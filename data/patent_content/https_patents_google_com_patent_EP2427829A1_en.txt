Definitions
- This specification relates to translation of text in web documents.
- the proliferation of the Internet has made web documents in many different languages readily accessible to users.
- Various web document translation mechanisms are available to assist a user in reading web document text displayed in a language unfamiliar to the user.
- Such translation mechanisms are integrated into and accessible through a toolbar of a web browser program or are provided by the web page itself (e.g., a script embedded within the web page).
- the translation cues provided by these translation mechanisms are static, i.e., shown to users regardless of the language in which the text of a web document is displayed.
- Another translation mechanism is integrated into a search results page that displays search results.
- a search result includes a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the URL can be provided in the form of a resource link to the web page referenced by the search result.
- the search results page can include a selectable option to translate the web page referenced by the search result. However, the user must select the option to translate the web page from within the search results page, and cannot select the option to translate the page from the actual web page itself.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include receiving, at a client device, a document comprising document text in a first language to be displayed on the client device; displaying, at the client device, the document text of the document; identifying, at the client device, a second language to which the document text may be translated; determining that the second language is different from the first language and displaying, only in response to the determination, a translation header with the document text, the translation header including text in the second language describing a selectable option in the translation header to translate document text from the first language to the second language; and in response to a selection of the selectable option: identifying, at the client device, a portion of the document text to be translated; sending a request from the client device to a translation server to translate the portion of the document text from the first language to the second language; in response to the request, receiving at the client device
- the translation header is shown on a rendered web document (e.g., a web page) only when appropriate, such as when the web document text is in a language other than a user preferred language.
- the translation header is prominently displayed with the web document text.
- Such a configuration permits a user to quickly identify that translation is available and request translation of the web document text without navigating through a menu or searching for a translation mechanism on the web document or in a toolbar of the operative web browser program.
- the user need not navigate back to the search result page to request a translation of text within the web document if a translation of web document text is determined to be needed. Instead, the translation header is prominently displayed with the web document text and the user may request a translation from within the web document.
- FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate example block diagrams of web document display formats of a web document.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example display of a web document and an example display of a translated version of the web document.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example architecture of a system that provides a conditional translation header for translation of web document text in a web document.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example DOM representation of a web document having web document text and a translation header element.
- FIGS. 5A and 5D respectively are flow diagrams for an example method of translating text in email web pages, and an alternate example method of translating text in email web pages.
- FIGS. 5B and 5C respectively illustrate an example display of an HTML email page, and an example display of the email page with translated text.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram for an example method for translating text in an HTML web page.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram for an example method for providing a conditional translation header for translation of web document text in a web document.
- This specification relates to displaying a conditional translation header in a rendered web document only if the web document includes text in a language other than one or more specified languages, such as a user's preferred language.
- a web document is a document annotated with a markup language that is provided to or accessible by a client device over a network, such as the Internet.
- An exemplary web document is an HTML document, which can be rendered on the client device by use of a web browser program.
- the translation header is an interactive object that provides a selectable option allowing a user to request translation of the web document text to a specified language different from the language in which the web document text is originally displayed to the user.
- a script i.e., executable or interpreted program instructions
- the script causes the web browser program to display the translation header only if the client device (e.g., by execution of the script) determines the language of the web document text to be different from a specified language associated with the client device.
- a client device is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving web documents and other content over a network, such as the Internet or an intranet.
- Example client devices include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network.
- FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate example block diagrams of web document display formats 110, 120 and 130 of a web document 105.
- the display format of the web document 105 is determined based on the original language of the web document text (i.e., the language of the text of the web document as created or authored and in which it is provided to client devices in response to a request from the client device), one or more specified languages, and whether translation of the web document text has occurred, as explained below.
- web document text is text that is rendered and visible on a client device, e.g., text associated with a text node in a document object model (DOM).
- DOM document object model
- Display format 110 includes web document text 140 in an original language and does not include a conditional translation header.
- the web document 105 is displayed in display format 110 if the original language of the web document text is the same as a specified language of a client device. For example, the web document 105 will be displayed in the display format 110 if the original language is English and specified language of a client device is also English.
- Display format 120 includes web document text 140 in an original language and a conditional translation header 142 with translation header text in a specified language, such as a preferred user language that is different from the original language.
- the web document 105 is displayed in display format 120 if the original language of the web document text 140 is different from the specified language of a client device, and if the translation process for the web document text has not been initiated and/or completed. For example, the web document 105 will be displayed in the display format 120 if the original language is English and the specified language is German, and the translation process for the web document text 140 has not been initiated.
- Display format 130 includes web document text 140' in the specified language and the translation header text in the specified language.
- the web document 105 is displayed in display format 130 if the original language of the web document text is different from the specified language and the translation process for the web document text has been completed. For example, the web document 105 will be displayed in the display format 130 if the original language is English and the specified language is German, and the translation process for the web document text 140 has been completed.
- the same web document is used, e.g., the same HTML document.
- the translation header 142 is only shown if the original language of the web document text 140 is different from the specified language of a client device
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example display 202 of a web document 205 and an example display 204 of a translated version of the web document 205.
- the example displays 202 and 204 are generated by a web browser program on a client device for which the English language is specified.
- the web browser displays the web document 205 with web document text 240 in the original language and a conditional translation header 246 with translation header text in the specified language (e.g., display format 120 of FIG. IB).
- the original language of the web document text 240 is Spanish and the specified language of the client device is English.
- the translation header 246 includes translation header text prompting an input for translation of the web document text 240, e.g., "Translate this page?" and, optionally, translation header text identifying the original language of the web document text 240, e.g., "This page is in Spanish.”
- the input prompted by the translation header text can be, for example, user selection of a selectable option such as a "Translate" button 206.
- the translation header text also identifies the specified language (e.g., the preferred language).
- the translation header 246 may include the text "Translate this page from Spanish to English?"
- the translation header 246 illustrated in and described with reference to display 202 is a first display configuration of the translation header 246.
- the translation header 246 is displayed in the first display configuration prior to a selection of the selectable translate option, e.g., Translate button 206.
- a selectable option in the translation header can allow a user to identify the original language of the web document text 240, as opposed to relying on, for example, an automated language identification process.
- the translation header selectable option can allow a user to identify the language to which the web document text 240 is to be translated. These options permit a user to explicitly define the language of the web document text 240 and/or the language to which the web document text 240 will be translated.
- display 204 the web browser displays the web document 205 with web document text 240 in the specified language, and the translation header 246 with translation header text in the specified language (e.g., display format 130 of FIG. 1C).
- the translation header 246 includes translation header text identifying that the web document text 240, or a portion of the web document text 240, has been translated and, optionally, one or both of the original language or specified language.
- the translation header 246 may include "This page has been translated to English.”
- the translation header 246 also includes a language selection option 208 to allow a user to select another language to which the web document text 240 is to be translated.
- the language selection option 208 can be a drop down menu listing available languages. Selection of a language from the language selection option 208 causes the web document text to be translated and displayed in the selected language.
- the translation header 246 also includes another selectable option 210 to return the display of the web document as shown in display 204 to display 202.
- selecting the selectable option 210 causes the browser to display the web document text 240 in the original language, i.e., Spanish.
- the translation header 246 illustrated in and described with reference to display 204 is displayed in a second display configuration.
- the translation header 246 is displayed in the second display configuration subsequent to a selection of the selectable translate option, e.g., Translate button 206.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example architecture of a system 300 that provides a conditional translation header for translation of web document text 312 in a web document 306.
- a client device 302 runs a web document display program, e.g., a web browser 304, to render the web document 306.
- the web document 306 includes web document text 312 and a translation header element 310.
- the web document text 312 is textual content displayed when the web browser 304 renders the web document 306.
- the translation header element 310 is program code (e.g., JavaScript) executable by the web browser 304.
- the translation header element 310 provides for the display of the translation header 246 and the functionality of the translation header 246.
- translation header element 310 is described as performing actions, it is meant that the web browser 304 is executing the program code defined by the translation header element 310 to cause the actions to be performed.
- the web browser 304 retrieves the web document 306.
- the 304 can retrieve the web document 306, for example, by sending a request for the
- the translation header element 310 identifies the original language ("first language") of the web document text 312.
- the original language of the web document text 312 is specified in the web document 306 or specified in metadata retrieved with the web document 306.
- the publisher of the web document 306 may embed data identifying the original language, such as a language tag.
- the web document 306 may be handled by an agent before reaching the web browser 304, such as an email message being handled by an email server.
- the agent or a system responsive to the agent may process the web document 306 to identify the original language or language(s) of the text of the web document and then send data identifying the original language(s) to web browser 304 along with the web document 306.
- the translation header element 310 identifies the original language from the provided information. However, if the original language is not specified in the web document 306 or associated metadata, then in some implementations the translation header element 110 can query, for example, a translation server 308 for identification of the original language. In other implementations the translation header element 310 can receive input (e.g., from a selectable option displayed in the translation header) from a user identifying the original language, for example, from a drop down menu or a text box rendered by the web browser 304. In still other implementations, the translation header element 310 can access a language identification program resident on the client device 302. The language identification program can process the text of the web document 306 to identify the language(s) of the web document text 312. Any number of known language identification or detection techniques can be used by the client device or translation service.
- the translation header element 310 identifies one or more specified languages ("second languages") in which web document text 312 is to be displayed on the client device 302.
- the specified languages are typically languages that the user of the client device 302 prefers. These preferences can be either explicit or implicit, and thus the specified languages can be identified in numerous ways.
- the specified languages can be identified from various source indicators such as an (A) HTTP request header (Accept-Language), (B) a last- changed target language (e.g., second language) used by, for example, the translation header element 310 and saved in a cookie on the client device and reported by the translation header element 310, (C) a last-used target language with a translation server/service, or (D) a last-used user interface language with a translation server/service.
- the specified languages can be identified from, for example, (E) web browser settings or (F) URL parameters (e.g., a query parameter).
- the specified languages can be ordered or prioritized according to their source and/or how recently a corresponding translation occurred.
- the translation header element 310 can prioritize (e.g., order) the specified languages, for example, according to a source ranking/ordering hierarchy.
- the hierarchy may dictate that the second language is determined by the following scheme with reference to the itemization above: (F) > (B) > (C) > (D) > (E) > (A).
- the specified language identified from the URL parameter (F) if present, is the second language to which the text is translated (i.e., a highest ordered second language).
- the specified language identified from the URL parameter (F) may be the most reliable source for identifying the specified language.
- other schemes and hierarchies can be used.
- the translation header element 310 determines whether the original language is different from the specified language (e.g., the selected, specified language if more than one). If the languages are different, then the translation header element 310 causes the web browser 304 to concurrently display the translation header 246, with translation header text in the specified language, with the web document text 312 in the original language, and any other display content included in the web document 306, such as images (e.g., display format 120 of FIG. IB). If the languages are not different, then the web document text 312 and any other display content included in the web document 306 are displayed without the translation header 246 (e.g., display format 110 of FIG. IA).
- the specified language e.g., the selected, specified language if more than one. If the languages are different, then the translation header element 310 causes the web browser 304 to concurrently display the translation header 246, with translation header text in the specified language, with the web document text 312 in the original language, and any other display content included in the web document 306, such as images (e.g.
- the translation header element 310 can detect selections of selectable options in the translation header, such as a user click on the Translate button 206. In response to the selection of the selectable option 206, translation header element 310 identifies the web document text 312 to be translated or a portion of the web document text to be translated (i.e., if less than all of the web document text is eligible for being translated by the translation server 308). In some implementations, from the displayed web document text, a user can select the portion of web document text 312 to be translated by, for example, selecting certain web document text 312 with a mouse or other user input device.
- the translation header element 310 can identify the web document text 312 to be translated or the portion of the web document text 312 to be translated by use of a document object model (DOM) representation of the web document 306.
- the web browser 304 can include a layout engine 314 to parse the web document 306 to generate a DOM representation or, equivalently, a data structure representation of the document 306.
- the layout engine 314 is distinct to the web browser 304, but is in data communication with the web browser 304 and works in concert with the web browser 304 to render web documents.
- the DOM representation provides a conduit through which scripts executed by the web browser 304 can inspect and modify the web document 306.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example DOM representation of a web document 400 having web document text and a translation header element.
- the DOM representation represents a web document as a hierarchical arrangement of nodes with each node corresponding to a portion of the web document.
- There are various types of nodes for example, root nodes (e.g., the root node 404), element nodes (e.g., the title element node 406), text nodes (e.g., text nodes 408, 410, 412) and script nodes (e.g., script node 414).
- a text node is a node corresponding to web document text (e.g., 312) in the web document (e.g., 306), and includes text stored in the node.
- An element node is a node corresponding to an annotation in the web document such as a markup language annotation.
- a script node includes an executable script in the web document such as the translation header element.
- the arrangement of the nodes is determined by the hierarchical relationships between the nodes. The hierarchical relationships of the nodes are attributable to nested annotations in a web document.
- the translation header element 310 sends a request to the translation server 308 to translate the relevant web document text 312 to the specified language.
- the translation server 308 provides translation data to the client device 302.
- the translation data include the translated web document text in the specified language.
- the web browser 304 can render the web document 306 with translated web document text (e.g., display format 130 of FIG. 1C).
- FIGS. 5A and 5D respectively are flow diagrams for an example method of translating text in email web pages, and an alternate example method of translating text in email web pages.
- FIGS. 5B and 5C respectively illustrate an example display 560 of an HTML email page, and an example display 540 of the email page with translated text.
- the example displays 540, 560 are generated by a web browser (e.g., 304).
- the web documents in displays 540 and 560 are email pages displaying email messages, and the web document text is the body text of the email messages.
- the body text are displayed as representations of the email messages.
- the body text of each email message can be included in a respective text node in a DOM representation. Additional text can also be included, for example, the subject text of the email message.
- Display 560 illustrates an email page displaying multiple email messages, e.g., an email conversation.
- display 560 shows first, second and third email messages 542, 544 and 546, respectively, although only email message 542 is expanded to show its body text 548.
- the original language (first language) of the body text in display 560 is Spanish.
- the body text of a first email message of the email messages to be translated is identified (502).
- the body text of a first email message (e.g., 542) of one or more displayed email messages can be identified as the body text of an active email message.
- an active email message is an email message that is currently opened or otherwise selected, e.g., as indicated by a cursor position or other user inputs.
- email message 542 is the active email message as it is expanded (e.g., open).
- the body text 548 can be identified by its respective text node.
- the web browser 304 and/or the client device 302 can, by use of the translation header element 310, identify the body text to be translated.
- the translation header element 310 can, for example, determine that the second language is different from the first language and display the translation header with the body text of the first email message.
- Display 560 shows the translation header 550 in a first display configuration with the body text 548.
- the translation header text identifies the second language (e.g., specified language) as English, i.e., the language to which the Spanish text should be translated.
- each expanded email message that includes body text not in the specified language can be displayed with a translation header.
- each message could be displayed with a translation header if the respective body texts were not in the specified language.
- the translation header element 310 can also cause the web browser 304 to display a "Translate conversation" button 553 to cause all email messages in the email conversation to be displayed with translated text.
- a request is sent to the translation server to translate the body text of only the first email message (506).
- the request is sent only if the second language is different from the first language.
- the web browser 304 can, for example, send a request to the translation server 308 to translate the body text of only the first email message.
- the request to translate the body text of the first email message can be a request to translate the subject of the first email message and the body of the first email message.
- the request of step 506, optionally, is a request sent to the translation server without the body text of the first email message (508).
- the web browser 304 can, for example, send the request to the translation server 308.
- the translation server can be in data communication (e.g., Remote Procedure Call protocol) with the email server handling the first email message. Because the email server distributed the first email message to the client device, it has access to the first email message or access to a copy of the first message.
- the request can include an identifier of the first email message, instead of the body text of the first email message.
- the identifier of the first email message can be resolved by the email server or the translation server to identify the first email message.
- the translation server can then translate the body text of the email message.
- Translation data including translated body text of the first email message in the second language are received (510).
- the translation data include the translated body text of the first email message in the second language.
- the web browser 304 can, for example, receive the translation data from the translation server 308.
- the translated body text of the first email message and the body text of the other email messages are displayed (512).
- the web browser 304 can, for example, render the document including the body text of the first email message and the body text of the other email messages for display on the client device 302.
- the body text of the other email messages may only include the subject of those email messages if the other email messages are in a collapsed display format.
- Display 540 shows the translated body text of the first email message (e.g., email message 542) in the second language (i.e., English) and a collapsed display of the other email messages (e.g., email messages 544 and 546).
- the display of step 512 optionally, includes replacing, in the respective text node, the body text of the first email message in the first language with the translated body text of the first email message in the second language (514), and rendering the data structure having the translated body text included in the respective text node (516).
- the translation header element 310 can, for example, replace the body text in the first language with the translated body text in the second language in the respective text node and render the data structure having the translated body text included in the respective text node.
- Display 540 shows the translated body text 548 of the first email message 542.
- steps 582 and 584 are the same as steps 502 and 504, respectively, explained above with reference to FIG. 5A.
- a request is sent for HTML data representing only the translated first email message (586).
- the HTML data can include, in addition to the body text of the first email message, for example, formatting information for the first email message, quoted text detection information for the first email message, and hiding information for the first email message.
- the web browser 304 can, for example, send a request for HTML data representing the translated first email message. In some implementations, HTML data for more than one email message can be requested.
- the HTML data representing the translated first email message are received (588).
- the web browser 304 can, for example, receive the HTML data from the translation server 308.
- a portion of HTML data of the HTML email document corresponding to the untranslated first email message is replaced with the HTML data representing the translated first email message (590)
- the translation header element 310 can replace the portion of HTML data of the email page corresponding to the untranslated first email message with the HTML of the translated first email message.
- the email page including the HTML of the translated first message can then be rendered by the web browser and displayed on the client device without a reload of the email page.
- the translation header element 310 can cause the web browser to render the HTML of the translated first email message for display on another portion of the displayed email page, such as in a message box, pop up box, tool tip or designated translation display area.
- the translation header 550 is displayed in a second display configuration.
- the second display configuration indicates that the portion of the document has been translated subsequent to a selection of the selectable option shown in FIG. 5B (e.g., the "Translate” button).
- the user can select "View original message” to view the message in its original form, or select "Change language” to translate the body text of the message to another language. If the latter option is selected, the original text of the email message is translated to a new language specified by the user, i.e., the process steps 506 - 512 above are re-executed to provide a translation of the original text to another different language.
- the "Change Language” option causes the original text in the email message to be translated to the new language as opposed to the currently translated text (e.g., in English) to be translated to the new language.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram for an example method 600 for translating text in an HTML web page.
- the web document is an HTML web page, and is represented by a data structure.
- the data structure includes text nodes, each text node includes respective text of the HTML web page text.
- the data is the DOM representation of the document or a copy of the DOM representation.
- the data is sent in multiple segments, i.e., portions of the data are individually sent to the translation server.
- the web browser 304 can, for example, send a request to the translation server 308 to translate the text.
- the text in the first language in the text nodes are replaced with corresponding translated text in the second language (604).
- the translated text are received from the translation server.
- the translation header element 310 can replace text in the first language in the text nodes with corresponding translated text in the second language.
- the data structure having the translated text in the text nodes is rendered (606).
- the data structure is a DOM representation and the web browser renders the DOM representation to display the HTML web page with the translated text.
- the web browser 304 can, for example, render the data structure having the translated text in the text nodes.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram for an example method 700 for providing a conditional translation header for translation of web document text in a web document.
- example method can be implemented on a computer with a web browser.
- a document comprising document text in a first language to be displayed on a client device is received (702).
- the web browser 304 can, for example, retrieve the document by using a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for the client device 302.
- HTTP hypertext transfer protocol
- the first language of the document text can be identified from a user input.
- the user input can be from selection of a selectable option in the translation header displayed with the document text.
- the document text of the document is displayed (704).
- the document can be a markup language document and the web browser 304 can render the markup language document for display on the client device 302.
- a second language to which the document text may be translated is identified (706).
- the second language can be a user's preferred language (e.g., the native language of the user).
- the user's preferred language can be determined, for example, from local settings on the client device (e.g., 302), such as web browser language settings, or from a cookie including data from past translations and the corresponding second languages (e.g., the data may indicate that a user requested translation to a certain second language).
- the translation header element 310 can, for example, identify the second language.

For example, if the document is an HTML web page then the portion of the document text is all of the document text that can be translated (e.g., some document text may be identified as non-translatable by a "no translate" flag).
- the portion of document text is the portion of the document text corresponding to the active email message.
- the portion of document text is identified based on user input, such as highlighting a portion of the document text.
- the translation header element 310 and/or the web browser 304 can, for example, identify a portion of the document text to be translated.
- a request from the client device is sent to a translation server to translate the portion of the document text from the first language to the second language (712).
- the web browser 304 can, for example, send a request to a translation server 308 to translate the portion of the document text from the first language to the second language.
- the request is sent in accord with the method described in FIGS. 5A and 5D In other implementations, the request is sent in accord with the method described in FIG. 6.
- the translation process performed by the translation server will often correctly identify the first language of the document text, as mentioned above, a user may specify the first language in the request to ensure that the first language of the document text is not misidentified.
- the translation header may provide a selectable option by which a user can designate the first language.
- translation data including a corresponding translated portion of the document text in the second language is received (714).
- the web browser 304 and/or the translation header element 310 can receive the translation data.
- the translated portion of the document text is displayed (716).
- the web browser 304 can, for example, render the web document including the translated portion of the document text to display the translated portion of the document text on the client device 302.
- the display of a translation header with document text is represented by display format 130 and shown in example display 204.
- the translated portion of the document text is displayed in accord with the method described in FIGS. 5A and 5D.
- the translated portion of the document text is displayed in accord with the method described in FIG. 6.
- the document can contain a link to another document (e.g., a link to another web page).
- the translation header element 310 can cause the web browser to include data defining the second language in a request for the another document.
- the included data can cause the another document to be automatically displayed by the web browser in the second language.
- the document text of a web page may have been translated from Spanish to English (e.g., by use of the translation element 310 and the process described above).
- the translation header element 310 can cause the web browser to append data (e.g., an identifier) to the request for the second web page indicating that translation of the second web page's text to English is requested.
- data e.g., an identifier
- the second web page will automatically be rendered by the web browser with its text translated to English.
- the data appended to the request (or otherwise identified in the request) by the web browser is a query parameter (e.g., item (F), a URL parameter).
- the web browser can append "#trans
- target language For example, "http://www.example.com? . . . #trans
- the translation header element (e.g., 310) has been discussed above as being included in the web document (e.g., 306), in some implementations the functionality of the translation header element is provided in an add- in component installed in the web browser 304, such as a toolbar or gadget. Further, in other implementations, the functionality of the translation header element is provided in a bookmarklet to allow the above described features to be utilized for a web page without a translation element.
