- Entity module 16 may extract, from at least the Internet resources obtained by entity module 16 , a plurality of entities and may, for each entity of the plurality of entities, determine one or more Internet resources that are associated with the particular entity. Entity module 16 may, for each of the plurality of entities, extract one or more features associated with the entity from at least the one or more Internet resources that are associated with the particular entity and resource information associated with the one or more Internet resources.

- the taxonomy feature category may include one or more features extracted from a taxonomic categorization of the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity.
- Entity module 16 may perform taxonomic categorization of the Internet sources to label each of the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity as being associated with one or more categories, from higher level categories such as sports and arts to lower level categories such as golf and rock music.
- Entity module 16 may, for each entity, associate a feature value with each different feature associated with a particular entity.
- the feature value associated with a feature that is associated with an entity may correspond to the number of times that the same feature is extracted from the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity and the resource information associated with the one or more Internet sources. For example, for an entity that is a musical event, the feature “concert” may appear many times, such as in the title of the one or more Internet resources and in the body of the Internet resources.
- Entity module 16 may de-duplicate the same events that are extracted multiple times from the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity and the resource information associated with the one or more Internet sources by associating a single instance of the resource with the entity, and by assigning that entity a feature value that corresponds to the number of times that the same feature is extracted from the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity and the resource information associated with the one or more Internet sources.
- entity module 16 may associate one or more features with each of a plurality of entities, where the one or more features may be textual information that describes or otherwise provides contextual information for the corresponding entity.
- each entity may be associated with one or more of the feature categories and may, for each associated category, be associated with one or more features in that feature category.

- stemming e.g., applying a Porter stemmer
- Entity module 16 may also perform entity de-duplication, such as by de-duplicating entities having the same names or titles, and may perform feature merging to merge the features associated with the duplicate events.
- entity de-duplication such as by de-duplicating entities having the same names or titles
- feature merging to merge the features associated with the duplicate events.
- each feature associated with the duplicate events may have an associated feature value, which may correspond to the frequency in which those events appear in the respective feature categories. For example, if the word “jazz” is a feature that appears multiple times in the surround feature category for a particular event, the feature value for the feature “jazz” may correspond to the number of times the word “jazz” appears in the surrounding text included in the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity.
- entity module 16 may determine the feature value of a feature to be merged as the sum the feature values of the same features of both entities if those features fall under the title, surround, query, and anchor feature categories. Entity module 16 may also determine the feature value of a feature to be merged as the max of the feature values of the same features of both entities for entities that fall under the taxonomy feature category.
- Entity module 16 may also perform stop word removal and feature reweighing to reduce feature noise in information retrieval as a part of feature processing. Stop word removal may include both global stop word removal as well as local stop word removal. To perform global stop word removal, entity module 16 may determine feature frequency of each of the extracted features, which may be the number of entities that are associated with the particular feature. Entity module 16 may determine that features which have a relatively high feature frequency (e.g., features associated with more than a threshold number of entities, features in the top 10 percentage of associated feature frequencies, and the like) may be global stop words, and may remove those features from entities or otherwise disassociate those features with entities.
- Stop word removal may include both global stop word removal as well as local stop word removal.
- entity module 16 may determine feature frequency of each of the extracted features, which may be the number of entities that are associated with the particular feature. Entity module 16 may determine that features which have a relatively high feature frequency (e.g., features associated with more than a threshold number of entities, features in the top 10 percentage of associated feature frequencies
- Entity module 16 may also perform local stop word removal, to remove local stop words. Local stop words may be frequent features for entities of a particular region that remain after performing global stop word removal. As discussed above, each entity may have an associated geographic location or geographic region. For example, when focusing on entities of a specific location, such as New York, many entities from New York may contain the phrase “New York,” which may not be removed during stop word removal. Entity module 16 may, for a specified geographic location (e.g., New York), perform local stop word removal to remove words or phrases that may appear frequently as features for entities in that particular geographic location. Thus, entity module 16 may perform local stop word removal for the associated geographic location of an entity by determining feature frequency within a specific area associated with the geographic location, and removing stop words associated with the geographic location.
- local stop word removal may be frequent features for entities of a particular region that remain after performing global stop word removal.
- each entity may have an associated geographic location or geographic region. For example, when focusing on entities of a specific location, such as New York, many entities from New York
- Entity module 16 may further perform, for each entity, feature reweighing of the one or more features associated with the entity by determining a feature weight of each feature associated with the entity that is based at least in part on the feature frequency of each feature for the respective entity. In other words, entity module 16 may reweigh a particular feature associated with a particular entity based at least in part on the feature value of the particular feature as it pertains to the particular entity. If a feature is associated with multiple entities, entity module 16 may determine a separate feature weight for each feature-entity pair, such that such a feature may be associated with multiple feature weights, one for each entity with which it is associated.
- Performing feature reweighing may include, for each entity, scaling down frequent features having a high feature value for the entity and scaling up features having a low feature value for the entity, due to the potentially skewed distribution of feature frequency even after performing stop word removal.
- entity module 16 may apply log normalized term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) by log scaling the frequency and multiplying the log scaled frequency by its inverse document frequency to determine a weight for the particular feature j in entity i as follows:
- TF-IDF log normalized term frequency-inverse document frequency
- weight ij log ⁇ ( 1 + tf ij ) * log ⁇ N df j ,
- weight ij may be the feature weight of feature j associated with entity i
- tf ij may be the frequency of feature j in entity i, such as the feature value of the feature for the entity
- N may be the collection size (i.e., the total number of entities)
- df j may be the number of entities in which feature j appears.
- entity module 16 may, for each entity, determine a weight for each feature associated with a particular entity.
- Entity module 16 may store indications of an association between entity, features, and feature categories for each entity extracted from the Internet resources into feature-entity data store 52 A, as well as the feature weights for each feature associated with the entities. For example, for each entity, entity module 16 may store, as structured data, at least the one or more features associated with the structured data, the feature weight of each of the one or more features, and the one or more feature categories under which the one or more features fall. Entity module 16 may further store into feature-entity data store 52 A any additional information associated with the entities, such as the geographical location associated with each of the entities, or any other suitable information.
- Ranking module 18 may, for a particular entity, determine a ranking of one or more entities related to the particular entities.
- the ranking of one or more entities related to the particular entity may be an indication of the one or more entities that have a highest level of relatedness to the particular entity out of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A. If each entity in a set of entities each has an associated similarity score that indicates a level of relatedness between the respective entity and the particular entity, the one or more entities that are related to be the particular entity may be the one or more entities that have the highest similarity scores out of the set of entities with respect to the particular entity. In other words, given a random user that has an interest in the particular entity the one or more entities related to the particular entity may be the one or more entities that the same random user would be the most interested in out of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A.
- ranking module 18 may determine a level of relatedness (e.g., a similarity score) between each of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A. Thus, in this example, for each entity stored in feature-entity data store 52 A, ranking module 18 may determine a level of relatedness between the particular entity and each other entity stored in feature-entity data store 52 A.
- a level of relatedness e.g., a similarity score
- ranking module 18 may instead determine the relatedness only between entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A that are within or associated with the same geographic region or location. Ranking module 18 may determine whether entities are within the same geographic region based at least in part on the geographic location associated with the entities. In this way, in this example, ranking module 18 may determine a level of relatedness (e.g., a similarity score) between each of a subset (e.g., fewer than all) of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A
- a level of relatedness e.g., a similarity score

- ranking module 18 may determine the level of relatedness between the source entity and another entity, which may be referred to as a target entity, by determining the level of similarity of features of the same set of feature categories between the source entity and the target entity
- F S j may be a set of features belonging to feature category j for source entity S
- F T j may be a set of features extracted from feature category j for target entity T.
- ranking module 18 may determine a similarity score between source entity S and target entity T as sc(F S j , F T j ), where sc( ) is a similarity score function, and where the similarity score corresponds to the level of similarity between the source entity and the target entity for that feature category.
- ranking module 18 may treat each entity as a distribution of features. To that end, ranking module 18 may utilize Jeffreys-Kullback-Leibler divergence, which may be a symmetric version of Kullback-Leibler divergence, to determine a measure of the difference between the distribution of features of the source and target entities.
- Jeffreys-Kullback-Leibler divergence which may be a symmetric version of Kullback-Leibler divergence
- Ranking module 18 may perform the combiner technique to determine a similarity score between source entity S and target entity T for each of the k feature categories as sc(F S 1 , F T 1 ), . . . sc(F S k , F T k ). Based on the similarity score for each feature category between the source entity and the target entity, ranking module 18 may determine an overall similarity score between the source event and the target event as an aggregation of the similarity scores for each feature category between a source entity and a target entity.
- Ranking module 18 may combine the similarity scores for each of the feature categories of source entity S and target entity T into a single ranking list by Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Given target entity T is associated with a similarity score of r S,T j with respect to source entity S, the overall similarity score between source entity S and target entity T of sc(S, T) may be expressed as
- K may be 60.
- ranking module 18 may, by performing the combiner technique, determine a level of relatedness between two entities based at least in part on an aggregation of the similarity between the features of the two entities. As discussed above, ranking module 18 may determine a level of relatedness between each of a set of entities out of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A, and may store an indication of the level of relatedness between each of a set of entities determined by ranking module 18 into ranking data store 52 C. For example, ranking data store 52 C may store indications of pairs of entities along with an indication of the associated level of relatedness, such as a similarity score, into ranking data store 52 C.
- ranking module 18 may determine, for each of a set of entities, based on the level of relatedness between each of a set of entities out of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A, a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity, such as a ranking of one or more entitles having the highest level of relatedness to the particular entity out of the set of entities, and may store such indications of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to each entity in the set of entities into ranking data store 52 C.
- ISS 14 may receive an indication of an entity from, for example, computing device 2 , determine, from the data stored in ranking data store 52 C, a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity, and transmit, to computing device 2 , an indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity.
- the indication of an entity that ISS 14 receives from computing device 2 may indicate a name associated with the entity, such as “Miles Davis” or “Beethoven's 5 th Symphony.”
- Ranking module 18 may utilize the name associated with the entity to index into ranking data store 52 C to find the entity associated with that name, and may determine a location within ranking data store 52 C where the ranking of indication of the one or more entities that are related to the particular entity is stored.
- Ranking module 18 may retrieve the indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity.
- ISS 14 may format the retrieved indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity into any suitable structured data format for transmitting the indication of the ranking of one or more entities, such as JSON or XML, and may output the indication of the one or more entities to computing device 2 , such as via network 12 or internet 20 .

- Ranking module 18 may rank the candidate entities within set of candidate entities C S by their respective similarity scores.
- Ranking module 18 may determine from the similarity scores associated with the entities in candidate entities C S , a ranking of one or more entities related to the query, and may output an indication of the ranking of one or more entities to computing device 2 , such as via network 12 or internet 20 using the techniques described herein.
- ranking module 18 may perform an expander technique to determine a ranking of one or more entities related to each of a set of entities.
- Ranking module 18 may perform the expander technique to determine a level relatedness between each entity of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52 A.
- ranking module 18 may perform the expander technique to determine a level of relatedness between a given pair of two entities based at least in part on determining the semantic relatedness between features of the two entities. For example, ranking module 18 may determine that two entities are highly similar if they are both highly similar to a third party entity, even if the two entities have a relatively low measure of similarity based on performing the combiner technique discussed above.
- ranking module 18 may generate a feature-entity bipartite graph (discussed in further detail with respect to FIGS. 3A-3C ) in which features and entities are represented as nodes.
- the graph may include a plurality of nodes, including feature nodes representing a plurality of features and entity nodes representing a plurality of entities.
- Each of the entity nodes in the graph may be connected to one or more of the feature nodes via one or more edges each having an edge weight, where an entity node may be connected to a feature node if the entity represented by the entity node is associated with the feature represented by the feature node.

- ranking module 18 may store into graph data store 52 B data indicative of the feature represented by the feature node.
- feature-entity bipartite graph or graph may be synonymous with the data stored in graph data store 52 B that are indicative of the feature-entity bipartite graph.

- Each edge that connects an entity node to a feature node may have an edge weight that corresponds to the feature weight for the feature represented by the feature node as associated with the entity that is represented by the connected entity node, as discussed above with respect to feature reweighing.
- entity nodes may not be connected to other entity nodes, and feature nodes may not be connected to other feature nodes. If a feature for an entity appears in multiple feature categories, ranking module 18 may collapse those feature in to a single feature represented by a single feature node that is connected to the entity node representing the entity.
- ranking module 18 may collapse the feature “movie” that is categorized in both the query feature category and the title feature category for a particular entity into a single feature that is represented by a single feature node, and may sum the feature weights of the feature in the two features into a single edge weight for the edge the connects the entity node to the feature node, thereby reducing feature dimension and mitigating feature sparsity issues.
- ranking module 18 may nevertheless determine that two entities are related even if their respective entity nodes are not within each other's immediate neighborhood, based on the similarity between the features of the source and target entities along with the features of another entity represented by an entity node that is within the neighborhood of the entity nodes representing the source and target entities.
- ranking module 18 may determine, for a particular source entity, that it is related to a target entity, even if the entity nodes representing the source entity and the target entity are not connected to the same feature node, as long as the entity nodes representing the source entity and the target entity are related to another entity represented by an entity node that is in the neighborhood of the entity nodes representing the source and target entities.
- ranking module 18 may perform label propagation to propagate labels across the feature-entity bipartite graph, to associate a distribution of labels with each of the plurality of nodes, so that each node in the graph may be associated with a distribution of labels.

Further, the distribution of labels associated with a node in the graph may indicate the level of relatedness of each of the one or more entities in the distribution of one or more entities to the entity or feature that is represented by the particular node, such that the distribution of labels associated with the node in the graph may be an indication of a ranking of the relatedness of the one or more entities related to the entity or feature that is represented by the particular entity node of feature node.
- ranking module 18 may associate a label with each entity node by seeding each of the plurality of entity nodes with one of a plurality of labels.
- labels initially associated with the entity nodes may be known as seed labels.
- the label associated with a particular entity node may identify the entity represented by the entity node, so that each one of the labels seeded by ranking module 18 may identify a corresponding one of the entity nodes.
- Each label may be an identity label, such that an entity may be a relevant label for itself.
- an entity node that represents entity A may be associated with a label of “entity A,” which may be the title of the associated entity.
- Ranking module 18 may perform label propagation to propagate the labels associated with the entity nodes across the graph, such that each node may be associated with a distribution of one or more of the labels. To perform label propagation, ranking module 18 may determine the distribution of labels associated with each node of the graph as an optimal solution that minimizes an objective function.
- the objective function may simultaneously minimize the following over all nodes in the graph: squared loss between true and induced label distribution, regularization term that penalizes neighboring feature nodes that have different label distribution from this entity node, and regularization term that smooths the induced label distribution towards the prior distribution, which is usually a uniform distribution in practice.
- ranking module 18 may determine the distribution of labels associated with the entity node as the optimal solution to minimize the objective function of ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ Y i ⁇ 2 + ⁇ np w ij ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ J ⁇ 2 + ⁇ pp ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ U ⁇ 2 , where is ⁇ ⁇ is the learned label distribution for entity node i, Y i is the true label distribution, ⁇ np is the predefined penalty for neighboring nodes with divergent label distributions, ⁇ j is the learned label distribution for feature neighbor j, w ij is the weight of feature j in entity i, ⁇ pp is the penalty for label distribution deviating from the prior a uniform distribution U.
- ⁇ np may be 0.5
- ⁇ pp may be 0.001.
- ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ Y i ⁇ 2 may be the squared loss between a true distribution of labels associated with the entity node and a learned distribution of labels associated with the entity node, where Y i is the true distribution of labels associated with the entity node i and ⁇ ⁇ is the learned distribution of labels for entity node i.
- the true distribution of labels associated with the entity node i may be the label that ranking module 18 seeds for entity node i
- the learned distribution of labels may be the distribution of labels that is associated with entity node i as a result of ranking module 18 performing label propagation over the graph.

The computing system may, for an entity of interest, determine one or more entities that are semantically related to the entity of interest, and may rank the one or more entities based at least in part on their relatedness to the entity of interest.

output user interface 8, such as a graphical user interface, that includes indications of the one or more entities related to the entity of interest. As shown inFIG. 1 , if the entity of interest is a hiking trip,user interface 8 may include indications of a rock climbing event, a backpacking event, and a caving event as the entities that are related to the hiking trip. UID 4 may present the related entities in order of relatedness to the entity of interest in the non-limiting example ofFIG. 1 , such that the rock climbing event may be the most related entity, the backpacking event may be the next most related entity, and the caving event may be the third most related entity. In this way, UID 4 may present a ranked list of entities that the user ofcomputing device 2 may be interested in based on the user's interest in the particular hiking trip. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,ISS 14 includesentity module 16 and rankingmodule 18. Together,modules computing device 2 and other computing devices connected to network 12 for providing one or more entities that are related to an entity of interest.Modules ISS 14.ISS 14 may executemodules modules ISS 14. -
Entity module 16 may retrieve and/or receive, fromInternet 20, Internet resources associated with entities, and may extract a set of features associated with each of the entities from the associated internet resources.Entity module 16 may crawlInternet 20 for Internet resources such as web pages, social media posts, and the like stored on internet servers 22 (e.g., web servers), or may otherwise receive a set of Internet resources, and may extract features from such Internet resources. For example, an Internet resource associated with a hiking trip may be a web site or social media post that describes the hiking trip. - In one example,
entity module 16 may extract, from one or more web pages for an entity, one or more features associated with the entity. Features associated with an entity may be contextual information that describes the associated entity. Features may include text, such as words, phrases, and the like contained in the web pages for the entity. In some examples, features may also include images, videos, and other media.Entity module 16 may extract, from a web page for an entity, features such as an entity description, the surrounding text in the web pages, queries associated with the web pages on which the entities occur, anchor text pointed to the web pages for the entity, taxonomic categorization of the web pages for the entity, and the like. -
Entity module 16 may store the features extracted from the Internet resources as well as indications of the associations between entities and the features onto computer readable storage devices, such as disks, non-volatile memory, and the like, ininformation server system 14. For example,entity module 16 may store such features and indications of the associations between entities and the features as one or more documents, database entries, or other structure data, including but not limited to comma separated values, relational database entries, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data, and the like. -
Entity module 16 may also perform feature preparation on the set of features associated with each entity that are extracted from Internet resource associated with the respective entity. For example,entity module 16 may perform stop word removal to remove the most common words in a language (e.g., a, the, is, at, which, on, and the like for the English language).Entity module 16 may perform feature reweighting to weigh the features associated with the entity based at least in part on the frequency in which the feature appears in the Internet resource associated with the entity. For example,entity module 16 may assign a higher weight to features that appear more frequently in the Internet resource associated with the entity.Entity module 16 may store such weights of features for entities onto computer readable storage devices inISS 14 as one or more documents, database entries, or other structure data, including but not limited to comma separated values, relational database entries, XML data, JSON data, and the like. - Ranking
module 18 may receive an indication of an entity of interest from computingdevice 2, determine a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the entity of interest based at least in part on the level of relatedness of each of the one or more entities to the entity of interest, and communicate an indication of the one or more entities tocomputing device 2. To that end, rankingmodule 18 may determine a measure of similarity between the entity of interest and each of a plurality of other entities, where the measure of similarity may correspond to the level of relatedness, and may determine which of the plurality of other entities are the most related to the entity of interest based at least in part on the measure of similarity. - In one example, ranking
module 18 may determine a measure of similarity between two entities based at least in part on measuring the similarity between features of two entities, and combining the measure of similarity between each feature type of the two entities. To determine a measure of similarity between an entity of interest and a target entity, rankingmodule 18 may, for features of each feature type associated with the entity of interest, determine the measure of similarity between the features of the feature type of the entity of interest and the features of the feature type of a target entity, and may combine the measure of similarity for each of the feature types of the entity to determine a measure of similarity between the entity of interest and the target entity. - In another example, ranking
module 18 may determine a measure of similarity between two entities (e.g., an entity of interest and a target entity) based at least in part on whether the two entities share connections to other similar entities. In other words, rankingmodule 18 may determine that two entities are related because some of their associated features are semantically related, even if the two entities do not share the same features. - To this end, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, ranking
module 18 may, in various non-limiting examples, generate a bipartite graph, where rankingmodule 18 may propagate information through the graph to pass semantic messages. Specifically, the bipartite graph may include a plurality of entity nodes associated with a plurality of entities that are connected to a plurality of feature nodes associated with a plurality of features, where each of the plurality of entity nodes is connected to one or more of the plurality of feature nodes. Thus, in the bipartite graph, an entity node that is associated with an entity may be connected to one or more feature nodes associated with the one or more features of the entity. - Ranking
module 18 may determine, for an entity of interest, one or more related entities based at least in part on connections in the bipartite graph between one or more entity nodes associated with the one or more related entities to an entity node associated with the entity of interest. Specifically, rankingmodule 18 may perform unsupervised machine learning, including performing label propagation over multiple iterations to associate a distribution of labels with each of the plurality of nodes of the bipartite graph, as discussed in more detail below with respect toFIGS. 3A-3C . Rankingmodule 18 may perform such label propagation as an optimal solution that minimizes an objective function to generate a distribution of labels that is associated with each node of the bipartite graph, where each of the distribution of labels includes an indication of a ranking of one or more entities that are related to an entity or a feature represented by an associated entity node or feature node. In this way, rankingmodule 18 may determine, for a particular entity of interest, a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the entity of interest. - While described in terms of bipartite graphs, aspects of the present disclosure may be implemented as tables, databases, or other underlying data structure. Nodes and edges of a bipartite graph may thus also be implemented as portions of a data structure, entries in tables, databases, functions, transformations, or data applied to or between entries in tables, databases, or other underlying data structure. The data structures, tables, databases, functions, data, and so forth may thus represent one or more bipartite graphs as disclosed herein.
- Ranking
module 18 may perform the techniques above to determine a measure of similarity (e.g., a similarity score) between the entity of interest and a plurality of other entities, and may determine, based upon the determined measure of similarity, a ranking of the relatedness of the plurality of entities to the entity of interest. Rankingmodule 18 may send, vianetwork 12 tocomputing device 2 an indication of a ranked list of one or more of the most related entities to the entity of interest. For example, rankingmodule 18 may send to computing device 2 a web page that includes links to the web pages associated with the ranked list of one or more of the most related entities. Correspondingly, a web browser running oncomputing device 2 may render the received web page such that UI device 4 may presentuser interface 8 that includes links to the web pages associated with the ranked list of one or more of the most related entities. - In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure,
ISS 14 may generate a graph that includes a plurality of nodes, wherein the plurality of nodes includes a plurality of entity nodes representing a plurality of entities and a plurality of feature nodes representing a plurality of features, and wherein each of the plurality of entity nodes is connected in the graph to one or more of the plurality of feature nodes.ISS 14 may perform label propagation to propagate a plurality of labels across the graph to associate a distribution of labels with each of the plurality of nodes.ISS 14 may receive an indication of at least one of a feature of interest or an entity of interest.ISS 14 may output for the at least one of the feature of interest or the entity of interest, an indication of one or more related entities that are related to the feature of interest or the entity of interest, wherein outputting the indication of the one or more related entities is based at least in part on the respective distribution of labels associated with one of the plurality of feature nodes that represents the feature of interest or one of the plurality of entity node that represents the entity of interest. These and other aspects of the present disclosure are discussed in more detail below. -
FIG. 2 is a blockdiagram illustrating ISS 14 as an example computing system configured to determine the level of relatedness of a set of entities, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.FIG. 2 illustrates only one particular example ofISS 14, and many other examples ofISS 14 may be used in other instances and may include a subset of the components included inexample ISS 14 or may include additional components not shown inFIG. 2 . -
ISS 14 providescomputing device 2 with a conduit through which a computing device, such ascomputing device 2, may access a related entities service for automatically receiving information indicative of one or more related entities for an entity of interest or a feature of interest. As shown in the example ofFIG. 2 ,ISS 14 includes one ormore processors 44, one ormore communication units 46, and one ormore storage devices 48.Storage devices 48 ofISS 14 includeentity module 16 and rankingmodule 18. -
Storage devices 48 ofISS 14 further includes feature-entity data store 52A,graph data store 52B, rankingdata store 52C, and Internetresources data store 52D (collectively, “data stores 52”).Communication channels 50 may interconnect each of thecomponents communication channels 50 may include a system bus, a network connection, an inter-process communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data. - One or
more communication units 46 ofISS 14 may communicate with external computing devices, such ascomputing device 2 ofFIG. 1 , by transmitting and/or receiving network signals on one or more networks, such asnetwork 12 orInternet 20 ofFIG. 1 . For example,ISS 14 may usecommunication unit 46 to transmit and/or receive radio signals acrossnetwork 12 to exchange information withcomputing device 2. Examples ofcommunication unit 46 include a network interface card (e.g., such as an Ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Other examples ofcommunication units 46 may include short wave radios, cellular data radios, wireless Ethernet network radios, as well as universal serial bus (USB) controllers. -
Storage devices 48 may store information for processing during operation of ISS 14 (e.g.,ISS 14 may store data accessed bymodules storage devices 48 are a temporary memory, meaning that a primary purpose ofstorage devices 48 is not long-term storage.Storage devices 48 onISS 14 may be configured for short-term storage of information as volatile memory and therefore not retain stored contents if powered off. Examples of volatile memories include random access memories (RAM), dynamic random access memories (DRAM), static random access memories (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memories known in the art. -
Storage devices 48, in some examples, also include one or more computer-readable storage media.Storage devices 48 may be configured to store larger amounts of information than volatile memory.Storage devices 48 may further be configured for long-term storage of information as non-volatile memory space and retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memories include magnetic hard discs, optical discs, floppy discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable (EEPROM) memories.Storage devices 48 may store program instructions and/or data associated withmodules - One or
more processors 44 may implement functionality and/or execute instructions withinISS 14. For example,processors 44 onISS 14 may receive and execute instructions stored bystorage devices 48 that execute the functionality ofmodules processors 44, may causeISS 14 to store information, withinstorage devices 48 during program execution.Processors 44 may execute instructions ofmodules modules processors 44 to perform various actions or functions ofISS 14 which are described herein. - The information stored at data stores 52 may be stored as structured data which is searchable and/or categorized. For example, one or
more modules more modules ISS 14 may provide access to the information stored at data stores 52 as a cloud based, data-access service to devices connected to network 12 orInternet 20, such ascomputing device 2. When data stores 52 contain information associated with individual users or when the information is generalized across multiple users, all personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone number, and/or e-mail address linking the information back to individual people may be removed before being stored atISS 14.ISS 14 may further encrypt the information stored at data stores 52 to prevent access to any information stored therein. In addition,ISS 14 may only store information associated with users of computing devices if those users affirmatively consent to such collection of information.ISS 14 may further provide opportunities for users to withdraw consent and in which case,ISS 14 may cease collecting or otherwise retaining the information associated with that particular user. -
Entity module 16 may retrieve, receive, or otherwise obtain Internet resources, such as fromInternet servers 22 viaInternet 20 as well as resource information associated with the Internet resources, and may store the Internet resources as well as the resource information associated with the Internet resources into Internetresource data store 52D. - The Internet resources obtained by
entity module 16 may, in some examples, be documents (e.g., web pages) obtained by crawlingInternet 20 for documents. In some examples,entity module 16 may not store the Internet resources in Internetresource data store 52D. Instead, the Internet resources may be stored elsewhere, such as on one or more remote computing devices (not shown) with whichentity module 16 may communicate viaInternet 20. - Resource information associated with the Internet resources may include context information about Internet resources that may not be included in the body of the Internet resources themselves. For example, resource information associated with a particular Internet resource may include queries issued to an Internet search engine that results a visit to the Internet resource via a link to the Internet resource that is included in the search results. In another example, resource information associated with a particular Internet resource may include anchor text of a link to the Internet resource from another Internet resource. In another example, the resource information associated with a particular Internet resource may include a taxonomic categorization of the Internet resource.
- The Internet resources obtained by
entity module 16 may be associated with a plurality of entities, such that each entity may be associated with one or more Internet resources. An entity may be, in some examples, an event, a place, a person, a business, a movie, a restaurant, and the like. An entity may further be associated with one or more of a description, a location, and a time. The description of an entity may, in some examples, be the title of an event, the name of a business, and the like. The location may be a geographic location such as the location of the event, the location of a business, and the like. The time may, in some examples, be the time at which an event takes place. - An Internet resource that is associated with a particular entity may describe the particular entity. For example, if the particular entity is an event, an Internet resource that is associated with the particular entity may be a web page for the event, a social media post regarding the event, a web site for the venue at which the event is to be held, and the like.
-
Entity module 16 may extract, from at least the Internet resources obtained byentity module 16, a plurality of entities and may, for each entity of the plurality of entities, determine one or more Internet resources that are associated with the particular entity.Entity module 16 may, for each of the plurality of entities, extract one or more features associated with the entity from at least the one or more Internet resources that are associated with the particular entity and resource information associated with the one or more Internet resources. The one or more features associated with the entity may include contextual information that describes the entity. In some examples, features may include textual information, such as words, phrases, sentences, and the like. For example,entity module 16 may extract, from a web page associated with a musical concert, words and phrases such as “Beethoven,” “symphony,” “concerto,” “orchestra,” “conductor,” “pianist,” “concertmaster,” “violinist,” and the like as features that describe or are otherwise associated with the musical concert. - The features extracted by
entity module 16 for a particular entity may be categorized into one or more feature categories that correspond to the types of information that describes the associated entity. The set of feature categories may include one or more of a title, a surround, a query, an anchor, and a taxonomy. One or more features extracted from a title or a heading of the one or more Internet resources (e.g., one or more web pages) associated with the entity may be categorized as belonging to a feature title category, and may comprise one or two sentences that describe the entity. One or more features that are extracted from the surrounding text included in the one or more Internet resources, such as the body of the one or more web pages for the associated with the entity, may be categorized as belonging to a surround feature category. - The query feature category may include one or more features extracted from queries issued to an Internet search engine that results a visit to the one or more Internet resources associated via the entity, via links to the one or more Internet resources that are included in the search results. For example,
entity module 16 may categorize a query of “classical music concerts” that resulted in a visit to a web page for a musical concert as features “classical,” “music,” and “concerts” that belong in the query feature category. - The anchor feature category may include one or more features extracted from anchor text of links to the one or more Internet resources associated entity from another Internet resource. Thus, in one example, if a web page contains a “classical concert” anchor that links to the web page for an entity that is a musical concert,
entity module 16 may categorize the anchor text of “classical concert” as features “classical” and “concert” that belong in the anchor feature category for the entity associated with the musical concert. - The taxonomy feature category may include one or more features extracted from a taxonomic categorization of the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity.
Entity module 16 may perform taxonomic categorization of the Internet sources to label each of the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity as being associated with one or more categories, from higher level categories such as sports and arts to lower level categories such as golf and rock music. -
Entity module 16 may, for each entity, associate a feature value with each different feature associated with a particular entity. The feature value associated with a feature that is associated with an entity may correspond to the number of times that the same feature is extracted from the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity and the resource information associated with the one or more Internet sources. For example, for an entity that is a musical event, the feature “concert” may appear many times, such as in the title of the one or more Internet resources and in the body of the Internet resources.Entity module 16 may de-duplicate the same events that are extracted multiple times from the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity and the resource information associated with the one or more Internet sources by associating a single instance of the resource with the entity, and by assigning that entity a feature value that corresponds to the number of times that the same feature is extracted from the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity and the resource information associated with the one or more Internet sources. - As a result of extracting features from the Internet resources and resource information associated from the Internet resources,
entity module 16 may associate one or more features with each of a plurality of entities, where the one or more features may be textual information that describes or otherwise provides contextual information for the corresponding entity. By categorizing the features into feature categories, each entity may be associated with one or more of the feature categories and may, for each associated category, be associated with one or more features in that feature category. In some examples, an entity may be associated with features in each of the five feature categories described above. In other examples, an entity may be associated with features in fewer than all of the five feature categories described above. In additional examples, an entity may be associated with features in one or more additional feature categories other than the feature categories describe above. -
Entity module 16 may, for each entity, perform feature processing to process the entities and the features extracted from the Internet resources. For example, the features may include textual information, such thatentity module 16 may perform stemming (e.g., applying a Porter stemmer) of the features and may convert the stemmed features to unigram and bigram features. -
Entity module 16 may also perform entity de-duplication, such as by de-duplicating entities having the same names or titles, and may perform feature merging to merge the features associated with the duplicate events. As discussed above, each feature associated with the duplicate events may have an associated feature value, which may correspond to the frequency in which those events appear in the respective feature categories. For example, if the word “jazz” is a feature that appears multiple times in the surround feature category for a particular event, the feature value for the feature “jazz” may correspond to the number of times the word “jazz” appears in the surrounding text included in the one or more Internet resources associated with the entity. To merge features of duplicate events,entity module 16 may determine the feature value of a feature to be merged as the sum the feature values of the same features of both entities if those features fall under the title, surround, query, and anchor feature categories.Entity module 16 may also determine the feature value of a feature to be merged as the max of the feature values of the same features of both entities for entities that fall under the taxonomy feature category. -
Entity module 16 may also perform stop word removal and feature reweighing to reduce feature noise in information retrieval as a part of feature processing. Stop word removal may include both global stop word removal as well as local stop word removal. To perform global stop word removal,entity module 16 may determine feature frequency of each of the extracted features, which may be the number of entities that are associated with the particular feature.Entity module 16 may determine that features which have a relatively high feature frequency (e.g., features associated with more than a threshold number of entities, features in the top 10 percentage of associated feature frequencies, and the like) may be global stop words, and may remove those features from entities or otherwise disassociate those features with entities. -
Entity module 16 may also perform local stop word removal, to remove local stop words. Local stop words may be frequent features for entities of a particular region that remain after performing global stop word removal. As discussed above, each entity may have an associated geographic location or geographic region. For example, when focusing on entities of a specific location, such as New York, many entities from New York may contain the phrase “New York,” which may not be removed during stop word removal.Entity module 16 may, for a specified geographic location (e.g., New York), perform local stop word removal to remove words or phrases that may appear frequently as features for entities in that particular geographic location. Thus,entity module 16 may perform local stop word removal for the associated geographic location of an entity by determining feature frequency within a specific area associated with the geographic location, and removing stop words associated with the geographic location. -
Entity module 16 may further perform, for each entity, feature reweighing of the one or more features associated with the entity by determining a feature weight of each feature associated with the entity that is based at least in part on the feature frequency of each feature for the respective entity. In other words,entity module 16 may reweigh a particular feature associated with a particular entity based at least in part on the feature value of the particular feature as it pertains to the particular entity. If a feature is associated with multiple entities,entity module 16 may determine a separate feature weight for each feature-entity pair, such that such a feature may be associated with multiple feature weights, one for each entity with which it is associated. - Performing feature reweighing may include, for each entity, scaling down frequent features having a high feature value for the entity and scaling up features having a low feature value for the entity, due to the potentially skewed distribution of feature frequency even after performing stop word removal. For the frequency of each feature of an entity,
entity module 16 may apply log normalized term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) by log scaling the frequency and multiplying the log scaled frequency by its inverse document frequency to determine a weight for the particular feature j in entity i as follows: -
- where weightij may be the feature weight of feature j associated with entity i, tfij may be the frequency of feature j in entity i, such as the feature value of the feature for the entity, N may be the collection size (i.e., the total number of entities), and dfj may be the number of entities in which feature j appears. In this way,
entity module 16 may, for each entity, determine a weight for each feature associated with a particular entity. -
Entity module 16 may store indications of an association between entity, features, and feature categories for each entity extracted from the Internet resources into feature-entity data store 52A, as well as the feature weights for each feature associated with the entities. For example, for each entity,entity module 16 may store, as structured data, at least the one or more features associated with the structured data, the feature weight of each of the one or more features, and the one or more feature categories under which the one or more features fall.Entity module 16 may further store into feature-entity data store 52A any additional information associated with the entities, such as the geographical location associated with each of the entities, or any other suitable information. - Ranking
module 18 may, for a particular entity, determine a ranking of one or more entities related to the particular entities. The ranking of one or more entities related to the particular entity may be an indication of the one or more entities that have a highest level of relatedness to the particular entity out of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A. If each entity in a set of entities each has an associated similarity score that indicates a level of relatedness between the respective entity and the particular entity, the one or more entities that are related to be the particular entity may be the one or more entities that have the highest similarity scores out of the set of entities with respect to the particular entity. In other words, given a random user that has an interest in the particular entity the one or more entities related to the particular entity may be the one or more entities that the same random user would be the most interested in out of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A. - In some examples, ranking
module 18 may determine a level of relatedness (e.g., a similarity score) between each of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A. Thus, in this example, for each entity stored in feature-entity data store 52A, rankingmodule 18 may determine a level of relatedness between the particular entity and each other entity stored in feature-entity data store 52A. - In other examples, because a user that is interested in a particular entity may also be interested only in other entities that are within the same geographic area, instead of determining the level of relatedness between each of the entities stored in feature-
entity data store 52A, rankingmodule 18 may instead determine the relatedness only between entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A that are within or associated with the same geographic region or location. Rankingmodule 18 may determine whether entities are within the same geographic region based at least in part on the geographic location associated with the entities. In this way, in this example, rankingmodule 18 may determine a level of relatedness (e.g., a similarity score) between each of a subset (e.g., fewer than all) of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A - In one example, ranking
module 18 may perform a combiner technique to determine a ranking of one or more entities related to each of a set of entities. Rankingmodule 18 may perform the combiner technique to determine a level relatedness between each entity of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A. For example, rankingmodule 18 may determine a level relatedness between each entity of a set of entities associated with the same geographic region or geographic location stored in feature-entity data store 52A. For a particular entity, which may be referred to as a source entity, rankingmodule 18 may determine the level of relatedness between the source entity and another entity, which may be referred to as a target entity, by determining the level of similarity of features of the same set of feature categories between the source entity and the target entity - Assuming a list of k feature categories associated with the source entity and the target entity, FS j may be a set of features belonging to feature category j for source entity S, and FT j may be a set of features extracted from feature category j for target entity T. For a particular feature category j, ranking
module 18 may determine a similarity score between source entity S and target entity T as sc(FS j, FT j), where sc( ) is a similarity score function, and where the similarity score corresponds to the level of similarity between the source entity and the target entity for that feature category. - More specifically, to determine the similarity score between source entity S and target entity T for a particular feature category, ranking
module 18 may treat each entity as a distribution of features. To that end, rankingmodule 18 may utilize Jeffreys-Kullback-Leibler divergence, which may be a symmetric version of Kullback-Leibler divergence, to determine a measure of the difference between the distribution of features of the source and target entities. Given the set of features FS j and FT j, rankingmodule 18 may define the similarity between source entity S and target entity T for feature category j as sc(FS j, FT j)=exp[−½(D(FS j∥FT j)+D(FT j∥FS j)], where D(•∥•) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In this way, rankingmodule 18 may perform the combiner technique to determine a similarity score for each feature category between a source entity and a target entity. - Ranking
module 18 may perform the combiner technique to determine a similarity score between source entity S and target entity T for each of the k feature categories as sc(FS 1, FT 1), . . . sc(FS k, FT k). Based on the similarity score for each feature category between the source entity and the target entity, rankingmodule 18 may determine an overall similarity score between the source event and the target event as an aggregation of the similarity scores for each feature category between a source entity and a target entity. Specifically, rankingmodule 18 may, based on the similarity score for each of the feature categories, determine an overall similarity score between source entity S and target entity T as sc(S, T)=φ(sc(FS 1, FT 1), . . . sc(FS k, FT k)), where φ may be an aggregation function. - The similarity score for source entity S and target entity T given feature category j may be denoted as Ranking
module 18 may combine the similarity scores for each of the feature categories of source entity S and target entity T into a single ranking list by Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Given target entity T is associated with a similarity score of rS,T j with respect to source entity S, the overall similarity score between source entity S and target entity T of sc(S, T) may be expressed as -
- where j may be each of the feature categories and where K may be a large predefined constant that reduces the impact of high rankings giving by outlier rankers. In one example, K may be 60.
- Thus, ranking
module 18 may, by performing the combiner technique, determine a level of relatedness between two entities based at least in part on an aggregation of the similarity between the features of the two entities. As discussed above, rankingmodule 18 may determine a level of relatedness between each of a set of entities out of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A, and may store an indication of the level of relatedness between each of a set of entities determined by rankingmodule 18 into rankingdata store 52C. For example, rankingdata store 52C may store indications of pairs of entities along with an indication of the associated level of relatedness, such as a similarity score, into rankingdata store 52C. - In other examples, ranking
module 18 may determine, for each of a set of entities, based on the level of relatedness between each of a set of entities out of the entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A, a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity, such as a ranking of one or more entitles having the highest level of relatedness to the particular entity out of the set of entities, and may store such indications of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to each entity in the set of entities into rankingdata store 52C. - In this way,
ISS 14 may receive an indication of an entity from, for example,computing device 2, determine, from the data stored in rankingdata store 52C, a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity, and transmit, tocomputing device 2, an indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity. In one example, the indication of an entity thatISS 14 receives fromcomputing device 2 may indicate a name associated with the entity, such as “Miles Davis” or “Beethoven's 5th Symphony.” Rankingmodule 18 may utilize the name associated with the entity to index into rankingdata store 52C to find the entity associated with that name, and may determine a location within rankingdata store 52C where the ranking of indication of the one or more entities that are related to the particular entity is stored. Rankingmodule 18 may retrieve the indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity.ISS 14 may format the retrieved indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity into any suitable structured data format for transmitting the indication of the ranking of one or more entities, such as JSON or XML, and may output the indication of the one or more entities tocomputing device 2, such as vianetwork 12 orinternet 20. - In other examples, instead of retrieving the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity from ranking
data store 52C,ISS 14, may, in response to receiving an indication of an entity from, for example,computing device 2, determine a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity on-the-fly, using the combiner technique described herein, and output an indication of the ranking of one or more entities tocomputing device 2, such as vianetwork 12 orinternet 20 using the techniques described herein. - In another example,
ISS 14 may receive an indication of a query from, for example,computing device 2. A query may be textual data, such as a word, a phrase, and the like, thatcomputing device 2 may receive as input. For example, a query may be search phrase for one or more entities that are related to the query. In response to receiving the indication of the query,computing device 2 may, via rankingmodule 18, determine a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the query, and may output tocomputing device 2 an indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the query. - Specifically, responsive to
computing device 2 receiving an indication of a query, such as “marathon,” rankingmodule 18 may, based at least in part on performing the combiner technique described herein, determine a ranking of one or more related entities to the search phrase. Rankingmodule 18 may determine a set of one or more entities each having an entity name or title that matches the issued query as a seed setS. Ranking module 18 may, using these seed entities, determine one or more entities related to each entity within seed set S, inclusive of the seed entity, as a set of candidate entities CS. Ranking module 18 may rank the candidate entities within set of candidate entities CS by their respective similarity scores. If an entity within the set of candidate entities is retrieved multiple times from different seed entities, because rankingmodule 18 determines that the entity is related to more than one of the entities in the seed set S, rankingmodule 18 may add up its similarity scores to result in a single similarity score for that entity. More formally, the similarity of target entity T to query Q may be defined as sc(Q,T)=module 18 according to the combiner technique disclosed herein. Rankingmodule 18, may determine from the similarity scores associated with the entities in candidate entities CS, a ranking of one or more entities related to the query, and may output an indication of the ranking of one or more entities tocomputing device 2, such as vianetwork 12 orinternet 20 using the techniques described herein. - In another example, ranking
module 18 may perform an expander technique to determine a ranking of one or more entities related to each of a set of entities. Rankingmodule 18 may perform the expander technique to determine a level relatedness between each entity of a set of entities stored in feature-entity data store 52A. Specifically, rankingmodule 18 may perform the expander technique to determine a level of relatedness between a given pair of two entities based at least in part on determining the semantic relatedness between features of the two entities. For example, rankingmodule 18 may determine that two entities are highly similar if they are both highly similar to a third party entity, even if the two entities have a relatively low measure of similarity based on performing the combiner technique discussed above. - To this end, ranking
module 18 may generate a feature-entity bipartite graph (discussed in further detail with respect toFIGS. 3A-3C ) in which features and entities are represented as nodes. Specifically, the graph may include a plurality of nodes, including feature nodes representing a plurality of features and entity nodes representing a plurality of entities. Each of the entity nodes in the graph may be connected to one or more of the feature nodes via one or more edges each having an edge weight, where an entity node may be connected to a feature node if the entity represented by the entity node is associated with the feature represented by the feature node. - Ranking
module 18 may store an indication of the feature-entity bipartite graph generated by rankingmodule 18 as data intograph data store 52B, which may include one or more data structures such as arrays, database records, registers, and the like. For example, rankingmodule 18 may store data indicative of the plurality of feature nodes, the plurality of entity nodes, the one or more edges that connects each of the entity nodes to one or more of the feature nodes, the edge weights of the one or more edges, and the like intograph data store 52B. In one example, for each entity node of the feature-entity bipartite graph, rankingmodule 18 may store intograph data store 52B data indicative of the entity represented by the entity node, data indicative of the one or more feature nodes connected to the entity node, and/or the values of the edge weights of the one or more edges that connect the entity node to each of the one or more feature nodes. Similarly, for each feature node of the feature-entity bipartite graph, rankingmodule 18 may store intograph data store 52B data indicative of the feature represented by the feature node. - Throughout this disclosure, the terms feature-entity bipartite graph or graph may be synonymous with the data stored in
graph data store 52B that are indicative of the feature-entity bipartite graph. In other words, while this disclosure may describe operations that are performed bymodules modules graph data store 52B that are indicative of the feature-entity bipartite graph, such as the feature nodes, entity nodes, edges, edge weights, connections between each of the entity nodes to one or more of the feature nodes via the edges, and the like, that make up the feature-entity bipartite graph. - Each edge that connects an entity node to a feature node may have an edge weight that corresponds to the feature weight for the feature represented by the feature node as associated with the entity that is represented by the connected entity node, as discussed above with respect to feature reweighing. In some examples, in the graph, entity nodes may not be connected to other entity nodes, and feature nodes may not be connected to other feature nodes. If a feature for an entity appears in multiple feature categories, ranking
module 18 may collapse those feature in to a single feature represented by a single feature node that is connected to the entity node representing the entity. For example, rankingmodule 18 may collapse the feature “movie” that is categorized in both the query feature category and the title feature category for a particular entity into a single feature that is represented by a single feature node, and may sum the feature weights of the feature in the two features into a single edge weight for the edge the connects the entity node to the feature node, thereby reducing feature dimension and mitigating feature sparsity issues. - Conceptually speaking, ranking module 18 may determine the relatedness of a pair of entities, such as between source entity S and target entity T as sc(S,T)=φ(sc(FS 1, FT 1,
- In other words, two entity nodes may within an immediate neighborhood of each other in the graph because they both connect to the same feature node. However, ranking
module 18 may nevertheless determine that two entities are related even if their respective entity nodes are not within each other's immediate neighborhood, based on the similarity between the features of the source and target entities along with the features of another entity represented by an entity node that is within the neighborhood of the entity nodes representing the source and target entities. Thus, rankingmodule 18 may determine, for a particular source entity, that it is related to a target entity, even if the entity nodes representing the source entity and the target entity are not connected to the same feature node, as long as the entity nodes representing the source entity and the target entity are related to another entity represented by an entity node that is in the neighborhood of the entity nodes representing the source and target entities. - Upon generating the feature-entity bipartite graph, ranking
module 18 may perform label propagation to propagate labels across the feature-entity bipartite graph, to associate a distribution of labels with each of the plurality of nodes, so that each node in the graph may be associated with a distribution of labels. Thus, each feature node and each entity node in the graph may be associated with a distribution of labels as a result of label propagation. As discussed above, performing label propagation across the feature-entity bipartite graph may include rankingmodule 18 operating on the data store ingraph data store 52B that are indicative of the feature-entity bipartite graph to perform the label propagation. - Each of the labels that ranking
module 18 propagates across the graph may indicate one of the entities represented as nodes in the graph, such that a distribution of labels associated with a node in the graph may be a distribution of one or more entities that are related to entity or feature that is represented by the particular node. Further, the distribution of labels associated with a node in the graph may indicate the level of relatedness of each of the one or more entities in the distribution of one or more entities to the entity or feature that is represented by the particular node, such that the distribution of labels associated with the node in the graph may be an indication of a ranking of the relatedness of the one or more entities related to the entity or feature that is represented by the particular entity node of feature node. - To initiate label propagation across the feature-entity bipartite graph, ranking
module 18 may associate a label with each entity node by seeding each of the plurality of entity nodes with one of a plurality of labels. Such labels initially associated with the entity nodes may be known as seed labels. The label associated with a particular entity node may identify the entity represented by the entity node, so that each one of the labels seeded by rankingmodule 18 may identify a corresponding one of the entity nodes. Each label may be an identity label, such that an entity may be a relevant label for itself. Thus, an entity node that represents entity A may be associated with a label of “entity A,” which may be the title of the associated entity. - Ranking
module 18 may perform label propagation to propagate the labels associated with the entity nodes across the graph, such that each node may be associated with a distribution of one or more of the labels. To perform label propagation, rankingmodule 18 may determine the distribution of labels associated with each node of the graph as an optimal solution that minimizes an objective function. - Given the feature-entity bipartite graph, the objective function may simultaneously minimize the following over all nodes in the graph: squared loss between true and induced label distribution, regularization term that penalizes neighboring feature nodes that have different label distribution from this entity node, and regularization term that smooths the induced label distribution towards the prior distribution, which is usually a uniform distribution in practice.
- More specifically, for each entity node i with its feature neighbors
module 18 may determine the distribution of labels associated with the entity node as the optimal solution to minimize the objective function of ∥Ŷι−Yi∥2+μnp - Thus, in this example, ∥Ŷι−Yi∥2 may be the squared loss between a true distribution of labels associated with the entity node and a learned distribution of labels associated with the entity node, where Yi is the true distribution of labels associated with the entity node i and Ŷι is the learned distribution of labels for entity node i. The true distribution of labels associated with the entity node i may be the label that ranking
module 18 seeds for entity node i, while the learned distribution of labels may be the distribution of labels that is associated with entity node i as a result of rankingmodule 18 performing label propagation over the graph. - Further, μnp may be a first regularization term that penalizes neighboring feature nodes that are associated with different distributions of labels from the distribution of labels associated with the entity node, where
module 18 performing label propagation over the graph. In addition, μpp may be a second regularization term that smooths the learned distribution of labels associated with the entity node towards a prior distribution of labels, by multiplying μpp with ∥Ŷι−U∥2. - Ranking
module 18 may determine the distribution of labels associated with a feature node as the optimal solution to minimize the objective function of μnpmodule 18 does not provide seed labels for feature nodes. Thus, μnp may be a first regularization term that penalizes neighboring entity nodes that are associated with different distributions of labels from the distribution of labels associated with the feature node, where - Ranking
module 18, by performing label propagation, may determine the distributions of labels for the entity nodes and the feature nodes of the graph as an optimal solution that minimizes the objective functions over the entirety of the graph. Thus, while rankingmodule 18 may not minimize the objective functions for each individual entity node or feature node, rankingmodule 18 may minimize the overall objective functions for the feature nodes and entity nodes making up the graph. - Ranking
module 18 may perform unsupervised machine learning to perform the label propagation discussed herein. Specifically, given a feature-entity bipartite graph in which a plurality of entity nodes are connected to a plurality of feature nodes via edges having associated edge weights, where the plurality of entity nodes are seeded with a plurality of labels, rankingmodule 18 may perform label propagation over multiple iterations (e.g., 5 iterations) without additional input to determine a distribution of labels for each node of the graph to minimize the objective functions described above. - By performing label propagation, ranking
module 18 may associate a distribution of labels with each node in a graph. Each of the distribution of labels associated with a node may include an indication of a ranking of one or more entities that are related to an entity or a feature represented by the associated entity node or feature node. Because each label in the graph may identify a particular entity represented by an entity node, a distribution of labels associated with a node may indicate the entity names of one or more entities that are related to a particular feature or entity represented by the node. Further, the distribution of labels associated with a node may also indicate the level of relatedness of the entities to a particular feature or entity represented by the node. In this way, the distribution of labels may indicate a ranking of one or more entities that are related to an entity or a feature represented by the associated entity node or feature node. Rankingmodule 18 may store an indication of each entity and each feature represented in the graph into rankingdata store 52C, including an indication of a ranking (by the level of relatedness) of one or more entities that are related to the entity or feature. - Thus,
ISS 14 may receive incoming data that is indicative of an entity or an indication of a feature from, for example,computing device 2 vianetwork 12 orInternet 20, determine, from the data stored in rankingdata store 52C, an indication of a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the entity or feature, and transmit, tocomputing device 2, outgoing data that includes an indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity or feature. In one example, the indication of an entity thatISS 14 receives fromcomputing device 2 may indicate a name associated with the entity, such as “Miles Davis” or “Beethoven's 5th Symphony.” Rankingmodule 18 may utilize the name associated with the entity to index into rankingdata store 52C to find the entity associated with that name, and may determine a location within rankingdata store 52C where the indication of the ranking of the one or more entities that are related to the particular entity is stored. Rankingmodule 18 may retrieve the indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity.ISS 14 may format the retrieved indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular entity into any suitable structured data format for transmitting the indication of the ranking of one or more entities, such as JSON or XML, and may output the indication of the one or more entities tocomputing device 2, such as vianetwork 12 orinternet 20. - In another example,
ISS 14 may receive incoming data that is indicative of a query from, for example,computing device 2. A query may be textual data, such as a word, a phrase, and the like, thatcomputing device 2 may receive as input. For example, a query may be search phrase for one or more entities that are related to the query. In response to receiving the indication of the query,computing device 2 may, via rankingmodule 18, determine a ranking of one or more entities that are related to the query, and may output tocomputing device 2 an indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the query. - Given an indication of a query, such as “marathon,” ranking
module 18 may determine a ranking of one or more related entities to the query. Rankingmodule 18 may treat the query as a feature, such as by mapping the text of the query to the text of a feature, to thereby - where FQ may be the set of all of the features that map to query Q. Specifically, because each feature is associated with a distribution of labels that are indicative of a ranking of one or more entities related to the feature, ranking
module 18 may determine the particular feature to which the query maps, index into rankingdata store 52C to find the particular feature, and may determine a location within rankingdata store 52C where the indication of the ranking of the one or more entities that are related to the particular feature is stored. Rankingmodule 18 may retrieve the indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular feature.ISS 14 may format the retrieved indication of the ranking of one or more entities that are related to the particular feature into any suitable structured data format for transmitting the indication of the ranking of one or more entities, such as JSON or XML, and may output the indication of the one or more entities tocomputing device 2, such as vianetwork 12 orinternet 20. -

As shown inFIG. 3A , rankingmodule 18 may generate feature-entitybipartite graph 80 that includesentity nodes nodes 84D-84F connected viaedges 86A-86F. Rankingmodule 18 may seedentity nodes labels edges 86A-86F may have an associated edge weight (not shown). - Ranking
module 18 may perform machine learning over graph 90 by exploiting the idea of label propagation, which is a graph-based learning technique that uses the information associated with each labeled seed node and propagates these labels over the graph in a principled and iterative manner. Label propagation may utilize two input sources:graph 80 and theseed labels module 18 may propagate theseed labels graph 80, to associate a distribution of seed labels for each ofnodes 84A-84F in thegraph 80 as an optimal solution that minimizes an objective function. - Ranking
module 18 may perform label propagation over multiple iterations to associate a distribution of seed labels for each ofnodes 84A-84F in thegraph 80 as an optimal solution that minimizes an objective function.FIG. 3B shows a first iteration of label propagation overgraph 80. As shown inFIG. 3B , after a first iteration of label propagation, rankingmodule 18 may associate distribution oflabels 82A-82F withnodes 84A-84F, respectively. Ranking module 88 may also distributelabels graph 80 such that distribution oflabels 82A-82F may include indications of one or bothlabels labels 82D associated withfeature node 84D includes indications of entities Science Fiction Movies and Science Fiction Films, and includes an indication of the relatedness between those entities and the feature associated withfeature node 84D on a 0 to 1.0 scale, where the larger the score indicates a higher level of similarity. - Ranking
module 18 may further iterate performance of label propagation overgraph 80.FIG. 3C shows a further iteration of label propagation overgraph 80. As shown inFIG. 3C , after further iteration of field propagation, rankingmodule 18 may further modify the distribution of labels associated with one or more ofnodes 84A-84F to determine a more optimized solution that minimizes an objective function overgraph 80. For example, distribution ofnodes 82C now includes indications of entities Science Fiction Movies and Science Fiction Films, and includes an indication of the relatedness between those entities and the feature associated withfeature node 84D on a 0 to 1.0 scale, where the larger the score indicates a higher level of similarity. -

entity module 16 from a plurality of Internet resources associated with the plurality of entities, the plurality of features associated with the plurality of entities. In some examples, the plurality of entities are associated with a same geographic area. -
