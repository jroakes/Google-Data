Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No.63/091,245, filed on day 13 of 10 in 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Technical Field
The disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for identifying related content. More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to automatically searching for content creators or content channels that match affinities and topics associated with content campaigns of brand content providers.
Background
Many media content sharing services provide media content (e.g., video content, audio content, etc.) to millions of users. Access to such media content presents opportunities for other content, such as advertisements, to be provided with the media content. That is, an advertiser may want to identify particular media content or particular media content channels that may be relevant to the product or entity being advertised.
However, it may be difficult to identify related media content or related channels of media content. For example, it may be difficult to determine whether a particular media content channel has a viewer who may be interested in a particular product or service. In some cases, such a determination is made manually, which can be time and resource intensive. In another example, due to advanced taxonomies, when such affinity fragments are not currently present in affinity taxonomies, it may be difficult to determine whether a particular media content channel is associated with an affinity segment.
It is therefore desirable to provide new methods, systems, and media for identifying related content.

Detailed Description
According to various embodiments, mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) are provided for identifying related content.
A content provider, such as a brand content provider (e.g., a brand advertiser), may desire to match content campaigns with one or more content creators. For example, given one or more Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), one or more keywords, and/or a budget for a content campaign, the mechanisms described herein are capable of automatically ingesting the one or more URLs and the one or more keywords as descriptors for the content campaign to generate a set of content creators or content channels that match affinities and topicality associated with brand content providers, while maximizing a view of content items in the content campaign. The brand content provider can, for example, select one or more of the matching content creators to engage in the content campaign.
In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein are capable of identifying a content creator or media content channel that is a suitable match for content activity. In some embodiments, the mechanism is capable of receiving any suitable input parameter related to content activity that indicates: subject matter or type related to the product or service being advertised, target audience demographics, minimum video quality of the video to be presented with the advertisement, and/or any other suitable parameter. For example, in some embodiments, the input parameters can include a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) associated with an entity corresponding to the content campaign or otherwise describing a target audience for the content campaign. As another example, in some embodiments, the input parameters can include one or more keywords describing a product or service associated with the content campaign or otherwise describing a target audience for the content campaign.
In some embodiments, the mechanism can identify a content creator or content channel that is a suitable match for a content campaign in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanism can identify channels related to the subject matter of the content campaign. As a more specific example, in some embodiments, the mechanism can generate vectors representing the relevance of different topics to content activity in any suitable embedding space. Continuing this particular example further, in some embodiments, the mechanism is capable of generating vectors in the embedded space for different channels of media content that represent the relevance of different topics to each channel. Continuing still further with this particular example, in some embodiments, the mechanism can then identify media content channels that are each associated with a plurality of topics most similar to the content activity by calculating any suitable similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity, euclidean distance, and/or any other suitable similarity measure) between the vector associated with the content activity and the one or more vectors associated with the media content channels.
In some embodiments, the mechanism can further identify a content creator or channel of media content that matches the content campaign appropriately based on any other suitable criteria, such as based on the affinity of the viewer of the channel. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms are capable of identifying media content channels having relatively high viewer affinities. In some embodiments, by identifying media content channels that are particularly relevant to a content campaign based on a topic and that have a relatively high affinity for the viewer, the mechanism is able to identify content creators or channels of media content that have a relatively high advertising value (e.g., by having viewers interested in the topic associated with the content campaign and likely to view content associated with the channel and thus likely to view content items associated with the channel, such as advertisements).
Note that in some embodiments, the mechanism can filter content creators or channels based on any criteria other than topic and affinity. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanism can filter content creators or channels based on how well their viewers match target demographics specified for the content campaign. As another example, in some embodiments, the mechanism can filter content creators or channels based on a minimum video quality criterion specified in input parameters associated with content activity.
In some embodiments, the mechanism can present to the creator of the content campaign a content creator or channel identified as suitable for the content campaign. For example, in some embodiments, the identified channels can be presented in any suitable ranking order, as described below in connection with fig. 1. In some embodiments, the identified channels can be presented in a user interface for selection by a creator of the content campaign.
It should be noted that while the embodiments described herein generally describe automatically selecting a content creator as a candidate to participate in a content campaign based on received parameters describing the content campaign, this is merely illustrative. In travel search implementations, given one or more Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that describe a desired location or vacation experience, one or more keywords, and/or a vacation budget, the mechanisms described herein are capable of automatically ingesting the one or more URLs and the one or more keywords as descriptors of a desired vacation to generate a proposed set of vacation results that match affinities and topicality associated with the desired vacation.
These and other features for identifying related content are further described in connection with fig. 1-6.
Turning to fig. 1, an illustrative example 100 of a process for identifying relevant content is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, the blocks of process 100 can be performed by any suitable device, such as a server hosting and streaming media content items to a user device. In some such embodiments, the server can execute the blocks of process 100 to identify one or more media content channels appropriate for a particular content activity.
The process 100 can begin at 102 by receiving an activity parameter for an activity, the activity parameter comprising one or more URLs and one or more keywords. In some embodiments, the process 100 may be capable of receiving the activity parameters in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can receive the campaign parameters from a user device (e.g., a user device of a user associated with a business or entity purchasing an ad spot associated with the campaign) via a user interface presented on the user device. In another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can allow a content provider to create content activities associated with one or more content items using tools provided by a content management system, wherein a user interface can be presented to the content provider, for example, through an online interface provided by the content management system or as an account management application installed and executing locally at the content provider's client device. Continuing with the example, the content provider can provide content parameters defining the content campaign using the user interface.
It should be noted that the creator of the content campaign may not be able to describe the target audience of the content campaign in the form of keywords. Furthermore, keywords already provided by the creator of the content campaign, such as "lettuce" or "high fiber diet", may not match the known audience segments. As such, process 100 can allow a creator of a content campaign to provide any suitable campaign parameters describing the content campaign, such as URLs associated with pages having content that a targeted viewer of the content campaign will be interested in, URLs associated with products or services of branded content providers, and so forth.
Turning to fig. 4 and 5, illustrative examples 400 and 500 of a user interface for receiving activity parameters are shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As shown, in some embodiments, user interfaces 400 and 500 can include any suitable input elements for receiving activity parameters. For example, as shown in fig. 4, user interface 400 can include input elements for receiving a URL at 402, one or more keywords related to a content campaign at 404, and/or one or more target demographic criteria (e.g., a target age range of a viewer of a presented advertisement, a gender of a viewer that a brand content provider desires to reach, a country of a viewer that a brand content provider desires to reach, and/or any other suitable demographic criteria) at 406. In another example, as shown in FIG. 5, user interface 500 can include input elements for receiving a target audience location (audience location) at 502, one or more keywords (keywords) describing a content campaign at 504, and one or more URLs from a brand content provider's website or from pages describing the content campaign at 506. In some embodiments, any other suitable parameters can be included, such as a target video quality of a video into which an advertisement or other content item is to be inserted, a target device type of a user device presenting the particular advertisement or content item associated with the campaign, cost or pricing information (e.g., a maximum amount spent associated with the campaign, and/or any other suitable cost or pricing information), and/or any other suitable campaign parameters.
It should be noted that any suitable information can be received as a descriptor of the activity. For example, the URL received at 402 can include a URL corresponding to a page from a website of the brand content provider. In another example, the URL received at 402 can include a URL corresponding to a page related to the activity. In a more specific example, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the URL "www.website.com/crafts" in 402 and the URL "http:// greatist. Com/health/branching-high-fiber-foods" in 506 can be provided to describe that the targeted viewer of the content campaign will be interested in the content of such pages. Continuing with this example, the URL received at 402 and the URL received at 506 can be supplemented with additional keywords describing the activity (e.g., keywords "knitting", "crochet" and "crafts" in 404, keywords "lituce" and "high fiber set" in 504, etc.) or additional information describing the target audience of the activity (e.g., demographic information "any age" in 406, audience location information "USA" in 502).
It should also be noted that in addition to target audience demographics and channel quality that may be used directly to search for matching content creators and/or content channels provided by content creators, process 100 can also extend searches for matching content creators and/or content channels provided by content creators to include parameters described by keywords and/or URLs that have been received (e.g., using the user interface shown in fig. 4 and 5).
Referring back to FIG. 1, at 104, in some embodiments, the process 100 can generate a target vector of content activity based on one or more URLs and one or more keywords. In some embodiments, the targeting vector can indicate any suitable information about the content campaign, such as one or more topics associated with the product or service to be advertised, and/or any other suitable information. In some embodiments, the target vector can be any suitable size vector and is generated in any suitable embedding space that maps information associated with the URL and keywords to the embedding space.
In some embodiments, the process 100 can generate the target vector in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can identify one or more pages related to the received URL, referred to herein as a vertical domain. As a more specific example, in instances where the received URL is "www.website.com/crafts," as shown in FIG. 4, the process 100 can identify relevant pages, such as "www.website.com," "www.website.com/art," and/or any other suitable page. Continuing further with the example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can parse or otherwise identify one or more topics associated with each page based on any suitable information, such as identifying words included in the page, identifying images included in the page, identifying videos included in the page, and/or any other suitable information. Continuing still further with this example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can generate the target vector based on the topics associated with the URL and related pages and based on one or more keywords included in the activity parameters described above in 102 in any suitable manner. As a more specific example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can identify the top N (e.g., top five, top ten, and/or any other suitable number) topics or keywords, and can generate a vector representing the degree of relevance of each of the top N topics or keywords. As a specific example, in instances where the URL is "www.website.com/documents" and the keywords are "knittings" and "art," the process 100 can identify the top N keywords as "documents", "knittings", "art", "reductions", and can assign each topic a strength indicating the relevance of each topic to the URL and keyword, such as [1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3].
In a more specific example, the process 100 can include a URL processor that ingests the received URL as input and parses the text of the associated page to determine the vertical field appearing on the page. Illustrative examples of the vertical field can include "Arts & Entertainment/TV & Video/Online Video" with a vertical weight of 0.8 and "Home & Garden/Domestic Services/Cleaning Services (Home and Garden/Home service/cleaning service)" with a vertical weight of 0.2. Continuing with the example, the process 100 can include a keyword processor that ingests the received keywords as input, wherein the keywords can be combined with the determined vertical domain. In some examples, keywords can be provided with weights equal to vertical fields from the received URLs. For example, if the URL has two vertical fields with weights of 0.8 and 0.2, and three keywords are also received, the vertical fields can be counted with weights of 0.2 (or 0.8 times 0.25) and 0.05 (or 0.2 times 0.25), respectively, and each of the three keywords can be counted with weights of 0.25.
It should also be noted that in some embodiments, multiple query embedding vectors can be generated for a content campaign based on one or more URLs and one or more keywords. For example, in response to receiving a plurality of URLs, a query embedding vector can be generated for each received URL in conjunction with one or more received keywords. Continuing with this example, the target vector can be an average of a plurality of query embedded vectors.
In some embodiments, in response to generating a plurality of query embedded vectors for content activity based on one or more URLs and one or more keywords and/or generating a target vector for content activity based on one or more URLs and one or more keywords, process 100 can determine a correlation between the received URLs and channels, identify video channels that match on topics with the plurality of query embedded vectors for content activity based on the one or more URLs and the one or more keywords, and/or identify video channels that match on topics with the target vector for content activity based on the one or more URLs and the one or more keywords.
In some embodiments, at 106, the process 100 can identify a topic associated with one or more potential video channels. In some embodiments, each potential video channel can be a video channel that is a candidate for recommending inclusion in the content campaign. For example, each channel can be associated with one or more topics. In another example, the process 100 can identify top N topics having a relevance score greater than a threshold associated with a video channel.
In some embodiments, at 108, process 100 can generate a channel vector of topics for each potential video channel. In some embodiments, process 100 may generate vectors in any suitable manner. For example, similar to that discussed above in connection with 104, process 100 can generate a vector for each channel indicating the relevance of the first N topics associated with the channel to the channel. As a more specific example, for a first channel associated with the topic "knitting," the process 100 can generate a vector indicating the relevance of different topics, such as "crafts," "knitting," "art," "reductions," to the channel. As a specific example, the vector can be [0.8,1.0,0.3,0.1] and/or any other suitable vector.
It should also be noted that in some embodiments, multiple channel embedding vectors can be generated for each topic of the potential video channel. Continuing with this example, the channel vector can be an average of a plurality of channel embedded vectors.
Alternatively, in some embodiments, the process 100 can identify a set of clusters of potential video channels. In some embodiments, each potential video channel can be a video channel that is a candidate for recommending inclusion in the content campaign. In some embodiments, each cluster can include any suitable number (e.g., one, two, ten, twenty, and/or any other suitable number) of potential video channels.
Continuing with this example, process 100 can identify the clustered groups of potential video channels in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can identify one or more clusters based on topics associated with video channels included in the clusters, each cluster including one or more potential video channels, wherein the topics of the clusters are identified as being related to one or more topics associated with URLs and/or keywords described above in connection with 102 and 104. As a more specific example, continuing with the example URL "www.website.com/documents," the process 100 can identify a first cluster associated with the topic "knitting," a second cluster associated with the topic "crocheting," and a third cluster associated with the topic "acceptors. In some embodiments, the process 100 can identify clusters in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, video channels can be grouped into clusters based on topics associated with the video channels, and process 100 can identify any suitable number (e.g., one, two, five, and/or any other suitable number) of related clusters. Process 100 can then generate a vector for each cluster of potential video channels included in the set of clusters. In some embodiments, process 100 may generate vectors in any suitable manner. For example, similar to that discussed above in connection with 104, the process 100 can generate a vector for each cluster that indicates the relevance of the top N topics associated with the cluster to the cluster. As a more specific example, for a first cluster associated with the topic "knitting", the process 100 can generate a vector indicating the relevance of different topics, such as "crafts", "knitting", "art", "comparisons", to the cluster. As a specific example, the vector can be [0.8,1.0,0.3,0.1] and/or any other suitable vector. It should also be noted that in some embodiments, multiple channel embedding vectors can be generated for each cluster of potential video channels in the set of clusters. Continuing with this example, the channel vector can be an average of a plurality of channel embedded vectors.
Referring back to fig. 1, at 110, in some embodiments, the process 100 can generate a similarity score for each candidate channel to the content campaign based on the channel vector for each channel and the target vector associated with the content campaign. In some embodiments, the process 100 may generate the similarity score in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, process 100 can calculate any suitable type of similarity between the vector associated with the channel and the target vector, such as a cosine similarity score. In a specific example, to determine correlations between URLs and other activity parameters and content channels, process 100 can generate appropriate vectors in the embedding space and determine cosine similarities between pairs of embedded vectors.
Note that in some embodiments, the vector associated with the cluster and the target vector can each be normalized in any suitable manner prior to calculating the similarity score.
In some embodiments, at 112, process 100 can select a subset of channels based on the similarity score and can filter channels based on the activity parameters. In some embodiments, process 100 may be capable of selecting a subset of channels in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can select the top N channels (e.g., top three, top five, top 10%, and/or any other suitable number of channels) with the highest similarity score. In another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can select channels having a similarity score greater than a particular threshold.
In some embodiments, process 100 may be capable of filtering channels in any suitable manner.
For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can filter out channels associated with demographic groups not included in the activity parameters received at 102. It should be noted that a channel is unlikely to have all of its viewers from a particular demographic group. As such, in some examples, the process 100 can select a channel from the set of channels that has a target demographic group of activity parameters received at 102 as one of the first N demographic groups of the channel. Alternatively, in some examples, the process 100 can select channels from the set of channels for which a threshold percentage of viewers falls within the target demographic group of activity parameters received at 102.
As another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can filter out channels that do not meet the minimum video quality criteria specified in the activity parameters received at 102.
As yet another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can filter out channels associated with locations other than the viewer location specified in the activity parameters received at 102. It should be noted that a channel is unlikely to have all viewers from a particular viewer location. As such, in some examples, process 100 can select a channel from a set of channels having a target audience location with activity parameters received at 102 as one of the first N audience locations for the channel. Alternatively, in some examples, process 100 can select channels from the set of channels for which a threshold percentage of viewers falls within the target audience location of the activity parameter received at 102.
In some embodiments, the process 100 can further identify a content creator or channel of media content that matches the content campaign appropriately based on any other suitable criteria, such as based on the affinity of the viewer of the channel. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can identify media content channels having relatively high viewer affinities. In some embodiments, by identifying media content channels that are particularly relevant to a content campaign based on topics and that have a relatively high affinity for viewers, the process 100 can identify content creators or channels of media content that have a relatively high advertising value (e.g., by having viewers interested in topics associated with the content campaign and likely to view content associated with the channels and thus likely to view content items associated with the channels, such as advertisements).
Returning to fig. 1, at 114, for each channel in the subset of channels, in some embodiments, process 100 can calculate the affinity of the viewer of the channel for the topic associated with the URL provided in the activity parameter. In some embodiments, the affinity can indicate any suitable information, such as a likelihood that a viewer of the video associated with the channel views other videos associated with other channels similar to the channel, a likelihood that a viewer of the video associated with the channel navigates to an external website associated with the channel, a likelihood that a viewer of the video associated with the channel participates in or interacts with advertisements included in the video of the channel, a likelihood that a viewer of the video associated with the channel participates in (e.g., approves, shares, reviews, etc.) the video, and/or any other suitable information.
In some embodiments, the process 100 can determine the affinity of the viewer in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can determine the affinity of the viewer of the channel based on the viewing history of the user who has viewed the video associated with the channel. In some embodiments, the viewing history can indicate a percentage of video associated with channels that the user has watched, a percentage of video associated with channels that the user has participated in (e.g., reviewed, approved, shared, etc.), and/or any other suitable viewing history information. As another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can determine the affinity of the viewer for a channel based on the number of subscriptions of the channel by the user.
In some embodiments, process 100 can calculate the total affinity for each channel by combining affinities across multiple topic clusters in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can calculate the total affinity across multiple topic clusters using the following formula:
wherein A is i Is the viewer affinity of the ith cluster. Note that in some embodiments, the process 100 can calculate the total affinity across multiple clusters by assuming the correlation of affinities of channels within the clusters and the independence of affinities across the clusters. That is, the process 100 can estimate the overall affinity of the audience across the different clusters by assuming independence between affinities of the different clusters and calculating a combined probability of having affinities for any cluster using the above formula.
In some embodiments, at 116, the process 100 can present a ranked list of channels based on the calculated affinity. In some embodiments, the process 100 can rank the channel list in any suitable manner based on affinity, e.g., from highest affinity to lowest affinity. In some embodiments, the process 100 can present a subset of channels selected based on affinity, such as by identifying a subset of channels having affinity exceeding a predetermined threshold and/or by identifying the first N channels.
Note that in some embodiments, process 100 can rank the channels based on any suitable combination of calculated affinities and any other suitable information, such as the number of subscribers to the channels, the total number of views of video of the channels, and/or any other suitable information. In some embodiments, by ranking channels based on affinity and any suitable metric that indicates predicted viewing of advertisements presented in conjunction with the channels, the channel ranking can indicate the likelihood that an advertisement will be viewed and the value of the advertisement by indicating such advertisement's value.
In some embodiments, the process 100 can present the ranked list of channels in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 can present a user interface that includes an indication of each channel in the ranked list. In some embodiments, the indication of the channel can include any suitable information about the channel, such as the name of the channel, the number of videos currently included in the channel, the name of the creator of the channel, the number of subscribers to the channel, the total number of views of videos associated with the channel, the number of views of videos associated with the channel over a predetermined period of time (e.g., over the week, over the month, and/or any other suitable period of time), and/or any other suitable information.
Note that in some embodiments, the user interface can include any suitable selectable input that allows a user of the user interface to select one or more channels to include in the content campaign.
Turning to fig. 6, an illustrative example of a user interface for a matching content creator or matching channel for presenting content based on received activity parameters is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As shown, in some embodiments, the user interface 600 can include the received activity parameters from fig. 5. As also shown in fig. 6, each matching content creator or channel can be provided with any suitable information, such as category (e.g., "Beauty & fascion", "gambling", etc.), location (e.g., "USA"), number of subscribers, number of content items provided over a particular period of time (e.g., videos published over the past 30 days), average number of views of the content items, and one or more matching scores (e.g., audience matching score, audience country score, audience demographic library, etc.), etc. In some embodiments, a content item, such as a video, video preview, or any other suitable video representation, can be presented with each matching content creator or channel. Continuing with this example, the branded content provider can select one or more video or other content items associated with the channel to determine whether the channel is suitable for the content campaign.
In some embodiments, different content creators or channels can be selected based on the target optimization parameters. For example, as shown in fig. 6, the target optimization parameters can include a target budget, a target number of views, and a target optimization (e.g., available budget, maximum views, or balance). Continuing with this example, in response to selecting a target optimization of the available budgets, process 100 can be configured to automatically select a maximum number of matching creators or channels that are likely to meet a given budget. Alternatively, in response to selecting a target optimization that maximizes viewing, the process 100 can be configured to automatically select a maximum number of matching creators or channels that are likely to satisfy the desired number of views. It should be noted that if, for example, the given budget is estimated to be insufficient to achieve the desired number of views, the process 100 can send a warning notification to the creator of the content campaign.
In some embodiments, in response to selecting the balance objective optimization, the process 100 can balance the automatic selection of matching creators or channels to best reach the intended viewing with a given budget. This can include, for example, selecting different types of content creators, such as top-level content creators, intermediate content creators, and encumbered content creators (e.g., based on the number of subscribers or audience size, based on the cost per view in a particular vertical domain, based on sponsored videos per channel, based on demographic matching, etc.). In a more specific example, in selecting balance target optimization, the process 100 can use a gaussian distribution to select a few top-level content creators (or highly established content creators) and a few encumbered content creators, mainly intermediate content creators.
In some embodiments, in response to selecting one of the content creators or channels (e.g., one of the matching channels in fig. 6), the brand content provider can contact, employment, and/or manage the content creators of the content campaign.
Turning to fig. 2, an example 200 of hardware for identifying relevant content that can be used in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown.
