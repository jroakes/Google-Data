Definitions
- the present invention relates to power supplies for microprocessors and, more particularly, to techniques for modulating the voltage level output by programmable power supplies.
- Portable computing devices such as laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet computers typically run on battery power.
- the batteries in such devices typically fully discharge after several hours of use.
- Each of these options has various disadvantages.
- Fully recharging a battery requires inserting the battery into a charger, plugging the charger into a power outlet, and waiting up to several hours. Recharging the battery in this way may be inconvenient or impossible for any of a variety of reasons. For example, the user may not have access to a battery charger or to a power outlet. Furthermore, the user may not have time to wait for the battery to recharge. Even if the user has access to a battery charger and a power outlet and has time to wait for the battery to recharge, it may be inconvenient for the user to carry a battery charger with him, to access a power outlet, and to wait for the battery to recharge.
- Replacing the battery with a fully-charged battery may be inconvenient or impossible for any of a variety of reasons. For example, the user may not have access to a fully-charged battery or may find it inconvenient to charge several batteries before traveling and to carry them with her on each trip. In addition, purchasing additional batteries increases the total cost of owning the corresponding portable computing device.
- the user may be inconvenient or impossible for the user to power the portable computing device by plugging it directly into an outlet.
- the user may be in a location (such as an airplane or automobile) in which a power outlet is not available.
- the user may find it inconvenient to carry a power cord and to find a power outlet, relocate to the site of a power outlet, and remain at the site of the power outlet to continue using the portable computing device.
- Portable computing device designers have attempted to increase the amount of time that such devices can run on a single battery charge both by improving the designs of the batteries themselves and by improving the designs of portable computing devices to make them capable of using battery power more efficiently.
- One way in which portable computing devices have been made more energy efficient is by enabling the power provided to their central processing units (CPUs) to be varied.
- the CPU in a portable computing device may be capable of automatically entering a “sleep” mode when the device has been idle for a certain minimum period of time. While in sleep mode, the CPU requires and is provided with a significantly-reduced amount of power.
- the same CPU may be capable of operating in additional power-saving modes requiring various intermediate levels of power. In this way the CPU avoids drawing unnecessary power, thereby increasing the amount of time until the device's battery needs to be recharged.

- the system 300 includes a CPU 302 or other microprocessor.
- the CPU 302 may, for example, be the CrusoeTM model TM5800 processor, available from Transmeta Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif.
- the CPU 302 includes a VID code table 304 that is modifiable by the designer of the system 300 to specify any desired set of digital VID codes and any desired mapping between VID codes and desired power supply output voltages.
- the CPU 302 generates and stores a VID code 320 that corresponds to the desired voltage level to be output by the power supply 214 .
- the VID code table 304 includes a voltage label column 402 a and a voltage ID (VID) code column 402 b .
- the example VID code table 304 shown in FIG. 4 includes three records 404 a - c , each of which specifies a mapping between a particular voltage label and a corresponding VID code. More specifically, record 404 a specifies that the voltage label V 1 corresponds to the VID code 00001; record 404 b specifies that the voltage label V 2 corresponds to the VID code 00010; and record 404 c specifies that the voltage label V 3 corresponds to the VID code 00100.
- the voltage labels in column 402 a may, for example, correspond to states of decreasing power consumption.
- the label V 1 may correspond to the full-power state of CPU 302
- the label V 2 may correspond to a partial-power state of CPU 302
- the label V 3 may correspond to a standby state of CPU 302 .
- the values in the voltage label column 402 a may have any meanings.
- the VID codes in VID code column 402 b are in ascending numerical order in the VID code table 304 shown in FIG. 4 , this is not a requirement of the present invention.
- each bit position in the VID code 320 is associated with a particular output voltage level.
- bit position 0 (the least-significant bit) is associated with voltage level V 1
- bit position 1 is associated with voltage level V 2
- bit position 2 is associated with voltage level V 3 .
- Bit positions 3 - 4 are unused.
- a VID code specifying a particular output voltage level may be formed by: (1) identifying the bit position associated with the output voltage level; (2) storing a first value (e.g., logical 1) in the identified bit position of the VID code; and (3) storing a second value (e.g., logical 0) in the remaining bit positions.
- the VID code table 304 may be generated by generating VID codes in this manner for each possible output voltage level, associating each such VID code with a VID label, and storing records in the VID code table 304 indicating the chosen associations between VID labels and VID codes.
- any value may be stored in unused bit positions of the VID code 320 , such as bit positions 3 - 4 in the example shown in FIG. 4 .
- VID code fields may include more than one bit each. If n is the number of fields (e.g., bits) in the VID code 320 , the encoding scheme shown in FIG. 4 is capable of specifying up to n distinct voltage levels.
- the label column 402 a in the table 304 is not required.
- the table may include only the VID code column 402 b .
- Records 404 a - c may be stored at distinct memory addresses and the addresses may serve the same function as the label column 402 a (i.e., to provide a mapping between output voltages and VID codes).
- FIG. 5A a flowchart is shown of a method 500 that may be used in the system 300 to cause the power supply 214 to produce a desired output voltage level on the power bus 114 .
- the VID code table 304 is as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the method 500 generates a digital voltage ID signal corresponding to the desired output voltage level (step 502 ).
- the CPU 302 may generate and transmit, on lines 306 a - e , a digital VID signal having a high logical value at the bit position associated with the desired output voltage level and having a low logical value at the remaining bit positions.
- the CPU 302 may use the VID code table 304 to map the voltage label V 2 to the VID code 00010, which has the aforementioned properties.
- the method 500 generates an analog input signal suitable for input to the power supply 214 based on the digital VID signal generated in step 502 (step 504 ).
- the system 300 shown in FIG. 3 includes three FETs 310 a - c coupled to CPU outputs 306 a - c , respectively.
- CPU outputs 306 d - e are connected to ground since they output unused VID bits in the present example.
- the system 300 also includes three resistors 312 a - c coupled to FETs 310 a - c , respectively.
- a resistor 314 is connected between power supply voltage V max 316 and the resistors 312 a - c .
- the resulting output of the circuit formed by the FETs 310 a - c and resistors 312 a - c and 314 at node 318 is coupled to analog input 216 of power supply 214 .
- the system 300 converts the digital VID signal output by the CPU 302 into an analog signal at node 318 as follows.
- FETs 310 a - c are closed when the corresponding CPU outputs 306 a - c carry a high logical value. Recall that in the present example one and only one of the outputs 306 a - c will carry a high logical value at a time. As a result, only one of the FETs 310 a - c will be closed at a time. Therefore, current will only flow through one of the resistors 312 a - c at a time.
- resistors 312 a - c and 314 so that the voltage produced at node 318 for each possible VID provides the correct analog input signal to input 216 of the power supply 214 for producing the desired output power voltage.
- the combination of resistors need not simply implement a discrete D/A converter, but rather may implement a configuration that caters to ease of implementation with a small number of resistors with limited impedance ranges.
- step 504 is performed in the system 300 shown in FIG. 3 by closing the switch (e.g., FET 310 b ) corresponding to the high bit in the VID signal (step 520 ), and opening the remaining switches (e.g., FETS 310 a and 310 c ) (step 522 ), thereby producing an analog signal at node 318 suitable for input to the power supply 214 .
- the switch e.g., FET 310 b
- the remaining switches e.g., FETS 310 a and 310 c
- the method 500 provides the analog signal generated in step 504 to the power supply 216 (step 506 ), thereby causing the power supply 216 to produce the desired output voltage on the power bus 114 (step 508 ).
- the system 300 shown in FIG. 3 uses simpler circuitry than the prior art system 200 shown in FIG. 2 for translating VID codes into analog control signals suitable for controlling the analog power supply 214 .
- the system 300 includes only three FETs 310 a - c and four resistors 312 a - c and 314 for producing the same result as the PAL 202 and D/A converter 208 in the system 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the FETs 310 a - c and resistors 312 a - c and 314 typically will be much smaller and cost significantly less than the PAL 202 and D/A converter 208 , thereby enabling the system 300 to be significantly smaller and cost significantly less to manufacture than the system 200 .
- the VID code table 304 may be a custom VID code table 304 , i.e., a VID code table in which specific VID codes have been stored for the purpose of enabling VID codes to be generated for use in conjunction with the method 500 illustrated in FIG. 5A .
- the VID code table 304 may, however, alternatively be a standard (e.g., factory-configured) VID code table that happens to contain VID codes having mutually-exclusive bits or other VID codes that are capable of being used in conjunction with the method 500 illustrated in FIG. 5A .
- Embodiments of the present invention in other words, are not limited to use in conjunction with custom VID code tables.
- FIG. 6 a schematic diagram is shown of a another embodiment of a system 600 for converting a digital VID signal into an analog signal suitable for input to the analog-programmable power supply 214 .
- the system 600 shown in FIG. 6 includes CPU 302 .
- the system 600 shown in FIG. 6 includes analog-programmable power supply 214 .
- the system 600 shown in FIG. 6 includes VID power supply 104 instead of circuitry 310 a - c , 312 a - c , 314 , 316 , and 318 .
- the system 600 of FIG. 6 uses a subset of the VID power supply 104 as a VID translator. More specifically, the system 600 uses an existing D/A converter subsystem 602 (e.g., a controller IC) in the VID power supply 104 to convert the digital VID signals from outputs 306 a - c into an analog output signal provided at output signal 618 and received by the analog-programmable power supply 214 at input 216 .
- One benefit of using the existing D/A converter subsystem 602 is that it may be obtained at low cost as part of a commercially-available VID power supply, and eliminates the need to design and manufacture circuitry such as that shown in FIG. 3 .
- the VID power supply 104 typically includes not only the controller IC that implements the D/A converter subsystem 602 , but also a variety of associated large, external components consisting of FETs, inductors, and capacitors. These components may be omitted from the system 600 .
- the system 600 need not include the entire VID power supply 104 to take advantage of its D/A converter subsystem 602 ; rather, the D/A converter subsystem 602 may be extracted from the VID power supply 104 and provided within the system 600 without the other components of the VID power supply 104 . This has the benefit of reducing the size of the system 600 , since the controller IC is relatively small compared to the other components in the VID power supply 104 .
- controller IC from the VID power supply 104 has the benefit of implementing a standard VID table, which eliminates the need to implement a custom VID table. Furthermore, using the controller IC from the VID power supply may enable extra features to be used, such as special out-of-band signals and timings that shift the voltage during boot up and during CPU deep sleep states.
Abstract
Description
- This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/618,084, filed on Oct. 12, 2004, entitled “Voltage ID Conversion System for Programmable Power Supplies,” which is hereby incorporated by reference.
- 1. Field of the Invention
- The present invention relates to power supplies for microprocessors and, more particularly, to techniques for modulating the voltage level output by programmable power supplies.
- 2. Related Art
- Portable computing devices, such as laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and tablet computers typically run on battery power. The batteries in such devices typically fully discharge after several hours of use. When the battery in a portable computing device has fully discharged, it becomes necessary to recharge the battery, replace the battery with a fully-charged battery, or plug the device directly into a power outlet in order to continue using the device. Each of these options has various disadvantages.
- Fully recharging a battery requires inserting the battery into a charger, plugging the charger into a power outlet, and waiting up to several hours. Recharging the battery in this way may be inconvenient or impossible for any of a variety of reasons. For example, the user may not have access to a battery charger or to a power outlet. Furthermore, the user may not have time to wait for the battery to recharge. Even if the user has access to a battery charger and a power outlet and has time to wait for the battery to recharge, it may be inconvenient for the user to carry a battery charger with him, to access a power outlet, and to wait for the battery to recharge.
- Replacing the battery with a fully-charged battery may be inconvenient or impossible for any of a variety of reasons. For example, the user may not have access to a fully-charged battery or may find it inconvenient to charge several batteries before traveling and to carry them with her on each trip. In addition, purchasing additional batteries increases the total cost of owning the corresponding portable computing device.
- Finally, it may be inconvenient or impossible for the user to power the portable computing device by plugging it directly into an outlet. For example, the user may be in a location (such as an airplane or automobile) in which a power outlet is not available. Furthermore, the user may find it inconvenient to carry a power cord and to find a power outlet, relocate to the site of a power outlet, and remain at the site of the power outlet to continue using the portable computing device.
- For these and other reasons it is highly desirable to enable portable computing devices to operate on a single battery charge for as long as possible. Portable computing device designers have attempted to increase the amount of time that such devices can run on a single battery charge both by improving the designs of the batteries themselves and by improving the designs of portable computing devices to make them capable of using battery power more efficiently.
- One way in which portable computing devices have been made more energy efficient is by enabling the power provided to their central processing units (CPUs) to be varied. In particular, the CPU in a portable computing device may be capable of automatically entering a “sleep” mode when the device has been idle for a certain minimum period of time. While in sleep mode, the CPU requires and is provided with a significantly-reduced amount of power. The same CPU may be capable of operating in additional power-saving modes requiring various intermediate levels of power. In this way the CPU avoids drawing unnecessary power, thereby increasing the amount of time until the device's battery needs to be recharged.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , aprior art system 100 is shown including aCPU 102 and apower supply 104 for supplying power to theCPU 102. TheCPU 102 specifies the voltage to be output by thepower supply 104 by transmitting a voltage ID (VID) code to thepower supply 104 over aparallel bus 108, referred to herein as a “VID bus.” Thepower supply 104 translates the VID into a particular voltage level and outputs the voltage over apower bus 114. Although theCPU 102 draws power from thepower bus 114, the connection between theCPU 102 andpower bus 114 is not shown inFIG. 1 for ease of illustration. - More specifically, the
CPU 102 outputs a 5-bit VID code on outputs 106 a-e and transmits the code as a VID signal over bus lines 110 a-e to inputs 112 a-e of thepower supply 104. Thepower supply 104 includes a lookup table or other means for mapping the particular VID code transmitted by theCPU 102 into a particular voltage level to output on thepower bus 114. Although the mapping of VID codes to voltage levels varies from power supply to power supply, such mappings typically specify a list of VID codes in ascending numerical order and a corresponding set of output voltages, which typically form a monotonic voltage ramp or set of ramps in different scales. - In some cases it may be advantageous to use a power supply that does not accept VID codes as inputs. For example, in some cases there may be no commercially-available power supply that accepts VID codes and that satisfies particular design requirements (e.g., maximum volume, high power conversion efficiency). Such alternative power supplies typically require as input an analog signal that corresponds to the desired output voltage.
- For example, referring to
FIG. 2 , an example of aprior art system 200 is shown including theCPU 102 and an analog-programmable power supply 214 that includes ananalog input 216 for receiving an analog signal specifying the output voltage to provide onpower bus 114. As used herein, the term “analog-programmable power supply” refers generally to any power supply that uses an analog input signal to select an output voltage level. - As in the
system 100 ofFIG. 1 , theCPU 102 inFIG. 2 outputs a VID code at outputs 106 a-e. Unlikesystem 100, however,system 200 includes a PAL 202 (programmable array logic) that receives the VID signal at inputs 204 a-e. ThePAL 202 translates the VID code output by theCPU 102 into a digital signal on outputs 206 a-h. A digital-to-analog (D/A)converter 208 receives this digital signal at inputs 210 a-h and converts the digital signal into an analog signal onoutput 212. This analog signal is provided to input 216 ofpower supply 214, which outputs an appropriate corresponding voltage level in response. Although thePAL 202 may not be needed in all cases, thesystem 200 must include at least the D/A converter 208 to convert the VID code (or a digital signal derived from it) into an analog signal suitable for input to thepower supply 214. - Although the
PAL 202 and D/Aconverter 208 perform the desired function, such added circuitry increases the total volume and manufacturing cost of thesystem 200, in some cases to an unacceptable degree. Volume and cost considerations are becoming increasingly significant as the size of portable computing devices decreases and pricing pressures increase. - What is needed, therefore, are improved techniques for converting VID codes into analog signals suitable for input to analog-programmable power supplies.
- Techniques are disclosed for converting voltage identification (VID) codes into analog signals suitable for input to analog-programmable power supplies. An encoding scheme is used in which each VID includes a plurality of fields (e.g., bits). Each field is associated with a particular voltage level to be output by an analog-programmable power supply. A VID code is formed for encoding a particular desired output voltage level by assigning a first value (e.g., logical 1) to the VID field associated with the desired output voltage level, and by assigning a second value (e.g., logical 0) to the remaining VID fields. The VID code is provided to VID conversion circuitry which converts the VID code into an analog signal that may be provided to the analog-programmable power supply to produce the desired output voltage level. The VID conversion circuitry may include a single switch (e.g., FET) and resistor for each VID field.
- For example, in one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided which includes steps of: (A) generating a digital voltage identification (VID) signal including a plurality of fields by performing steps of: (A)(1) assigning a first value to a first one of the plurality of fields, the first one of the plurality of fields corresponding to a desired output voltage; and (A)(2) assigning a second value to at least one other one of the plurality of fields; and (B) converting the VID signal into an analog signal suitable for input to an analog-programmable power supply.
- In another aspect of the present invention, a system is provided which includes generation means for generating a digital voltage identification (VID) signal including a plurality of fields. The generation means includes means for assigning a first value to a first one of the plurality of fields, the first one of the plurality of fields corresponding to a desired output voltage; and means for assigning a second value to at least one other one of the plurality of fields. The system further includes conversion means for converting the VID signal into an analog signal suitable for input to an analog-programmable power supply.
- In yet another aspect of the present invention, a system is provided which includes: a parallel bus includes a plurality of bus lines; transmission means for transmitting a plurality of fields of a digital voltage identification (VID) signal over corresponding ones of the plurality of bus lines, wherein the plurality of fields includes a first field having a first value and at least one second field having a second value that differs from the first value; a plurality of FETs coupled to the plurality of bus lines; a plurality of resistors, each of which is coupled between a corresponding one of the plurality of FETs and an intermediate node; a power source; a resistor coupled between the power source and the intermediate node; and an analog-programmable power supply having an analog input coupled to the intermediate node.

TheCPU 302 includes a VID code table 304 that is modifiable by the designer of thesystem 300 to specify any desired set of digital VID codes and any desired mapping between VID codes and desired power supply output voltages. TheCPU 302 generates and stores aVID code 320 that corresponds to the desired voltage level to be output by thepower supply 214. - For example, referring to
FIG. 4 , the contents of the VID code table 304 are shown according to one embodiment of the present invention. The VID code table 304 includes a voltage label column 402 a and a voltage ID (VID) code column 402 b. The example VID code table 304 shown inFIG. 4 includes three records 404 a-c, each of which specifies a mapping between a particular voltage label and a corresponding VID code. More specifically, record 404 a specifies that the voltage label V1 corresponds to theVID code 00001;record 404 b specifies that the voltage label V2 corresponds to theVID code 00010; and record 404 c specifies that the voltage label V3 corresponds to theVID code 00100. - The voltage labels in column 402 a may, for example, correspond to states of decreasing power consumption. For example, the label V1 may correspond to the full-power state of
CPU 302, the label V2 may correspond to a partial-power state ofCPU 302, and the label V3 may correspond to a standby state ofCPU 302. These are merely examples, however, and the values in the voltage label column 402 a may have any meanings. Furthermore, although the VID codes in VID code column 402 b are in ascending numerical order in the VID code table 304 shown inFIG. 4 , this is not a requirement of the present invention. - According to the label-code mapping scheme shown in
FIG. 4 , each bit position in theVID code 320 is associated with a particular output voltage level. In the example shown inFIG. 4 , bit position 0 (the least-significant bit) is associated with voltage level V1, bit position 1 is associated with voltage level V2, and bit position 2 is associated with voltage level V3. Bit positions 3-4 are unused. - According to this scheme, a VID code specifying a particular output voltage level may be formed by: (1) identifying the bit position associated with the output voltage level; (2) storing a first value (e.g., logical 1) in the identified bit position of the VID code; and (3) storing a second value (e.g., logical 0) in the remaining bit positions. The VID code table 304 may be generated by generating VID codes in this manner for each possible output voltage level, associating each such VID code with a VID label, and storing records in the VID code table 304 indicating the chosen associations between VID labels and VID codes.
- It should be appreciated that any value may be stored in unused bit positions of the
VID code 320, such as bit positions 3-4 in the example shown inFIG. 4 . Furthermore, it should be appreciated that although each field in the VID codes shown inFIG. 4 includes exactly one bit, VID code fields may include more than one bit each. If n is the number of fields (e.g., bits) in theVID code 320, the encoding scheme shown inFIG. 4 is capable of specifying up to n distinct voltage levels. - Note that the label column 402 a in the table 304 is not required. Alternatively, for example, the table may include only the VID code column 402 b. Records 404 a-c may be stored at distinct memory addresses and the addresses may serve the same function as the label column 402 a (i.e., to provide a mapping between output voltages and VID codes).
- Referring to
FIG. 5A , a flowchart is shown of amethod 500 that may be used in thesystem 300 to cause thepower supply 214 to produce a desired output voltage level on thepower bus 114. Assume for purposes of example that the VID code table 304 is as shown inFIG. 4 . Also assume for purposes of example that it is desired to produce the voltage corresponding to voltage label V2. - The
method 500 generates a digital voltage ID signal corresponding to the desired output voltage level (step 502). In particular, theCPU 302 may generate and transmit, on lines 306 a-e, a digital VID signal having a high logical value at the bit position associated with the desired output voltage level and having a low logical value at the remaining bit positions. In the present example, theCPU 302 may use the VID code table 304 to map the voltage label V2 to theVID code 00010, which has the aforementioned properties. - The
method 500 generates an analog input signal suitable for input to thepower supply 214 based on the digital VID signal generated in step 502 (step 504). For example, thesystem 300 shown inFIG. 3 includes three FETs 310 a-c coupled to CPU outputs 306 a-c, respectively. CPU outputs 306 d-e are connected to ground since they output unused VID bits in the present example. Thesystem 300 also includes three resistors 312 a-c coupled to FETs 310 a-c, respectively. A resistor 314 is connected between powersupply voltage V max 316 and the resistors 312 a-c. The resulting output of the circuit formed by the FETs 310 a-c and resistors 312 a-c and 314 atnode 318 is coupled toanalog input 216 ofpower supply 214. - The
system 300 converts the digital VID signal output by theCPU 302 into an analog signal atnode 318 as follows. FETs 310 a-c are closed when the corresponding CPU outputs 306 a-c carry a high logical value. Recall that in the present example one and only one of the outputs 306 a-c will carry a high logical value at a time. As a result, only one of the FETs 310 a-c will be closed at a time. Therefore, current will only flow through one of the resistors 312 a-c at a time. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate how to select appropriate resistances for resistors 312 a-c and 314 so that the voltage produced atnode 318 for each possible VID provides the correct analog input signal to input 216 of thepower supply 214 for producing the desired output power voltage. Note that the combination of resistors need not simply implement a discrete D/A converter, but rather may implement a configuration that caters to ease of implementation with a small number of resistors with limited impedance ranges. - Referring to
FIG. 5B ,step 504 is performed in thesystem 300 shown inFIG. 3 by closing the switch (e.g.,FET 310 b) corresponding to the high bit in the VID signal (step 520), and opening the remaining switches (e.g.,FETS 310 a and 310 c) (step 522), thereby producing an analog signal atnode 318 suitable for input to thepower supply 214. - Returning to
FIG. 5A , themethod 500 provides the analog signal generated instep 504 to the power supply 216 (step 506), thereby causing thepower supply 216 to produce the desired output voltage on the power bus 114 (step 508). - One advantage of the
system 300 shown inFIG. 3 is that it uses simpler circuitry than theprior art system 200 shown inFIG. 2 for translating VID codes into analog control signals suitable for controlling theanalog power supply 214. As shown inFIG. 3 , thesystem 300 includes only three FETs 310 a-c and four resistors 312 a-c and 314 for producing the same result as thePAL 202 and D/A converter 208 in thesystem 200 ofFIG. 2 . The FETs 310 a-c and resistors 312 a-c and 314 typically will be much smaller and cost significantly less than thePAL 202 and D/A converter 208, thereby enabling thesystem 300 to be significantly smaller and cost significantly less to manufacture than thesystem 200. - It is to be understood that although the invention has been described above in terms of particular embodiments, the foregoing embodiments are provided as illustrative only, and do not limit or define the scope of the invention. Various other embodiments are also within the scope of the claims.
- For example, the VID code table 304 may be a custom VID code table 304, i.e., a VID code table in which specific VID codes have been stored for the purpose of enabling VID codes to be generated for use in conjunction with the
method 500 illustrated inFIG. 5A . The VID code table 304 may, however, alternatively be a standard (e.g., factory-configured) VID code table that happens to contain VID codes having mutually-exclusive bits or other VID codes that are capable of being used in conjunction with themethod 500 illustrated inFIG. 5A . Embodiments of the present invention, in other words, are not limited to use in conjunction with custom VID code tables. - Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to using the particular conversion circuitry illustrated in
FIG. 3 . For example, referring toFIG. 6 , a schematic diagram is shown of a another embodiment of asystem 600 for converting a digital VID signal into an analog signal suitable for input to the analog-programmable power supply 214. Like thesystem 300 shown inFIG. 3 , thesystem 600 shown inFIG. 6 includesCPU 302. And, like thesystem 300 shown inFIG. 3 , thesystem 600 shown inFIG. 6 includes analog-programmable power supply 214. - The
system 600 shown inFIG. 6 , however, includesVID power supply 104 instead of circuitry 310 a-c, 312 a-c, 314, 316, and 318. Rather than use theVID power supply 104 to supply power, however, thesystem 600 ofFIG. 6 uses a subset of theVID power supply 104 as a VID translator. More specifically, thesystem 600 uses an existing D/A converter subsystem 602 (e.g., a controller IC) in theVID power supply 104 to convert the digital VID signals from outputs 306 a-c into an analog output signal provided atoutput signal 618 and received by the analog-programmable power supply 214 atinput 216. One benefit of using the existing D/A converter subsystem 602 is that it may be obtained at low cost as part of a commercially-available VID power supply, and eliminates the need to design and manufacture circuitry such as that shown inFIG. 3 . - Note that the
VID power supply 104 typically includes not only the controller IC that implements the D/A converter subsystem 602, but also a variety of associated large, external components consisting of FETs, inductors, and capacitors. These components may be omitted from thesystem 600. In other words, thesystem 600 need not include the entireVID power supply 104 to take advantage of its D/A converter subsystem 602; rather, the D/A converter subsystem 602 may be extracted from theVID power supply 104 and provided within thesystem 600 without the other components of theVID power supply 104. This has the benefit of reducing the size of thesystem 600, since the controller IC is relatively small compared to the other components in theVID power supply 104. Furthermore, using the controller IC from theVID power supply 104 has the benefit of implementing a standard VID table, which eliminates the need to implement a custom VID table. Furthermore, using the controller IC from the VID power supply may enable extra features to be used, such as special out-of-band signals and timings that shift the voltage during boot up and during CPU deep sleep states.
