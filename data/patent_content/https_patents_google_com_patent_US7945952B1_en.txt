Definitions
- At least some embodiments of the present invention relate to communication systems, and more particularly to the prevention of abuses of communication systems through performing automated tests to tell humans and computers apart.
- CAPTCHATM which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart, are tests designed such that most humans can pass but not current computer programs.
- bots Automated computer programs, known as “robots” or “bots”, have been used to process data with minimum human intervention. While bots can be useful in certain situations, bots may lead to abuses and/or security threats in other situations.
- CAPTCHATM tests may be used to prevent search engine bots from indexing certain web pages and prevent others from finding them easily.
- CAPTCHATM tests may be used to prevent dictionary attacks in password systems.
- a few companies are marketing the idea of using CAPTCHATM tests to fight email worms and spam through enforcing “I will only accept an email if I know there is a human behind the other computer.”
- CAPTCHATM test is a Turing test but designed to automatically tell human and machine apart based on the difference in capabilities between humans and the current state of art of computer programs.
- CAPTCHATM tests are generated automatically and designed to be Public Turing tests which rely on randomness in the generation of the tests but neither on secret database nor on secret algorithm.
- a typical CAPTCHATM test presents a word rendered as an image.
- the word is distorted in shape and obfuscated with different colors and other features such as dots and lines.
- Most humans can pass the test, but blind and partially sighted people became the inadvertent victims in a war against bots of spammers when such CAPTCHATM tests are used.
- a method performed by a data processing system includes: detecting a condition indicative of abuses of a communication channel; in response to the condition, providing a non-image based challenge through the communication channel, the challenge being solvable to an average human user of the communication channel; receiving a response to the challenge; and determining whether or not the response is correct.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system to present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIGS. 2-3 illustrate scenarios to automatically present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to embodiments of the present invention.
- FIGS. 4-5 illustrate methods to present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a method to generate challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a server system to generate and present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- One embodiment of the present invention involves the automated determination of whether a human or machine is at the other end of a communication channel. The determination is based on whether the correct response to a challenge is received from the other end of the communication channel.
- the challenge is provided in a non-image format, such as a text based questions or a sound clip.
- a challenge in an image format can also be used when appropriate.
- Image-based challenges have a number of limitations, such as requiring the human user to have a device capable of rendering images, requiring the human user to have adequate vision to see the image, etc.
- text based challenges or sound based challenges can be used more advantageously with applications such as instant messaging (IM), short message service (SMS) messaging, telephonic communication, etc., which might not render images or might disrupt normal usage when rendering image-based challenges.
- IM instant messaging
- SMS short message service
- telephonic communication etc.
- the computer can play a sound clip and ask the user to type in the word or number they just heard or an answer related to the content of the sound clip.
- Sound based challenges are great for visually impaired users and for telephone based applications.
- the computer can provide text based challenges based on the idea that users can more easily answer questions like “what is the third word in this sentence?”, “spell the fifth word in this sentence in reverse?”, “is New York City in Africa?”, “are apples squares?”, etc.
- the computer may deliberately misspell words, such as taking out vowels randomly, to confuse the computer software robots (bots).
- the challenges are used after a configurable amount of traffic (e.g., instant messages or SMS messages), or a configurable messaging speed is detected, to prevent bots from sending unsolicited messages automatically to people.
- a configurable amount of traffic e.g., instant messages or SMS messages
- a configurable messaging speed is detected, to prevent bots from sending unsolicited messages automatically to people.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system to present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- a communication server(s) ( 103 ) is used to provide communication channels over the electronic communication network ( 101 ) between user terminals, such as user terminal A ( 111 ) (e.g., computer), user terminal B ( 113 ) (e.g., personal digital assistant (PDA)), user terminal X ( 119 ) (e.g., mobile phone), etc.
- user terminal A e.g., computer
- user terminal B e.g., personal digital assistant (PDA)
- PDA personal digital assistant
- user terminal X e.g., mobile phone

- servers such as search engines that are in response to queries in the form of SMS messages, document search engine, web-based email, web servers that accept and publish user comments (e.g., blogs), web based registration or form submission, etc.
- the communication server(s) ( 103 ) is connected to a database ( 105 ) which contains user information and data for the generation of challenges to tell humans and machines apart.
- the communication server(s) ( 103 ) may be on a single physical machine or on separated, different physical machines.
- the electronic communication network ( 101 ) may be the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN, a cellular communication network, etc., or a combination of various different types of networks with bridges, routers, gateways, etc.
- the user terminals may use various applications to communicate with the communication server(s) ( 103 ).
- the server(s) ( 103 ) may include a document server; and the user terminals run document browsers to communicate with the document server in order to access various services, such as online account log in, online registration, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) form submission, etc.
- the document server provides a document to the client in response to a request for the document from the client.
- the user can further provide data to the document server based on the document to request a further document (e.g., a web page).
- the server(s) ( 103 ) may include an instant messaging server, which services online presence information about IM users and which may or may not relay the IM messages for the users.
- the servers ( 103 ) may include a gateway for voice over interne protocol (VoIP) for the user terminals to make voice connections.

- the communication server(s) ( 103 ) integrates various different types of communication systems, such as email, instant messaging, chat, SMS messaging, voice communication, video teleconferencing, etc.
- the user terminals in communication may or may not use the same types of communication applications.
- the server(s) ( 103 ) include two types of servers to support communication: connection servers and session servers.
- Connection servers maintain communication connections (e.g., TCP/IP connections) to a number of users; and session servers maintain user related data for a communication session, such as the presence information and roster of a user, etc.
- a roster of a user in an IM system typically includes a list of users of the IM system, or other entities, to whom the user is subscribed.
- Connection servers are designed to service a large number of simultaneous connections to clients.
- a connection server can handle any user so that a connection server can be selected to reduce latency to the client.
- Connection servers do the initial version negotiation, authentication and handshaking for a connection.
- connection servers parse and canonicalize the original communication stream (e.g., in Extensible Markup Language (XML)) from the user, and protect the service from protocol attacks (e.g., eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)).
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- XMPP eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
- connection servers monitor traffic for rate-limiting and parse and print the stream from and to the client.
- Connection servers may or may not “short-circuit” packets directly from one user's connection to another user's connection to bypass the session servers, even if two clients are connected on the very same connection server.
- Session servers are used to maintain the state for a user's session, enforce privacy policies, broadcast presence, etc.
- the server(s) ( 103 ) include one or more servers to monitor the communication traffic for the detection of indications of abuse.
- a human-in-the-loop challenge is generated and presented to the corresponding user terminal.
- the answer from the user terminal fails the challenge, it may be determined that the user terminal is under the control of a bot, not a human; and appropriate actions can then be taken to limit the access from the user terminal. For example, the privilege of the user terminal to use the service of the server(s) ( 103 ) may be suspended for a period of time.
- the server(s) ( 103 ) provides human-in-the-loop challenges in a form that is appropriate for the communication connection to the user terminal device.
- human-in-the-loop challenges can be used for real time communication systems such as IM, VoIP, etc.
- image-based challenges can also be used.
- the user terminal uses an IM client or an SMS client, which may not be able to render image, or rendering an image can dramatically effect the usage flow in the application.
- the server automatically selects a non-image format challenge for the user terminal.
- the server may monitor the type of communication originated from the user terminal (e.g., a mobile device) that is capable of rendering different type of data (e.g., text, sound, image, video, etc.) to determine an appropriate format.
- the user terminal e.g., a mobile device
- different type of data e.g., text, sound, image, video, etc.
- an image-based or video-based challenge may be presented. If the device sends only SMS messages, an SMS message-based challenge is presented.
- multiple types of challenges may be sent to the user terminal so that a human user may select one which is appropriate for the situation to response.
- the servers(s) ( 103 ) includes one or more servers to generate challenges automatically.
- the challenges may be generated automatically partially according to information stored in the database (e.g., components of questions, rules to composite questions), partially according to information related to the current communication stream, partially based upon information randomly obtained from the Internet, and/or partially based on advertisement information.
- the challenge may use an advertisement (e.g., selected according to the relevancy to the content of the ongoing communication of the user terminal) to set up the context and post a question regarding the advertisement.
- an advertisement e.g., selected according to the relevancy to the content of the ongoing communication of the user terminal
- the human-in-the-loop challenges may or may not be “public” Turing tests.
- the data for the generation of the challenges may be kept in secrete and may change from time to time to discourage the attempts to develop bots to break the challenges.
- FIGS. 2-3 illustrate scenarios to automatically present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to embodiments of the present invention.
- the server may monitor the traffic for indications of spam. For example, after a configurable amount of traffic that is considered unusual from a human, the server may raise a human-in-the-loop challenge. In such a situation, it may not make sense to show an image-based CAPTCHATM test. A text- or sound-based challenge is then provided.
- an Instant Messaging (IM) client ( 201 ) is used at the user terminal.
- the server monitors the usage of the instant messaging system by the user terminal. Through monitoring the conversation (e.g., 201 - 205 ), the server may detect an indication that the user terminal may be spamming under control of a software robot (bot).
- bot software robot
- a number of aspects of the communication traffic can be monitored for indication of spam. For example, a bot may send similar messages to a large number of people; a bot may send messages at a rate must higher than a typical human can type; a bot may send a large amount of data than a typical human would type; spam messages may have certain language patterns, etc.
- the server When an indication of abuse is detected, the server provides a text challenge ( 211 ) to request for a correct answer before allowing the continue use of the system.
- the server posts a request “Spell the fifth word in this sentence in reverse”.
- a human user can understand the request and type in the response “ni” ( 213 ).
- a spam bot will fail to provide a correct answer.
- the server may determine that the IM client is under the control of a bot and block the IM client from contacting other IM users for a period of time.
- the text-based challenge may be in the form of a question about the context, such as “what is the third word in this sentence”, “what is the last word of the previous message you received”, etc.
- the text-based challenge may be in the form of a request that require further manipulation of the context, such as “what is the fifth word in this sentence in reverse”.
- the text-based challenge may require commonly known knowledge, such as “is New York City in Africa”, “are apples squares”, etc.
- the text-based challenge is a sentence in a natural language currently used by the IM client, such as English.
- a natural language is a language in which human users talk to teach other in voice communications and/or in written communications. A computer may guess the result in a period of time, people can understand it much faster.
- the server deliberately misspells words to confuse bots. Humans typically can spot a misspelling and understand the sentence.
- server may randomly take out vowels (or other characters) to generate the challenge. Further, the characters (e.g., vowels) can also be added randomly. Alternatively, the server may randomly select and substitute one word with another word that has similar spelling.
- the text challenge is generated from a set of components.
- the context may be “this sentence”, “the previous message you received”, “the previous message you sent”, “this paragraph”, “the above advertisement”, etc.
- the question may be about the i'th word, j'th character, n'th sentence, etc.
- the text challenge is in a negative form, such as “not what is a capital of . . . ”.
- the text challenge is in the form of a puzzle (e.g., a mathematical expression).
- a handheld device e.g., a PDA and/or mobile phone ( 301 ) is the user terminal.
- Similar messages ( 305 ) are being sent from the device to many other users in a short period of time, which may be the work of a spam bot or an exciting user who wants to tell friends a story. Thus, it may become desirable to determine whether there is a human at the end of the device.
- the server sends a sound challenge ( 311 ); and the device plays the sound through the speaker ( 303 ).
- the sound challenge ( 311 ) asks the user “what is five plus two”.
- a human will be able to determine the result and press one or more keys (e.g., 307 ) to send the correct response.
- the sound challenge may be presented as a Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) message, or as a text-to-speech message played after calling the device (e.g., through VoIP or traditional telephone network), or through other communication channels.
- MMS Multimedia Messaging Service
- the challenge may be sent as text in the form of an SMS message; and the response is expected from a reply SMS message.
- the sound-based challenge includes a sound clip that requests the user to type in the word they just heard. Sound-based challenges are great for visually impaired users. Sound-based challenges also work well with telephonic applications.
- the sound-based challenge may ask the user to perform a simple mathematical operation and provide the result, or ask the user to speak a word, or ask the user to type in a number related to the question, etc.
- text-based or sound-based challenges can also be used with other communication clients, such as a VoIP client, a video conferencing client, a document browser, etc.
- FIGS. 4-5 illustrate methods to present challenges to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- a condition indicating abuses of a communication channel is detected ( 401 ) (e.g., through monitoring the traffic in the communication channel).
- the communication channel may be in an instant messaging system, a short message service system, a voice communication system, an email system, or a combination of such systems.
- a human-in-the-loop challenge is provided ( 403 ) through the communication channel (e.g., no-image based challenges, such as text or speech).
- a response to the challenge is subsequently received ( 405 ).
- the system then automatically determines ( 407 ) whether or not the response is from a human based on whether or not the response is correct.
- the system monitors ( 501 ) the communication traffic from a communication device in a real time communication system.
- the system may monitor the rate at which messages are generated, the estimated speed of data generation at the device, the number of connections to different devices over a short period of time, etc.
- the system sends ( 505 ) a human-in-the-loop challenge to the device in a format (e.g., image, text, speech) according to a current communication mode of the communication device.
- a human-in-the-loop challenge to the device in a format (e.g., image, text, speech) according to a current communication mode of the communication device.
- the system suspends ( 509 ) the privilege of the communication device to use the communication system (e.g., for a short period of time).
- FIG. 6 illustrates a method to generate challenge to tell humans and machines apart according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- a transformation is performed ( 603 ) on the text message.
- the text message may be obtained through selecting one from a database, generating according to a set of rules from a number of components stored in the database, questioning context, questioning factual relation, questioning results of operations on context based subjects, etc.
- the responder is required to have certain factual knowledge, such as the geographic relation between New York City and Africa, which is not provided with the challenge.
- the factual-based challenge may test whether or not the responder is aware of the factual knowledge that is commonly known to a typical human user.
- the transformation of the text message may include randomly deleting and/or adding characters or vowels, substituting words with similar spelling words, etc.
- operation ( 605 ) determines that the current flow of communication is in text, the text message is presented as a human-in-the loop challenge.
- operation ( 605 ) determines that the current flow of communication is in voice
- text-to-speech is performed ( 609 ) on the transformed text message to generate a voice message.
- the voice message is further distorted ( 611 ) to increase the difficulty for bots to comprehend the message.
- the voice message is then presented ( 613 ) as a human-in-the loop challenge.
- the generated human-in-the-loop challenges can be used in real time communication systems, such as IM, telephone conversation, video conferencing, as well as in HTML form submission (e.g., for online registration, comment submission, access control, blocking bots, etc.)
