Family amplification, the geographical location shown in map national level position change shown in the map 302 is at shown in map 402
State level position.Therefore, when local Figure 30 2 is divided by country, map 402 is divided by state boundary 404.Similarly, if user after
Continuous enlarged map 402, then map can be transformed into from display state level position again shows at county level or city level position.
By changing map between the different brackets of geographical location hierarchical structure, disclosed system provides energy for user
The map of information is shown with required grain size category.For example, Fig. 5 is the screenshot capture 500 of explicitly Figure 50 2 in viewport 504,
Relevant location information 506 is shown by viewport 504.It is similar with the map 402 of Fig. 4, as shown in state boundary 404, map is drawn
It is divided into the zoom level in state grade geographical location, explicitly 2 Figure 50.According on one side, user can choose to be shown on a map 502
The one or more geographical locations shown.Any number of input equipments can be used, (do not shown by computer mouse cursor such as
Geographical location is selected out) or by entering a query into search field 310, executes the selection in geographical location.In touch screen
In the case of, user can select geographical location by clicking the required position on map.Map can show expression via with
Family selects the visual indicia in which geographical location.For example, user can choose geographical location 508 in map 502.By changing
Become the color on state boundary 510 or the visual indicia of thickness, indicates selection geographical location 508.
In addition, screenshot capture 500 includes the mark 512 for identifying the title in geographical location selected by user.Mark
512 can also identify the hierarchical structure grade in selected geographical location.For example, mark 512 indicates that geographical location 508 is section's roller
It is more and it is the state in father geographical location " whole world ", " North America " and " U.S. ".
The selected geographical location in the map of display can automatically be corresponded to by the location information of map denotation.Example
Such as, location information 506 shown in screenshot capture 500 corresponds to the geographical location 508 of Colorado.Location information 506 can be with
Any information including can be used for server apparatus 110 or client device 120, including addressable information on the internet.
For example, the census data of the accessible storage of server apparatus 110, in order to provide population and GPD data, such as screen is cut
Location information 506 shown in Figure 50 0.As discussed below, location information can also include the letter provided by other users
Breath.For example, location information may include being shot by other users and from each client device, such as client device
120,130 and 140, upload to the photo of the server apparatus 110 of Fig. 1.
As described above, user can be with enlarged map 502, to make map automatically from display state 508 turns of geographical location of grade
Change to the geographical location of display lower level.For example, the screenshot capture 600 of Fig. 6 indicates map 602, it is in user's enlarged drawing 5
Shown in geographical location 508 result.In map 602, taken with such as the geographical location at county level as shown in boundary 604 at county level
For state grade geographical location 508.User can selectively one or more geographical locations shown in Figure 60 2 again, however, user
It now will be from the Resource selection of position at county level rather than state level position.As shown in boundary 608, user is selectively in Figure 60 2
Geographical location 606.Mark 612 expression geographical locations 606 be " Parker county " and its be father geographical location " whole world ", " North America ",
The a part in " U.S. " and " Colorado ".After selecting geographical location 606, corresponding location information 614 is shown.Then, it uses
Each geographical location at county level in selectively Figure 60 2 is continued at family, to obtain location information at county level.
Therefore, the different levels structural class that geographical location is shown for different zoom grade can be generated in system 100
Map.To any specific zoom level, system 100 can determine the geographical location appropriate that will be shown in map.According to
The one aspect of the technology, server apparatus 110 or client device 120 can be by specific geographic positions and specific zoom level
Association.Fig. 7 shows the tree 700 of example geo position hierarchical structure.In tree 700, each geographical location and one or more contractings
It is associated to put grade.Grade number is put by low-shrinkage, such as 0 to 7, the opposite low-shrinkage in specified map is put, and by higher number,
Such as 13 and 14, indicate higher scaling.Dotted line 730,732 and 734 indicates that map will be converted to the second ground from the first geographical location
Manage the zoom level boundary of position.
For example, as shown in tree 700, in 0 to 7 zoom level, will display country 702, and to 8 to 10 zoom level,
It will show state 704 and 706.Therefore, in zoom level 7, map will show the geographical location of country 702.However, if user will
Map is amplified to zoom level 8, then map is divided into the geographical location corresponding to state 704 and 706, rather than country 702.Such as
Map is presented with zoom level 11 and 12 in fruit, and map is divided into geographical location at county level, such as county 708 and 710.Similarly, exist
Zoom level 13 and 14, map are divided into city-level geographical location, such as city 718 and city 720.Although Fig. 7 illustrates only scaling
Grade 0 is to zoom level 14, but disclosed system is not limited to any fixedly scaling number of degrees.It is thus possible to increase higher scaling
Grade and intermediate zoom level, depending on can be used for the Information Granularity of map to be shown.
The hierarchical structure tree in geographical location can be designed, so that all geographical locations in same level structural class occur
Within the scope of same zoom level.For example, tree 700 is presented to same zoom level (such as scaling 8- scaling 10), all state grades
Geographical location occurs, and in scaling 11 and scaling 12, the hierarchical structure that all geographical locations at county level occur.
However, it is possible to generate the hierarchical structure tree in geographical location, so as to specific zoom level only specific hierarchical structure etc.
The subset of grade occurs.For example, in zoom level 11, county 814 and 816 is rendered as by map in the hierarchical structure tree 800 of Fig. 8
Unique geographical location, and it is not rendered as unique geographical location in zoom level 11, county 810 and county 812.Therefore, in scaling etc.
Father's hierarchical structure grade (such as state 802) in county 810 and 812, rather than county 810 and 812 will be presented in grade 11.Similarly, it is contracting
Grade 13 is put, city 818 will be presented, without city 820 is presented, until zoom level 14.Therefore, the layer presented in tree 800
Under level structure, at least some available zoom levels, map will be in the unique geographical location for being now in different levels structural class.
However, according on one side, father position can be divided into all available sub- positions of next hierarchical structure grade by disclosed system
It sets., can be by the every other county in state 802, including county for example, once county 810 is rendered as unique geographical location by map
812, it is rendered as unique geographical location.Therefore, in zoom level 12, at county level geographical location of the state 802 completely by being located in state 802
Replace.
It need not there are hierarchical structure grades to each geographical location.For example, although county 810 is divided into city 818 and city
819, but county 816 can not have city-level geographical location associated there.Therefore, in zoom level 13 and 14, map can be with
Continue county 816 being rendered as unique geographical unit, even if other counties are divided into city level position.In addition, although in figures 7 and 8
Four hierarchical structure grades are illustrated only, but any number of hierarchical structure grades can be used in disclosed system.For example, level knot
Structure may include the continent or subcontinent in the father geographical location as country level geographic position.Similarly, hierarchical structure can be after
It is continuous that city-level geographical location is divided into more boy position, such as local level and block level position.In this way, user can be after
Continuous enlarged map, to receive cartographic information with any granularity existing for cartographic information.
According to the one aspect of the technology, disclosed system can be according to the division ground of multiple and different hierarchical structures
Figure, each hierarchical structure include diverse geographic location type set.For example, the first hierarchical structure may include corresponding to state, county,
The geographical location of city and block grade, and the second hierarchical structure may include corresponding to state, congressional district and elections at the basic level cell
Geographical location grade.In addition, the diverse geographic location in specific map may include diverse geographic location type set.For example, ground
Figure may include America & Canada, divide the U.S. using Canadian location type set is different from.Specifically, based on ground
Area, province, administrative area and block hierarchical structure, Canada is divided in map, and the U.S. is divided into the layer of state, county and block
Level structure.Therefore, in geographical location shown in country variant, consistency is not needed.However, in the one aspect of the technology
In, adjustable zoom ranges so as in particular country keep hierarchical structure grade consistency.
Fig. 1 is returned to, server apparatus 110 can store position hierarchical structure data 119 and map rendering data 117.Position
Setting hierarchical structure data 119 may include the list in geographical location associated with one or more maps.According on one side,
Server apparatus 110 can be by selecting from the list in geographical location, Lai Shengcheng geographic hierarchy structure, such as above-mentioned 700 He of tree
800.When selection is by the geographical location in geographic hierarchy structure is included in, which type server apparatus 110 can determine
Geographical location be suitable for specific application.It is, for example, possible to use different levels structures, and census data is presented to show
Map, the map in the geographical location instead of photo is presented.
In generating geographic hierarchy structure, for any or most maps zoom level, server apparatus 110 can be from
It will be selected in the geographical location for covering all or most of viewport.Particularly, server apparatus 110 can be generated by next stage
Position completely or substantially covers the hierarchical structure in each father geographical location, the little or no overlapping between sub- position.This can
To be known as splitting and cover hierarchical structure, wherein have between each father position and its all sub- position close to one-to-one correspondence and close
System.
Hierarchical structure is split and covered by generating, the map letter that can be divided into unique grain size category can be presented for user
Breath.For example, cartographic information shown in Fig. 5 can be subdivided into data at county level shown in Fig. 6.If position creation at county level and section
One-to-one relationship more than roller can then merge the census data in the county for all Colorado, so as on the whole
Generate the census data for being used for the state of Colorado.
In the hierarchical structure for generating geographical location, various forms of data, including postal service are can be used in disclosed system
Address and geological information.For example, postal address is hierarchical structure form, wherein lists province, administrative area and city in some countries.
In another example, server apparatus 110 can the geometry in more each geographical location determine which sub- geographical location
Split and cover father geographical location.Which repeatable position server apparatus 110, which can also detect, is present in potential geographic hierarchy knot
In structure.In this example, a geographical location in hierarchical structure can be excluded, is especially still being covered by remaining geographical location
It covers in the example of the map.
As described above, disclosed system can choose one of the geographic hierarchy structure that specific zoom level will be shown or
Multiple grades.For example, as shown in FIG. 7 and 8, the zoom level of particular range is specified in each geographical location.The range of zoom level
Can the shapes and sizes based on the geographical location being present in the hierarchical structure and be determined.Specifically, it can choose scaling
The range of grade, so that map viewport shows an appropriate number of geographical location, or so as to all geographical positions of appropriately sized display
It sets.For example, can choose the range of zoom level shown in Fig. 7 and 8, so that the number in geographical location shown in viewport will
Always between 10 and 100.
In another example, can size and viewport based on geographical location size ratio, determine zoom level
Range.The not homometric(al) of geographical location size can be used.For example, size can height based on the gross area or geographical location and
The independent of width compares.To each zoom level, the pixel size ratio between geographical location and viewport can be compared.Based on this ratio
Compared with then it is determined that showing the lowest scale grade in geographical location, and the highest zoom level in geographical location should be shown.
In one example, highest zoom level can correspond to 40% geographical location of the area without departing from viewport, and most low-shrinkage
Putting grade can correspond at least 1% geographical location of viewport area.It is then possible to compare the zoom ranges of father and son position
To determine zoom level boundary appropriate that map will change between father and son.
In some instances, all sub- positions of particular parent position will have the highest scaling etc. less than or equal to father position
The lowest scale grade of grade.In this case, which can be identified as zoom level boundary most lower than father position
High zoom level and be higher than for all sub- positions all lowest scale grades any zoom level between.However,
In the case of other, at least some highest zoom levels that will be above father position of the lowest scale grade of sub- position.In these realities
In example, geographical location can be shown, even if current zoom level is except the range in the geographical location of zoom level.For example,
Disclosed system can be by some percentage of true position of stator by the zoom level within the scope of their zoom level, really
Fixed appropriate zoom level boundary.Specifically, zoom level boundary can be determined as to zoom level at or greater than sub- position
The point of the 80% of lowest scale grade.In another example, scaling can be determined based on the area ratio of the father position in viewport
Class boundaries.For example, even if all sub- positions not in their lowest scale grade, can also cover viewport in father position
80% or more point at generate zoom level boundary.In another example, zoom level boundary can be limited, so that will show
At most make a reservation for multiple sub- positions out, such as 200.It in this example, can if father position includes to exceed to make a reservation for multiple sub- positions
To show all sub- positions of father position simultaneously not in same viewport.In another example, it can choose zoom level boundary,
So that at least one zoom level exists, wherein certain types of all geographical locations are assigned to the zoom level.Example
Such as, specific zoom level may exist, wherein all states in the U.S. are assigned to the specific zoom level.Show except above-mentioned
Exception, can be with the top layer of any geographic hierarchy structure of minimum available zoom level (for example, scaling 0) display, and leaf geography position
(such as without those of any child geographical location) is set to show continuation with highest zoom level.Scaling etc. described above
The exemplary various combination of grade boundary can be used in and generate in specific map.
In another aspect, by with for specifying the geographical location of viewport dynamically outline map, can choose by
The geographical location shown in map.Correspond to center in the center and hierarchical structure of viewport for example, can identify
Potential geographical location.Then, potential geographical location is determined which potential geographical location has most compared with current viewport
Close to the area of the estimated rate of current viewport area.Then, the geographical location is selected, with near selected geographical location one
Play display.For example, estimated rate can be 1/9, so that selected geographical location will be had in potential geographical location closest to view
The position of 1/9 area of open area.Quilt can also be gone out from hierarchical structure hierarchical selection identical with the first selected geographical location
Select all neighbouring positions in geographical location.However, it is possible to determine to one or more neighbouring positions, if different layers should be used
Level structure grade.Specifically, it may determine whether to show more or less positions in viewport.If viewport includes too many
The father position of neighbouring position then can be used in position.Similarly, if viewport include very little position, can be used one or
The sub- position of multiple neighbouring positions.
