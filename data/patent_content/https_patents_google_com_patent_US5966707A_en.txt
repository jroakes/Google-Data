- DMS functions and utilities include an API, and a a complete set of functions based on a PFVL paradigm. PFVL paradigm calls are mapped into DataManager(s)/Control Repository calls.
- the client/server interface is a common interface to a enterprise Client/Server network, and may be reduced in size for acting for a co-resident client/server.
- the data repository is an aggregation of disparate data storage engines.
- a package manager tailors the control repository and provides methodology customization with package, variance, filetype, level granularity.
- Adaptation of the DMS to a user environment is accomplished through a single architectural layer. This allows the architectural core, including all the transactions and functions encompassed therein to remain methodology and environmentally independent.
- Our DMS allows applications to remain methodology independent through the use of a standardized application program interface.
- User interfaces can be constructed to customize the same DMS application several different ways to conform to user methodologies.
- our invention teaches an alternative method for implementing applications using easily customizable state tables.
- Our Client/Server Interface allows the elements of the DMS to interact locally in a client-only environment or via a client / server connection.
- the client/server implementation can be achieved in a Local Area Network, Wide Area Network or a globally distributed environment such as the internet.
- Scalability of the DMS is achieved through the use of configurable Managers which can be switched on or off depending on the needs of the users. Since all the Managers conform to the PFVL Paradigm and follow a standardized application program interface, new Managers can be added to the system without the need to reconstruct or alter the existing DMS.
- the physical implementation of the DMS is described in two sections which deal with the Data and Control Repositories separately.
- the Data Repository may be implemented using a plurality of means ranging from simple file systems to commercially available Product Data Management (PDM) systems such as RCS, Sherpa, MetaPhase, etc.
- PDM Product Data Management
- the data can be physically located in a single storage medium such as a hard disk, local file system, or server, or distributed throughout a plethora of storage media scattered geographically.
- the centralized Control Repository can be implemented using several approaches, including but not limited to, relational or object oriented databases, flat files, meta data files or table formatted files.
- This disclosure describes the use of Command Translators which map generic Control Repository transactions to the appropriate access method corresponding to the physical implementation. This approach permits the information in the Control Repository to be migrated between different physical implementations. It even allows multiple physical implementations to act as a single logical Control Repository.
- FIG. 1 depicts the overall architecture of the preferred embodiment.
- the entire DMS architecture is based on the PFVL paradigm, illustrated in FIG. 2, which allows the DMS to be environment and methodology independent. All interfaces into the DMS use a standard PFVL based API which provides the flexibility to use a common DMS across several similar or disparate user groups. For example, this system could be used to manage the data for both the electrical and mechanical components in an automobile company.
- FIG. 2A illustrates the PFVL paradigm through the use of a multidimensional symbol such as a cube.
- the present invention teaches the notion that all objects resides in a Data Management System can be classified according to five basic attributes:
- Package An arbitrary grouping of data objects that has some relationship. or common bond with each other. Each package contains one or more variances.
- Variance One or more objects within a package that, when combined with the remaining objects in the same Variance or from one or more dependent Variances, comprise a coherent and meaningful collection of objects.
- Filetype A collection of objects sharing the same data type or format.
- FIG. 2A depicts Package "A" (20) comprised of two Variances. Within each Variance are one or more data objects (21) of a given Filetype, residing at one or more Levels, with one or more Versions of the object. In the simplest case, a single Version of a single Filetype exists at a single Level within a single Variance of a single Package. Our invention achieves tremendous flexibility by allowing any of these attributes to be expanded n ways. By varying the dimensions of the cube, and the number of cubes in the Package, one can create a DMS capable of managing data in almost any environment.
- the present invention also permits Packages to be arranged hierarchically. This is illustrated at the bottom of FIG. 2A where Package "A" (20) is embedded within a higher level Package (22).
- the higher level Package may also contain its own data objects (21) as shown in the figure. This is possible because each Package in the hierarchy has its own set of PFVL attributes.
- a printed circuit board could be considered a high level Package comprised of various ASICs, resistors, capacitors and connectors.
- the ASICs on the board could be considered Packages themselves, where each ASIC Package is comprised of the underlying circuit designs.
- FIG. 2B contemplates two examples of how the PFVL Paradigm can be implemented in actual applications.
- the first table (23) demonstrates a typical electrical engineering design environment comprised of design objects dispersed in the DMS.
- the primary design object is an MPEG design consisting of multiple versions of a schematic residing in the "dsgn -- lib" design library. This library also contains a VHDL object for the MPEG design. It can also be seen that the dsgn -- lib library contains two Levels, Test and Prod. Versions of the MPEG schematic simultaneously exist at both Levels. Most of the objects are classified under the Universal Serial Bus (USB) Variance, except for a PCI Variant of the MPEG schematic.
- USB Universal Serial Bus
- the second DMS Table (24) in FIG. 2B shows how the same PFVL paradigm can be used to track objects and sub-assemblies in an automotive environment.
- Packages are used to denote the Cooling and Engine sub-assemblies as well as the Electro-Mechanical main assembly.
- Within each sub-assembly are one or more components described in the form of schematics, layouts and VHDL, and residing at quality levels QA1, and QA2. Also, some components exist under distinct Variances in order to accommodate two different automobile models.
- the top layer is the User Interface Layer (10).
- This layer makes possible such scenarios as sharing electrical and mechanical design information by acting as an environmental adapter.
- An example of such an adaptation is present in a large electronic design organization where several design groups need to share data among several libraries.
- a common DMS application in this scenario would be a Check-In operation which allows data to enter the DMS from a user's private work space. Since the DMS accommodates several design groups using numerous libraries, the DMS Check-In application's API requires one of the invocation parameters to be the Package.
- the User Interface Layer may employ a local "wrapper" or user utility which only requires the user to enter the name and type of design object being checked in. This wrapper then passes this information to the DMS Check-In application. It also supplies the sole library name as the Package as well as a hard-coded Level and Variance.
- the User Interface Layer can employ several methods such as, but not restricted to, wrappers, shell scripts, batch files, command line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, web browsers, menus, or voice activated systems, which would be customized to the user's environment or methodology.
- wrappers shell scripts
- batch files command line interfaces
- graphical user interfaces graphical user interfaces
- web browsers web browsers
- menus or voice activated systems
- our preferred embodiment contemplates the use of several layers which comprise the core architecture of the DMS. Spanning three of the layers are the DMS Managers (11). These are comprised of a plurality of functions, some of which belong to the DMS Application, Client/Server and Control Repository Access layers. By grouping these functions into isolated Managers with standardized interfaces, a great deal of modularity is achieved. Furthermore, these functions can be combined to form larger, more complex, applications. Consider the following portion of an example promotion application which illustrates one way to deploy a modular DMS:
- Manager functions are invoked to perform the necessary DMS operations. By combining these functions together in an algorithmic way, one can achieve highly complex DMS applications. Furthermore, one can see how modularity can be achieved using the if statements to test the Control Repository for existence of a particular Manager. This permits Managers to be installed or configured in a "plug-n-play" manner simply by setting switches in the Control Repository.
- a DMS vendor or supplier could then construct customized DM systems based on the customer's needs, simply by linking together the required modules. For example, customer A may only require basic data management services so the DMS provider would only link the object code from the Library, Package and Lock Managers into a "lite" version of the DMS. Customer B, on the other hand, may require use of applications involving aggregations (configurations) and Library Processing. This customer's DMS would link the object code from the Library, Package, Lock, Aggregation and Process Managers. Regardless of the implementation method, one skilled in the art can clearly envision the advantages afforded by such a system since enhancements or changes to functions in one Manager don't require the entire DMS to be re-compiled, or redistributed.
- FIG. 1 also depicts the DMS Applications layer (12) which contains all the standard utilities that a user needs in order to interact with the DMS. This includes things like Check-In, Check-Out, Promotion, Locking, Library Searching, creating and tracking an aggregation or configuration, and setting or viewing process results. These utilities are described further is this disclosure as either functions residing within a particular Manager, or applications which consist of one or more functions, confined to a single Manager or involving a plurality of Managers. All functions and applications within this layer follow a consistent, standardized Application Program Interface which allows them to remain isolated from any user environment or methodology. This feature of the invention allows a single DMS to be deployed through several user groups performing similar or disparate work, yet having the need to share data between them.
- DMS Applications layer contains all the standard utilities that a user needs in order to interact with the DMS. This includes things like Check-In, Check-Out, Promotion, Locking, Library Searching, creating and tracking an aggregation or configuration, and setting or viewing process results.
- These utilities are described
- All functions and applications communicate with the Control and Data Repositories through the Client/Server Interface (13) layer.
- This is an expandable or contractible layer designed to allow either communication between the various layers in a client-only environment or between clients and one or more servers existing anywhere in a global enterprise.
- the same set of Manager functions, DMS applications and Control Repository Access routines are utilized regardless of the client/server topology.
- Control Repository Access Layer consists of one or more "transactions" which perform simple or complex operations against the Control Repository (CR) itself. These can typically be categorized as adding information to the CR, modifying existing information in the CR, deleting information from the CR, or extracting (and potentially filtering) information out of the CR. Regardless of the type of operation, all transactions in this layer are written as if the Control Repository is a single virtual repository consisting of tables organized around the PFVL paradigm. This approach allows different physical implementations of the Control Repository. It even permits a plurality of physically different implementations to appear as a single virtual Control Repository.
- Our invention further contemplates a virtual Data Repository (15) comprised of one or more physical repositories.
- the underlying repositories can be a simple file management system such as the Distributed File System (DFS) or a simple directory structure organized on a hard or floppy disk.
- the data repository could be constructed using proprietary or commercially available storage engines or PDM products such as RCS, Sherpa, MetaPhase, SCCS, CMVC, and ClearCase.
- the present invention permits Automated Library Machines, such as those disclosed in P0996-0010 to be employed as Data Repositories. As shown in FIG. 1, all communication with the Data Repository is performed through the Client/Server Interface layer, which permits the Data Repository to be locally accessible to the client, or distributed anywhere in the global enterprise on a remotely accessible server.
- FIG. 3 depicts a complex Data Repository comprised of Data Repository A (30) which is a simple unix directory where the files in the DMS may reside. Additional data may be stored in Data Repository B (31) which is a commercially available PDM such as RCS or Sherpa. Although these storage engines automatically handle revision control whenever a user checks data into or out of the system, the preferred embodiment maintains it's own unique file identifier in the form of a File Reference number within the Control Repository.
- Data Repository C could be a physical location on a server accessible via a Universal Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).
- URL Universal Resource Locator
- the PFVL Paradigm serves as the common storage model such that any client (33) can interact with the data. Furthermore, data is directed to the appropriate Data Repository through the use of the Data Repository Table (34). It clearly illustrates how the PFVL attributes can be used in any combination to segregate the data into one or more physical repositories.
- Repository B represents one of the commercial revision control engines such as RCS or Sherpa. Wiring Layouts for the Rel -- 1 Level of the Base Variant of the MPEG design library are stored in a DFS directory represented by Repository A, and customer documentation for the MPEG design is stored in a publicly accessible URL represented by Repository C.
- Control Repository (17) which can be implemented using a multitude of methods, including, but not limited to, Table Formatted Files, Relational or Object Oriented Databases, or Meta-Data files in any format.
- Our invention also permits one or more of the above implementations to be used simultaneously to comprise a single virtual Control Repository. Regardless of the physical implementation of the Control Repository, all information is organized under the PFVL paradigm such that any entry in the repository directly or indirectly maps to one or more PFVLs. This permits users to access information about any object residing in any Package or library, at any Level or Variance regardless of whether that piece of information exists in a relational database, a simple ASCII file or a binary encoded MetaData file. Information can be freely reorganized or transplanted between different Control Repository implementations without the need to modify any DMS Applications, Manager functions or Control Repository Access transactions. Tables support underlying Manager functions and DMS Applications.
- a key player in enabling the aforementioned feature are the Command Translators (16) which interface between the Control Repository Access Layer and the Control Repository (17).
- Each physical implementation of the Control Repository would employ a unique Command Translator to map the generic Control Repository Access transaction into the appropriate command to satisfy the physical repository.
- a relational database may be able to accept the Control Repository Access transaction "as is" or with a simple syntax modification while a binary encoded MetaData file would require a function capable of parsing and manipulating the MetaData file.
- this approach also enables a great deal of flexibility in upgrading the Control Repositories or permitting data from disparate sources to appear as one logical repository.
- a SQL database may be employed as the primary Control Repository which includes all information necessary to track each object in the DMS by File Reference, PFVL, physical location, etc.
- This repository may also contain a Part Number table for all the manufactured pieces of a product.
- PFVL File Reference
- This repository may also contain a Part Number table for all the manufactured pieces of a product.
- a Lotus Notes database containing service call or defect repair information organized by Part Number for the same product.
- Our invention would allow Control Repository Access transactions to be written, using an identical SQL-like syntax, to extract design information about the part from the SQL database and repair actions from the Lotus Note database.
- the Command Translators would be responsible for mapping the generic transaction for the design information into a true SQL, command, and mapping the repair action transaction into a Notes transaction.
- Our invention contemplates an architectural layer dedicated to the various DMS Functions and Utilities that a user invokes to manipulate the Data Management System.
- Common functions found in this layer include, but aren't limited to, Check-In, Check-Out, Promote, Setting Locks, Checking authorities, etc.
- API application program interface
- FIG. 4 conveys the preferred embodiment of this layer.
- the DMS Applications Layer (41) is comprised of all the applications that enable a user to interact directly with-the DMS.
- Each application consists of one or more application modules (42) which may or may not interact with the various Managers (44).
- FIG. 4 depicts various scenarios involving the interaction with the application modules:
- Non-Manager Interaction An application may desire to interface directly to the Control Repository (46) without the need to interact with any Managers.
- An example might be a function which extracts project management data from the Control Repository and displays it in a formatted report.
- An application may only need to interface with a single Manager in order to execute all the steps in the application's algorithm. For example, an application which associates an object to a problem fix number only requires functions within the Problem Fix/EC/PN Manager.
- a promotion algorithm may interface with the Authority Manager to determine if the user has the proper promote authorization. Next, it may execute Process Manager functions to determine if the object meets the necessary promotion criteria. Finally, it may interface with the Library Manager to perform the actual promotion to the next level.
- Control Repository Coupled with Manager Interaction Any combination of the above methods may be used to construct an application which interacts with one or more Managers in addition to the Control Repository. For instance, an application may query the Control Repository to see which Managers are currently installed in a user environment, and use that information to branch through various parts of the algorithm which interface with the Managers.
- FIG. 4 depicts one or more Manager Functions (43) which combine to form a library of utilities upon which applications can be constructed.
- the Problem Fix/EC/PN Manager contains:
- FIG. 4 also depicts an Application Program Interface (40) common to all applications and functions In the DMS Application Layer.
- the API is based on the PFVL paradigm. By requiring all the functions to conform to the PFVL paradigm they remain methodology independent while retaining the flexibility to be adapted to any user environment through the use of the User Interface Layer.
- Our preferred embodiment requires all functions in this layer to be invoked by passing package, file type, variance, and level as the minimum amount of information. Additional information such as filename, iteration, or run-time options may also be supplied.
- Our embodiment also permits the wildcard character (*) to be used on any combination of PFVL attributes. For instance, if a wildcard is passed in place of the level, then all information matching the remaining PFVL attributes at all levels is accessable.
- the wildcard can be combined with a partial PFVL attribute in a similar manner.
- a level attribute of prod* would access all information matching the remaining PFVLs at any level beginning with prod.
- a placeholder such as the percent (%) character can be used to ignore any attribute.
- Certain DMS applications may not require information regarding all the PFVL attributes, so use of the % character allows every DMS application to use an identical API to facilitate interaction with the user environment. For example, the following API could be used to interface with all DMS applications regardless of their underlying function:
- the user interface layer can suppress or hard-code them prior to invoking the underlying DMS application.
- a user environment may exist such that variances aren't applicable and data only resides in two levels of a single package (library).
- the current process only permits users to check data into the DMS at the lowest level.
- the corresponding user interface may be a simple menu where the only two fields the user enters are the file name and file type.
- the underlying user interface code would automatically pass the sole package and level, and hard-code or suppress the variance to the DMS check-in API.
- the advantage to the present invention is in the event the process changes to allow users to perform additional actions, such as checking data into the second level, only the user interface needs to be updated Neither the underlying DMS applications nor the information in the Control Repository need to be updated.
- Our invention permits any combination of these functions, or any other functions in this or any other Manager, to be referenced by any application or by other functions in this or any other Manager.
- the modularity afforded by this approach results in novel implementation techniques.
- the present invention allows the various steps of our promotion algorithm to be broken down into modular pieces of code whereby some constitute Manager Functions while others comprise the promotion application.
- the Manager Functions tend to be small enough to lend themselves to conventional procedural programming techniques, the application code itself may or may not.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B describe an alternative method using state tables.
- FIG. 5A shows an example promotion algorithm implemented using State Table (51) which is comprised of 12 steps. This table illustrates a full promotion where each step interacts with one or more Manager functions, including steps 6, 7 and 9 which interact with the Process Manager to invoke Library Processing. Each step has 2 Next State columns associated with it.
- the primary Next State column (labeled GOOD), indicates the next step which should be undertaken if the result of the present step is successful.
- the secondary Next State column (labeled BAD) indicates the state transition if the present step results in an unacceptable result.
- State Table (52) illustrates the ease by which the promotion application can be updated to eliminate the Library Processing. This is accomplished by simply changing the Next State columns for steps 4, 5 and 8. to bypass steps 6, 7 and 9.
- State Table (53) in FIG. 5B, demonstrates how the DMS application can be modified to completely omit steps 6, 7 & 9 and renumber the remaining steps for simplicity.
- the present invention contemplates the use of a Client/Server Interface embedded between the DMS Application and Control Repository Access layers. All communication between the DMS applications and the Control Repository functions is performed through special interface routines. These routines are responsible for locating the proper Control Repository, making the connection, and passing the appropriate information to the underlying Control Repository Access function. This feature allows a completely scalable DMS ranging from a low-end DMS where the Control Repository is directly accessible from the user's client to a high-end enterprise DMS where the Control Repository can be literally spread across a plurality of worldwide servers. For the low-end implementation, the client/server routines simply pass the required information from the DMS application to the CR Access function, much like a parent module invoking an external function or subroutine. In the high-end scenario, the routine would locate the server where the appropriate CR resides, make the appropriate connection and pass the information to the CR function.
- the client/server interface In addition to controlling the interface between the DMS applications and Control Repository, the client/server interface also controls access to the Data Repository.
- a low-end system may exist whereby the data resides in a file system directly updatable by the user's client. For example, during a Check-In process, the client would physically copy the data from the source location to the actual data repository. This could be accomplished by providing write access to the data repository for all users, or writing a client/server routine which utilizes techniques such as Unix setuid bits to ensure that data can only be written to the repository via the proper DMS applications.
- the client/server routines could establish a connection with the server where the data repository resides and employ the server to perform the appropriate file operation. This implementation lends itself to a more secure DMS since access to the data repository can be very tightly controlled, and user clients can not directly update the data repository outside of the DMS either intentionally or accidentally.
- the DMS applications (12) and the Various Managers (11) as well as the Control Repository Interface (14) all communicate with the Data Repository (15) and the Control Repository (17) via the Client/Server Interface (13).
- This interface is depicted in FIG. 7, where the DMS applications, the various Mangers and the CR interface layer is shown (71).
- the respective Communications Services (72) are invoked.
- These services support a variety of protocols including but not limited to those depicted in the (73) layer.
- Some of these services communicated either directly to the Data Servers (75), through the network and or the severs depicted at the (74) layer.
- Automated Library Machines are employed in a "batch" environment which permits a large number of DMS operations to be queued and processed by these virtual machines.
- the Client/Server routines are responsible for creating work requests on the user's client and transmitting them to the appropriate ALM for processing.
- Use of ALMs also provides the advantage of breaking up large complex DMS applications into foreground and background pieces.
- the foreground portion runs on the user's client, then a work request is created and transmitted to the ALM through the Client/Server Interface.
- the ALM processes the background portion of the DMS operation, including all file manipulations. Since the foreground portion tends to comprise a series of checks as opposed to intensive computing, improved client throughput can be achieved by offloading the more compute intensive portions of the DMS application to the ALM.
- Control Repository Access Layer comprised of a library of functions or transactions which extract, add, modify or delete information from the Control Repository.
- DMS Application Layer There are two main advantages to separating this code from the functions comprising the DMS Application Layer:
- the API call is represented (81).
- the state table (82) is used to convert the API call into invocations of the Authority Manager File Authority Check (83) and the Lock Manager SetLock (84) routines.
- FIG. 9 depicts the Control Repository Interface (CRI) call (91) employed by the Authority Manager to perform the File Authority Check. This in generates the SQL transaction (92).
- FIG. 9a depicts the CRI call (93) employed by the Lock Manager to perform the lock set. This generates a sequence of three SQL transactions (95). It should be noted that all CRI calls are atomic, i.e. All SQL transactions in a CRI call must complete successfully. If one transaction fails, all previously completed transactions are backed out.
- CRI Control Repository Interface
- Control Repository Access functions to be written in a common generic form, adhering to the fundamental concept that all Control Repository information is organized in virtual tables. This also holds true for transactions that reference information residing in a Control Repository which is not physically implemented using tables.
- the Command Translators serve as the interface to the physical embodiments of the Control Repository.
- FIG. 6 depicts a scenario where the virtual Control Repository is physically comprised of a SQL database (65) and an encrypted metadata file (66).
- Command Translator A (62) simply passes the generic SQL-based transaction (61) to the SQL database after a simple modification into a true SQL transaction (64).
- transactions destined for the meta-data file are sent to Command Translator B (63).
- the met-data file is parsed using the proper decryption technique to locate the data that maps to the generic Control Repository information contained in the transaction.
- the new information is encrypted and embedded in the appropriate position within the file.
- This architectural approach permits information residing in existing meta-data, or non-DMS data-bases to be included as part of the centralized DMS Control Repository by simply writing a command translator to perform the mapping between the generic (repository independent) transaction and the interface to the physical repository.
Abstract
Description
______________________________________ if (Lock.sub.-- Manager.sub.-- Installed) { query Control Repository for any locks that exist on the file if (locks.sub.-- exist) fail the promote } if (Authority.sub.-- Manager.sub.-- Installed) { query Control Repository to see if user has authority to do the promote if (user.sub.-- not.sub.-- authorized) fail the promote. } if (Process.sub.-- Manager.sub.-- installed) { query Control Repository to see if any Library Processes need to run if (library.sub.-- processes.sub.-- exist) invoke them and wait for completion } Check Promotion Criteria Tell Control Repository to update level of the file Perform necessary update to data repository (move file, update link, ______________________________________ etc.)
