Embodiment
Content item can present in the various contexts on being included in mobile device display.Some content items (for example, advertisement) can (for example, as the part of webpage or mobile application interface) be included with the demonstration of other content.Because the screen size of mobile device is less and the characteristic of mobile device, the viewing content item and with the interaction of content item may be very difficult.Interactive content item is provided, and this interactive content item is inputted according to different users and is carried out different content item actions.Therefore, the behavior of content item can change based on the user's input that is associated with content item.
Although the below describes for ad system and method, according to following detailed description, can manage, present and follow the tracks of the content of other form, the content of this other form comprises the broadcast contents of other form (sponsored content).
Fig. 1 is the block scheme that exemplary contents presents system 100.In some implementations, directly or indirectly input in Advertising Management System 104 of one or more advertisers 102, maintenance and tracking advertising message.Although describe for advertisement, the content of other form also can be sent by system 100, comprises the broadcast contents of other form.The form of described advertisement can be the graphical advertisement such as Banner, the one or more advertisement during only any this class of text advertisements, image ad, bar code advertisement, audio advertisement, video ads, animated advertising, combination forms etc.Advertisement can also comprise embedding information, metamessage and/or the machine-executable instruction such as link.One or more publishers 106 can be to the request of Advertising Management System 104 submissions for advertisement.Advertising Management System 104 by sending to request publisher 106 that advertisements respond so that arrangement or be associated with one or more publishers' content item (for example, webpage characteristic).The example web page characteristic can comprise webpage, TV and blurbing time slot or print media space.
Other entity such as user 108 and advertiser 102 can provide use information to Advertising Management System 104, for example, such as whether the conversion relevant with advertisement (for example, purchase or other interaction) having occured or clicked (for example, the user has selected advertisement).This use information comprises the user behavior measured or that observe relevant with advertisement that experiences (serve).Advertising Management System 104 can be carried out financial transaction, for example, charges to publisher's 106 book keeping operations and to advertiser 102 based on described use information.
Network 110 links to each other with advertiser 102, Advertising Management System 104, publisher 106 and user 108, the combination of these network 110 all in this way LAN (Local Area Network) (LAN), wide area network (WAN), internet, one or more telephone network or above-mentioned network.
An example published person 106 is general content server, this general content server for content (for example receives, article, discussion thread, music, video, figure, Search Results, web page listings, information feedback etc.) request, and obtain the content of asking in response to this request.Content server can be submitted request for advertisement to the Advertisement Server in the Advertising Management System 104.Ad-request can comprise the advertisement of a plurality of expectations.Ad-request can also comprise content request message.This information (for example can comprise content itself, the content of the page, video broadcasting, radio station show or other type), with described in classification corresponding to perhaps described content requests (for example, art, commerce, computing machine, art film, arts-music etc.), partly or entirely content requests, content age, content type (for example, text, figure, video, audio frequency, mixed-media etc.), geographical location information etc.
In some implementations, the one or more advertisements in the advertisement that the content of asking and Advertising Management System 104 are provided of content server or client browser are made up.Content after the combination and advertisement can be sent out/be rendered into request content so that the user 108 who in reader (for example, browser or other content display system), presents.Content server can return Advertisement Server with the communication about advertisement, comprise (for example, with HTML or JavaScript) how, when describe and/where play up the information of advertisement.
Another example published person 106 is search services.Search service can receive the inquiry for Search Results.As response, described search service can be obtained relevant Search Results from the index of document the index of webpage (for example, from).Search Results for example can comprise web page title tabulation, the text fragments that extracts and to the hypertext link of these webpages from these webpages, and can be grouped into predetermined number (for example, 10) Search Results.
Search service can be to the request of Advertising Management System 104 submissions for advertisement.Described request can comprise the advertisement of a plurality of expectations.This number can be such as the screen or the amount of page space, the size and dimension of advertisement etc. that depend on Search Results, occupied by Search Results.Request for advertisement can also comprise (as input or parse) inquiry, based on the information (whether coming from the identifier of branch offices (affiliate) and this branch offices such as geographical location information, inquiry) of inquiry, and/or be associated with Search Results or based on the information of Search Results.This information for example (for example can comprise the identifier relevant with Search Results, document identifier or " docID "), the score relevant with Search Results (for example, acquisition of information (" IR ") score), the fragment of the text that extracts from the document that identifies (for example, webpage), the full text text of the document that identifies, the proper vector of the document that identifies etc.In some implementations, the IR score is such as basis and dot product, page rank score and/or the IR score of inquiry and document characteristic of correspondence vector and the calculating such as combination of page rank score.
In some implementations, Advertising Management System 104 can select advertisement from advertisement 102 with auction process.For example, can allow advertiser 102 to select or quotation for advertisement present at every turn or and advertisement between interaction (for example, clicking), advertiser 102 is ready the price paid, for example, each clicking cost amount of money of advertiser's payment when the user clicks advertisement.This each clicking cost can comprise maximum each clicking cost, and for example, for each click of advertisement being carried out based on keyword (for example, the one or more words in the inquiry), the advertiser is ready the maximum dollar amount paid.Yet, also can use other quotation type.Based on these quotations, the advertisement of can selecting and sort is in order to present.
One or more combinations in the advertisement that search service can provide Search Results and Advertising Management System 104.Subsequently, the information after this combination can be forwarded to the user 108 of request content.Search Results can differently be safeguarded with advertisement, does not obscure thereby can not allow the user produce between the intermediate search results of the advertisement of having paid and supposition.
In some implementations, one or more publishers 106 are to the request of Advertising Management System 104 submissions for advertisement.Advertising Management System 104 sends advertisement in order to be placed on one or more publishers' the webpage characteristic (for example, website and other net distribution content) by the publisher 106 to request, and the advertisement that sends is relevant with this network characteristic.For example, if publisher's 106 issues website relevant with physical culture, then Advertising Management System 104 can provide the advertisement relevant with physical culture to publisher 106.In some implementations, by when the webpage with the publisher is loaded on the client device, carry out particular script (for example, JavaScript), can for carry out request by the equipment that is associated with user 108.
Another example published person 106 is mobile application developer.The mobile application is that specialized designs is come the application in the upper operation of mobile device (for example, smart phone).This moves application can also comprise the advertisement that is placed in the mobile content of using.Be similar to above-mentioned publisher 106, when the user accesses mobile the application (for example, when the mobile specific webpage of using is loaded on the mobile device), can receive described advertisement in order to be placed on mobile the application from Advertising Management System 104.
Fig. 2 is the block scheme be used to the example system 200 that interactive type advertisement is provided.System 200 can for example provide interactive type advertisement in order to present to the user to equipment (for example, mobile device).Interactive type advertisement can comprise the advertisement logic, and this advertisement logic receives user's input and/or according to the particular advertisement action that is associated with user's input user's input replied.Advertisement action can comprise the size of adjusting advertisement, present alternative advertisement, open the landing page (landing page), present advertisement options etc.
System 200 comprises can be to the mobile device 202 of user's rendering content.In some implementations, mobile device 202 is cell phone, personal digital assistant, flat computer, Vehicular navigation system or notebook.Although shown is mobile device 202, in some implementations, also can use miscellaneous equipment, for example, laptop computer, desk-top computer, Internet Protocol telephone booth (Internet kiosk), server or the TV with set-top box.Mobile device 202 for example can comprise web browser 204 and one or more application 206, for example, and news application, e-mail applications, game or government utility.
Advertisement presents module 210 can be based on specified criteria, the advertisement of storage and other advertisement in the ad system 208 are (for example in identification and the ordering interactive type advertisement warehouse 212, non-interactive type advertisement), so that with described advertisement and the content of asking and/or request user coupling.For example, advertisement presents module 210 can be based on the keyword that is associated with the corresponding advertisement with the content of asking, identification advertisement (for example, with the keyword coupling in advertisement keyword and the interior perhaps query term of asking), wherein said advertisement will be present in the content of asking.In another example, advertisement presents module 210 and uses and identify advertisement about user's information (for example, subscriber profile information).In another example, advertisement presents module 210 and can send based on the application-specific of request advertisement social networks and use advertisement (product or service that advertisement is noted for the typical user that attracts social networks to use).
The interactive type advertisement of storage can comprise the advertisement logic in the interactive type advertisement warehouse 212, and this advertisement logic allows ad response to input fill order in the user who is associated with the advertisement that presents.For example, the advertisement logic can be adjusted the size of respective advertisement, asks alternative advertisement in order to present, and opens the landing page that is associated with corresponding advertisement, perhaps allows the advertisement setting on the mobile device 202 is configured.The below describes the example action of being carried out by interactive type advertisement in response to input in more detail.
The advertisement 214 that presents can comprise advertisement logic 216.Advertisement logic 216 can receive the input from one or more input pickups 218 (for example, the touch-screen of mobile device), and in response to receiving this input fill order.Advertisement logic 216 can comprise that input mode is to the mapping of the action that is associated with interactive type advertisement.Advertisement logic 216 can be identified the pattern that is associated with the input that receives, and will move and described pattern match with described mapping.For example, advertisement logic 216 with gesture recognition be on the touch-screen user interface from the top of the advertisement 214 that presents to the vertical paddling (swipingmotion) of bottom.For all advertisements of storage in the interactive type advertisement warehouse 212, input mode can be identical to the mapping of interactive type advertisement action.
In one example, input pickup 218 can receive the input from the user of mobile device 202.Mobile device 202 can determine that the input that receives was associated with the advertisement that presents 214.Advertisement logic 216 can receive user's input from input pickup 218, and determines to input the order (for example, adjusting the size of advertisement) that is associated with this user.Advertisement logic 216 can for example be carried out determined order by the size of expanding the advertisement 214 that presents at the display of mobile device 202.
For example, mobile device 202 paddling that can determine to comprise on the touch-screen display of the page that presents in the web browser 204 is intended to this Webpage that rolls downwards.
In another example, mobile device 202 can be associated the touch input from the left side of the advertisement 214 that presents to the right with advertisement logic 216.The touch-screen input pickup can offer mobile device 202 with the positional information of posture on display that detects.Mobile device 202 can be determined the advertisement 214 that presents and be presented at the zone that is associated with this position (for example, in the appointed area about described location advertising) in the display, and detected posture is offered advertisement logic 216.
In some implementations, input pickup 218 can detect a plurality of inputs simultaneously.For example, input pickup 218 can detect selects two buttons simultaneously, perhaps detects a plurality of concurrent touch input to touch-screen.Input pickup 218 can send the keystroke combination to advertisement logic 216, touch the input pattern of combination of gestures or other combination.
Ad system 208 can be followed the tracks of the advertisement that presents at mobile device 202 in one or more advertisement logics 220.Each record in the advertisement logic 220 can comprise each specific timestamp that presents of the advertisement on ad identifier, user's identifier (for example, user identifier, profile identifier, device identifier) for example and/or the mobile device 202.In some implementations, mobile device 202 can send to ad system 208 together with user identifier and content requests.Advertisement logic 220 can be followed the tracks of presenting or the two of the presenting of interactive type advertisement, non-interactive type advertisement.
The advertisement transitional information of the advertisement that presents on the mobile device 202 can be stored in one or more conversion logics 222 on the ad system 208.When ad system 208 detects advertisement when conversion on the mobile device 202, ad system 208 can create or upgrade the record in the conversion logic 22.Conversion logic 222 for example can comprise identifier, user's identifier and the timestamp of conversion.Conversion logic 222 can be followed the tracks of the interactive type advertisement conversion, non-interactive type advertisement is changed or the two.
In one example, the application on the mobile device 202 can be from ad system 208 request advertisements.This application can receive by advertisement and present the interactive type advertisement that module 210 identifies.This interactive type advertisement can be presented on the display of mobile device by this application.Input pickup 218 can receive the input from the user, and mobile device 202 can carry out association with this input and the interactive type advertisement that presents (advertisement 214 that for example, presents).For example, accelerometer can detect the movement of mobile device 202.It is input (for example, rather than the normal movement of mobile device 202) from the user that mobile device 202 can determine that this moves.Mobile device 202 can be determined this input and be associated with interactive type advertisement, rather than operates in another process on the mobile device 202.The embedded advertisements logic that comprises in the interactive type advertisement can the inquiring user input pattern to the mapping of interactive type advertisement action, the action that will carry out with identification.For example, the embedded advertisements logic can be determined this input and is associated with zoom action.When the advertisement logic was determined pattern and is moving up of mobile device 202, the advertisement logic can be expanded this advertisement and/or enlarge this advertisement.When the advertisement logic was determined pattern and is moving down of mobile device 202, the advertisement logic can be dwindled this advertisement, for example, reduce this advertisement size or so that this advertisement minimize.
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram for the exemplary method 300 of carrying out the interactive type advertisement action.Mobile device (for example, mobile device 202) and parts thereof will be used as example in following and mention.Method 300 can or replace mobile device by one or more other systems' combinations and carry out.
Request advertisement (302).For example, mobile device can be from ad system (for example, ad system 208) request advertisement.Mobile device can also with this ad-request simultaneously, ask other content (for example, webpage or application content) from the publisher.Alternatively, mobile device can be from publisher's request content, and this publisher can be from ad system request advertisement.
For example, the application on the mobile device one of (for example, use 206 in) can be from ad system request content (for example, advertisement).In another example, web browser (for example, web browser 204) can be from ad system request advertisement so that (for example, based on the html advertisement script that is loaded in this browser) presents at webpage.In another example, the advertisement logic that is associated with the interactive type advertisement that presents can be determined the user and input indication and replacement advertisement will be presented on request on the mobile device display.The advertisement logic can be from this replacement advertisement of ad system request.
Receive interactive type advertisement (304).For example, advertisement presents module (for example, advertisement presents module 210) and can identify interactive type advertisement and come to provide service for mobile device.Mobile device can receive interactive type advertisement from ad system.
In some implementations, ad system or publisher can make up interactive type advertisement and other content, and the content after will making up offers mobile device.Alternatively, mobile device can receive and the advertisement of combined interaction formula and other content.
Present this interactive type advertisement (306).For example, mobile device can be presented on this interactive type advertisement on the display of touch-screen display for example.This interactive type advertisement can present with other content from ad system or publisher's request.In some implementations, this interactive type advertisement is presented on the display with other content from mobile device, for example, with being presented on the display with the application of this advertisement of request or the content that web browser is associated.
Receive the user's input (308) that is associated with the interactive type advertisement that presents.For example, one or more input pickups (for example, input pickup 218) can receive the input from the user.Mobile device can be determined the input that receives and be associated with this interactive type advertisement.
Mobile device can be determined the input that is received by touch-screen display and be associated with this interactive type advertisement.For example, mobile device can be determined the touch that occurs at display and where is positioned at respect to the position of advertisement on display.If the appointment degree of approach that this touch input occurs in the location advertising on the display is interior (for example, in the border of advertisement or interior at a distance of the specified pixel distance with this advertisement), then mobile device can carry out related with this interactive type advertisement this touch input.Therefore, touch outside the appointment degree of approach of this interactive type advertisement input can be carried out relatedly with other action, and for example, rolling comprises the web page contents of this advertisement.
In another example, mobile device can be determined, when input pickup (for example, trace ball or the button from the mobile device) receives the user and inputs, this interactive type advertisement is highlighted (for example, presenting square frame around this interactive type advertisement).
In some implementations, it is unconnected with another process that operates on the mobile device that mobile device is determined user's input, and carry out related with this interactive type advertisement this user's input.For example, input pickup can detect the movement of mobile device.Mobile device can determine to use whether waiting for the input that receives.If mobile device does not identify the application of waiting for the input that receives, then mobile device can carry out the advertisement logic that comprises in this movement and this interactive type advertisement related.
In some implementations, mobile device automatically carries out related with interactive type advertisement user's input.For example, movable sensor can detect the movement of mobile device, and mobile device can send to detected movement the advertisement logic that is associated with interactive type advertisement.
Identify the type of input, and the type is mapped to the action (310) that is associated with the input type that identifies.For example, the advertisement logic that is associated with this interactive type advertisement can be based on the type of the input pickup identification input that receives this input, and for example, touch is inputted, button is selected or the movement of mobile device.The advertisement logic can be inquired about unique input pattern to the mapping of action for the input type that identifies, so that identification action or the order corresponding with the input that receives.
Can determine the input that receives such as, advertisement logic is touch input on the touch-screen display.The advertisement logic can be identified and touch the posture that input is associated (for example, clicking or double-clicking on the display, the circumference (circular) around the part of interactive type advertisement is mobile, perhaps strides the paddling along specific direction of interactive type advertisement).The advertisement logic can match this posture shape and/or posture direction and this posture shape, posture direction or the two particular advertisement action that is associated.For example, clicking on the interactive type advertisement can start the landing page that is associated with this advertisement in the web browser.In another example, can carry out being difficult in display presenting interactive type advertisement on the interactive part (for example, the smaller portions in the display).Clockwise circumference posture around this advertisement can be presented on this advertisement on the whole display.
In some implementations, it is movement or the orientation of mobile device on specific direction that advertisement logic is determined the input that receives.The advertisement logic can movement-based speed, the action that will carry out is identified to the mapping of advertisement action in moving direction and/or orientation.For example, the vertical movement that makes progress of mobile device can show replacement advertisement.Perhaps, the downward vertically movement of mobile device can be hidden this advertisement.The input pattern that receives is listed in table 1 to some examples of mapping of action are following.
In some implementations, advertisement logic the input that receives is identified as that button on the mobile device is selected or the touch-screen display of mobile device on the selection of the button that presents.The advertisement logic can use the input that receives to determine the advertisement action that will carry out, is input to the mapping of advertisement action with inquiry.For example, can open the privacy setting (for example, to the setting of the option outside the advertisement tracking, disabling of audio or video ads are closed the circulation of video ads etc.) of advertisement and mobile device to the selection of button.During other was realized at some, the user can provide the input that allows the user that feedback to the advertisement that presents (for example, improper or lose interest in) is provided.This feedback can be made for specific user and/or equipment intense adjustment to be carried out in advertisement by ad system.
Carry out corresponding advertisement action (312) in response to this input.For example, advertisement logic can be carried out the order that is associated with corresponding advertisement action.This order can be upgraded the option that is associated with interactive type advertisement, perhaps changes presenting of interactive type advertisement.Alternatively, this order can provide information to other process, in order to carry out the advertisement action.In some implementations, when carrying out this order, advertisement logic other process solicited message (for example, the geographic position of mobile device) from the mobile device.
The advertisement logic can be after receiving user's input and identifying the advertisement action, immediate execution command.Alternatively, the advertisement logic can before carrying out this order, be waited for schedule time amount (for example, to determine that this user's input is not unexpected input).In some implementations, the advertisement logic is carried out this order and can not changed the content that display presents in background, until (for example carry out this order fully, in case the landing page that is associated with interactive type advertisement has been loaded in the web browser, then presents web browser at display).
