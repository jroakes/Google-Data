(for example, advertiser or uploaded the other users of video) provides the information for facilitating assessment video performance.In some implementations
In mode, video analysis device 120 is in video to determine using the played data of particular video frequency (for example, particular video frequency advertisement)
The presentation for the designated position (for example, 25% of total duration) of the particular video frequency having reached in video before being now terminated
Partly (for example, opposite be presented quantity).For example, if particular video frequency is presented at 100 different user devices, and 25 are in
The 25% of total duration is now reached, then video analysis device 120 can determine 25% video to have exhibited up to video total
The 25% of duration.Video analysis device 120 is described as to the device of execution video analysis operation on the discussion below is total.So
And some or all operations can be executed by user equipment or be executed in other ways by client device.
Fig. 2A is the illustrative screenshot of the browser 200 of the video of the presentation of video player 116 wherein.Video player 116
It is included therein the video presentation region 202 that video is presented.For example, when receiving video, video player can load (or
Start to load) video and start video present before wait for user and " broadcasting " element 204 interaction.Video player
116 alternatively can in the arbitrary portion for receiving video or preassigned video section (for example, 10%)
It immediately begins to play received video after being received by video player 116.
Indicate that the data (that is, " video data ") for the video that video player 116 receives will include usually specified connect
The data of the total duration 206 of rating frequency.For example, if particular video frequency is 1 minute long, the video data of the video can be with
" total duration " data of total duration including specified 1 minute for the video.Video player 116 can use this total
Duration data determines the part received by video player in video total duration, and further determines that one
A or multiple and different video segmentations are considered the reproduction time being over.
For example, it is assumed that video player 116 by video segmentation be four it is different be segmented (four parts), and video it is lasting when
Between data indicate the video total duration be 1 minute.In this example, the first segmentation of the video includes total duration
First 15 seconds (for example, from time=0 second to time=15 second), the second segmentation of the video includes the of total duration
Two 15 seconds (for example, from time=16 second to time=30 second), the third segmentation of the video include the third of total duration
15 seconds a (for example, from time=31 second to time=45 second), and the video the 4th segmentation include total duration most
The latter 15 seconds (for example, from time=46 second to time=60 second).
Through herein for exemplary purposes use four parts, but video player can by video segmentation be any amount
Different segmentations.For example, it is 60 of 1 second length segmentations that the video in above example, which can be segmented into,.Although moreover, every
A segmentation can be the disjoint subset of the total duration of video, but in some embodiments, it is not required that segmentation is
Disjoint subset.Therefore, two or more different segmentations can be allowed to include total duration lap.For example,
The second segmentation in above example can be defined as all or part of for including the first segmentation so that the second segmentation can wrap
It includes first and second 15 seconds (for example, from time=0 to time=30) of total duration.The number of fragments that video is segmented
It can also pseudorandomly be selected.
Each segmentation can also be specified about the percentage of total duration included in the segmentation.For example, working as
When video segmentation is four parts by video player, the first segmentation can be defined as 25% including total duration, and the
(that is, relative to video at the reproduction time for 25% ending that the ending of one segmentation can be positioned corresponding to total duration
Beginning).Similarly, the ending of second, third and the 4th segmentation can be located at 50% corresponding to total duration, 75%
At 100% reproduction time.
Video player 116 can be configured as the broadcasting (that is, presentation) of monitoring video to determine whether broadcasting has reached
Segmentation ending is arrived.For example, it is assumed that video playing at the beginning of video 206 (that is, 0% of total duration) starts, and
Heading frame 208 is presented first frame.In this example, when initiating video and presenting (for example, in response to user and broadcasting member
Element 204 interacts or automatically begins to play), video player 116 can transmit specified initiation to video analysis device 120 and regard
The played data 209 that frequency plays.
Played data is to specify the data (start for example, playing, play and terminate) of various broadcast events.Played data is for example
HTTP GET requests can be formatted as, are used to transmit the information in relation to video playing to video analysis device 120.
Played data includes the data of designated identifier, and video identifier identification is regarded what user equipment was presented
Frequently.For example, when in the video index 114 that each video is uploaded to (or being stored in other ways) Fig. 1, the video
It is associated (for example, with for it unique video identifier of the video can be distributed to (for example, by video server 115)
Reference carry out store and/or be indexed according to it).Then the video identifier can be used as the reference to video.Example
Such as, can include video identifier for asking the active link [HTML] of video, and video server can be identified from request
The video identifier in video index to position the video.Played data can also include and occur video presentation user
Equipment is associated the user identifier (for example, cookie) of (for example, being stored thereon).
In some embodiments, played data includes broadcast message class type indicator, and designated is as video content
Item (for example, advertisement presentation) or target video (for example, non-advertisement video is presented) are presented.Playing type indicator can
Enable video analysis device 120 when video is presented as content item (for example, video ads) and as target video
Determine individual rating measurement (for example, reaching special in video for the presentation of particular video frequency when (for example, non-advertisement video) is presented
Position the relative populations for the presentation set).E.g., including the played data of the broadcasting type indicator of " advertisement " can be used to
It determines that rating is measured for video when being presented as advertisement, and includes that the broadcasting type indicator of " target " or " non-advertisement " is broadcast
Putting data can be used to determine that rating is measured for video when presenting as target video (or non-advertisement video).
Played data may further include the data of the specified video section presented at user equipment.
For example, video playing reach the first segmentation 210 end up (for example, 25% of total duration) when the played data that transmits can be with
Indicate that video playing has reached the ending of the first segmentation 210.Similarly, reach each subsequent segment 212,214 in video playing
With 216 ending (for example, the 50% of total duration, 75% and 100%) when the played data that transmits can respectively specify that and regard
Frequently the segmentation ending having progressed to is played.
Video player 116 can determine that video playing has had progressed to specific point of video using several technology
The ending of section.In some embodiments, video player can will play timer 218 and (indicate to continue by the total of video
The timer of the time schedule of time) specified by time be compared with the reproduction time that each corresponding segment terminates.For example,
Assuming that the first segmentation of particular video frequency terminates for 15 seconds after the particular video frequency starts.In this example, video player 116
It can monitor the time played specified by timer 218, and when it is 15 seconds to play the time specified by timer 218, depending on
Frequency player 116 can determine the ending for having had reached the first segmentation 210.In turn, video player 116 can (for example, to
Video analysis device 120) transmission played data 209, the specified ending for having had reached the first segmentation 210 and also specified be in
The now user identifier of the user equipment of the video.
When video player 116 can continue to monitoring and play the time specified by timer 218 and determine specified
Between whether the reproduction time for being considered terminating with other segmentations of particular video frequency matches.For example, it is assumed that particular video frequency is other
Segmentation is considered 30 seconds after the particular video frequency starts, 45 seconds and 60 seconds respectively and terminates.In this example, video player
116 can determine the other segmentation of the particular video frequency when the time specified by broadcasting timer 218 is 30 seconds, 45 seconds or 60 seconds
It has been presented.In response to determining that the other segmentation of the particular video frequency has been presented at user equipment, video player 116
Can be transmitted specify the particular video frequency be in addition segmented the other video playing data being presented at user equipment
209.For example, when it is 30 seconds to play the time specified by timer, video player 116, which can be transmitted, indicates the particular video frequency
Second segmentation be presented at user equipment (that is, video playing reached second segmentation 212 ending) video broadcast
Put data 209.Similarly, in this example, when it is 45 seconds or 60 seconds to play the time specified by timer 218, video is broadcast
It puts device 116 and can be transmitted other played data 209.
In some embodiments, video player 116 can the video frame at particular fragments ending by
Determine that the particular fragments of the video have been presented when presentation.Video player 116 for example can reach specific by determination
The video frame (being referred to as segmentation end frame) that the when of ending up is presented is segmented to identify the frame at particular fragments ending.Specific point
Section segmentation end frame for example can by determine particular fragments ending be considered end reproduction time (for example, relative to
Video beginning time) and identify be identified in the video frame that the reproduction time is presented.
For example, it is assumed that the ending of the first segmentation 210 is considered in the 25% of the total duration for having been presented for video
Terminate.In this example, video player 116 can determine specific reproduction time that 25% video is presented (for example, opposite
Start in video).In turn, the video frame presented in the specific reproduction time can be identified as the video by video player 116
First segmentation segmentation end frame 220.
Video player 116 can supervise video playing for the presentation of the segmentation end frame 220 of the first segmentation
Depending on.When video player 116 determines that the segmentation end frame 220 (or another terminates fragmented frame) of the first segmentation has been presented
When, video player 116 can be transmitted the played data 209 that instruction video playing has reached the ending of the first segmentation 210.
Video player 116 can be directed to video each identification by stages be segmented end frame, and monitor video playing with
Determine whether arbitrary segmentation end frame has been presented.For example, as shown in Figure 2 A, it is assumed that video player 116 will regard
Frequency is segmented into four parts.In this example, video player 116 can identify that the first segmentation of video is considered first point terminated
Section end frame 220.Video player 116 can also identify that the second segmentation of video is considered the terminate second segmentation end frame
222, the third segmentation of video, which is considered the third terminated segmentation end frame 224 and the 4th segmentation of video, to be considered terminating
The 4th segmentation end frame 226.It is any one in these segmentation end frames (for example, 220,222,224 or 226) in response to determining
A to be presented, video player 116 can transmit instruction video playing to video analysis device 120 and have reached corresponding point
The played data 209 of the ending of section.
Fig. 2 B are another screenshotss of the browser 200 of the video of the presentation of video player 116 wherein.Video player
116 can enable a user to by with progress indicator 228 (that is, the user interface of video section that instruction is being presented
Element) mode that interacts and change the video section presented configured.For example, it is assumed that video playing has reached
The ending of one segmentation 210 and the second segmentation for going successively to video.When video playing reaches the ending of the first segmentation 210,
Transmission instruction video playing has been reached the played data 209 of the ending of the first segmentation 210 by video player 116.
Continue the example, it is further assumed that the video receiver 116 before the ending that video playing reaches the second segmentation 212
Receive the request for continuing video playing from video beginning (for example, 0% of total duration).The request for example can be with instruction
Progress indicator 228 is repositioned at video beginning the interaction of (for example, by interaction of user and progress indicator 228)
The form of data is received.The interaction data for example can execute click and drag operation in response to user and be received, wherein
User clicks progress indicator 228 and changes its position.The interaction data can also for example be clicked in response to user (or with
Other manner confirms selection) position on the progress bar 230 that is located therein of progress indicator 228 and be received.
In response to receiving the request, the video location that video player 116 can be specified in the request starts to regard
Frequency plays.It continues the examples above, video player 116 can be in response to the request and (for example, when always continuing at video beginning
Between 0%) start to play so that the video first segmentation can be presented again.
When video playing reaches the ending of the first segmentation 210 again, total presentation time of the video, which will be at least, always holds
50% (for example, it is assumed that the video is segmented into four parts of matching duration) of continuous time.For example, in the first broadcasting of video
When reaching the ending of the first segmentation 210, the 25% of the total duration of the video is presented.Similarly, when restarting to regard
When video playing reaches the ending of the first segmentation again after frequency is presented, the total duration of the video will be presented again
25%.Therefore, total presentation time of the video will be at least the 50% of the total duration of the video.However, in this example,
The ending of the first segmentation is only reached during broadcasting so that the ending of specified first segmentation 210 is the broadcasting phase by played data
Between reached only segmentation ending.
In some embodiments, the transmission instruction video when reaching particular fragments ending every time of video player 116 is broadcast
The unconventional and unrestrained played data 209 (that is, no matter previously whether reaching the ending of the segmentation) for having arrived particular fragments ending.Continue previous
Example, video player 116 can video it is first broadcasting reach the ending of the first segmentation 210 when for the first time transmission instruction
The played data 209 of the ending of the first segmentation 210 is reached.Video player 116 can also be in follow-up play (that is, receiving
Continue the broadcasting after the request played from another position in video) transmission instruction when reaching the ending of the first segmentation 210
The played data of the ending of the first segmentation 210 is reached.Video analysis device 120 is able to record each reality of played data 209
Example is filtered multiple examples of the identical played data from same user device.
Fig. 2 C are another screenshotss of the browser 200 of the video of the presentation of video player 116 wherein.As shown in Figure 2 C,
Video player 116 can also be configured such that user " can skip " part for video.For example, it is assumed that video playing exists
Start at the beginning of video 206, but before the ending that video playing reaches the first segmentation 210, video player 116 receives
Video location 232 in the second segmentation continues the request played, thus " skip " in video will video playing from point 234 into
The presentation of the part presented when row to point 232.
In some embodiments, video player 116 is configured as ending up it reaching video segmentation in video playing
Before the played data that instruction has reached segmentation ending is not sent when being interrupted.For example, when the ending of the first segmentation 210 passes through use
The interaction (for example, by clicking progress indicator 228 and it being dragged to a little 232 from point 234) of family and progress indicator 228
And when " being skipped ", video player 116 can not send reached first segmentation 210 ending played data (that is, no matter
Whether video playing continues in point 232).However, if video playing advances to a little 236 from point 232, video playing is up to
The ending of second segmentation 212.Therefore, video player 116 can be transmitted the knot for having reached the second segmentation 212 during instruction plays
The played data 209 of tail.
As described above, though video player 116 not yet transmission instruction first segmentation 210 (or it is another previously
Segmentation) ending played data, video player 116 also can be transmitted instruction reached second segmentation 212 ending (or
The ending of another subsequent segment, such as third segmentation ending or the 4th segmentation ending) played data.Such as above with reference to figure
Described in 2B, video player 116 is configured such that user can also ask partly to continue to regard in the relatively early of video
Frequency plays.Therefore, video player 116 formerly will likely pass through the broadcasting number that instruction reaches the ending of the second segmentation 212 by forward pass
Reach the played data of the ending of the first segmentation 210 according to transmission instruction later.
For example, with reference to figure 2C, it is assumed that video playing reach a little 236 when, video player 116 receive from point 234 (
Before 25%) continue video playing request.In this example, if the broadcasting continued reaches the knot of the first segmentation 210
Tail, video player 116 can be transmitted the played data 209 for the ending for indicating to reach the first segmentation 210 (that is, it is not intended that regarding
Frequency player 116 previously transmitted the fact that played data for the ending that instruction reaches the second segmentation 212).Therefore, no matter see
See segmentation sequence how, played data 209 can be transmitted when reaching each segmentation ending.
As described above, played data 209 can be transmitted when reaching each segmentation ending.When in this way
When providing played data, user may watch the major part of the segmentation (for example, more in the case where playing not up to segmentation ending
In the 50% of the segmentation).Therefore, video player 116 does not transmit the played data that instruction has reached segmentation ending.Therefore,
Video analysis device 120 can not receive the data that the specific part of instruction video is presented, and this may influence to regard
Frequency division analysis apparatus 120 can utilize it to determine the accuracy for the opposite spectator attendance for watching particular video frequency part.
A kind of improve determines that the mode of the accuracy for the opposite spectator attendance for watching particular video frequency part is to increase video
Divided number of fragments.For example, if one minute video segmentation is 60 segmentations by video player, each segmentation can be with
For 1 second long (that is, 60 seconds/60 are segmented=1 second/segmentation).Therefore, the spectators of any video section for being more than 1 second are watched
Relative populations can be based on being sent to the played data of video analysis device 120 to determine.However, to video analysis device
120 played datas received are managed the number of fragments that required computing resource is segmented with video and proportionally increase.
Therefore, according to available computational resources (for example, process resource, communication bandwidth and memory resource), video can be divided
The number of fragments of section is limited, and still may expect additional accuracy.
Another kind, which improves, determines that the mode of the accuracy for the opposite spectator attendance for watching particular video frequency part is to change often
Included video section in a segmentation.The segmentation knot of the segmentation will be changed by changing video section included in particular fragments
The beam time.For example, when the first segmentation of video includes 25% video, the segmentation end time of the first segmentation will regard at this
At the 25% of the total duration of frequency.Similarly, when the first segmentation includes 33% video, the segmentation of the first segmentation terminates
Time, first was segmented by the 33% of the total duration of the video, and when the first segmentation includes 10% video
The segmentation end time will be at the 10% of the total duration of the video.Therefore, it is necessary to be presented to be directed to specific point
The video section of section transmission played data will also change.
In some embodiments, video player 116 changes video section included in each segmentation.Video playing
Device 116 for example can by for each segmentation pseudorandomly (or in other ways changeably) selection segmentation end time come
Change video section included in each segmentation.For example, it is assumed that video player 116 is configured as video segmentation being four
Segmentation.In this example, video player 116 can be selected pseudo randomly segmentation for each in this four segmentations and terminate
Time (or using other selection technique, such as the segmentation end time will be incremented by (or successively decreasing) preassigned amount), into
And determine video section included in each segmentation.
Fig. 3 A-3C are the diagrams of the progress bar 300 for the segmentation for wherein depicting the various duration.For example, such as Fig. 3 A
Shown in progress bar 300, video segmentation is 4 segmentations by video player, wherein the ending of the first segmentation 302 is regarded positioned at this
At the 18% of the total duration of frequency (that is, beginning relative to video), ending always the holding positioned at the video of the second segmentation 304
At the 45% of continuous time, the ending of third segmentation 306 is at the 65% of the total duration of the video, and the 4th segmentation 308
Ending positioned at the video total duration 100% at.It therefore, will be when video playing reaches the 18% of total duration
The played data of the first segmentation of transmission, and 45%, 65% and the 100% of the total duration of the video will be reached in video playing
When send respectively second, third and the 4th segmentation played data.
The played data being each segmented may include the reference for the segmentation end position, this makes video analysis device
120 can determine the corresponding video section of played data.It continues the examples above, video player can be directed to first point
Played data of the ending of specified first segmentation of section transmission at the 18% of video total duration.Alternatively (or remove this
Except), the played data of the first segmentation may include the reproduction time (for example, 15 seconds) that the specified first ending being segmented is located at
The segmentation end time.The played data of each other segmentations may include the similar information of the position of specified segmentation ending.
When user equipment asks video every time, video player can be directed to the video and select the different segmentation end times.
For example, it is assumed that video player is that the end time is segmented shown in the first request selecting Fig. 3 A of particular video frequency, and also vacation
At the end of being segmented shown in setting video player be respectively second and third request selecting of identical particular video frequency Fig. 3 B and 3C
Between.
As shown in Figure 3B, the segmentation end time 310,312,314 and 316 of the second request of particular video frequency, which is located at, regards
At 20%, 40%, 60% and the 100% of the total duration of frequency.As shown in Figure 3 C, the segmentation end time 318 of particular video frequency,
320,322 and 324 be located at video total duration 10%, 55%, 78% and 90% at.Therefore, with when in response to
First request provide when video broadcasting caused by played data compare, when in response to second and third request it is provided when from
Played data caused by the broadcasting of particular video frequency will specify different information.
For example, in response to second ask provided particular video frequency played data by the broadcasting of specified particular video frequency whether
20%, 40%, 60% and the 100% of the total duration of the particular video frequency is reached.At the same time, institute is asked in response to third
Whether the broadcasting of specified particular video frequency has been reached the total duration of the particular video frequency by the played data of the particular video frequency of offer
10%, 55%, 78% and 90%.
As user continues that particular video frequency, video player is asked to can continue to select different segmentation knots for the video
The beam time so that the played data that summarizes from multiple requests will provide the viewing profile summarized for the particular video frequency.Viewing
Profile is the data acquisition system for indicating to reach the video presentation portion minute of each point in video.Refer to for example, viewing profile can have
Show relative populations (that is, reaching the relative populations for the presentation that total duration the terminates) (example for 100% user for having viewed video
Such as, percentage) a numerical value.The viewing profile of this numerical value is for determining that it is frequent that the total duration of video is presented
Degree is useful, but and is not provided with the number of users for closing the fewer parts (for example, 18% of video) for watching video
Information.
Fig. 4 is that the example of video summarizes the figure 400 of viewing profile.The viewing profile that summarizes of video is to be directed to video not
With one group of rating measurement of part (for example, position or point).Figure 400 has x-axis 402, the total duration with video
0% origin numerical value and increase to total duration 100% (x-axis 402 can also refer to reproduction time absolute value).
There is figure 400 y-axis 404, the origin numerical value of 0% always presented with video to have and increase to video presentation
100% numerical value (y-axis can also specify the absolute quantity of presentation or another relative measurement of presentation).Figure 400 is for example
It can be created by the video analysis device 120 of Fig. 1.
When as being segmented to video above with reference to described in Fig. 3 A-3C, during video playing being based on
What is generated summarizes played data and generates figure 400.In some embodiments, pseudorandom (or can be changed in other ways
Ground) played data of segmentation end time of selection summarizes in the statistics relative populations of user, and has viewed video
The opposite numbers of users (that is, reaching each the opposite of segmentation ending is presented quantity) of various pieces figure can be plotted in
On 400.For example, according to figure 400,48% video has exhibited up to the 25% of total duration.25% numerical example in x-axis
It can such as indicate the segmentation terminated at the 25% of the total duration of video.Analogously it is possible to be held always based on being wherein segmented
The played data that the video terminated at the 25% of continuous time is presented determines the 25% opposite presentation quantity for reaching total duration.
Reaching the opposite quantity that presents of each specific position (for example, 25% of total duration) in video can be referred to as
The broadcasting percent of pass (play-through rate) of the video location.For example, it is assumed that at least part of particular video frequency is 100
It is presented at a user equipment, and 25 broadcastings in these presentations have reached the 50% of the total duration of video.At this
In example, the broadcasting percent of pass for 50% video location can be 25% (for example, 25/100).
In some embodiments, figure 400 may include a plurality of curve 406, wherein curve (for example, 406a) table
Show and (is regarded for example, reaching specified using the rating measurement that there is the played data for playing type indicator numerical value " advertisement " to be calculated
The relative populations of the presentation of frequency position), and the second curve (for example, 406b) is indicated using " non-wide with type indicator is played
The rating measurement that the played data of announcement " or " target video " is calculated.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 500 for tracking video playing.Process 500 is that video player passes through it
It is multiple segmentations by video segmentation and monitors the broadcasting of video to determine whether video playing has reached the mistake of segmentation ending
Journey.In response to determining that broadcasting has had reached segmentation ending, video player is to data processing equipment (for example, the video of Fig. 1 point
Analysis apparatus 120) transmission played data.The played data transmitted will be including specifying the segmentation being had reached during broadcasting to end up
Data.Data processing equipment determines rating measurement (for example, what the video for reaching the specified point of video was presented for the video
Relative measurement), and those ratings are measured to the publisher or the owner for being provided to video.
Video is segmented into two or more segmentations (502).In some embodiments, each of video segmentation is to regard
The disjoint subset of frequency so that two segmentations of video do not include identical video section.For example, one minute video can be
It is segmented at the 50% of the total duration of the video so that the first segmentation of the video is tied at the 50% of total duration
Beam and the second segmentation are using next video frame for being presented after the 50% of total duration as starting.As described above,
Video can be by asking the video player (or application or equipment of another client-side) of the video to be segmented.
In some embodiments, the number of fragments that video is segmented can pseudorandomly (or in other ways changeably)
Selection.For example, when video player receives video, video player can obtain the output of pseudo-random number generator and
By the segmentation that video segmentation is the quantity.Additionally or alternatively, video player can be obtained according to another number
The output of the number generator of selection technique (that is, nonrandom or pseudorandom) selection number.
In some embodiments, video based on its total duration and the video number of fragments to be segmented and by
Segmentation.For example, the total duration of video can be determined by (for example, based on video received data) and for every
A segmentation pseudorandom selection segmentation end time is segmented video.It can for each segmentation end time for being segmented selection
To be the time of the pseudorandom selection between 0 and the total duration of video.
Video playing is monitored (504), and determines whether video playing has reached segmentation ending (506).?
In some embodiments, determine that video is broadcast when matching the segmentation end time for playing time and segmentation specified by timer
The unconventional and unrestrained ending for having arrived the segmentation.For example, if the segmentation end time of particular fragments is 15 seconds after video starts, it can
The enough time indicated by broadcasting timer determines that video playing has had reached the ending of the particular video frequency when being 15 seconds.
In some embodiments, determine that video playing has reached segmentation knot when segmentation end frame is presented in video player
Tail.For example, once having identified the segmentation end time of segmentation, it will be able to identify the frame presented in the segmentation end time simultaneously
And it is assigned therein as the segmentation end frame (for example, last frame in segmentation) of the segmentation.With the progress of video playing, video
Player can be monitored whether the segmentation end frame with the arbitrary segmentation of determination has been presented to broadcasting.Divide in response to determining
Section end frame has been presented, and video player can determine that video playing has had reached point corresponding to the segmentation end frame
Section ending.
If it is determined that video playing reaches segmentation ending not yet, then continue to monitor (506) video playing.When true
Determine video playing had reached segmentation ending when, played data is provided, wherein the played data instruction play has reached segmentation
It ends up (508).In some embodiments, by the data processing equipment to server side (for example, the video analysis of Fig. 1 fills
It sets and 120) transmits HTTP GET requests and played data is provided.
The played data for example may include the data for the particular fragments ending being had reached during specified play.Play number
According to that can also include for example timestamp, the data processing equipment of server side can determine during broadcasting and reach different frame
Ending sequence (and such as video pause, video stop, video skip with video repeat etc broadcast event appearance
Sequentially).As described above, played data may further include the video identifier of presented video and video be presented
User equipment user identifier so that the data processing equipment of server side can be indexed suitably and restore played data.
Played data can also include the presentation type (also referred to as playing type) of video.For example, played data can be with
Whether it is presented as video content item (for example, the advertisement of video is presented) including designated or whether video is used as target
The data that video (for example, the non-advertisement of video is presented) is presented.The presentation type of video can be for example based on when receiving
With included by video data and in response to it provide the request of video and determine.
For example, as described above, when providing video in response to ad-request, the presentation type of video can be recognized
For be advertisement present.However, if video be in response in not for the request of advertisement (for example, being provided to Advertisement Server
Request) request and provide, then it is that non-advertisement is presented that the presentation type of the video, which may be considered that,.
The data processing equipment of server side receives and stores played data (510).In some embodiments, server
The data processing equipment of side is with reference to video and/or receives from it the user equipment of played data and stores played data.For example, clothes
The data processing equipment of business device side can be according to one in the video identifier of video and the user identifier of user equipment
Or multiple played data is indexed.Played data can be stored in data storage, the rating daily record 119 of such as Fig. 1.
Determine that rating measures (512) for video.In some embodiments, rating measurement instruction reaches each in video
The relative populations that the video of point is presented.For example, as described above, the played data energy summarized is presented from many different videos
It is enough used to create viewing profile.In some embodiments, the advertisement presentation of video and the non-advertisement of video can be directed to
It presents and creates individual viewing profile with the direct comparison for the duration for facilitating advertisement to be presented with non-advertisement.
