Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to communication devices and in particular to mechanisms and methodology for performing content search by voice query on communication devices.
- cellular phones and other communication devices typically provide a search function on the device support for performing searches within content that is stored/maintained on the device.
- search functions are performed using a text-based search technology.
- words “or character combinations) plays a critical role. These words may be manually inputted into the device using the devices input mechanism (keypad, touch screen, and the like); however, in more advanced devices, the words are provided as audio data that is spoken by the user and detected by the devices microphone.
- the searching methodology is based on voice-to-text, wherein words are first converted into text using a dictionary of known spoken words/terms.
- the method commonly utilized relies on a use of phonemes derived from the audio data to perform searches and is referred to as a process of discovering “words” from audio data input remains a challenging task on mobile communication devices. It is also a difficult task on a server-based computer system because the performance of the speech recognition system is dependent on the language coverage and word-coverage of the dictionaries and the language models.
- a recent phoneme-based approach to deciphering audio data does not need actual word discovery. But, the approach makes uses of very limited contextual information, and involves sequentially processing the features of audio data. The approach thus needs to sequentially process the features of the audio data, and the limited locality information results in an expensive fine match.

- UDS utility 115 (or interchangeably referred to as Voice-to-Voice Search (VVS) utility).
- VVS Voice-to-Voice Search
- VSCO utility 160 Voice Search and Content Ordering
- UDS utility 115 When executed by microprocessor 107 , key functions provided by UDS utility 115 include, but are not limited to: (1) retrieving/discovering one or more uniterms from audio data and associating the discovered uniterms with content stored within the communication device 100 ; (2) maintaining an audio database ( 230 , FIG.
- a voice search is initiated (i.e., a voice query detected) at the device 100 , generating a statistical latent lattice model from the voice query and scoring the terms stored in the database against the latent lattice model utilizing a series of probability evaluations to produce a set of best “scoring” uniterms, corresponding to specific ones of the stored content; and (4) returning the content associated with the best uniterms as the result of the voice query.
- the returned content is identified by an audio label/tag from which the best scoring uniterm(s) were generated.
- VSCO utility 160 also provides several additional functionalities, when the VSCO utility 160 is executed by microprocessor 107 .
- functions provided by VSCO utility 160 are, without limitation: (1) enabling a linking/tagging of each content with a voice tag; (2) storing the content along with the associated voice tag; (3) retrieving keywords from a voice query and storing an ordering sequence of the keywords relative to each other; performing the voice-to-voice search utilizing the UDS utility 115 ; (4) sorting returned content based on the ordering sequence of corresponding keywords that retrieved the returned content; and (5) outputting the content in the ordered sequence; and (6) enabling storage of the ordered sequence of returned content as a new content, tagged with a new audio tag.
- aspects of the disclosed embodiments provide a process of generating a “dictionary” representation for voice search (during a uniterm Discovery Process) and then utilizing this dictionary in voice search (during a Search Process).
- the invention involves extracting phoneme strings from segments of audio data in which the phoneme string is considered to be a good estimate of the actual phonetic content by virtue of the phoneme string's consistency within the phoneme lattice.
- These phoneme strings extracted from all of the utterances in an audio database, play the role of words in subsequently attempting to match a new utterance having the same lexical content.
- the invention seeks to identify which of these “words” (referred to herein as “uniterms”) also appear with consistency within the lattice representation (i.e., the statistical latent lattice model) of a new utterance.
- the identified uniterms allow the incoming utterance to be associated with the corresponding content in the audio database.
- One embodiment of the invention provides a sememeless term (or ?vocabulary?) discovery strategy, where a sememe is a unit of transmitted or intended meaning (of a smallest unit of word).
- the invention recognizes that use of a sememeless term or discovery strategy is more practical since the audio segments may contain non-speech sound such as noise and music, or foreign terms, names of people, and places that are missing from the dictionary.
- the invention further recognizes that performing searches with vocabulary such as “in dictation” is very challenging on mobile devices with limited computational power.
- the voice-to-voice methodology requires very little computational power for large vocabulary conversational speech recognition (LVCSR).
- LVCSR large vocabulary conversational speech recognition
- One embodiment of the invention enhances the phoneme-based approach to performing voice searches.
- voice-to-voice searches are provided without requiring “?word?” discovery, by adding the use of contextual information, and thus eliminating the need for sequential processing of audio data.
- the functionality of the described embodiments also removes the explicit word boundaries in the audio database, when compared with voice to text search.
- Embodiments of the described invention makes use of the sememeless term (or ?vocabulary?) discovery strategy. As described in greater details below, during the discovery process, phoneme recognition is performed on the utterances and a phoneme lattice is generated.
- the top N branches (uniterms) with best scores from the uniterm tree are determined and kept, and then a fine search is performed on the lattice associated with the top N uniterms.

- stored audio content from audio database 230 is sent through speech recognizer 210 , which generates the audio content phoneme lattice 211 .
- multiple phoneme lattices are generated, each corresponding to a segment of audio content within the audio database 230 .
- the audio content phoneme lattice 211 is then passed through uniterm extraction function 214 , which generates a plurality of uniterms corresponding to the different audio content (and segments thereof) within the audio database 230 .
- the uniterms generated by uniterm extraction function 214 are stored within bestpath and uniterm index database 218 , with the uniterms indexed according to some pre-established pattern to form a phoneme uniterm tree that is utilized during the coarse search function.

- the probabilistic estimates that can be used in the phoneme lattice statistical model are phoneme conditional probabilistic estimates, and N-gram counts can be extracted from the phoneme lattice.

- (a)
speech recognizer 210, which receives audio/voice input (voice query) 201 and performs a recognition function to generate acorresponding phoneme lattice 212. The phoneme lattice is utilized to generate a statisticallatent lattice model 215, which is utilized to score uniterms that are stored within the audio database 230 (or within bestpath and uniterm index database 218); - (b) coarse search function 220 (which is a basic uniterm scoring subroutine that performs an initial scoring of all uniterms within the bestpath and uniterm index database 218), scores the uniterms (specifically, the phoneme uniterm tree) of the stored audio/voice data and retrieved from bestpath and
uniterm index database 218 against the statisticallatent lattice model 215. The scoring is performed via a process involving a series of probability analyses, described below.Coarse search function 220 generatescoarse search candidates 222 as the result of scoring the uniterms (or uniterm tree) against the statisticallatent lattice model 215; and - (c) fine search function 225 (which is a more specific uniterm scoring subroutine, which only scores the results of the coarse search function 220), receives the
coarse search candidates 222 from thecoarse search function 220 along with a copy of thephoneme lattice 212 fromspeech recognizer 210.Fine search function 225 performs a more refined analysis of the phoneme lattice compared with the coarse search candidates to generatefine search output 227.Fine search output 227 is the result produced (i.e., content retrieved from audio database) as the output of the voice-to-voice search initiated byvoice query 201, which search is performed using the set of stored uniterms (or phoneme uniterm tree) and the statisticallatent lattice model 215 generated from thevoice query 201.
- (a)
p(x|y,z)=α*p(x|y,z)+β*p(x|y)+γ*p(x)+ε
where α, β, γ and ε are given constants based on experiments and with the condition that α+β+γ+ε=1.
p(x 1 x 2 . . . x M |L)=p(x 1 |L)p(x 2 |x 1 ,L). . . p(x M |x M-1 ,L),
where p(x1x2 . . . xM|L) is the estimated probability that the indexing term having the phoneme string x1x2 . . . xM occurs in the utterance from which lattice L was generated. Further, the probabilistic estimate is determined from the unigram [p(x1|L)] and bi-gram [p(xM|xM-1,L)] conditional probabilities of the phoneme lattice statistical model.
p(x 1 x 2 . . . x M |L)=p(x 1 |L)p(x 2 |x 1 ,L)p(x 3 |x 2 ,x 1 ,L) . . . p(x M |x M-1 , . . . x M+1-N ,L),
where p(x1x2 . . . xM|L) is the estimated probability that the indexing term having the phoneme string x1x2 . . . xM occurred in the utterance from which lattice L was generated. The probability/probabilistic estimate is determined from N gram (e.g., for tri-gram, N=3) conditional probabilities p(x1|L), p(x2|x1,L), . . . , p(xM-1|xM-1, . . . xM+1-N,L) of the phoneme lattice statistical model. The score of an uniterm can be calculated as:
S=log(p(x 1 x 2 . . . x M |L))/M+f(M),
where f(M) is a function which penalizes the short strings, for example f(M)=b*log(M) and b=0.02.
