- Text between the heading tag can be extracted and used as a ToC entry.
- snippets selected from the text following the heading can be appended to the ToC entry, as shown in FIG. 4.
- a ToC entry is a link that takes a user to a portion of the electronic document that includes the text from which the
- ToC entry was generated. For example, if the text "Cool New People" was extracted from the middle of a web page, selection of the ToC entry that corresponds to this entry would cause the mobile device to display the text in the middle of the web page.
- this is accomplished by generated an anchor tag (e.g., ⁇ a>) that is inserted substantially near the text from which the entry was generated.
- the ToC entry references the anchor so that when the ToC entry is selected, the mobile device (more specifically an application, such as a browser) locates the anchor and displays the text referenced by the anchor.
- the text "Table of Contents” can have a "plus” sign beside it indicating that the element expands when it is selected by a user.
- FIG. 5 is an example of a transcoded electronic document that includes a login identifier.
- the login identifier can be the link labeled "Login.”
- the mobile device displays a portion of the transcoded document that includes the login element.
- the login element is located by the parser as discussed above.
- the document generator can insert an anchor ⁇ a> near (e.g., ahead) of the login element.
- the login identifier can be a URL that references the anchor, so that when the login identifier is selected, the mobile displays the login element.
- the login identifier includes code that can be used to generate the login element.
- the login identifier can be displayed at the top of the electronic document so that a user sees the login element as soon as the page is displayed. For example, this may accomplish a "cut and paste" effect, where the login element is moved from a different section in the electronic document to a portion of the document that is first displayed to the user (e.g., the top of the first chunk of page displayed in a mobile browser).
- the original code for the login is not removed so that the login element only appears in a different portion of the electronic document, but is instead copied.
- the login element may be present in more than one section of the electronic document.
- the login identifier may be part of an expandable user interface element, similar to the user interface element described in association with the ToC identifier.
- the login element is part of the expandable user interface element regardless of the element's placement with the electronic document. For example, referring to FIG. 5, the login element is included within an expandable user interface element labeled "Hide Section.”
- FIG. 6 is an example of a transcoded electronic document, which has a reduction of repetitive text. More specifically, the example shows two scenarios. The first scenario includes two screens that a user would see without a reduction in repetitive content. The second scenario is two screens that the user would see with a reduction in repetitive content.
- an application e.g., a browser
- the second web page displayed includes much of the same text that was included in the first web page.
- the application displays the first web page just as in the first scenario.
- the right arrow to Attorney Docket: 16113-543WO1/GP-1203-00-PCT
- the application displays a portion of the web page that occurs after the repetitive content. This may permit the user to view the new content without having to manually navigate to the new content. In certain implementations, the user may scroll or otherwise navigate up to view the repetitive text.
- reduction of repetitive text can be accomplished by storing the content of the first electronic document and comparing the content of the first electronic document to content of a second electronic document.
- the transcoder 110 can store the content in the system storage 212.
- the content can include text, images, video, audio, etc.
- the formatting information can be excluded from the content that is saved.
- the transcoder 110 can compare the contents of the first and second document. For example, the transcoder 110 can execute a string compare on text content to determine what, if any, text is similar between the first and second electronic documents. If repetitive text exists, the transcoder 110 can insert an anchor tag after the repetitive text, which causes the application on the mobile device 104 to display the non-repetitive text when the second electronic document is displayed to the user.
- the transcoder can compare file names, file sizes, or one or more bytes of media, such as audio files, video files, or images, to determine whether they are repetitive content. For example, if an Attorney Docket: 16113-543WO1/GP-1203-00-PCT
- the transcoder can modify the second electronic document so that it does not play the audio file (e.g., removes the HTML that specifies that the audio file should be played or generates HTML code that instructions the application to mute the audio file).
- a similar process may be performed for video files.
- the transcoder can remove it from the second document or reposition it so that the image is not displayed when the second electronic document is first loaded. For example, the image can be repositioned above the non-repetitive content, similar to the position of the repetitive text in the second scenario.
- repetitive content e.g., text, images, video, etc.
- repetitive content can be included in a user interface element that a user may expand if the user wishes to view the repetitive content.
- multiple repetitive content identifiers can be generated and inserted in the second document. This may allow a user to skip repetitive content by selecting a link that navigates to the next section of non-repetitive content. For example, a block of non-repetitive text may be followed by a block of repetitive text.
- the document generator may embed two tags that permit a user to skip over the repetitive text.
- the first is an anchor tag that identifies the next block of non-repetitive text
- the second is a link that references the anchor tag and navigates to the tag when selected by a user.
- the link may Attorney Docket: 16113-543WO1/GP-1203-00-PCT
- the user may select the link, which causes the application to skip of the following block of repetitive text to the next block of non- repetitive text.
- FIG. 7 is an example of a transcoded electronic document that includes a progress monitor.
- an electronic document can be segmented into multiple sections, or chunks for display on a small screen.
- a progress monitor can be displayed by a mobile device to inform a user which chunk he or she is currently viewing.
- the chunks are sequential divisions of a web page from the top of the web page to the bottom. For example, the first chunk would be a topmost portion of the web page, the second chunk would be a portion below that, and so on, until the last chunk, which would include the bottommost portion of the web page.
- the chunks are not sequential, but may be based on sections or frames that are specified by the electronic document.
- a login section may be one chunk
- legal notices a second chunk
- a search box within a frame may be a third chunk.
- the progress bar can include navigation elements that allow a user to move between different electronic documents (e.g., web pages) or within chunks of a single electronic document.
- the "prev" and "next" navigation elements enable a user to navigate to a previous and next web page, respectively.
- the highlight section within the progress bar can display which chunk within an electronic document a user is currently viewing. In the first screenshot, the user is viewing a first chunk, and in the second screenshot, the user is viewing a second chunk. If a user wishes to navigate to a third chunk, he can select a point in the progress bar at which the third chunk would appear, as shown in the third screenshot.
- the length of the highlighted section can also be dynamically updated to reflect how many chunks are within the electronic document. For example, if there are only two chunks, the highlighted section can be very large relative to the progress bar's total length (e.g., the section can take up half of the progress bar). If there are many chunks, the highlighted section can be smaller (e.g., if there are ten chunks, the highlighted section can be one tenth of the size of the progress bar).
- the progress bar is displayed in a static position as the user navigates through the electronic document. For example, as shown in FIG. 7, the progress bar can remain at the bottom of the display.
