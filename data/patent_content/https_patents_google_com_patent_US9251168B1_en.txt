- This specification is directed generally to determining information about a location, and, more particularly, to determining a characteristic of a location based on visit data that is associated with travel of one or more users to one or more other locations from the location and/or from one or more other locations to the location.
- Characteristics for locations are often based on analysis of Internet documents related to the locations. For example, a webpage associated with a restaurant may be analyzed to determine a restaurant type and whether the restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. Also, for example, user reviews and/or professional reviews for a location may be analyzed to determine what types of users frequent the location and/or to determine a quality measure for the location. Determined characteristics for a location may be associated with the location in a database and may be utilized by one or more applications and/or provided to a user. For example, a user search for restaurants in a particular area may return search results for restaurants that are ranked based on the characteristic and/or that are displayed in combination with an indication of the characteristic.
- the present disclosure is directed to methods and apparatus for determining information about a location based on visit data associated with the location.
- Visit data indicative of travel of users to a first location from one or more other locations and/or of travel of users from the first location to one or more other locations may be utilized to determine information about the location.
- visit data indicative of a user moving from a first location to a second location and/or indicative of a user moving to the first location from the second location may be utilized to determine a connectedness measure and associate the second location with the first location based on the connectedness measure.

- the method may further include the steps of: determining at least one second location characteristic of the second location; and determining at least one first location characteristic of the first location based on the second location characteristic of the second location.
- the step of determining the at least one first location characteristic of the first location based on the second location characteristic of the second location may be dependent on the connectedness measure between the first location and the second location satisfying the connectedness threshold.
- the first location characteristic and the second location characteristic may both be location type characteristics.
- the first location characteristic may be unique from the second location characteristic.
- the location type for the first location may be a venue and the location type for the second location may be a restaurant.
- the step of determining the first location characteristic may include: determining a first time value indicative of time spent at the first location during one or more of the physical visits; determining a second time value indicative of time spent at the second location during one or more of the physical visits; and determining the first location characteristic based at least in part on the first time value and the second time value.

- visit data may be based on one or more of navigational queries, geolocation data from mobile devices, financial transactions at a given location, user indications of visits to a given location, etc.
- visit data may be restricted based on one or more aspects of the visit data. For example, visit data may be restricted based on the range of dates of the visits, days of the week of the visits, and/or time of the day of the visits. Also, for example, visit data may be restricted to certain user attributes associated with the visit data. For example, visit data may be restricted to a certain age range associated with the visit data to determine a connectedness measure between two locations among a particular age range. For example, visit data may be restricted to a certain user type associated with the visit data to determine a connectedness measure between two locations among a particular user type.
- the connectedness measure determination system 120 may associate a first location with a second location based on a connectedness measure.

- a threshold number of users may be at least a threshold percentage of users.
- the threshold percentage may be 2% for a Venue A, it may be determined that the visit data indicates that 5% of the visits to Venue A originated from Restaurant B, and the connectedness measure may be based on such a determination.
- the connectedness measure may be indicative of potential correlation between two locations if at least a threshold number of users indicate a visit between the two locations.
- the threshold may be a fixed threshold.
- the threshold may be based on the location type (e.g., venue, restaurant, retail store) of the first location and/or the second location.
- the threshold may be based on the visit data itself. For example, statistical analysis may be performed on the visit data for Venue A to determine a statistically significant threshold. For example, it may be determined that only Restaurant B and Restaurant C are associated with a statistically significant threshold number and/or percentage of visits to Venue A based on a distribution of numbers of users in visits between locations and Venue A.
- the connectedness measure may additionally be based on the geographical distance between the first location and the second location, wherein a connectedness measure becomes more indicative of correlation between the first and the second location as geographical distance between the first and second location increases. For example, for a Venue A, it may be determined that the visit data indicates that 5% of the visits to Venue A originated from Restaurant B, that 5% of the visits to Venue A originated from Restaurant C, that the distance from Venue A to Restaurant B is 1 mile and the distance from Venue A to Restaurant C is 4 miles. The connectedness measure between Venue A and Restaurant C may be more indicative of correlation than the connectedness measure between Venue A and Restaurant B due to the greater distance between Venue A and Restaurant C.
- the distance between two locations may be based on the distance along a straight line between the two locations. In some implementations the distance between two locations may be based on the distance along one or more travel paths between two locations. For example, the distance may be based on driving, walking, biking, and/or taking public transportation between two locations. In some implementations the distance may be based on any distance indicated by the visit data. For example, the distance between two locations may take into account one or more modes of transportation indicated in the visit data. Also, for example, the visit data may directly indicate a distance traveled for one or more movements between a first location and a second location. In some implementations the distance between two locations may be represented as one or more distributions. Such distributions may be continuous and/or discrete.

- the visit data may indicate a travel time for one or more movements between a first location and a second location.
- the distance between two locations may be based on other measures between the two locations. For example, the distance may be based on the number of intervening neighborhoods, counties, and/or zip codes between two locations. Any determined distance may be based on one or more factors such as those discussed herein. For example, distance between two locations may be based on actual visit data between the two locations and an estimated distance based on one or more travel paths between the two locations. Additional and/or alternative factors may be taken into account in one or more determined distances between two locations.
- the connectedness measure may be based on both the number of users indicating a visit between the first location and the second location and the geographical distance between the first location and the second location.
- the connectedness measure is represented by C
- the number of users indicating a visit between the first location and the second location may be represented by “# of Users”
- the distance between the first location and the second location may be represented by “Distance”
- C may be based on: (# of Users)*(Distance).
- # of Users may be the actual number of users or a percentage of the users and Distance may be the determined distance.
- the # of Users may equal 1 if it satisfies a threshold and equal 0 otherwise.
- the distance may be based on the range in which the distance falls. For example, Distance may be 0.5 for distances between 0 and 1 miles, 0.75 for distances between 1 and 2 miles, 1 for distances between 2 and 4 miles, etc. Additional and/or alternative connectedness measures taking into account the number of users indicating a visit between the first location and the second location and the geographical distance between the first location and the second location may be utilized.
- the connectedness measure may additionally be based on residence times of users at the first location and/or residence times of users at the second location.
- the connectedness measure between two locations may be based on whether an average residence time at the first location and/or an average residence time at the second location satisfies a time threshold.
- short residence times at location A on the way to location B may be less indicative of association between the two locations than would lengthy residence times at location A followed by lengthy residence times at location B.
- visit data related to travel between a first location and a second location may be excluded from a connectedness measure determination if residence time associated with the first location and/or second location of the visit data fails to satisfy a time threshold.
- residence time may not be provided with some or all of the visit data.
- residence time may not be utilized in determining a connectedness measure.
- the connectedness measure between a first location and a second location may additionally be based on one or more geographic characteristics associated with the first location and/or the second location.
- Restaurant A and Restaurant B may be the same distance away from Venue A and the same number of users may travel from Restaurant A to Venue A as travel from Restaurant B to Venue A.
- a path between Restaurant A and a Venue A may pass (or come within a defined diversion distance of) three different restaurants that are similar to Restaurant A on the way to venue A
- a path between Restaurant B and the Venue A may not pass (or come within a defined diversion distance of) any different restaurants that are similar to Restaurant B on the way to venue A.
- the connectedness measure of Restaurant A may be more indicative of association with venue A than the connectedness measure of Restaurant B due to the larger number of similar restaurants bypassed in traveling from Restaurant B.

- the connectedness measure between a given restaurant and a given venue may be based on a number of competing venues within a certain distance of the given venue and/or based on a number of competing venues within a certain distance of the given restaurant.
- the rank for a given restaurant may be based on density of competing restaurants within five miles of the given restaurant.
- the rank for a given location may be based on visit data. For example, visit data from users who indicate travel between two locations may be utilized to determine paths of the users and, for each path, how many competing locations of one or both of the two locations were passed (or within a defined diversion distance) along the path. Also, for example, visit data from a user group that indicates travel to a location may be utilized to determine one or more paths of the users of the user group and, for each path, how many competing locations of the location were passed (or within a defined diversion distance) along the path. A greater number of competing locations passed may lead to a connectedness measure more indicative of association between the locations.
- the connectedness measure may be based on visit data of a plurality of users that indicates at least a threshold number of a first group of users indicating a visit to the first location and at least a threshold number of the second group of users indicating a visit to the second location.

- the first and second groupings may be the same.
- a threshold number may be at least a threshold percentage.
- the threshold percentage may be 5% of total visits for both the first location and the second location, it may be determined that the visit data indicates that 10% of the visits to Venue A originated from the first group of users and that 15% of the visits to Venue B originated from the second group of users, and the connectedness measure may be based on such a determination.
- the threshold associated with the first location may be based on the location type of the first location and/or the location type of the first location.
- the threshold associated with the second location may be based on the location type of the first location and/or the location type of the second location.
- the threshold may be based on one or more attributes of the first group of users and/or the second group of users.
- the threshold may be based on the visit data itself.
- the connectedness measure may additionally be based on the geographical distance traveled by the first group of users to the first location and/or the geographical distance traveled by the second group of users to the second location, wherein a connectedness measure becomes more indicative of correlation between the first and the second location as at least one of the geographical distances increases.
- the visit data indicates that 500 visits to Venue A originated from a first group of users and 500 visits to Venue B originated from a second group of users sharing one or more attributes with the first group of users. It may further be determined that a determined distance value for the first group of users to the Venue A is 4 miles and that a determined distance value for the second group of users to the Venue B is 4 miles.
- the connectedness measure between Venue A and Venue B in such a scenario may be less indicative of connectedness than the connectedness measure if the determined distance value for the first group of users to the Venue A were 8 and/or a determined distance value for the second group of users to the Venue B were 8 miles.
- the determined distance value for a group of users to a location may be based on actual travel distance and/or actual travel time by one or more users in the group in reaching the location.
- the determined distance value may be a mean, median, or other determined statistical measure of actual travel distances identified via visit data.
- the determined distance value for a group of users may be based on the distance along one or more travel paths of the users in reaching the location.
- the determined distance value may be represented as one or more distributions. Such distributions may be continuous and/or discrete.
- the determined distance value for a group of users to a location may be based on actual and/or assumed travel distances of a subset of users of the group.
- the determined distance value may be based on a subset of visit data for which travel times and/or distances is available. In some implementations the determined distance value may be based on other measures between two locations. Additional and/or alternative factors may be taken into account in one or more determined distance value for a group of users.
- the connectedness measure may be based on both: the number of the first group of users indicating a visit to the first location and a number of the second group of users indicating a visit to the second location; and the geographical distance traveled by the first group of users to the first location and/or the geographical distance traveled by the second group of users to the second location.
- the connectedness measure is represented by C
- the number of the first group of users indicating a visit to the first location may be represented by “# of Users 1 ”
- the number of the first group of users indicating a visit to the second location may be represented by “# of Users 1 ”
- the distance value for the first group of users in travelling to the first location may be “Distance 1 ”
- the distance value for the first group of users in travelling to the second location may be “Distance 2 ”
- C may be based on: [(# of Users 1 )*(Distance)]*[(# of Users 1 )*(Distance)].
- # of Users 1 / 2 may be the respective actual number of users or a percentage of the users and Distance 1 / 2 may be the respective determined distance. In some implementations the # of Users 1 / 2 may equal 1 if it satisfies a threshold and equal 0 otherwise. In some implementations the distance may be based on the range in which the distance falls. For example, Distance 1 / 2 may be 0.5 for distances between 0 and 1 miles, 0.75 for distances between 1 and 2 miles, 1 for distances between 2 and 4 miles, etc. Additional and/or alternative connectedness measures may be utilized.

Abstract
Description
In some implementations the quality measure may be based on: n+Σi n piDi, wherein Σi n pi=1 and pi is a weighting factor for each distance associated with another location i. For example, in some implementations pi may be based on one or more factors such as the ranking of location i such as the ranking described herein, the number of users traveling to the given location from the location i, average residence time at the location i, and/or a geographic region characteristic associated with the location i. In some implementations a quality measure for a given location may optionally take into account quality measures from the unique locations from which users navigated to the given location and/or to which users navigated from the given location. For example, where the geographical distance between a given location and another location i is represented by Di, the quality measure of another location i is represented by Qi, another location i is represented by Di, the quality measure may be represented by: Quality Measure=f(n; g(D1, D2, . . . , Dn); h(Q1, Q2, . . . , Qn)) wherein n is the number of locations associated with the given location.
