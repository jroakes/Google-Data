Definitions
- This invention generally relates to targeting videos on a video web site for placements of advertisements and more specifically to targeting videos by audience or content.
- One technique for delivering targeted advertising is for an advertiser to associate an advertisement with particular terms in a search query and/or generally with the set of search results that result from the query. For example, a targeted advertisement can be presented if a particular term appears in a search query. Advertisers can bid for particular terms that are likely to appear in search queries and have their advertisements presented when the terms appear in the query or as keywords (e.g., tags) associated with the videos in the results set.
- keywords e.g., tags
- Embodiments of the invention include methods, computer-readable storage media, and computer systems for targeting videos based on the audience characteristics or the actual content of the video.
- Advertisers search for videos by entering search criteria into a user interface. Advertisers can search based on characteristics of the audience (viewers) of the videos, such as age range, gender, and interests of the viewers, and/or based on metadata associated with the videos. A set of videos that meet the search criteria is then retrieved. Through a graphical user interface, advertisers can select individual ones of these videos or groups of these videos. The selected videos or groups of videos can be added to a media plan associated with the advertiser. The items from the media plan can be imported into an advertising campaign management system, wherein the advertiser's ads are associated with the selected videos or groups of videos. Subsequently, viewers who view videos from among the selected videos and groups of videos also view the advertiser's ads in connection with the videos, for example as instream advertisements or as overlays on the videos.

- An example of data included in the user database 1111 for a specific user includes the video IDs of video files transmitted by the user to the video hosting service 110 and the video IDs of video files that the user has accessed from the videos database 1110 for viewing.
- the user database 1111 also stores demographic information about the user, including the user's gender, age, subject matter interests, income level, where the user lives (e.g., country, state, etc.), and/or any other demographic information.
- the user registration module 1107 creates and manages user accounts for the video hosting service 110 , although in some implementations it is not necessary to have an account to view videos from the video hosting service 110 . For those users who establish accounts, during account creation, users are requested to provide demographic information and a user login is assigned. The user registration module 1107 stores the user demographic information in the user database 1111 associated with the respective login. For users who do not establish accounts, they may be identified by the user's internet protocol address, which the user registration module 1107 can store in the user database 1111 .
- the video search server 1103 processes any search queries received by the front end server 1101 from users seeking to view videos.
- a search query received by the front end server 1101 from a user includes search criteria, such as keywords that may identify videos the user is interested in viewing.
- the video search server 1103 uses the search criteria to query the metadata of video files stored in the videos database 1110 .
- the search results from the query are transmitted to the front end server 1101 for presentation to the user. For example, if a user provides the front end server 1101 with a keyword search query with the word “Lakers” the video search server 1103 identifies videos stored in the videos database 1110 related to the word “Lakers.”
- the video access server 1104 processes requests from users (“viewers”) to access certain videos.
- the video access server 1104 receives a request from a viewer to access a video when the viewer clicks on a link to the video.
- the request received from the viewer includes the video ID of the video the viewer wishes to access for viewing (this can be included automatically once the viewer clicks on the link for the video).
- the video access server 1104 uses the video ID to search and locate the video in the videos database 1110 . Once the requested video is located, the video access server 1104 transmits the video to the viewer via the front end server 1101 .
- the video is presented to the viewer on a web page. Metadata associated with the video may also be presented with the video, such as the title and description of the video.
- the video access server 1104 after transmitting the video to the viewer, stores the video ID of the video transmitted to the viewer in the user database 1111 with the data of the respective viewer. In another embodiment, the video access server 1104 responds to requests from advertisers to preview videos being considered for placements of advertisements.
- the data collection server 1106 collects data on the demographic profile of the users who watch each video, and stores the information in the view count database 1112 according to the demographics.
- the view count can be tallied as a whole for the viewers of a video and tallied separately along each demographic division, such as gender, age, region of the world, etc., if such information is available, for example, if such information has been provided by users.
- the view counts are updated each time a viewer accesses a video. For example, assume User A requests and watches a video B.
- the video access server 1104 notifies the data collection server 1106 that User A has viewed video B.
- the data collection server 1106 pulls the demographic information about User A from the user database 1111 , which in this example contains the information that User A is an 18-year-old male.
- the data collection server 1106 updates the view count database 1112 to reflect that an 18-year-old male has viewed video B.
- the total view count for video B is incremented by 1, as is the view count for males who viewed video B and the view count for 18-year-olds who viewed video B.
- the tallies along any other demographic partitioning can be updated in the view count database 1112 according to the information pulled from the user database 1111 by the data collection server 1106 .
- view counts can be recorded according to a number of different granularities for age ranges and/or recorded according to keywords that are used in users' profiles. If no demographic information about User A is available from the user database 1111 (perhaps because User A has not established an account through the user registration module 1107 ), the total view count for video B is still incremented by 1, but the demographic tallies are not altered.
- the information in the view count database 1112 is used to calculate the number of views per day of each video, which determines the number of impressions per day that an advertiser can expect from placing an ad in connection with the video.
- the information in the view count database 1112 is also used to identify which videos have audiences that skew towards or match demographic characteristics that an advertiser desires for the audience of the advertiser's ads.
- the score of a video with respect to a given audience is computed as follows: Let m be the watches of a video by the target audience; M be the total watches of the video; N be the total watches of the target audience on any video; w be the weight (between 0 and 1 inclusive) given to recall; and then the score of a video is

Abstract
A video hosting service stores and provides video content to a client via a network. Advertisers search for videos to target by entering search criteria into a user interface. Advertisers can search based on characteristics of the audience (viewers) of the videos, such as age range, gender, and interests of the viewers, and/or based on metadata associated with the videos. A set of videos that meet the search criteria is then retrieved. Advertisers can select individual ones of these videos or groups of these videos. The selected videos or groups of videos can be added to a media plan. The items from the media plan can be imported into an advertising campaign management system, wherein the advertiser's ads are associated with the selected videos. Subsequently, viewers who view the selected videos also view the advertiser's ads in connection with the videos.
Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- This invention generally relates to targeting videos on a video web site for placements of advertisements and more specifically to targeting videos by audience or content.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- The sharing of video content on websites has developed into a worldwide phenomenon. On average, over 10,000 videos are posted to video sharing websites every day, and this number is increasing as the tools and opportunities for capturing video become easy to use and more widespread. Shared video content provides opportunities to present advertising to viewers along with the requested video content. Oftentimes, there is a desire to target the advertising to particular types of viewers and content.
- One technique for delivering targeted advertising is for an advertiser to associate an advertisement with particular terms in a search query and/or generally with the set of search results that result from the query. For example, a targeted advertisement can be presented if a particular term appears in a search query. Advertisers can bid for particular terms that are likely to appear in search queries and have their advertisements presented when the terms appear in the query or as keywords (e.g., tags) associated with the videos in the results set.
- Embodiments of the invention include methods, computer-readable storage media, and computer systems for targeting videos based on the audience characteristics or the actual content of the video. Advertisers search for videos by entering search criteria into a user interface. Advertisers can search based on characteristics of the audience (viewers) of the videos, such as age range, gender, and interests of the viewers, and/or based on metadata associated with the videos. A set of videos that meet the search criteria is then retrieved. Through a graphical user interface, advertisers can select individual ones of these videos or groups of these videos. The selected videos or groups of videos can be added to a media plan associated with the advertiser. The items from the media plan can be imported into an advertising campaign management system, wherein the advertiser's ads are associated with the selected videos or groups of videos. Subsequently, viewers who view videos from among the selected videos and groups of videos also view the advertiser's ads in connection with the videos, for example as instream advertisements or as overlays on the videos.

FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram of a computing environment 100 according to one embodiment.FIG. 1 illustrates avideo hosting service 110, an advertisingcampaign management system 120, and aclient 130 connected by anetwork 101. Only oneclient 130 is shown inFIG. 1 in order to simplify and clarify the description. In practices, the computing environment 100 can have thousands or millions ofclients 130, as well as multiplevideo hosting services 110 and advertisingcampaign management systems 120. Someclients 130 will be used by viewers andother clients 130 will be used by advertisers in the manner described below. - The
video hosting service 110 provides video content (referred to herein as “videos”) to theclient 130 via thenetwork 101. In one embodiment, thevideo hosting service 110 is located at a website provided by YOUTUBE, LLC of San Bruno, Calif., although thevideo hosting service 110 can also be provided by another entity. As will be described below in more detail with respect toFIGS. 3A-3B , thevideo hosting service 110 includes databases for storing multiple videos, the descriptions of the content of each video, user demographic data, and data for tracking the views of the videos. Thevideo hosting service 110 also includes avideo targeting tool 1105 that advertisers use to select specific videos or groups of videos with which to show the advertiser's ads. - The advertising
campaign management system 120 manages and stores advertising content, and provides the advertising content (i.e., ads) toclients 130 via thenetwork 101 in association with videos from thevideo hosting service 110. In some instances, the advertising content is in the same format as the content provided by the video hosting service 110 (e.g., is a playable video ad). In other instances, other types of advertising are provided to the clients, such as pure text advertising, advertising providing a hyperlink to an advertiser's website, text-and-audio advertising, and static image advertising. In one embodiment, the functions of the advertisingcampaign management system 120 are provided by thevideo hosting service 110, rather than by a separate system. - The ads managed by the advertising
campaign management system 120 are supplied by an advertiser who selects the specific videos or groups of videos with which to show the ad, using thevideo targeting tool 1105 of thevideo hosting service 110 described herein. The advertiser may submit bids for the specified videos, agree to pay rates specified by a rate card, or agree to other payment terms associated with the video or group of videos. - The
client 130 is a computer or other electronic device used by one or more users to perform activities including viewing video content received from thevideo hosting service 110 and viewing advertising received from the advertisingcampaign management system 120. Theclient 130, for example, can be a personal computer executing aweb browser 132 that allows the user to browse and search for videos available from thevideo hosting service 110. In other embodiments, theclient 130 is a network-capable device other than a computer, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a pager, a television “set-top box,” etc. Whereas some users useclients 130 to access thevideo hosting service 110 primarily to view videos, advertisers also useclients 130 to access thevideo hosting service 110 to select videos in connection with which to show advertising, as will be described in detail below. - The
network 101 represents the communication pathways between thevideo hosting service 110, the advertisingcampaign management system 120, and theclient 130. In one embodiment, thenetwork 101 is the Internet. Thenetwork 101 can also utilize dedicated or private communications links that are not necessarily part of the Internet. In one embodiment, thenetwork 101 uses standard communications technologies and/or protocols. Thus, thenetwork 101 can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber line (DSL), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on thenetwork 101 can include the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), the file transfer protocol (FTP), etc. The data exchanged over thenetwork 101 can be represented using technologies and/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML), the extensible markup language (XML), etc. In addition, all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as the secure sockets layer (SSL), Secure HTTP and/or virtual private networks (VPNs). In another embodiment, the entities can use custom and/or dedicated data communications technologies instead of, or in addition to, the ones described above. -
FIG. 2 is a high-level block diagram illustrating an example of acomputer 200 for use as a server computer in thevideo hosting service 110, an advertisingcampaign management system 120, and/orclient 130. Illustrated are aprocessor 202 coupled to abus 204. Also coupled to thebus 204 are amemory 206, astorage device 208, akeyboard 210, agraphics adapter 212, apointing device 214, and anetwork adapter 216. Adisplay 218 is coupled to thegraphics adapter 212. - The
processor 202 may be any general-purpose processor. Thestorage device 208 is, in one embodiment, a hard disk drive but can also be any other device capable of storing data, such as a writeable compact disk (CD) or DVD, or a solid-state memory device. Thememory 206 may be, for example, firmware, read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), and/or RAM, and holds instructions and data used by theprocessor 202. Thepointing device 214 may be a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with thekeyboard 210 to input data into thecomputer 200. Thegraphics adapter 212 displays images and other information on thedisplay 218. Thenetwork adapter 216 couples thecomputer 200 to thenetwork 101. - As is known in the art, the
computer 200 is adapted to execute computer program modules. As used herein, the term “module” refers to computer program logic and/or data for providing the specified functionality. A module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. In one embodiment, the modules are stored on thestorage device 208, loaded into thememory 206, and executed by theprocessor 202. Thecomputer 200 is configured to perform the specific functions and operations by various modules, for example as detailed inFIGS. 3A-3B , and thereby operates as a particular computer under such program control. - The types of
computers 200 utilized by the entities ofFIG. 1 can vary depending upon the embodiment and the processing power utilized by the entity. For example, aclient 130 that is a mobile telephone typically has limited processing power, asmall display 218, and might lack apointing device 214. A server in thevideo hosting service 110, in contrast, may comprise multiple blade servers working together to provide the functionality described herein. -
FIG. 3A is a high-level block diagram illustrating elements of thevideo hosting service 110 according to one embodiment. Some embodiments of thevideo hosting service 110 have different and/or other modules than the ones described here. Similarly, the functions can be distributed among the elements in accordance with other embodiments in a different manner than is described here. Depending upon the embodiment, certain modules can be incorporated into other modules of thevideo hosting service 110 and/or other entities on thenetwork 101, including theclient 130. Regardless of the particular arrangement, in all instances thevideo hosting service 110 is specifically configured by the modules it is executing and thereby operates as a particular computer system. - As shown in
FIG. 3A , thevideo hosting service 110 includes afront end server 1101, an ingestserver 1102, avideo search server 1103, avideo access server 1104, avideo targeting tool 1105, adata collection server 1106, and auser registration module 1107. Thevideo hosting service 110 also includes avideos database 1110, auser database 1111, and aview count database 1112. - The
front end server 1101 handles communication with theclients 130 via thenetwork 101. The front end server provides a user interface in a web page to theclient 130, and interactions withclients 130 are handled through the user interface. For example, a user may select videos to view through the webpage provided to user'sclient 130. As another example, an advertiser receives a separate webpage at itsclient 130 to select videos in connection with which to show targeted advertising. Examples of the user interface web pages for targeting videos by audience characteristics and content are shown inFIGS. 5-10 . Thefront end server 1101 receives requests from theclients 130 and communicates with the other servers of thevideo hosting service 110 to process the requests. - The ingest
server 1102 processes video files received by thefront end server 1101 from a user for posting to thevideo hosting service 110. In one embodiment, the processing of a video file received includes assigning a video identification (video ID) to the video file and storing the video file in avideos database 1110. Other steps that may be involved in the processing of the received video file before storing it in thevideos database 1110 include: formatting (e.g., transcoding), compressing, metadata tagging, content analysis, and/or other data processing methods. In one embodiment, thefront end server 1101 also receives a form with the video file received from the user. The form includes information entered by the user about the video, such as the title, description, and tag information. The ingestserver 1102 stores the information included in the form as metadata of the video file in thevideos database 1110. Additionally, the ingestserver 1102 updates data contained on the user that transmitted the video file to thevideo hosting service 110 in theuser database 1111. In one embodiment, the ingestserver 1102 stores the video ID assigned to the stored video file with the data of the respective user in theuser database 1111. - In one embodiment, the
videos database 1110 is a storage system that includes video files shared by thevideo hosting service 110 with users. All of the videos contributed by one entity are referred to as a single “channel.” The videos stored in thevideos database 1110 may also be organized into vertical hierarchical categories according to content, referred to herein as “verticals,” with categories higher in the hierarchy being more general than categories lower in the hierarchy. For example, a category for a hip-hop music artist might belong to the category “entertainment|music|urban|artist.” Here, “entertainment” is the top category, “music” is a sub-category of entertainment, “urban” is a sub-category of music, and “artist” (i.e., the name of the artist) is a sub-category of urban. - The
user database 1111 includes data on users that communicate with thevideo hosting service 110. An example of data included in theuser database 1111 for a specific user includes the video IDs of video files transmitted by the user to thevideo hosting service 110 and the video IDs of video files that the user has accessed from thevideos database 1110 for viewing. Additionally, theuser database 1111 also stores demographic information about the user, including the user's gender, age, subject matter interests, income level, where the user lives (e.g., country, state, etc.), and/or any other demographic information. - The
user registration module 1107 creates and manages user accounts for thevideo hosting service 110, although in some implementations it is not necessary to have an account to view videos from thevideo hosting service 110. For those users who establish accounts, during account creation, users are requested to provide demographic information and a user login is assigned. Theuser registration module 1107 stores the user demographic information in theuser database 1111 associated with the respective login. For users who do not establish accounts, they may be identified by the user's internet protocol address, which theuser registration module 1107 can store in theuser database 1111. - The
video search server 1103 processes any search queries received by thefront end server 1101 from users seeking to view videos. A search query received by thefront end server 1101 from a user includes search criteria, such as keywords that may identify videos the user is interested in viewing. Thevideo search server 1103 uses the search criteria to query the metadata of video files stored in thevideos database 1110. The search results from the query are transmitted to thefront end server 1101 for presentation to the user. For example, if a user provides thefront end server 1101 with a keyword search query with the word “Lakers” thevideo search server 1103 identifies videos stored in thevideos database 1110 related to the word “Lakers.” - The
video access server 1104 processes requests from users (“viewers”) to access certain videos. In one embodiment, thevideo access server 1104 receives a request from a viewer to access a video when the viewer clicks on a link to the video. The request received from the viewer includes the video ID of the video the viewer wishes to access for viewing (this can be included automatically once the viewer clicks on the link for the video). Thevideo access server 1104 uses the video ID to search and locate the video in thevideos database 1110. Once the requested video is located, thevideo access server 1104 transmits the video to the viewer via thefront end server 1101. The video is presented to the viewer on a web page. Metadata associated with the video may also be presented with the video, such as the title and description of the video. In one embodiment, after transmitting the video to the viewer, thevideo access server 1104 stores the video ID of the video transmitted to the viewer in theuser database 1111 with the data of the respective viewer. In another embodiment, thevideo access server 1104 responds to requests from advertisers to preview videos being considered for placements of advertisements. - The
data collection server 1106 collects data on the demographic profile of the users who watch each video, and stores the information in theview count database 1112 according to the demographics. The view count can be tallied as a whole for the viewers of a video and tallied separately along each demographic division, such as gender, age, region of the world, etc., if such information is available, for example, if such information has been provided by users. The view counts are updated each time a viewer accesses a video. For example, assume User A requests and watches a video B. Thevideo access server 1104 notifies thedata collection server 1106 that User A has viewed video B. Thedata collection server 1106 pulls the demographic information about User A from theuser database 1111, which in this example contains the information that User A is an 18-year-old male. Thedata collection server 1106 updates theview count database 1112 to reflect that an 18-year-old male has viewed video B. Thus, the total view count for video B is incremented by 1, as is the view count for males who viewed video B and the view count for 18-year-olds who viewed video B. Likewise, the tallies along any other demographic partitioning can be updated in theview count database 1112 according to the information pulled from theuser database 1111 by thedata collection server 1106. For example, view counts can be recorded according to a number of different granularities for age ranges and/or recorded according to keywords that are used in users' profiles. If no demographic information about User A is available from the user database 1111 (perhaps because User A has not established an account through the user registration module 1107), the total view count for video B is still incremented by 1, but the demographic tallies are not altered. The information in theview count database 1112 is used to calculate the number of views per day of each video, which determines the number of impressions per day that an advertiser can expect from placing an ad in connection with the video. The information in theview count database 1112 is also used to identify which videos have audiences that skew towards or match demographic characteristics that an advertiser desires for the audience of the advertiser's ads. The score of a video with respect to a given audience is computed as follows: Let m be the watches of a video by the target audience; M be the total watches of the video; N be the total watches of the target audience on any video; w be the weight (between 0 and 1 inclusive) given to recall; and then the score of a video is -
- The
video targeting tool 1105 of thevideo hosting server 110 will now be described with reference toFIG. 3B . The video targeting tool includes acriteria receipt module 11051, avideo search engine 11052, a resultspage formation module 11053, and amedia plan module 11054. - In one embodiment, the
front end server 1101 of thevideo hosting server 110 provides a web page containing a user interface that allows an advertiser to input video search criteria. An advertiser uses thebrowser 132 of aclient 130 to enter the search criteria and submit it to thefront end server 1101 that passes the criteria to thecriteria receipt module 11051. The search criteria include one or more characteristics of the viewers of the video or criteria relevant to the content of the video. Thecriteria receipt module 11051 extracts the search criteria from the advertiser's input. In one embodiment, the advertiser's input is in the form of a search query, and the criteria receipt module 11501 receives the search query and parses it by performing tasks including verifying the query syntax, filtering out stop words, identifying the query terms, and identifying any query parameters. The criteria receipt module 11501 then provides the search criteria to the other modules of thevideo targeting tool 1105. - A video search engine 11502 of the
video targeting tool 1105 processes the criteria received from the advertiser via thecriteria receipt module 11051. Thevideo search engine 11052 uses the criteria to query thevideos database 1110 to find videos that satisfy the input criteria. - A results
page formation module 11053 forms a results page containing search results generated in response to thevideo search engine 11052 querying thevideos database 1110. The resultspage formation module 11053 forms a results page that lists the video results, and may also list associated information like suggested alternative queries and options for ranking the results. The resultspage formation module 11053 may include one or more thumbnail images from the videos in the result set, and may include information such as the title of the video, a description of the video, a rating of the video, the date the video was contributed, the total number of view of the video and the number of view per day, the length of the video, and/or any other descriptive information related to the video that has been stored as metadata in thevideos database 1110. The resultspage formation module 11053 passes the results page to thefront end server 1101 to provide to theclient 130. The advertiser can select videos of interest for placing ads from the results page. - The
media plan module 11054 manages the selected videos and groups of videos for which the advertiser has expressed an interest in placing ads. Themedia plan module 11054 displays the advertiser's selections, for example in a list, and the user can add or delete items from the list. In one embodiment, the items from the media plan can be imported into an advertising campaign management system 114, such as GOOGLE ADWORDS™ wherein the advertiser's ads are associated with the selected videos or groups of videos.
