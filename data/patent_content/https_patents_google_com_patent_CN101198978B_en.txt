Abstract
The invention relates to a method for determining a congregation formed by one or more taxonomy categories by receiving keywords related to the property and using some keywords and/or information. Each of the taxonomy categories can be a vertical category, and can have at least one property (e.g., Web document) that participates in an advertising network. An advertiser selection of a suggested taxonomy category can be accepted, and the serving of an ad of the advertiser can be targeted to each of the at least one property (e.g., Web document) associated with the selected suggested taxonomy category; and an offer for association with the selected suggested taxonomy category can be provided by the advertiser. The set of one or more taxonomy categories may be performed by determining a set of one or more semantic clusters (e.g., term co-occurrence clusters) using the accepted keyword(s) and/or property information.
Description
Technical field
The application relates to advertising, publicizes such as online advertisement.Especially, the present invention relates to help the effectively selected target that presents its advertisement of advertiser.
Background technology
The advertising of the traditional media such as use such as TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine is well-known.Regrettably, even used the demographic studies data and about the fully reasonably hypothesis of each media typical audience, the advertiser finds that still a large amount of advertising budgets is waste purely.And, identify and eliminate this waste and also be difficult to.
Recently, become universal via the advertising of interactive media more.For example, along with the number of using the Internet is increased sharply, the advertiser begins to recognize that the media and the service that provide via the Internet become potential strong advertising.
Interactively advertisement provides chance to the advertiser, so that they can throw in those glad audients who receives their advertisement as target.That is, there is the advertisement of target more likely useful to the final user, because these advertisements relevant with the demand of inferring according to certain user's activity (for example, relevant to the search inquiry of search engine with the user, relevant with the content in the document of user request etc.).Search engine is using searching keyword to determine that target is to send relevant advertisement.General headquarters are positioned at the AdWords ad system of the Google (Google) in California, USA Mountain View city, are that target is come delivering advertisements by the keyword in the inquiry inquiry.Similarly, ad delivery system take content as target has been proposed.For example, submit on Dec 6th, 2002, the invention people be Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Hank and Paul Buchheit, name to be called " METHODS AND APPARATUS SERVINGRELEVANT ADVERTISEMENTS ", sequence number be 10/314,427 U.S. Patent application (" 427 apply for " incorporated herein for your guidance and be called to its content by reference into); And submit in February in 2003 26, the invention people be Darrell Anderson, Paul Buchheit AlexCarobus, Claire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar, name is called " SERVING ADVERTISEMENTSBASED ON CONTENT " sequence number is that 10/375,900 U.S. Patent application (" 900 apply for " incorporated for your guidance and be called to its content by reference into) has all been described the method and apparatus that the document content that is relevant to such as webpage provides advertisement.The ad delivery system take content as target such as the AdSense ad system of Google has been used for providing advertisement at webpage.
" advertising network " is the set of the gathering of website (or some other media asset), and the advertiser can be by throwing in advertisement to single side payment at advertising network.Many advertising networks are by artificial foundation and " vertical (vertical) " (can find the group of Related product, service, industry and/or proposition in Web content) its website of tissue of keeping.For example, " Slashdot.org " is technology vertical/Ji Suanji ﹠amp; The part of technology, and " iVillage " is family/Sheng Huofangshi ﹠amp vertical with dwelling house; Community/Women Issue.The advertiser will pay to make their advertising display on these each websites as predetermined vertical.
Regrettably, what these were predetermined vertically also can only want to allow advertisement by the actual demand of its audient's perception near the advertiser usually, because the target audience may not be fixed on predetermined vertical (such as, may the predetermined vertical granularity less, not scheduled vertical covering etc.).For example, the advertiser wants take the student software developer as target, may need have target to render to their advertisement and own on " technology " vertical website, thereby this audient can be seen.Therefore, in having assembled the advertising network that belongs to certain vertical or website that some is vertical, described vertical too wide in range for many advertisers' demand.
Hierarchical arrangement vertically can be used for the target selection that provides narrower or wider.But for using the vertical advertising network of layering, difficulty is to safeguard this vertical demixing.In addition, more fine-grained vertical if add to more website, if perhaps abundant advertiser need to have vertical thinner division now, then to determine that system adds possibly new vertical for advertising objective.But even provide this new vertical, the advertiser also may not use it.For example, the advertiser may not know that this is new vertical, may lose more than gain for obtaining the hand labor that more fine-grained target requires, etc.
From the foregoing, present advertising network uses the network of their websites of vertical " bucket " or " storehouse " tissue of artificial definition to be used for advertisement selection usually.There are many inefficiency parts in this method.Can only provide and to judge the set of websites of organizing by the mankind such as most of advertising networks.Process more advertiser and/or website when advertising network, this inefficiency will be aggravated.
In view of the problem in the above-mentioned existing advertising network, if can allow the advertiser define and/or organize the set of the website in the advertising network needn't only depend on the inflexible vertical of publisher's definition to satisfy their specialized market's demands, that will be very useful.

As an example, the advertiser may participate in the relevant advertising (such as the AdWords from Google) of advertisement search key word of the inquiry and may use specific key word (such as Wine in this activity, Wine tasting, Wine enthusiast and California wine).Nature, the source of these key words need not to be the relevant advertising campaign of search keywords that is pre-existing in.As other example, the advertiser may know that it wants that on the specific website of having known (such as www.winesite1.com and winesite2.com) advertises.Fig. 9 illustrates the part 900 of display frame, have section 850 ', its center 860 ' and 870 ' respectively comprise key word and the website that the advertiser inputs.Then this advertiser can ask to belong to the related web site of this advertising network by selecting " Find Sites＞" button 910.
Figure 10 shows the display frame 1000 that comprises webpage part, this webpage comprise frame 860 for Fig. 9 ' and 870 ' shown in given input key word and " Find Sites " request results of website.This result 1010 comprises some data item.This advertiser can filter these as a result websites.For example, drop-down menu 1015 can so that the advertiser only show website, the website that can receive image ad that can receive text and image ad, the website that can receive text advertisements, etc.Each of these data item can comprise the station address 1030 with the link of pointing to this website.In such a way, the advertiser can check the website by selecting hypertext link to fetch.Each data item also can comprise the statistics about this website, and for example every day manifests (page browsing) quantity.See shown in the frame 1050, the advertiser can think that the set of one or more websites formation of display advertisement is added or deleted in the above to it.For example, but advertiser's check box 1025 and can add respectively and delete such website with button 1055 and 1060.The advertiser can provide button 1020 so that can select (inspection) all data item.At last, as shown, button 1070 can be provided so that the advertiser can use in the frame 1050 the website as input (as use frame 870 ' in the website of listing) search other websites (as be classified into as described in website in the same or analogous verticals categories in input website).
Suppose that the advertiser has added some websites in it wants to be used to provide the set of websites of advertisement.Shown webpage part (not shown) can comprise command element (such as 820,830,840 among similar Fig. 8) so that this advertiser can provide advertisement campaign information in display frame 1000, be used for selected website certain some its advertisement is provided as target.For example, referring to Figure 11, screen-picture part 1100 can comprise the information of relevant advertising creative, such as the small image of advertisement 1110, and some data item 1120.Each data item: can comprise check box 1130, the text of website (may with link) 1140, the current status information 1150 that whether participates in this advertising network in relevant this website, the quotation information 1160 of advertiser's input, the various statisticss 1170 of this advertisement are as selecting (click), manifesting number of times, selection rate (CTR), the average cost (CPM) that manifests for per thousand times, total expenses etc.The data area information of relevant advertising campaign also can be provided by the advertiser, shown such as instrument element 1180.
How to be used for advising that the advertiser wants the website as target although above-mentioned example shows embodiment according to the invention, the present invention is not limited to such embodiment.For example, as mentioned above, embodiment according to the invention can be used for the suggestion advertisement mainly as the verticals categories of target.
Example 2
Suppose that Bayerische Motorne Werke Aktiengeellschaft (BMW) plan starts the brand building advertising campaign at certain advertising network.For example, suppose that it has the advertising campaign of " BMW-is refining such as good wine ", the people that these advertisements are intended to drink (these people are highly related with the luxurious car buyer) is target.BMW can input wine.com and winespectator.com (recalling 870 among Fig. 8) with the website recommendation tools consistent with the present invention and be intended as two examples of the website of target as it.This website recommendation tools is checked the website of two inputs and for each searches most popular cluster (such as the phil cluster) (review Fig. 3 322).
Use these clusters, this website recommendation tools can use cluster-document associations (look back Fig. 3 326) and/or cluster-classification related (look back Fig. 3 328) and classification-document associations to return the individual website of optimum N (such as N=500) of sorting by the correlativity score.
Use filter utility, BMW can be placed on it to focus and think on maximally related verticals categories and/or the website.Can provide the statistics about this website of paying close attention to this advertiser, such as page browsing number, minimum CPM (as being pointed out by web publisher) and average CPM (as being quoted for this website by other advertisers).BMW can be with filtering and check box selects to choose the website of specific CPM of will bidding, and this CPM is used in the website of this selection.Can use identical mechanism afterwards change to be done in these settings.Suppose BMW input 3 as " user can watch the maximum times of advertisement " frequency limitation, page browsing every day that is estimated as 200K with acquisition spent with the every day that is estimated as 1,000.00.
Suppose that working as BMW consults this list of websites, have several websites to seem suspicious, and after clicking them and checking web site contents, cancellation is to the selection of these websites from this tabulation.Can select to label to these cancellations, be used for (as artificial) quality comment.
Suppose that BMW has enough large budget to further expand this tabulation, they just click " add more sites (adding more multi-site) " button and input " fine cuisine (cuisines) " as key word (looking back the frame 860 of Fig. 8) like this.Suppose and return other 100 websites, wherein great majority are loose relevant.But supposition BMW still finds 15 websites that they select (can cancel select every other and select these 15 such as them), and this networking station is arranged 3 CPM bid.
At last, suppose that BMW allows " automatically notify me of new sites similar tomy target list (automatically notifying me similar my new site of object listing) " selection tool element keep being examined state.Like this, suppose that BMW has notice after two weeks, two new websites that are considered to be correlated with have been added this advertising network to, and invite these two websites are added in the targeted website set of BMW.
Suppose that final summary (looking back such as the hypertext 840 among Fig. 8) provides page browsing every day that is estimated as 300K and spends with the every day that is estimated as $ 1,250.00, this satisfies target cost of BMW.
Example 3
Suppose that Google (Google) plans the software developer is advertised and sets up " Google developers wanted " text advertisements at AdWords.Suppose so Google at website recommendation tools input " Slashdot.com " and " freshmeat.com " (frame 870 of review Fig. 8).Then to the advertiser present comprise Slashdot a series of developers community website as output.Suppose website " Freshmeat " not in this advertising network, it is illustrated as " inactive (inactive) ".Only plan to advertise at Slashdot although Google is initial, it is being provided 10 closely similar " developer community websites " afterwards, it may be changed mind.Like this, it may determine at all these website bid $ 5.00 CPM.Suppose that Google do not plan to receive the notice of relevant new website, then so not select " automatically notify me of new sitessimilar to my target list (automatically notifying me similar my new site of object listing) " check box.Further supposition Google uses and is defaulted as " user can watch the maximum times of advertisement " value of 5, can be considered to " waste advertisements " because the advertisement that exceeds this number of times is provided to the user.
Suppose at afterwards website " Freshmeat " and join this advertising network.In this case, can automatically become the bid of " Freshmeat.com " website movable.
