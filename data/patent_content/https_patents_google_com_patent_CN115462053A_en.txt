Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to establishing an initial bit rate for real-time communications.
Background
Audio and video communications over digital networks have become commonplace, the quality of these communications being controlled to a large extent by the bit rate. The bit rate is the number of bits (e.g., kbit/s or kbps) communicated over the communication channel per unit time. The higher the bit rate, the more bits that are propagated in the same given time, and the higher the quality. However, if the bit rate exceeds the available bandwidth of the communication channel, a delay may be incurred in buffering sufficient data, thereby significantly reducing the communication quality. When real-time communication is initiated, an initial bit rate must be selected. Typically, the initial bit rate is a fixed value that is predetermined. Due to the variety of user and network conditions, a fixed bit rate may not be an ideal value.

Detailed Description
The overall quality of digital communications is greatly affected by the communication bit rate. The bit rate is the number of bits (e.g., kbps or Mbps) communicated per unit time. Since the higher the bit rate, the higher the communication quality, in general, a high bit rate is preferred. However, bit rates that exceed the available bandwidth of the communication channel can cause delays and freezes, thereby greatly reducing communication quality, since using bit rates that exceed the capacity of the channel can cause buffering, ultimately resulting in packet loss in the network router. In typical communications, a predetermined fixed value is used to establish the initial bit rate. When the initial bit rate is set too low (i.e., well below the bandwidth of the communication link), the quality of the communication will be artificially degraded (e.g., large amounts of audio or visual artifacts, low resolution, etc.). In addition, significant delays or freezes may occur when the initial bit rate is set too high (i.e., higher than the bandwidth of the communication link can support). Accordingly, it is desirable to more accurately reflect the initial bit rate of the available bandwidth of the communication link between the parties.
Embodiments herein are directed to an initial bit rate determiner that determines an initial transmission bit rate for a user equipment that establishes digital communication with another user equipment. The initial bit rate determiner includes an initial bit rate predictor model that generates a probability density function for an average bit rate of the digital communication between the first user equipment and the second user equipment. An initial bit rate determiner samples the probability density function to determine an initial bit rate for the digital communication and establishes the digital communication between the first user equipment and the second user equipment at the determined initial bit rate.
Referring to FIG. 1, in some embodiments, an example system 100 includes two or more user devices 10, user devices 10a-n, each associated with a respective user 12, 12a-n, and communicating with a remote system 140 over each network 112, network 112 a-n. The user device 10 may communicate with any computing device, such as a desktop workstation, a laptop workstation, or a mobile device (i.e., a smartphone). The user device 10 includes computing resources 18 (e.g., data processing hardware) and/or storage resources 16 (e.g., memory hardware).
The remote system 140 may be a single computer, multiple computers, or a distributed system (e.g., a cloud environment), with extensible/resilient computing resources 144 (e.g., data processing hardware) and/or storage resources 142 (e.g., memory hardware). Data store 146 (i.e., remote storage device 146) may be overlaid on storage resources 142 to allow one or more clients or computing resources 144 to use storage resources 142 in a scalable manner. The remote system 140 is configured to receive and transmit video and/or voice data signals, such as signals associated with a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) call or video chat application, between the user equipment 10, 10a-b, via the network 112, 112 a-b. Thus, a first caller 12a using a first user device 10a may place a telephone or video call (e.g., send a communication request 21) to a second user device 10b through a remote system 140. User devices 10, 10a-b communicate by sending digital communication data signals over networks 112, 112a-b to remote system 140. The communication data signal is segmented into a series of data packets 20, for example by TCP/IP or UDP protocols, each data packet 20 comprising a representation of one or more audio/video samples 22 of the communication signal from a respective user device 10.
The remote system 140 or each user device 10 executes an initial bit rate determiner 150 to determine an initial bit rate 180 for each user device 10 prior to establishing digital communication between the first user device 10a and the second user device 10b. In some examples, the initial bit rate 180 is the initial transmission bit rate 180 because the upload bandwidth tends to be lower than the download bandwidth for most users 12. That is, the initial transmission bit rate 180 determines the bit rate at which the corresponding user device 10 transmits the digital communication (i.e., the data packet 20) to the other user devices 10 at the beginning of the digital communication. In some embodiments, the remote system 140 determines the initial bit rate 180 for each user device 10 independently. The remote system 140 may also determine the same initial bit rate 180 for each user device 10. In other examples, each user equipment 10 executes an independent initial bit rate determiner, which determines a corresponding independent initial bit rate 180. For example, prior to establishing digital communication, an initial bit rate determiner 150a executing on a first user equipment 10a determines an initial bit rate 180a for transmissions from the first user equipment 10a, while an initial bit rate determiner 150b executing on a second user equipment 10b determines an initial bit rate 180b for transmissions from the second user equipment 10b.
The initial bit rate determiner 150 uses the initial bit rate predictor model 160 to determine an initial bit rate 180 for each user equipment 10. In some embodiments, the initial bit rate predictor model 160 is trained on training data 190 generated from a corpus of training communication records 192, each training communication record 192 being associated with a corresponding training digital communication and including a corresponding plurality of features 310 and an actual bit rate (e.g., an average bit rate, a median bit rate, etc.) of the corresponding training digital communication. That is, the initial bit rate predictor model 160 may be trained on training data 190, the training data 190 including historical training communication records 192 having features 310 and corresponding actual bit rates of corresponding digital communications. The actual bit rate may have any kind of suitable statistical association with the historical training communication, such as an average bit rate, a median bit rate, or other representation.
Referring now to fig. 2A and 2B, in general, a digital communication service uses a predetermined fixed value as an initial bit rate. However, due to the wide variety of network conditions and user equipment, the predetermined fixed value is often sub-optimal. While digital communication services may ultimately cope with an undesirable initial bit rate by adjusting the bit rate accordingly, users may still experience communication degradation (e.g., video freeze, delay in starting communication, etc.) prior to adjustment. Fig. 2A and 2B illustrate respective transmission bit rate maps 200a, 200B, each having an x-axis representing time (in seconds) and a y-axis representing the transmission bit rate (in kilobits per second (kbps)) for digital communications. In diagram 200a of fig. 2A, the initial predetermined bit rate is 300kbps, but the upload link of the transmitting user equipment is only 120kbps. Because of this bottleneck, graph 200a shows that a significant network latency peak 210a occurs immediately after communication is established because the packets are queued using the upload link. In contrast, plot 200b of fig. 2 shows that the initial bit rate is set to 120kbps, resulting in no significant network delay peaks, as the upload link can keep pace with the transmission bit rate. Since the encoder does not strictly follow the initial bit rate, resulting in a slightly higher actual bit rate, a slight delay peak may occur, causing some delay.
Referring to fig. 1, an initial bit rate predictor model 160 receives a data packet 20 including a communication request 21 and a plurality of characteristics 310 associated with the communication request. In some examples, the audio/video samples 22 in the data packets 20 are pre-processed to improve the quality of the data before or after feature extraction. As described in more detail below, the plurality of features 310 define a plurality of features (e.g., network types) of the digital communication. The model 160 may be a neural network or other algorithm, such as a decision tree, logistic regression, recurrent Neural Network (RNN), long Short Term Memory (LSTM), deep Feed Forward (DFF), or any other type of neural network or algorithm. In some examples, the model 160 generates a probability distribution 164 of all possible average bit rates for the respective user equipment 10 during digital communications. That is, because the average bit rate of the digital communication may be a good representation of the channel capacity (i.e., the upload bandwidth of the communication channel between the first user equipment and the second user equipment), the probability distribution 164 generates a probability for each possible communication average bit rate in the set of average bit rates. Each average bit rate in the set includes a corresponding probability that will be the average bit rate of the digital communication (i.e., the average bit rate of the entire digital communication). In other words, the model 160 predicts the average bit rate of the upcoming digital communication between the first user equipment 10a and the second user equipment 10b. Other statistical characterizations may be used instead of averages (e.g., median). The set of average bit rates includes a minimum average bit rate (e.g., 100 kbps) and a maximum average bit rate (e.g., 5 mbps), and each of the other average bit rates in the set is distributed between the minimum average bit rate and the maximum average bit rate. Each average bit rate in the set of average bit rates may represent a range of bit rates (e.g., 100kbps to 300 kbps).
After determining the initial bit rate 180 from the probability distribution 164, the user equipment 10 may establish digital communication with other user equipment 10 at the determined initial bit rate 180. For example, the first user equipment 10a (or the remote system 140) determines a first initial bit rate 180a and transmits the data packet 20 to the second user equipment 10b at the first initial bit rate 180 a. Likewise, the second user equipment 10b (or the remote system 140) determines a second initial bit rate 180b and transmits the data packet 20 to the first user equipment 10a at the second initial bit rate 180b.
Referring now to fig. 3, the initial bit rate predictor model 160 is configured to receive a plurality of characteristics 310 associated with the digital communication request 21. In some embodiments, the plurality of features 310 includes a geographic identifier 310a (also referred to as a country category 310 a) that identifies a geographic location associated with the respective user device 10. That is, the characteristics 310 may include a country category 310a of the respective user device 10. The country category 310a represents a country (i.e., a political state or a nation) in which the corresponding user equipment 10 is currently located. The geographic identifier 310a may be determined in a variety of ways (e.g., an IP address, a GPS signal, etc.).
In some embodiments, the geographic identifier 310a includes a country group selected from a plurality of country groups. Each country group may include a respective country group having a homogeneous historical average bit rate for digital communications. That is, rather than setting an entry for each possible country, the geographic identifier 310a may group countries. For example, the countries canada, the united states and mexico are all included in "group a," and the geographic identifier 310a of any user device located in any one of these three countries represents group a. Such grouping may greatly reduce the number of possible selections of geographic identifiers 310a.
In some embodiments, each country group of the plurality of country groups is based on a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering). For example, when countries are grouped based on similarity of average bit rates, the deviation is reduced by normalizing the average bit rates of a set of percentiles (e.g., 10 percentiles, 50 percentiles, and 90 percentiles). In some examples, these normalized percentiles are used as features with different weights for clustering. Using k-means clustering, the initial bit rate determiner 150 may cluster the countries into a plurality of classes or groups (e.g., five groups). Optionally, the initial bit rate determiner 150 includes a geographical position as a further feature to reduce noise.
In a further example, the plurality of characteristics 310 includes a previously communicated average bit rate 310d. In some embodiments, the previous digital communication average bit rate 310d represents the average bit rate of the most recent or last digital communication that used the same local network type as the current local network type connection 310b for the pending digital communication. The user device 10 and/or the remote system 140 may store in non-volatile memory (e.g., memory hardware 146) the most recent previously communicated average bit rate 310d for each network type that the user device 10 uses to establish digital communication with another user device 10. For example, when the user device 10a sends a communication request 21 to the remote system 140 over the 3G network (i.e., network 112 a), the user device 10a and/or the remote system 140 determines the average bit rate of the most recent digital communication of the user device 10a using the 3G network. Thus, each user device 10 and/or remote system 140 may store an average bit rate for each possible network type (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, wi-Fi, ethernet, etc.). In some embodiments, the plurality of features 310 includes a plurality of average bit rates 310d of previous communications. In this example, different average bit rates are assigned different weights. For example, the most recent average bit rate is assigned a higher weight and thus has a greater impact.
With continued reference to fig. 3, in some embodiments, the average bit rate of the previous digital communication 310d of the respective user equipment 10 is represented by a bit rate bucket 311a-n selected from a plurality of bit rate buckets 311. In the example shown, there are a bit rate bucket 311a for 100 to 300kbps, a bit rate bucket 311b for 301 to 500kbps, a bit rate bucket 300c for 501kbps to 1mbps, and a bit rate bucket 311d for greater than 1mbps, for a total of four bit rate buckets 311a-d. These bit rate buckets 311 are merely exemplary, and any number of buckets 311 representing any range of bit rates may be used. In one example, the plurality of bit rate buckets 311 includes ten bit rate buckets 311. Each bit rate bucket 311 of the plurality of bit rate buckets 311 is associated with a respective bit rate range that does not overlap with a respective bit rate range associated with any other bit rate bucket 311 of the plurality of bit rate buckets 311. Bit rate bucket 311 may greatly reduce the number of possible choices of average bit rate of previous digital communications 310d.
The plurality of features 310 may include other features that are features of the user device 10a, the user device 10b, or the network 112a, 112 b. For example, the plurality of features includes additional features that describe the other user device 10b. In another example, the plurality of characteristics 310 includes a distance between the first user device 10a and the second user device 10b.
With continued reference to fig. 3, the initial bit rate predictor model 160 may include one or more layers 320. For example, the model 160 includes two hidden layers. One or more of the layers may be a fully connected layer (e.g., dense layer 320 a). In another example, the one or more layers are softmax layers. Optionally, the model 160 includes other layers (e.g., SVDF layer, bottleneck layer, etc.). The last layer of the model 160, (e.g., softmax320b in the illustrated example) outputs a probability distribution 164 of possible average bit rates of digital communications between the first user device 10a and the second user device 10b.
Referring now to fig. 4, the initial bitrate determiner 150 may further include a converter 400. Conversion in some embodiments, converter 400 converts initial bit rate predictor model 160 to look-up table 410. Here, look-up table 410 includes an array containing each value that model 160 is capable of outputting. These values are indexed so that they can be accessed based on multiple features 310, and when the same features 310 as the model 160 are provided, the look-up table 410 provides the same or nearly the same output (i.e., the initial bit rate 180). That is, after conversion by converter 400, initial bitrate determiner 150 can bypass model 160 and determine initial bitrate 180 of the digital communication by accessing lookup table 410 based on the plurality of features 310. The look-up table 410 may substantially reduce processing time relative to the model 160 while reducing storage requirements. In some embodiments, the remote system 140 trains the model 160 and converts the model 160 into a look-up table 410, and then transmits the look-up table 410 to the first user device 10a and/or the second user device 10b. The user device 10 may store the lookup table 410 locally and access the lookup table 410 using the plurality of characteristics 310 associated with the corresponding communication request 21 to determine the initial bit rate 180 for the digital communication. In another example, the look-up table 410 is stored in the memory hardware 146 of the remote system 140. Here, in response to the communication request, the user device 10 may access a look-up table 410 stored on the memory hardware 146 using the plurality of characteristics 310 associated with the communication request 21. Alternatively, the remote system 140 may simply push the appropriate initial bit rate 180 directly to each user device 10.
In other embodiments, converter 400 converts initial bit rate predictor model 160 to function 420. This function 420, when provided with the same input (i.e., the plurality of features 310) as the model 160, generates the same or substantially the same output (i.e., the initial bit rate) as the model 160. Thus, after conversion by converter 400, initial bitrate determiner 150 can bypass model 160 and determine initial bitrate 180 of the digital communication by providing plurality of features 310 as inputs to function 420. The function 420 may be generated in various ways (e.g., curve fitting, etc.).
In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to select an initial bitrate that maximizes audio and/or video quality while minimizing the risk of overdosing (i.e., selecting a bitrate that exceeds the maximum capacity of networks 112a, 112 b). Fig. 5A shows a graph depicting a rate-distortion curve 510 based on the bit rate and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of a digital communication (e.g., video and/or audio data transmitted and compressed via a digital communication). PSNR is a commonly used indicator for representing digital communication quality, where higher PSNR values are associated with higher digital communication quality. The PSNR may represent the quality of the compressed video and/or audio data as compared to the original (i.e., uncompressed) video and/or audio data. The utility function may generate a rate-distortion curve 510, where the x-axis of the graph represents the bit rate and the y-axis of the graph 500 represents the PSNR. In some examples, initial bitrate determiner 150 determines initial bitrate 180 of the digital communication between first user equipment 10a and second user equipment 10b by selecting bitrate bucket 311 from a plurality of bitrate buckets 311 based on probability distributions 164 of possible average bitrates of rate-distortion curves 510 (e.g., the same bitrate bucket 311 used to classify the average bitrate of previous digital communication 310 d). That is, the determiner 150 uses the model 160 to generate probability distributions 164 of possible average bit rates for the respective user equipment 10 during the digital communication, and then uses the rate-distortion curve 510 to select an initial bit rate 180 for the digital communication. It is apparent that rate-distortion curve 510 may help select an initial bit rate 180 for communication to optimize the quality of digital communication and mitigate the risk of bandwidth overshoot. More specifically, simply selecting the initial bit rate associated with the highest probability in the probability distribution 164 may undesirably increase the risk of bandwidth overshoot, so the determiner 150 may reference the rate-distortion curve 510 to select a lower value for the initial bit rate 180 to provide a homogeneous quality benefit while reducing the risk of bandwidth overshoot.
In one example, the graph 500 shows PSNR versus bit rate quality for audio or video communications according to a rate-distortion curve 510. Since the rate-distortion curve 510 is not linear, when the bit rate is low (and quality is poor), a small change in bit rate results in a greater quality increase than when the bit rate is high (and quality is correspondingly high) for the same magnitude of bit rate change. As shown by rate-distortion curve 510, a first delta bit rate change 530a results in an increase in first delta PSNR 540 a. Likewise, a second bit rate change 530b, of the same magnitude as the first bit rate change, results in an increase in the second bit rate PSNR 540 b. Since the first delta bit rate change 530a occurs at a much lower bit rate than the second delta bit rate change 530b, the first delta PSNR 540a is much larger than the delta PSNR 540 b. That is, although the first delta bit rate change 530a increases the bit rate by the same magnitude as the second delta bit rate change 530b, a greater increase in quality is provided than the delta bit rate change 530 b.
In some embodiments, initial bit rate determiner 150 determines initial bit rate 180 based on probability distribution 164 and rate-distortion curve 510 to minimize the risk of the uplink bit rate being too high. As shown in table 550 of fig. 5B, each bit rate bucket 311 (bit rate bucket 0, bit rate bucket 1, bit rate bucket 2, bit rate bucket 3, bit rate bucket 4, and bit rate bucket 5 in this example) accumulates a prediction probability representing that the current channel bandwidth is greater than the corresponding bit rate bucket 311 based on probability distribution 164. In the example shown, based on one exemplary probability distribution 164, there is a 100% chance that the bit rate is greater than bucket 0, 85% chance, the bit rate is greater than bucket 1, 65% chance, the bit rate is greater than bucket 2, and so on. In some examples, initial bitrate determiner 150 defines a confidence threshold and selects bitrate bucket 311 when bitrate bucket 311 meets the confidence threshold. In the example shown, when the confidence threshold is 75%, bit rate bucket 1 is the closest bit rate bucket 311 that meets (e.g., exceeds) the confidence threshold, and thus initial bit rate determiner 150 selects bucket 1.
In some embodiments, the initial bitrate determiner 150 takes into account the audio and/or video encoder of the user equipment 10. The encoder attempts to generate the best perceived communication quality (i.e., minimize distortion) under a set of constraints such as channel bandwidth. The output bit rate of the encoder depends on the quantization step size. Rate-distortion curve 510 (fig. 5A) may obtain the bit rate and distortion by encoding all possible quantizers. The rate-distortion curve is always convex due to the statistical nature of the audio and video signals. Based on the rate-distortion curve 510, each bit rate bucket 311 may be assigned a corresponding bit rate bucket 311. Referring to fig. 5C, table 560 shows that as the bandwidth associated with a respective bit rate bucket 311 increases, increasing the corresponding confidence threshold may help improve the tradeoff between quality gain and risk of bandwidth overshoot.
Fig. 6 is a flow chart of an exemplary configuration of operations of a method 600 for determining an initial bit rate for a digital communication between a first user equipment and a second user equipment. The method 600 includes, step 602, receiving a communication request 21 at the data processing hardware 18, 144 to establish digital communication between the first user equipment 10a and the second user equipment 10b. The communication request is associated with a plurality of features 310, including a geographic identifier 310a identifying a geographic location associated with the first user device 10a. In some examples, geographic identifier 310a includes a country group selected from a plurality of country groups, and each country group includes a respective country group having a homogeneous historical average bit rate for digital communications. Each country group of the plurality of country groups may be based on k-means clustering.
The plurality of features 310 also includes a first network type connection 310b associated with the first user device 10a for establishing digital communication with the second user device 10b and a second network type connection 310c associated with the second user device 10b for establishing digital communication with the first user device 10a. In some embodiments, the first network type connection 310b and the second network type connection 310c comprise one of a 2G network, a 3G network, a 4G network, a 5G network, a Wi-Fi network, an ethernet connection, an unknown network, and the like. The first network type connection 310b may comprise the same type of network connection as the second network type connection 310c.
The plurality of characteristics 310 further includes an average bit rate of previous digital communications 310d of the first user equipment 10a. The previous digital communication, in some examples, includes the most recent digital communication established for the first user device 10a using the first network type connection 310 b. Optionally, the average bitrate of the previous digital communication 310d of the first user equipment 10a is represented by a bitrate bucket 311 selected from the plurality of bitrate buckets 311, and each bitrate bucket 311 of the plurality of bitrate buckets 311 is associated with a respective bitrate range that does not overlap with the respective bitrate range associated with any other bitrate bucket 311 of the plurality of bitrate buckets 311.
At step 604, the method 600 includes determining, by the data processing hardware 18, the initial bit rate 180 for digital communication between the first user device 10a and the second user device 10b using the initial bit rate predictor model 160 configured to receive the plurality of features 310 as feature inputs. In some embodiments, the initial bit rate predictor model 160 is configured to generate a probability distribution 164 of the likely average bit rate of the first user equipment 10a during the digital communication. Determining an initial bit rate 180 for the digital communication may include selecting one bit rate bucket from a plurality of bit rate buckets 311 based on the probability distribution 164 of possible average bit rates and based on a graph 500 of a rate-distortion curve 510. In some examples, the model 160 is trained on a corpus of training communication records 192, each training communication record 192 being associated with a corresponding training digital communication having a corresponding plurality of features 310 and an average bit rate 182 (i.e., an actual average bit rate of the corresponding communication). The method further comprises, step 606, establishing, by the data processing hardware 18, the digital communication between the first user equipment 10a and the second user equipment 10b at the determined initial bit rate 180.
In some embodiments, method 600 includes converting, by data processing hardware 18, data processing hardware 144, initial bit rate predictor model 160 to lookup table 410, and determining initial bit rate 180 for the digital communication includes accessing lookup table 410 based on the plurality of features 310. In some examples, method 600 includes converting, by data processing hardware 18, data processing hardware 144, initial bit rate predictor model 160 to function 420, and determining initial bit rate 180 for the digital communication includes using function 420 to calculate initial bit rate 180 based on the plurality of features 310.
