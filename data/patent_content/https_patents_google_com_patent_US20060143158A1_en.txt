- Backend server 102 collects product reviews, or information containing product reviews for a plurality of products ( 302 ).
- collecting information comprises selectively crawling review-related Web sites or portions thereof and retrieving information containing product reviews.
- Selective crawling differs from traditional crawling in that the crawler only follows selected links on Web pages, rather than all links.
- crawling module 220 To initiate a crawl, crawling module 220 is given a set of starting (sometimes called “seed”) URLs (Uniform Resource Locators, i.e., web addresses) to crawl.
- seed Uniform Resource Locators, i.e., web addresses
- Crawling module 220 puts these URLs in queue 222 .
- Crawler 226 continuously fetches pages corresponding to the URLs in the queue 222 until either there more no more URLs in the queue 222 , or a crawl termination condition is reached.
- link parser 224 tells crawler 226 how to extract new links to follow from a fetched page by matching regular expression patterns.
- link parser 224 tells crawler 226 how to extract new links to follow from a fetched page by using text classification techniques.
- Table 1 contains pseudo code for a link parser 224 that selects which links to follow on an exemplary website (www.productcompany.com) for reviews of electronics products.
- Crawler 226 outputs the crawled pages to fetched pages buffer 228 .
- the fetched pages buffer may contain one or more files or other data structures.
- link parser 224 parses the page and attempts to extract links (URLs) to follow that, if found, are added to queue 222 .
- URLs links
- parser 224 may identify such links based on the presence of terms or patterns in the URLs of the links, or based on the anchor text of the links.
- Anchor text is text contained in or otherwise associated with a link.
- the information containing product reviews can be collected from a wide variety of sources, including web pages and forum postings.
- the web pages comprise Web pages of review-related Web sites and/or product-related Web sites.
- collecting information comprises receiving product reviews in a predetermined digital format, for example as data streams from multiple product reviewers.
- the predetermined digital format of the product reviews may comprise key/value pairs, or data organized in predefined data structures.
- collecting information comprises selecting information from a repository of information collected by a web crawler.
- Backend server 102 automatically extracts product reviews from the collected information ( 304 ).
- review parser 232 which is analogous to link parser 224 , extracts content pertaining to a review (e.g., the review text, author, and date), as well as content that identifies the product that the review is about (e.g. the product name, model number, or other features), from the fetched pages in buffer 228 .
- the extracted information is stored in extracted reviews buffer 234 .
- extracted reviews buffer 234 contains a list of key/value pairs denoting the extracted product review information, such as the review author, content, publisher, and so on.
- each extracted review found on a web page is encoded and stored in a respective review record in the extracted reviews buffer 234 .
- Table 2 lists the fields of each review record in the extracted reviews buffer 234 in an exemplary embodiment.
- each review record may have a subset of the fields listed in Table 2, and may also include additional fields.
- the review records might not include the ReviewType and CrawlDate fields.
- the Rating field may be a numeric field, instead of a string field.
- each review record may include both a string Rating field and a normalized numeric rating field (e.g., normalized with respect to a rating scale of 0 to 1, or 0 to 5).
- the keyword “required” indicates a required field
- “repeated” indicates a field that may occur more than once in a record (and in rare cases, may have zero occurrences)
- “optional” indicates an optional field.
- Optional fields may be present in some review records, while not present in other review records, for example because some reviews may not include the optional information.
- the data structure fields shown in Table 2, except ReviewID, ReviewType, QualityScore and ClusterID, are filled with data from the extracted review information if information relevant to those fields are found in the extracted review information.
- the ReviewID is a unique identifier assigned to each individual review by the aggregated reviews backend server.
- the ReviewType indicates whether the review is an editorial review, or a review submitted by a user.
- QualityScore which provides a measure of the quality of a review, is determined based on the review's length and word entropy (which measures, among other things, the diversity of the words or terms used in the review). As explained below, all reviews belonging to the same product form a “cluster” and the ClusterID identifies the cluster to which a review belongs.
- Backend server 102 automatically identifies particular products that are associated with particular product reviews ( 306 ). For at least some of the extracted product reviews, backend server 102 identifies a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review.
- identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review comprises associating a unique number or string in the extracted product review with a particular product.
- the unique number or string is a product model number.
- the unique number is an ISBN number.
- identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review comprises associating a brand name and a model number in the extracted product review with a particular product. In some embodiments, identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review comprises associating a brand name, a model number, and a product category in the extracted product review with a particular product.
- identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review is simple if the product review includes the global identifier.
- extracted brand names and model numbers in the above example, the brand name is “canon”, and the model numbers are “lide30” and “7890a002”
- category information such as the fact that the above product is a scanner
- reviews about the same product form a “cluster” and “clustering” refers to identifying reviews for the same product.
- this information is stored in review records (Table 2) by review extraction module 230 .
- Extracted brand names, model numbers and category information may all be stored in the ProductNames fields of the review records.
- each review record may include a Model field for storing a model number, a Category field for storing product category information, and a Names field for storing brand name information for a respective product.
- Model, Category and Brand Name are not explicitly identified on a web page.
- this information is deduced from the title string or other fields of the extracted review.
- product category and model number can be inferred by the review parser 232 or the review aggregating module 236 as follows. Given a title string, the part of the title string beyond words like “for”, “with”, and “featuring” is ignored. Words in the title string are traversed from right to left and the first word (or pair of words) that is included in a data file containing a predefined list of product categories is considered the product category.
- this data file also identifies, for each distinct product category, a list of other product category names for the product category that are mapped to one canonical name. For example, “notebooks”, “notebook”, “laptop” or “laptops” may all be mapped to the canonical name, “notebooks”. Thus, a title string such as “Canon canoscan lide 30 color scanner with free extras” would be mapped to the category “scanner”.
- model numbers the title string is traversed from left to right and the first word that contains digits (i.e., characters from ‘0’-‘9’) is concatenated with the preceding word to form a model number.
- the resulting model number is discarded if it matches any of the regular expression patterns corresponding to blacklisted model numbers or contains a brand name or parts of a brand name.
- An example of a blacklisted pattern is “pentium ⁇ d+”+” (i.e., “pentium” followed by a string of digits).
- “lide 30 ” is extracted as the model number. Note that more than one model number can be inferred for a product name.
- the brand names are identified by matching words in the product title with known (i.e., predefined) brand names in a list or dictionary of such brand names.
- the brand name of a product may be extracted from the URL of the page on which the product review is found.
- two product reviews are assigned to the same cluster (product) if they have the same exact brand name, and agree on their model numbers and categories.
- Two reviews are said to agree on a model number if the set of model numbers extracted for them have a non-empty intersection.
- Two categories are said to agree if they are the same or at least one of them is unknown.
- two product reviews are assigned to the same cluster (product) if they have the same exact brand name and agree on their model numbers.
- reviews corresponding to products for which brand or model information cannot be determined are put into a singleton cluster of their own and are not clustered with any other reviews.
- review aggregating module 236 fills in the ClusterID field in the review record for the extracted review.
- backend server 102 For each particular product in at least a subset of the plurality of products, backend server 102 generates aggregated review information for the particular product based on a plurality of extracted product reviews that are associated with the particular product ( 308 ).
- review aggregating module 236 uses the reviews for a particular product to generate aggregated review information for the product that is stored in aggregated review buffer 240 .
- the aggregated review information for the particular product comprises a total number of reviews for the product, an average rating for the product, a distribution of the ratings for the product, and/or frequently appearing phrases in the extracted product reviews associated with the product.
- One or more additional types of aggregated review information may be included in the aggregated review information in other embodiments.
- the average rating is the average of weighted ratings from different web sites.
- the weight of a single review on a web site with K reviews for the same product is 1/K.
- the weight given to reviews from a particular web site or reviewer can be personalized by a user. For example, a user can specify via a preferences dialog box one or more web sites (e.g., www.consumerreports.org) and/or reviewers (e.g., Roger Ebert) preferred by the user. The ratings given in the reviews associated with the user's preferred sources are then given higher weight when computing an average rating for a product.
- the ratings given in reviews associated with the user's preferred sources are given N times the default weight assigned to those reviews, where N is a value such as 2, 2.5, 3 or any other appropriate value greater than 1.
- frequently appearing phrases in the extracted product reviews associated with a particular product are computed by review aggregation module 236 as follows. For all the phrases (e.g., unigrams, bigrams or trigrams that do not span across sentences) that occur in reviews associated with a product (cluster), the number of their weighted occurrences is counted. Occurrences in the review title or summary are given a higher weight. When computing or selecting frequently appearing phrases, all stop words and, words that occur in the title of the product name are ignored. Each phrase is given a score equal to the length of the phrase times the square root of the sum of weighted occurrences of the phrase. A predetermined number of phrases with the highest scores (e.g., the top 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 phrases) that do not overlap each other are chosen as the frequent phrases and stored in aggregated review buffer 240 .
- scores e.g., the top 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 phrases
- Table 3 lists the fields of each aggregated review record, produced by aggregating information from all the extracted reviews for a particular product, and stored in the aggregated reviews buffer 240 .
- each aggregated review record may have a subset of the fields listed in Table 3, and may also include additional fields.
- a separate instance of the aggregated review record is included in the aggregated reviews buffer 240 and in the reviews database 242 for each distinct product.
- each aggregated review record includes a ClusterID (identifying the product associated with this record), a list of ReviewID's (each of which is uniquely associated with a review of the product), a list of the words or phrases most frequently found in the reviews of the product, and a computed average rating of all the reviews for the product.
- an aggregated review record also includes one or more of the following additional fields: a string identifying the product, a number specifying the number of reviews in the cluster; and data concerning the distribution of ratings in the reviews for a product, such as the number of reviews with low, medium and high ratings, as well as the number of reviews having no product rating.
- Backend server 102 automatically stores the extracted product reviews 244 and the aggregated review information 246 in reviews database 242 ( 310 ).
- each stored product review in the reviews database 242 comprises a record that includes the same information as the corresponding review record (Table 2) stored in the extracted reviews buffer 234 , while in other embodiments, the stored product review may comprise a subset of the information stored in the corresponding review record.
- reviews indexer 248 indexes the individual product reviews 244 and the aggregated review information for a product 246 and stores the results in reviews index 250 .
- Client 104 sends a request for an aggregated review for a product ( 402 , FIG. 4 ).
- the request is sent in response to a user-initiated activity, such as a user clicking on a hyperlink.
- a user looking at web page 650 with various products for sale could activate hyperlink 652 to see an aggregated review for product 654 .
- frontend server 100 receives the request ( 404 ) for an aggregated review for a product and obtains ( 406 ) the aggregated review.
- product information 254 in product database 252 is linked to aggregated reviews for the corresponding products by product-to-review map 256 .
- map 256 contains mappings of product identifiers used by a first website or service (e.g., a product information website) to the ClusterIDs used by the frontend server 100 .
- the process of assigning product identifiers to products in the first website or service may be analogous to the process described above for identifying particular products that are associated with particular product reviews.
- map 256 is determined by matching a global identifier for a particular product (e.g., an ISBN number) in product database 252 with a corresponding review cluster.
- Product-to-review map 256 is used to identify the aggregated review (in the reviews database 242 ) corresponding to a product.
- Presentation module 264 formats the aggregated review.
- the reviews index 250 is used to identify the individual reviews corresponding to the aggregated review for a product. More specifically, the reviews index 250 maps the ClusterID of the aggregated review to the individual reviews for the product associated with the aggregated review.
- Frontend server 100 sends ( 408 ) the aggregated review to client computer 104 via communications network 106 .
- Client 104 receives ( 410 ) and displays ( 412 ) the aggregated review 600 ( FIG. 6B ).
- aggregated review 600 includes portions of reviews 626 for the product and a search input area 618 for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms. Search input area 618 is used to enter search terms for a search that only returns results that are within the reviews for the product.
- aggregated review 600 includes a histogram 608 of review ratings for the product, an aggregate rating 604 for the product, and/or the number 606 of reviews for the product. In some embodiments, aggregated review 600 is displayed in a single Web page.
- review search module 258 supports two different types of queries: (1) search within the reviews 262 belonging to a single product (e.g. a search for “customer service” in the reviews for a given product) and (2) search all reviews 260 to find a particular product (e.g. a search for “good digital camera”).
- Aggregated review 600 FIG. 6B , shows a search input area 618 for the first type of search.
- a variety of user initiated activities can start the search process, including the user entering search terms in search input area 618 , selecting a hyperlink for a frequently appearing phrase 620 , selecting a hyperlink to a review source 622 , or selecting a hyperlinked portion (e.g., 610 , 612 , 614 , or 616 ) of histogram 608 .
- client 104 sends ( 502 , FIG. 5 ) a request to search within a plurality of reviews for a particular product.
- frontend server 100 receives ( 504 ) the search request from client 104 and obtains ( 506 ) information satisfying the request.
- the information is obtained by review search module 258 sending two queries to reviews database 242 .
- the first query all individual reviews (sometimes called “documents”) that contain the search terms are found.
- the first query is restricted to the main body (e.g., the “review content” fields) of the reviews index 250 , and only to individual reviews that belong to the product (cluster).
- a second query is then issued to obtain portions of all reviews that are to be displayed.
- the ordering preferences submitted by the user e.g., by clicking on 636 , 638 , 640 , and/or 642 ) as well as the start position are used to determine which reviews to display.
- the start position indicates the ordinal number within an ordered set of reviews at which to begin formatting reviews for display.
- Frontend server 100 sends ( 508 , FIG. 5 ) at least a portion of the obtained information to client 104 .
- Client 104 receives ( 510 ) information satisfying the request and displays ( 512 ) the received information, e.g. in web page 660 , FIG. 6C .
- Client 104 displays at least portions 662 of reviews of the product matching the search terms 664 .
- the information sent by frontend server 100 and received by client 104 includes at least portions 662 of reviews for the particular product that satisfy the search request. In some embodiments, this information includes the identities 666 of the review sources contributing to the sent information.
- the information is also obtained by review search module 258 sending two queries to reviews database 242 .
- first query all individual reviews that contain the search terms are found, without restricting the search to a particular product (cluster).
- the results of the first query are grouped by cluster (product).
- a second query is then issued to obtain portions of at most three (or some other small number) reviews in each cluster, which are restricted to be from different publishers.
- information about each of the clusters such as the total number of reviews and the average rating, is also requested, obtained, and sent for display.
- the graphical user interface 600 ( FIG. 6B ) on client computer 104 comprises a plurality of portions 626 of reviews for a product and a search input area 618 for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms.
- the plurality of portions of reviews can be grouped by review source 636 , sorted by date 642 , and sorted by relevance to the search input 640 , or sorted by quality of review when the user has not provided a search input.
- more or fewer sorting and grouping options may be provided for sorting and/or grouping the reviews.
- graphical user interface 600 also includes, either alone or in various combinations: an aggregate rating 604 for the product; a list of suggested search terms 620 ; a list of sources 622 for the reviews that link back to the source Web sites or to the corresponding reviews; at least one user selectable link for sorting the portions of reviews by date 642 or relevance to the search input 640 , and/or for grouping the portions of reviews by source 636 ; and/or a histogram 608 of reviews for the product.
- clicking on a region e.g., 610 , 612 , 614 , or 616
- clicking on region 616 may generate a new display showing portions of reviews having high ratings for the product.
- An aggregated rating 604 is given to the product by calculating an average over all reviews for the product.
- the ratings in the individual reviews 244 and in the aggregated reviews 246 are normalized, e.g., to a 0-1 or 0-5 scale.
- the aggregated rating 604 and number 606 of reviews are changed to reflect the average rating and number of reviews matching the search. This change in the aggregated rating can help users answer questions like, “How do reviewers that discuss ‘customer service’ rate this product?”
- the aggregated rating 604 and number 606 of reviews are not changed to reflect the average rating and number of reviews matching the search.
- Commonly used phrases e.g., unigrams, bigrams or trigrams appearing in the reviews for the product are displayed as a list of suggested search terms 620 . Phrases that contain the product name and stop-words (such as “the”) are removed to improve the quality of the suggested search terms. Clicking on one of the phrases results in displaying just the reviews that contain the user selected phrase. This is equivalent to entering the phrase into the search box 618 with quotes around the phrase and then initiating a search. Showing these phrases gives the user a good idea which aspects of the product are most frequently discussed in the product reviews, and thus which aspects of the product might be important to know about.
- the list of review sources 622 includes links to the sites from which reviews for the product have been obtained, or a subset thereof. In some embodiments, after a search within reviews for a product, the list of review sources 622 just includes links to the sites from which reviews matching the search have been obtained, or a subset thereof. In some embodiments, the links lead to the main pages for the given product on each source web site. In some embodiments, the links lead to the product reviews matching the search.
- a histogram 608 with a rating distribution of the reviews includes the number of reviews that are unrated 610 (in some embodiments, displayed as a gray area), negative 612 (in some embodiments, displayed as a red area), neutral 614 (in some embodiments, displayed as a yellow area) and positive 616 (in some embodiments, displayed as a green area).
- the rating distribution is displayed as a flat histogram, where the length of each colored bar is proportional to the number of reviews in the category. Clicking on a histogram results in a search 262 that just shows the corresponding reviews, e.g. clicking on the red bar 612 results in showing just the negative reviews.
- Search input area 618 allows a user to enter arbitrary search terms for the search within reviews for a given product. As shown in FIG. 6C , in some embodiments the search terms are highlighted in portions of reviews 626 that match the search query.
- User selectable links permit the displayed list of reviews to be sorted in various ways, such as by:
- a portion 626 of the review e.g., a snippet
- the portion or snippet 626 of each review may be generated using the same or similar techniques to those used to generate snippets of search results in an Internet search engine such as the Google search engine.
- the portion of each review shown may be a portion matching one or more search terms that were used to select the reviews to be displayed.
- the portion of each review shown may be a beginning portion of the review.
- the portion of each review shown may be a portion determined by an automatic process to be a summary or most important portion of the review.

One aspect of the invention is a graphical user interface on a computer that includes a plurality of portions of reviews for a product and a search input area for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms.
Description
- The disclosed embodiments relate generally to search engines. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to methods, systems, and graphical user interfaces for finding, aggregating, and providing reviews for a product.
- Many Internet users research a product (e.g., a Canon digital camera) or a service (e.g., a hotel room in Hawaii) before obtaining it. Currently, the approach that many users follow is to use Internet search engines. Users issue a search query that contains the product or service name plus terms like “review” and sift through the myriad of results that are returned by the search engine. While some of these results do contain reviews about the product, many results do not. Moreover, it is very difficult to get a holistic view of all the reviews. In short, this process is fairly cumbersome, time consuming, and inefficient.
- Alternatively, users may go to Web sites that provide reviews and ratings for products, such as www.amazon.com, www.epinions.com, and www.circuitcity.com. A few sites, such as www.rottentomatoes.com, movies.yahoo.com, and www.consumersearch.com, aggregate reviews for the same product from several sites. However, some of these sites aggregate reviews manually, which is very inefficient and limits the number of reviews that can be gathered for each product. Moreover, all of these sites are very limited in the tools they provide users to navigate through the reviews.
- Thus, it would be highly desirable to provide tools that enable users to more efficiently conduct research on the products and services they are interested in obtaining (e.g., by purchase, lease, rental, or other similar transaction).
- The embodiments disclosed herein include new, more efficient ways to collect product reviews from the Internet, aggregate reviews for the same product, and provide an aggregated review to end users in a searchable format.
- In one aspect of the invention, a client sends a request for an aggregated review for a product, receives the aggregated review, and displays the aggregated review. The aggregated review includes portions of reviews for the product and a search input area for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms.
- In another aspect of the invention, a server receives a search request from a client computer to search within a plurality of reviews for a particular product, obtains information satisfying the request, and sends at least a portion of the obtained information to the client computer. The sent information includes at least portions of reviews for the particular product that satisfy the search request.
- Another aspect of the invention is a graphical user interface on a computer that includes a plurality of portions of reviews for a product and a search input area for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms.
- As used in the specification and claims, the word “product” refers to both products and services. Moreover, “product” encompasses virtually any product, service or combination thereof that can be bought, leased, rented, or similarly obtained. Exemplary products include, without limitation, consumer products, business products, movies, books, restaurants, hotels, and travel packages.
- For a better understanding of the aforementioned aspects of the invention as well as additional aspects and embodiments thereof, reference should be made to the Description of Embodiments below, in conjunction with the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the figures.

The actual number of servers used to implementbackend server 102 andfrontend server 100 and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart representing a method for collecting and aggregating reviews for a product according to one embodiment. The process shown inFIG. 3 is performed by aggregated reviews backend server 102 (FIGS. 1 and 2 A). It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that one or more of the acts described may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems. -
Backend server 102 collects product reviews, or information containing product reviews for a plurality of products (302). - In some embodiments, collecting information comprises selectively crawling review-related Web sites or portions thereof and retrieving information containing product reviews. Selective crawling differs from traditional crawling in that the crawler only follows selected links on Web pages, rather than all links.
- To initiate a crawl,
crawling module 220 is given a set of starting (sometimes called “seed”) URLs (Uniform Resource Locators, i.e., web addresses) to crawl. -
Crawling module 220 puts these URLs inqueue 222.Crawler 226 continuously fetches pages corresponding to the URLs in thequeue 222 until either there more no more URLs in thequeue 222, or a crawl termination condition is reached. In some embodiments,link parser 224 tellscrawler 226 how to extract new links to follow from a fetched page by matching regular expression patterns. In some embodiments,link parser 224 tellscrawler 226 how to extract new links to follow from a fetched page by using text classification techniques. As an example of the former approach, Table 1 contains pseudo code for alink parser 224 that selects which links to follow on an exemplary website (www.productcompany.com) for reviews of electronics products.TABLE 1 Exemplary Pseudo Code for Crawling Module with Link Parser Initialize crawler queue with seed page(s) from the www.productcompany.com website; For each URL in the queue, do the following { download page from URL, and remove the URL from the queue; extract product reviews, if any, on the page, and parse and store the extracted product reviews; search page to see if any portion of the page matches any predefined pattern in a set of predefined patterns (contentpattern1, contentpattern2, ...); if the page does not match any of the one or more predefined patterns { processing of the page is complete;} // otherwise, continue processing the page collect all links on the page; process each link as follows { if the URL of the link matches any predefined pattern in a set of predefined patterns (linkpattern1, linkpattern2, ...) OR if the anchor text of the link matches any predefined pattern in a set of predefined patterns (anchorpattern1, anchorpattern2, ...), do the following: { optional: remove unneeded fields from the URL of the link; put the URL of the link on the crawler queue;} } // Links that do not match any of the predefined pattern(s) are not put on the queue // The patterns used in the processing of the crawled pages may be specific to the // website from which product review information is being extracted. -
Crawler 226 outputs the crawled pages tofetched pages buffer 228. In some embodiments, the fetched pages buffer may contain one or more files or other data structures. For each page that is fetched,link parser 224 parses the page and attempts to extract links (URLs) to follow that, if found, are added toqueue 222. As noted above, in contrast to traditional crawls, not all the links in a page are followed by the crawler. Rather, only those links that parser 224 identifies as potentially leading to review pages are followed. For instance,parser 224 may identify such links based on the presence of terms or patterns in the URLs of the links, or based on the anchor text of the links. Anchor text is text contained in or otherwise associated with a link. - The information containing product reviews can be collected from a wide variety of sources, including web pages and forum postings. In some embodiments, the web pages comprise Web pages of review-related Web sites and/or product-related Web sites.
- In some embodiments, collecting information comprises receiving product reviews in a predetermined digital format, for example as data streams from multiple product reviewers. The predetermined digital format of the product reviews may comprise key/value pairs, or data organized in predefined data structures. In some embodiments, collecting information comprises selecting information from a repository of information collected by a web crawler.
-
Backend server 102 automatically extracts product reviews from the collected information (304). In particular,review parser 232, which is analogous to linkparser 224, extracts content pertaining to a review (e.g., the review text, author, and date), as well as content that identifies the product that the review is about (e.g. the product name, model number, or other features), from the fetched pages inbuffer 228. The extracted information is stored in extractedreviews buffer 234. In some embodiments, extracted reviews buffer 234 contains a list of key/value pairs denoting the extracted product review information, such as the review author, content, publisher, and so on. - The information extracted from a single web page may correspond to multiple reviews. In some embodiments, each extracted review found on a web page is encoded and stored in a respective review record in the extracted
reviews buffer 234. Table 2 lists the fields of each review record in the extractedreviews buffer 234 in an exemplary embodiment. In other embodiments, each review record may have a subset of the fields listed in Table 2, and may also include additional fields. For example, in some embodiments, the review records might not include the ReviewType and CrawlDate fields. In some embodiments, the Rating field may be a numeric field, instead of a string field. Alternately, in some embodiment, each review record may include both a string Rating field and a normalized numeric rating field (e.g., normalized with respect to a rating scale of 0 to 1, or 0 to 5). - In Table 2, the keyword “required” indicates a required field, “repeated” indicates a field that may occur more than once in a record (and in rare cases, may have zero occurrences), and “optional” indicates an optional field. Optional fields may be present in some review records, while not present in other review records, for example because some reviews may not include the optional information.
TABLE 2 Exemplary Fields for Individual Review Records in Individual Reviews Buffer and Reviews Database required int64 ReviewID // unique identifier for each review repeated string ProductNames // one or more product names associated with the review required int32 ReviewType // exemplary values: editorial=1, user=2 required string Rating // product rating given by the reviewer optional string Author // author of the review optional string Title // title of the review optional string Summary // review summary optional string Content // review content, which is the main body of the review optional string Date // Review date required int32 CrawlDate // crawl date required string URL // URL at which review was found. // Alternately, this may be the base URL for product // reviews at the website at which this review was found required string Publisher // publisher of the review (e.g., CNET, epinions.com) // Additional Optional Fields that may be included in some embodiments: optional int64 ClusterID // ClusterID of the product optional float QualityScore // Quality Score of the review optional int32 Year // Model year, or other year associated with the product // (e.g., year of first publication of a book or a movie) - The data structure fields shown in Table 2, except ReviewID, ReviewType, QualityScore and ClusterID, are filled with data from the extracted review information if information relevant to those fields are found in the extracted review information. The ReviewID is a unique identifier assigned to each individual review by the aggregated reviews backend server. The ReviewType indicates whether the review is an editorial review, or a review submitted by a user. QualityScore, which provides a measure of the quality of a review, is determined based on the review's length and word entropy (which measures, among other things, the diversity of the words or terms used in the review). As explained below, all reviews belonging to the same product form a “cluster” and the ClusterID identifies the cluster to which a review belongs.
-
Backend server 102 automatically identifies particular products that are associated with particular product reviews (306). For at least some of the extracted product reviews,backend server 102 identifies a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review. - In some embodiments, identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review comprises associating a unique number or string in the extracted product review with a particular product. In some embodiments, the unique number or string is a product model number. In some embodiments, the unique number is an ISBN number.
- In some embodiments, identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review comprises associating a brand name and a model number in the extracted product review with a particular product. In some embodiments, identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review comprises associating a brand name, a model number, and a product category in the extracted product review with a particular product.
- Different web sites often use different names for the same product, which makes it difficult to automatically determine whether two reviews actually refer to the same product. For example, different web sites refer to the same Canon scanner as:
-
- Canon CanoScan 7890a002 Flatbed 7890a002
- Canon CanoScan LiDE 30
- Canon CanoScan LiDE 30 Scanner
- Canon CanoScan LiDE 30 Color Scanner
- Canon Lide 30 (7890A002)
- For products with global identifiers (such as ISBN numbers for books), identifying a particular product that is associated with the extracted product review is simple if the product review includes the global identifier. In some embodiments, in the absence of such a global identifier in the review, extracted brand names and model numbers (in the above example, the brand name is “canon”, and the model numbers are “lide30” and “7890a002”), as well as category information (such as the fact that the above product is a scanner) are used to identify reviews that refer to the same product. As used herein, reviews about the same product form a “cluster” and “clustering” refers to identifying reviews for the same product. As described above, in some embodiments, this information is stored in review records (Table 2) by
review extraction module 230. Extracted brand names, model numbers and category information may all be stored in the ProductNames fields of the review records. Alternately, in some embodiments each review record may include a Model field for storing a model number, a Category field for storing product category information, and a Names field for storing brand name information for a respective product. - Sometimes, one or more of these three pieces of information (Model, Category and Brand Name) are not explicitly identified on a web page. In such cases, this information is deduced from the title string or other fields of the extracted review. For example, product category and model number can be inferred by the
review parser 232 or thereview aggregating module 236 as follows. Given a title string, the part of the title string beyond words like “for”, “with”, and “featuring” is ignored. Words in the title string are traversed from right to left and the first word (or pair of words) that is included in a data file containing a predefined list of product categories is considered the product category. In some embodiments, this data file also identifies, for each distinct product category, a list of other product category names for the product category that are mapped to one canonical name. For example, “notebooks”, “notebook”, “laptop” or “laptops” may all be mapped to the canonical name, “notebooks”. Thus, a title string such as “Canon canoscan lide 30 color scanner with free extras” would be mapped to the category “scanner”. - To extract model numbers, the title string is traversed from left to right and the first word that contains digits (i.e., characters from ‘0’-‘9’) is concatenated with the preceding word to form a model number. In some embodiments, the resulting model number is discarded if it matches any of the regular expression patterns corresponding to blacklisted model numbers or contains a brand name or parts of a brand name. An example of a blacklisted pattern is “pentium \d+”+” (i.e., “pentium” followed by a string of digits). For the title string in the previous example, “lide 30” is extracted as the model number. Note that more than one model number can be inferred for a product name.
- In some embodiments, the brand names are identified by matching words in the product title with known (i.e., predefined) brand names in a list or dictionary of such brand names. In some embodiments, the brand name of a product may be extracted from the URL of the page on which the product review is found.
- In some embodiments, two product reviews are assigned to the same cluster (product) if they have the same exact brand name, and agree on their model numbers and categories. Two reviews are said to agree on a model number if the set of model numbers extracted for them have a non-empty intersection. Two categories are said to agree if they are the same or at least one of them is unknown.
- In some embodiments, two product reviews are assigned to the same cluster (product) if they have the same exact brand name and agree on their model numbers.
- In some embodiments, reviews corresponding to products for which brand or model information cannot be determined are put into a singleton cluster of their own and are not clustered with any other reviews.
- In some embodiments, when a product review is assigned to a cluster,
review aggregating module 236 fills in the ClusterID field in the review record for the extracted review. - For each particular product in at least a subset of the plurality of products,
backend server 102 generates aggregated review information for the particular product based on a plurality of extracted product reviews that are associated with the particular product (308). In some embodiments,review aggregating module 236 uses the reviews for a particular product to generate aggregated review information for the product that is stored in aggregatedreview buffer 240. - In some embodiments, the aggregated review information for the particular product comprises a total number of reviews for the product, an average rating for the product, a distribution of the ratings for the product, and/or frequently appearing phrases in the extracted product reviews associated with the product. One or more additional types of aggregated review information may be included in the aggregated review information in other embodiments.
- In some embodiments, the average rating is the average of weighted ratings from different web sites. In some embodiments, the weight of a single review on a web site with K reviews for the same product is 1/K. In some embodiments, the weight given to reviews from a particular web site or reviewer can be personalized by a user. For example, a user can specify via a preferences dialog box one or more web sites (e.g., www.consumerreports.org) and/or reviewers (e.g., Roger Ebert) preferred by the user. The ratings given in the reviews associated with the user's preferred sources are then given higher weight when computing an average rating for a product. In one embodiment, the ratings given in reviews associated with the user's preferred sources are given N times the default weight assigned to those reviews, where N is a value such as 2, 2.5, 3 or any other appropriate value greater than 1. An exemplary representation of the average rating computation is:
where ai represents the weight given to each rating, ratings, of each respective review i. - In some embodiments, frequently appearing phrases in the extracted product reviews associated with a particular product are computed by
review aggregation module 236 as follows. For all the phrases (e.g., unigrams, bigrams or trigrams that do not span across sentences) that occur in reviews associated with a product (cluster), the number of their weighted occurrences is counted. Occurrences in the review title or summary are given a higher weight. When computing or selecting frequently appearing phrases, all stop words and, words that occur in the title of the product name are ignored. Each phrase is given a score equal to the length of the phrase times the square root of the sum of weighted occurrences of the phrase. A predetermined number of phrases with the highest scores (e.g., the top 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 phrases) that do not overlap each other are chosen as the frequent phrases and stored in aggregatedreview buffer 240. - Table 3 lists the fields of each aggregated review record, produced by aggregating information from all the extracted reviews for a particular product, and stored in the aggregated
reviews buffer 240. In other embodiments, each aggregated review record may have a subset of the fields listed in Table 3, and may also include additional fields. A separate instance of the aggregated review record is included in the aggregatedreviews buffer 240 and in thereviews database 242 for each distinct product. In this example, each aggregated review record includes a ClusterID (identifying the product associated with this record), a list of ReviewID's (each of which is uniquely associated with a review of the product), a list of the words or phrases most frequently found in the reviews of the product, and a computed average rating of all the reviews for the product. In some embodiments, an aggregated review record also includes one or more of the following additional fields: a string identifying the product, a number specifying the number of reviews in the cluster; and data concerning the distribution of ratings in the reviews for a product, such as the number of reviews with low, medium and high ratings, as well as the number of reviews having no product rating.TABLE 3 Exemplary Fields for Aggregated Review Records in Aggregated Reviews Buffer and Reviews Database required int64 ClusterID // this is the ClusterID for a particular product repeated int64 ReviewID // this represents a list of ReviewID's, which are the // IDs of the individual reviews for the product repeated string FrequentPhrases // This is a list of phrases that frequently occur // in the reviews of the product required float AvgRating // This is the average rating for the product // Additional Optional Fields that may be included in some embodiments: optional int32 ReviewNum // number of reviews in cluster repeated string ProductName // name(s) of Product to which this cluster belongs repeated int32 ScoreDistribution // score distribution for: unrated, negative, neutral, // and positive reviews -
Backend server 102 automatically stores the extractedproduct reviews 244 and the aggregatedreview information 246 in reviews database 242 (310). In some embodiments, each stored product review in thereviews database 242 comprises a record that includes the same information as the corresponding review record (Table 2) stored in the extractedreviews buffer 234, while in other embodiments, the stored product review may comprise a subset of the information stored in the corresponding review record. - As mentioned earlier, reviews indexer 248 indexes the
individual product reviews 244 and the aggregated review information for aproduct 246 and stores the results inreviews index 250. -
Client 104 sends a request for an aggregated review for a product (402,FIG. 4 ). In some embodiments, the request is sent in response to a user-initiated activity, such as a user clicking on a hyperlink. For example, referring toFIG. 6A , a user looking at web page 650 with various products for sale could activate hyperlink 652 to see an aggregated review forproduct 654. - Referring to
FIG. 4 ,frontend server 100 receives the request (404) for an aggregated review for a product and obtains (406) the aggregated review. In some embodiments,product information 254 inproduct database 252 is linked to aggregated reviews for the corresponding products by product-to-review map 256. In some embodiments, map 256 contains mappings of product identifiers used by a first website or service (e.g., a product information website) to the ClusterIDs used by thefrontend server 100. The process of assigning product identifiers to products in the first website or service may be analogous to the process described above for identifying particular products that are associated with particular product reviews. In some embodiments,map 256 is determined by matching a global identifier for a particular product (e.g., an ISBN number) inproduct database 252 with a corresponding review cluster. Product-to-review map 256 is used to identify the aggregated review (in the reviews database 242) corresponding to a product.Presentation module 264 formats the aggregated review. In some embodiments, thereviews index 250 is used to identify the individual reviews corresponding to the aggregated review for a product. More specifically, thereviews index 250 maps the ClusterID of the aggregated review to the individual reviews for the product associated with the aggregated review. -
Frontend server 100 sends (408) the aggregated review toclient computer 104 viacommunications network 106.Client 104 receives (410) and displays (412) the aggregated review 600 (FIG. 6B ). - As shown in
FIG. 6B , aggregatedreview 600 includes portions ofreviews 626 for the product and asearch input area 618 for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms.Search input area 618 is used to enter search terms for a search that only returns results that are within the reviews for the product. In some embodiments, aggregatedreview 600 includes ahistogram 608 of review ratings for the product, anaggregate rating 604 for the product, and/or thenumber 606 of reviews for the product. In some embodiments, aggregatedreview 600 is displayed in a single Web page. - In some embodiments,
review search module 258 supports two different types of queries: (1) search within thereviews 262 belonging to a single product (e.g. a search for “customer service” in the reviews for a given product) and (2) search allreviews 260 to find a particular product (e.g. a search for “good digital camera”).Aggregated review 600,FIG. 6B , shows asearch input area 618 for the first type of search. - For the first type of search, a variety of user initiated activities can start the search process, including the user entering search terms in
search input area 618, selecting a hyperlink for a frequently appearingphrase 620, selecting a hyperlink to areview source 622, or selecting a hyperlinked portion (e.g., 610, 612, 614, or 616) ofhistogram 608. - In response to this user-initiated activity,
client 104 sends (502,FIG. 5 ) a request to search within a plurality of reviews for a particular product. - Referring to
FIG. 5 ,frontend server 100 receives (504) the search request fromclient 104 and obtains (506) information satisfying the request. In some embodiments, the information is obtained byreview search module 258 sending two queries toreviews database 242. In the first query, all individual reviews (sometimes called “documents”) that contain the search terms are found. When searching for reviews within a single product, the first query is restricted to the main body (e.g., the “review content” fields) of thereviews index 250, and only to individual reviews that belong to the product (cluster). For example, the query “customer service” for reviews in cluster 1234 would be translated to the following: query restricts: ClusterID=1234, body:(customer service). - A second query is then issued to obtain portions of all reviews that are to be displayed. The ordering preferences submitted by the user (e.g., by clicking on 636, 638, 640, and/or 642) as well as the start position are used to determine which reviews to display. When the number of reviews for a product exceeds the maximum number of review portions to be displayed on a single web page, the start position indicates the ordinal number within an ordered set of reviews at which to begin formatting reviews for display.
-
Frontend server 100 sends (508,FIG. 5 ) at least a portion of the obtained information toclient 104. -
Client 104 receives (510) information satisfying the request and displays (512) the received information, e.g. inweb page 660,FIG. 6C . In some embodiments,Client 104 displays atleast portions 662 of reviews of the product matching thesearch terms 664. - The information sent by
frontend server 100 and received byclient 104 includes atleast portions 662 of reviews for the particular product that satisfy the search request. In some embodiments, this information includes theidentities 666 of the review sources contributing to the sent information. - For the second type of search, the information is also obtained by
review search module 258 sending two queries toreviews database 242. In the first query, all individual reviews that contain the search terms are found, without restricting the search to a particular product (cluster). In some embodiments, the results of the first query are grouped by cluster (product). A second query is then issued to obtain portions of at most three (or some other small number) reviews in each cluster, which are restricted to be from different publishers. In some embodiments, information about each of the clusters, such as the total number of reviews and the average rating, is also requested, obtained, and sent for display. - The graphical user interface 600 (
FIG. 6B ) onclient computer 104 comprises a plurality ofportions 626 of reviews for a product and asearch input area 618 for entering search terms to search for reviews of the product that contain the search terms. In some embodiments, the plurality of portions of reviews can be grouped byreview source 636, sorted bydate 642, and sorted by relevance to thesearch input 640, or sorted by quality of review when the user has not provided a search input. In some embodiments, more or fewer sorting and grouping options may be provided for sorting and/or grouping the reviews. - In some embodiments,
graphical user interface 600 also includes, either alone or in various combinations: anaggregate rating 604 for the product; a list of suggestedsearch terms 620; a list ofsources 622 for the reviews that link back to the source Web sites or to the corresponding reviews; at least one user selectable link for sorting the portions of reviews bydate 642 or relevance to thesearch input 640, and/or for grouping the portions of reviews bysource 636; and/or ahistogram 608 of reviews for the product. In some embodiments, clicking on a region (e.g., 610, 612, 614, or 616) in the histogram automatically generates portions of at least some of the reviews corresponding to the histogram region. For example, clicking onregion 616 may generate a new display showing portions of reviews having high ratings for the product. - An aggregated
rating 604 is given to the product by calculating an average over all reviews for the product. The ratings in theindividual reviews 244 and in the aggregatedreviews 246 are normalized, e.g., to a 0-1 or 0-5 scale. In some embodiments, after a search within reviews for aproduct 262, the aggregatedrating 604 andnumber 606 of reviews are changed to reflect the average rating and number of reviews matching the search. This change in the aggregated rating can help users answer questions like, “How do reviewers that discuss ‘customer service’ rate this product?” In some other embodiments, the aggregatedrating 604 andnumber 606 of reviews are not changed to reflect the average rating and number of reviews matching the search. - Commonly used phrases (e.g., unigrams, bigrams or trigrams) appearing in the reviews for the product are displayed as a list of suggested
search terms 620. Phrases that contain the product name and stop-words (such as “the”) are removed to improve the quality of the suggested search terms. Clicking on one of the phrases results in displaying just the reviews that contain the user selected phrase. This is equivalent to entering the phrase into thesearch box 618 with quotes around the phrase and then initiating a search. Showing these phrases gives the user a good idea which aspects of the product are most frequently discussed in the product reviews, and thus which aspects of the product might be important to know about. - The list of
review sources 622 includes links to the sites from which reviews for the product have been obtained, or a subset thereof. In some embodiments, after a search within reviews for a product, the list ofreview sources 622 just includes links to the sites from which reviews matching the search have been obtained, or a subset thereof. In some embodiments, the links lead to the main pages for the given product on each source web site. In some embodiments, the links lead to the product reviews matching the search. - A
histogram 608 with a rating distribution of the reviews includes the number of reviews that are unrated 610 (in some embodiments, displayed as a gray area), negative 612 (in some embodiments, displayed as a red area), neutral 614 (in some embodiments, displayed as a yellow area) and positive 616 (in some embodiments, displayed as a green area). In some embodiments, the rating distribution is displayed as a flat histogram, where the length of each colored bar is proportional to the number of reviews in the category. Clicking on a histogram results in asearch 262 that just shows the corresponding reviews, e.g. clicking on thered bar 612 results in showing just the negative reviews. -
Search input area 618 allows a user to enter arbitrary search terms for the search within reviews for a given product. As shown inFIG. 6C , in some embodiments the search terms are highlighted in portions ofreviews 626 that match the search query. - User selectable links permit the displayed list of reviews to be sorted in various ways, such as by:
-
- Relevance 640: In some embodiments, editorial reviews are listed before user reviews. In some embodiments, the reviews are sorted by their length and information content, e.g., sorted by Review-per-word-entropy*sqrt(Review-Length). Other scoring functions, such as scoring reviews by an “information retrieval” score, can also be used.
- Date 642: The reviews are sorted by date, with the newest reviews coming first. Reviews for which a date is unknown may be listed at the end.
- Review Source 636: Reviews are grouped by review site, as represented by screen shot 670 in
FIG. 6D , with at most N reviews (e.g., 3, 4 or 5, or some other small number) shown for each review site. At the top of each group, alink 672 to the corresponding review site is provided, which may be the same as the link provided to the site in the list ofreview sources 622. - Ungrouped 638 (e.g., not grouped by review source). This view is similar to traditional search result displays. Reviews are listed (i.e., portions of the reviews are displayed) one-by-one in a selected order (e.g., by date or relevance) and reviews from different sources are mixed (i.e., without grouping the portions of reviews by source).
- Location (not shown in aggregated
review 600,FIG. 6B ). This view permits reviews to be sorted by location (e.g., for reviews of restaurants, local businesses, movies or other products near a particular location, such as by address, city, region, or mailing or zip code).
- In some embodiments, for reviews listed in an aggregated review (e.g.,
graphical user interface 600 or 670) or reviews listed as results for a search within reviews for a product (e.g.,graphical user interface 660,FIG. 6C ) the following information is displayed:review title 624, aportion 626 of the review (e.g., a snippet), the source of thereview 628, the date of thereview 634, the type of review 630 (e.g., whether it is an editorial or user contributed review), and the name of thereviewer 632. The portion orsnippet 626 of each review may be generated using the same or similar techniques to those used to generate snippets of search results in an Internet search engine such as the Google search engine. For example, when a graphical user interface is presenting reviews for a product, the portion of each review shown may be a portion matching one or more search terms that were used to select the reviews to be displayed. Alternately, the portion of each review shown may be a beginning portion of the review. In yet another embodiment, the portion of each review shown may be a portion determined by an automatic process to be a summary or most important portion of the review. - The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
