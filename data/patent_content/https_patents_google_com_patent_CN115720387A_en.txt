Description
Description of the different cases
The application belongs to divisional application of Chinese invention patent application No.201880036692.1 with application date of 2018, 12 and 14.
Technical Field
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for establishing and terminating a wireless link.
Background
A wireless communication device can connect to a wireless network through an access point that broadcasts transmissions within range of the device. While access points are often fixed in position, end-user wireless devices such as smartphones, tablets, and notebook computers are often mobile and frequently enter and exit the coverage areas of different access points and wireless networks. Additionally, external events and environmental changes can cause fluctuations in the quality of the connection even when the mobile device maintains its location for a period of time while connected to a particular wireless network.
To manage these changing conditions, the wireless communication device may include a connection manager that detects a wireless network or access point in the vicinity of the device and determines when to connect to the network or access point based on an indication of the quality of the network or the quality of the access point. For example, some wireless communication devices are configured to connect to an access point if the received signal strength of a transmission from the access point meets a predefined static threshold. The connection manager may also select a particular network to connect to if several access points are detected within range of the device.
Disclosure of Invention
This specification describes systems, methods, devices, and other techniques for managing connections between a wireless communication device and an access point. The quality of a wireless connection involving two-way communication between a wireless communication device and an access point depends on both the ability of the wireless communication device to successfully receive downlink transmissions from the access point and the ability of the access point to successfully receive uplink transmissions from the wireless communication device. However, information about the quality or range of the uplink is often not available to the wireless communication device when the wireless communication device evaluates whether to connect with an access point that it has detected. For example, if the downlink transmission power level of transmissions from the access point significantly exceeds the uplink transmission power level of transmissions from the wireless communication device, the wireless communication device may initiate a connection with the access point based on the wireless communication device detecting a relatively high received signal strength from the access point, even though the quality of the uplink transmissions may be low. Thus, even if a connection is established between the wireless communication device and the access point, there may be relatively little margin for fading and performance of the connection may suffer.
This specification describes techniques for a wireless communication device to manage connections with an access point (and a wireless network corresponding to the access point) in a manner that can take into account both uplink and downlink transmission quality. These techniques may be applied when determining whether to initiate a connection with an access point or, if a connection has already been established, whether to maintain a connection.
In some embodiments, the wireless communication device is configured to increase the SNR required to receive uplink transmissions during the connection phase, thereby providing a margin in terms of SNR that allows for fading that can potentially occur during the course of a wireless connection by degrading the quality of transmissions from the wireless communication device to the access point when the wireless communication device attempts to establish a connection. The wireless communication device may, for example, reduce its transmission power, use a more complex modulation scheme, or both during a connection procedure to establish a link with the access point. If the link can be established using a reduced uplink transmission quality, the wireless communication device can then increase the transmission power and/or use a more robust modulation scheme for the transmission once the link has been established, thereby providing a margin for uplink transmission. In this way, the device may reduce the uplink transmission quality (e.g., by reducing the uplink transmission power and/or using a more complex modulation scheme) during the connection phase so that the access point successfully receives the transmission requires a higher level of SNR.
In some implementations, a wireless communication device is configured to determine specific entry criteria for connecting to different wireless networks, access points, and/or frequency channels. The device may also determine exit criteria for disconnecting, as described further below. The entry criteria can be based on an indication of relative success of the wireless communication device (or of other wireless communication devices) when historically successfully connecting to a particular network, access point, and/or channel. For example, the wireless communication device can maintain a database that stores, for different networks, access points, and/or channels, the ratios at which the wireless communication device (or other wireless communication device) previously connected to different networks, access points, and/or channels at each of a plurality of different downlink transmission quality levels. Additionally or alternatively, the database may be maintained on one or more servers remote from the wireless device. When the wireless communication device later detects an available network, access point, and/or channel, the wireless communication device can compare a downlink transmission quality level of transmissions from the detected network, access point, and/or channel to a threshold quality level for the detected network, access point, and/or channel, wherein the threshold quality level is based on historical capabilities to connect to the network, access point, and/or channel with a minimum specified success rate. For example, if the historical success rate of connecting to a first access point with an RSSI of-70 dBm is sufficiently high, the wireless communication device may select a first access point with an RSSI (received signal strength indicator) of-70 dBm for the detected transmission, but may select a second access point with no connection to a detected transmission with an RSSI of-70 dBm if the historical success rate of connecting to a second access point with an RSSI of-70 dBm does not meet a minimum specified level. The wireless communication device may be configured in some examples to: if the downlink transmission has an RSSI that meets a predefined default RSSI, a connection is initiated to the access point, but may be configured to: if the connection history indicates a sufficiently high success rate to connect to the access point (e.g., on a particular wireless network and/or channel) at a low RSSI (e.g., at a default RSSI threshold), the default RSSI threshold is lowered. The wireless communication device may maintain or further lower the threshold if the lowered threshold continues to allow for a high success rate when connecting to the access point; otherwise, the threshold may revert to the default RSSI threshold or may even increase above the initial default threshold if the specified minimum connection success rate needs to be achieved. In some implementations, the database may be indexed by user and network location and/or other context indicating preferred network and network performance on different days of the week, time of day, and whether the user/device is located indoors or outdoors.
Due to fading that may occur in a wireless connection between a wireless communication device and an access point, the wireless communication device may also be configured to monitor the health of the connection and terminate the connection if the performance of the connection degrades a sufficient amount over time (e.g., thereafter connecting to a different access point or network that may provide better service). One factor that a wireless communication device may consider in determining whether to maintain or terminate a connection is the downlink transmission power level of transmissions from the access point. If the downlink transmission power level (e.g., RSSI as measured by the wireless communication device as downlink) falls below the exit power level threshold for a period of time, the wireless communication device may initiate a procedure to terminate the connection with the access point. However, when the downlink power is strong enough but the uplink power is not strong enough (e.g., due to a difference in transmission power of the access point and the wireless communication device), merely evaluating the downlink transmission power level may cause the wireless communication device to maintain the connection.
Thus, in some implementations, a wireless communication device can determine an exit criterion for terminating a wireless link based on both a downlink transmission quality (e.g., power level and/or modulation scheme) from the perspective of the wireless communication device and an uplink transmission quality from the perspective of an access point. The wireless communication device may set an exit criterion for terminating the wireless communication device based on a comparison of the downlink transmission quality and the uplink transmission quality. Thus, if there is a significant gap between the uplink transmission quality and the downlink transmission quality (e.g., if the RSSI of the uplink transmission measured by the access point is lower than the RSSI of the downlink transmission measured by the wireless communication device), the wireless communication device can adjust the baseline exit criteria (e.g., can increase the downlink exit RSSI threshold) such that the wireless communication device terminates the connection if it is no longer able to provide a valid communication channel for the wireless communication device or access point in either communication direction.
In some implementations, the wireless communication device may not be able to directly obtain information about the received signal strength of uplink transmissions at the access point or information about other transmission quality parameters. In these cases, the wireless communication device can infer the quality of uplink transmissions received by the access point based on characteristics of downlink transmissions received from the access point that correspond to successful uplink transmissions. For example, if the wireless communication device sends a packet to the access point and receives an acknowledgement indicating that the packet was successfully sent, the wireless communication device may measure one or more quality parameters of the transmission containing the acknowledgement to estimate the access point's perception of the health of the wireless link. If the access point is at a lower modulation and coding scheme (e.g., MCS) 0 ) Transmit, then the wireless communication device can infer that the received signal strength of the uplink transmission at the access point is relatively low. Thus, the wireless communication device may adjust the exit criteria for terminating the wireless connection, for example, by increasing the exit RSSI threshold. In some embodiments, a device may send multiple packets to an access point, each packet having a different MCS. The device may then track which of those packets (and corresponding MCSs) are acknowledged, thereby providing the device with an indication of the current uplink signal quality (e.g., received signal strength of the uplink transmission at the access point).
The techniques described herein may, in some implementations and in some cases, achieve one or more advantages. First, by degrading the uplink transmission quality during the connection process relative to the baseline quality, the wireless communication device can ensure that any resulting connection will have additional margin to counteract fading in the transmission that may occur during the course of the wireless connection. Second, by adjusting the entry criteria for connecting to the access point based on historical information regarding downlink transmission quality levels that result in successful connections, the wireless communication device may increase the likelihood of successfully connecting to the access point at a later time (e.g., for a particular wireless network and/or on a particular frequency channel) and decrease the likelihood of establishing a poor quality connection. Third, by adjusting an exit criterion for initiating termination of an existing/ongoing wireless connection based on a comparison of the uplink quality parameter and the downlink transmission quality parameter, the wireless communication device may more efficiently determine when a wireless connection is to be maintained or ended. For example, rather than just measuring the received signal strength of a downlink transmission, which risks maintaining a poor connection where the wireless communication device is within a downlink range of the access point but the access point is not within an uplink range of the wireless communication device, an exit threshold for the received signal strength of the downlink transmission may be increased if a gap exists between the received signal strengths of the uplink and downlink transmissions. Fourth, the wireless communication device may select a better performing access point for connection by applying different entry criteria specific to individual access points.

Detailed Description
This specification generally describes systems, methods, devices, and other techniques for establishing wireless connections (also referred to as "wireless links") between wireless communication devices and access points that provide access to wireless networks and monitoring them. The wireless communication device may apply these techniques to selectively establish a wireless connection with an access point that is more likely to provide reliable high quality performance. In some implementations, the wireless communication device may further apply these techniques to determine an appropriate time to terminate an existing wireless connection, e.g., to support a connection to an alternate access point that may provide a higher quality connection.
Referring to fig. 1, a conceptual diagram of a wireless environment 100 is shown, the wireless environment 100 having a wireless communication device 102 and a pair of access points 104, 106 in the vicinity of the wireless communication device 102. The wireless communication device 102 may be any suitable wireless-enabled device capable of wirelessly connecting to an access point to access a network. The wireless communication device 102 may be, for example, a smart phone, a tablet computing device, a notebook computer, a desktop computer, a wireless network interface card, a smart watch, a wireless-enabled television or set-top box, an automotive wireless system, or other suitable device. The access points 104, 106 can each be any suitable wireless networking device that allows a wireless communication device (e.g., wireless communication device 102) to connect to a network via a wireless connection to the access point 104 or 106. In some implementations, the access points 104, 106 are integrated in a wireless router. In other embodiments, the access points 104, 106 are different from wireless routers. The access points 104, 106 may each provide access to a wired network, such as the internet or an organization's intranet. Typically, each access point 104, 106 implements a wireless network alone or in cooperation with one or more additional access points. For example, the access points 104, 106 may be configured to implement an IEEE802.11 (WIFI) wireless local area network, or may be part of a 2G, 3G, 4G (e.g., LTE), or 5G broadband wireless local area network, as well as additional access points. The wireless communication device 102 may be configured to communicate with the access points 104, 106 over a corresponding wireless network (e.g., an IEEE802.11 WIFI network or a 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G network). Although only two access points 104, 106 are shown in fig. 1, any number of access points (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) may be located in the wireless environment 100 in such proximity that the device 102 may detect their presence. Two or more of the access points (e.g., access points 104 and 106) may be part of the same wireless network or different wireless networks.
The wireless communication device 102 and the access points 104, 106 each have a receiver portion and a transmitter portion for receiving and transmitting Radio Frequency (RF) transmissions, respectively. With respect to the transmitter portion, the wireless communication device 102 is configured to broadcast uplink RF transmissions and detect/receive downlink RF transmissions. In contrast, the access points 104, 106 are each configured to broadcast downlink RF transmissions and detect/receive uplink RF transmissions. However, the wireless communication device 102 and the access points 104, 106 may both have different transmission power levels that provide different transmission ranges from one another. For example, FIG. 1 shows access point 104 having a radius r 1 Has a radius r reflecting a higher transmission power level, the access point 106 has a coverage area 108 of a moderate size 2 And the wireless communication device 102 has a radius r reflecting a lower transmission power level 3 A relatively small coverage area (this representation assumes equivalent receiver sensitivity between the devices 102, 104, 106). Due to these differences in transmission power levels and the location of the wireless communication device 102 relative to the access points 104 and 106, the wireless communication device 102 is within the respective downlink coverage areas 108, 112 of the access points 104, 106, but only the first access point 104 is within the uplink coverage area 110 of the wireless communication device 102. The second access point 104 is located a greater distance from the wireless communication device 102 than the effective uplink transmission range r of the wireless communication device 102 3 . As a result, the wireless communication device 102 may be able to receive transmissions of sufficient quality to allow reliable downlink communications from both access points 104 and 106, but only the first access point 104 within range allows reliable uplink communications from the wireless communication device 102. However, the downlink power transmission level measured by the wireless communication device 102 from both access points 104 and 106 may be the same (or the transmission from the second access point 106 may even have a greater received signal strength at the wireless communication device 102). For example, changes in access point beacon RSSI at the edge of the uplink range can be due to changes in the access point transmission power levelOver 10dB. As described with respect to fig. 2-4, rather than relying on a static threshold for downlink transmission power in determining whether to attempt to connect to an access point, the wireless communication device 102 can take action to selectively connect to an access point that is more likely to provide reliable connections and margin for fading in downlink and uplink communications.
Fig. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for establishing a wireless connection between a wireless communication device and an access point. In general, a wireless communication device can be configured to connect with an access point in a manner that provides a margin for signal quality fading in uplink transmissions by degrading the quality of transmissions from the wireless communication device to the access point while the wireless communication device attempts to establish a connection. The wireless communication device may use a lower than baseline transmission power level, use a more complex modulation scheme, or both, for example, during a connection procedure to establish a link with the access point. If the link can be established using a reduced uplink transmission quality, the wireless communication device can then increase the transmission power and/or use a more robust modulation scheme for the transmission once the link has been established, thereby providing a margin for uplink transmission.
In more detail, at stage 202, a wireless communication device (e.g., wireless communication device 102) detects an available access point (e.g., access point 104 or 106) for a wireless network. A wireless communication device may detect an access point by passively or actively scanning its environment. For active scanning, a wireless communication device may first advertise its presence by broadcasting a message and monitoring for a response from any access point within uplink range of the wireless communication device. For passive scanning, an access point may periodically transmit beacons that allow any wireless communication device within downlink range of the access point to discover the access point by listening for such beacons on a predefined frequency channel.
At stage 204, the wireless communication device determines one or more quality parameters of downlink transmissions from the detected access point. The downlink transmission may be a beacon from the access point detected during the passive scan, a transmission received in response to a probe message from the wireless communication device during the active scan, or any other transmission detected by the wireless communication device from the access point prior to establishing a link with the access point. The quality parameters of the transmission include any characteristic of the transmission that relates to the ability of the wireless communication device to successfully receive and interpret the transmission, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the transmission, the power level of the transmission, the modulation scheme of the transmission, the number of spatial streams provided in the transmission, the coding rate of the transmission, and the guard interval of the transmission. In some embodiments, the sending device is configured to broadcast the transmission according to a set of defined transmission quality parameters, and to adjust the parameters as needed to ensure reliable throughput of the data to the receiving device. When there is greater interference or noise, the transmitting device may select higher quality transmission parameters to make its transmission more robust against the adverse effects of the interference or noise. In other words, the quality of a transmission is generally inversely proportional to its destructiveness due to interference or noise. For example, binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) may be considered a higher quality modulation scheme than Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), since BPSK transmission is less susceptible to noise than QPSK, despite the lower throughput of BPSK. As another example, 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) provides lower data throughput, but for purposes of this specification is considered to have higher quality than 64-QAM, since 16-QAM is less susceptible to noise.
Similarly, a higher transmission power level generally corresponds to a higher transmission quality because it improves the SNR of the transmission at the receiver. In this specification, the power level of a transmission generally refers to the strength of the transmission at the receiving device. Transmission power levels are typically measured at the receiving device, for example in terms of a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The power level of a transmission fades as it propagates through the medium and is inversely proportional to the distance from the transmitter. Thus, the transmission power level measured at the receiver will typically be less than the transmission power level measured at the transmitter. However, a transmitting device may be configured to select different transmission power levels, and thus in some contexts as described herein, a transmission power level may refer to a transmission power level from the perspective of the transmitter.
In some embodiments, a wireless communication device may determine a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) index value for a transmission from an access point as an indication of a quality of the transmission. The IEEE802.11 protocol defines a series of MCS index values that each represent a different combination of transmission quality parameters. In general, a higher MCS index value indicates a lower quality transmission, i.e., provides higher data throughput but requires a higher SNR to be successfully received. For example, MCS 0 Indicating a transmission with one spatial stream, using BPSK modulation, at a 1/2 coding rate. MCS (modulation and coding scheme) 1 Is a slightly lower quality, higher throughput transmission with one spatial stream, using QPSK modulation, a coding rate of 1/2. In some embodiments, the wireless communication device may use the MCS index value, the RSSI, or both, of the received transmission as an indication of the quality of the transmission.
At stage 206, the wireless communication device compares the observed downlink transmission quality of transmissions from the access point to one or more entry criteria for initiating a connection with the access point. The entry criteria may include thresholds for one or more transmission quality parameters, such as a minimum acceptable downlink transmission power level (e.g., a threshold RSSI value). If the observed transmission quality of the transmission from the access point satisfies the entry criteria, the wireless communication device may initiate a connection procedure to establish a wireless link with the access point (stage 208). The wireless communication device may choose not to attempt to connect with the access point if the observed transmission quality of transmissions from the access point does not meet the entry criteria.
As mentioned, at stage 208, the wireless communication device may initiate a connection procedure to establish a wireless link with the access point. The wireless communication device selects a set of degraded uplink transmission quality parameters to be applied during the connection procedure (210), and then configures a transmitter portion of the wireless communication device to use the degraded parameters in uplink transmissions during the connection procedure (212). The degraded uplink parameters have a lower quality than the baseline set of parameters because the transmission generated using the degraded parameters requires a higher SNR for successful reception by the access point. For example, the wireless communication device may throttle (throttle) the transmission power level of the uplink transmission during the connection procedure according to a baseline (e.g., maximum) power level that the wireless communication device is configured to use after (and in this case after) the connection procedure is completed and the wireless link is successfully established. Additionally or alternatively, the wireless communication device may use a more complex modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK instead of BPSK) that requires a higher SNR for successful reception by the access point during the connection procedure. If the connection is later established, the wireless communication device may revert to higher quality parameters, such as broadcasting at a higher transmission power level and/or applying a less complex modulation scheme. In this manner, by providing lower quality transmissions while the wireless communication device attempts to connect to the access point, the wireless communication device can proactively take steps to provide a margin of SNR in uplink transmissions from the wireless communication device after the link is established.
At stage 214, if the access point is able to successfully receive the degraded uplink transmission during the connection procedure and the procedure is successfully completed, then a wireless link is established and the wireless communication device connects to the access point (216). However, if the quality of the degraded given access point is such that the access point cannot successfully receive uplink transmissions from the wireless communication device, then no link will be established and the wireless communication device is not connected to the access point (218).
In some implementations, after establishing the connection to the access point, the wireless communication device is configured to: the uplink transmission is initially broadcast using at least one improved transmission quality parameter as compared to a transmission quality parameter used during a connection procedure when the communication device uses the at least one degraded transmission quality parameter. The first uplink transmission occurring after the link is established may have a lower MCS index value and/or a higher power level than applied during the connection procedure, for example, such that the quality of the initial uplink transmission in the link is higher than the quality of the degraded uplink transmission occurring during the connection procedure. In some embodiments, a wireless communication device is configured to initially generate an uplink transmission when establishing a link with an access point using at least one improved transmission quality parameter without regard to a downlink transmission power level, other downlink transmission quality parameters, or other information regarding the quality of the link. For example, the wireless communication device may broadcast the uplink transmission at less than full power during the connection procedure and then be configured to send the first uplink transmission at full power after the link is established. The device may then adjust a transmission quality parameter for the uplink transmission based on the information about the quality of the link, including the quality parameter for the uplink and/or downlink transmission.
The degraded uplink transmission may be applied during the entire connection procedure or only for certain messages sent during the connection procedure. In some implementations, the wireless communication device degrades the probe messages during the active scan. If a given degraded probe message does not receive a response from the access point, the wireless communication device will not detect the access point or further attempt a connection. In some implementations, the wireless communication device downgrades the additional messages after detecting the access point, whether as a result of an active scan or a passive scan.
Turning to fig. 3, a flow diagram of an example process 300 for determining access point-specific entry criteria for a wireless communication device to connect to a particular access point is shown. In general, access point-specific criteria can be generated based on an indication of historical success rates of one or more wireless communication devices when connecting to different access points having different downlink transmission qualities. The entry criteria for a particular access point may then be set to or based on the quality of downlink transmissions from the access point that historically provided at least a threshold success rate connection. In some implementations, if the wireless communication device achieves a high enough success rate when establishing a reliable connection with an access point at the current entry threshold, the entry criteria can be relaxed for the particular access point (e.g., lower the RSSI threshold). It should be noted that although fig. 3 and the discussion herein refer to access point-specific access criteria by way of example, some embodiments relate to determining individualized access criteria for a particular wireless network that includes one or more access points, and some embodiments relate to determining specific access criteria for different frequency channels of individual access points and/or wireless networks.
In more detail, at stage 302, a wireless communication device (e.g., wireless communication device 102) detects an available access point (e.g., access point 104 or 106) for a wireless network. A wireless communication device may detect an access point by passively or actively scanning its environment. For active scanning, a wireless communication device may first advertise its presence by broadcasting a message and monitoring for a response from any access point within uplink range of the wireless communication device. In some active scanning implementations, a device may advertise its presence by sending a probe request frame. The probe request frame may be sent multiple times, with each instance of the probe request being sent at a different power level and/or a different MCS. The probe requests may each have a unique identifier (e.g., a serial number) and may also be sent with different (randomized) MAC addresses, such that an access point receiving multiple probe requests may not recognize that the probe requests each originate from the same physical device. The access point may then respond to each of the probe requests separately. From these responses (expected responses if no responses are received), the wireless device can determine which particular ones of the probe response messages the access point responded to, and can identify the corresponding transmission power and/or MCS levels that resulted in probe requests from these responses by the access point. The wireless device may then estimate the uplink signal quality based on the response from the access point. For passive scanning, an access point may periodically transmit beacons that allow any wireless communication device within downlink range of the access point to discover the access point by listening for such beacons on a predefined frequency channel.
At stage 304, the wireless communication device determines that it should attempt to connect to the detected access point and initiates a connection procedure to establish a wireless link with the access point. The determination to initiate the connection process may result from identifying that the quality of the beacon or other downlink transmission from the access point satisfies predefined entry criteria for connecting to the access point. Initially, the wireless communication device may use default entry criteria before historical information indicating previous experience and success of the wireless communication device in connecting to various access points is available. The default criteria may later be replaced or adjusted with access point-specific criteria as the wireless communication device collects more observations of successful and failed attempts to connect to the wireless communication device under different conditions and different downlink transmission qualities.
At stage 306, the wireless communication device stores the results of the connection procedure and an indication of downlink transmission quality of one or more transmissions from the access point. The downlink transmissions for which quality is measured and recorded may be transmissions corresponding to the time when the wireless communication device detects the access point and/or transmissions that occur during the connection process. In some embodiments, the result of the connection procedure is a binary classification, e.g., a successful connection (established link) or a failed connection (non-established link). For example, the wireless communication device may generate a database entry for the connection attempt that indicates the outcome of the attempt (e.g., success or failure) and a downlink transmission power level (e.g., RSSI level) of one or more downlink transmissions sent during the connection procedure. In some implementations, a cumulative success and/or failure rate can be maintained in a database that indicates a percentage of connection attempts that the wireless communication device and/or other wireless communication devices have succeeded or failed when attempting to connect with a particular access point (or a particular wireless network and/or a particular channel on a particular access point) during a past period of time. The cumulative success or failure rate may be updated based on the results of the most recent attempt to initiate a connection with the access point performed at stage 304.
In some embodiments, a connection attempt is classified as successful if the connection procedure is complete and results in a link being established between the wireless communication device and the access point. If the link cannot be established, the connection attempt is deemed to have failed. In some embodiments, a connection attempt is classified as successful only if a link is established and maintained for at least a threshold amount of time (e.g., to ensure that the link does not immediately fail despite having been established for a brief period of time). If the link fails before a threshold amount of time has elapsed, the connection is deemed to have failed. In some embodiments, a connection attempt is classified as successful only if the link is established and the quality of the uplink and/or downlink transmission meets a threshold quality for at least a threshold amount of time.
At stage 308, the wireless communication device or another system determines access point-specific entry criteria for connecting to the access point (or for connecting to a particular wireless network to which the access point belongs and/or for connecting to the access point on a particular frequency channel). In particular, the system determines, for each of a plurality of downlink transmission quality levels, a cumulative success rate (or failure rate) for the wireless communication device and/or other wireless communication devices to connect to a particular access point when a particular downlink transmission quality level is observed (310). The success rate may be determined from the above-mentioned database entry mapping the result of the connection attempt to the downlink transmission quality level. In some embodiments, the success rate is determined for a particular downlink transmission quality (e.g., -60dB, -55dB power level). In other embodiments, the success rate is determined for a range of transmission qualities (e.g., -70 to-61 dB, -60 to-51 dB power levels). The system then uses the selection criteria to select one or more downlink transmission quality levels to use to set entry criteria for the access point (312). In some embodiments, the system selects the lowest downlink transmission quality level that is mapped to a high enough historical connected power (e.g., as indicated by a threshold success rate). The selected downlink transmission quality level may then be used to establish access point-specific entry criteria for the access point (314). In some embodiments, the entry criteria is or includes a threshold downlink transmission power level (e.g., RSSI level) and the threshold is set to or based on a selected downlink transmission power level, such as a lowest transmission power level mapped to a threshold connection success rate for the access point.
To illustrate, fig. 4 shows an example database table storing information about past attempts by wireless communication devices to connect to various access points on different networks and channels. Each row presents connection success information for a particular combination of SSID, BSSID, frequency channel, and RSSI ranges. The SSID ("service set identifier") column of a given entry indicates the wireless network to which the wireless communication device is attempting to connect; the BSSID column indicates the MAC address of the particular access point to which the wireless communication device is attempting to connect; the channel column indicates the frequency channel on which the connection attempt was made; and the RSSI column indicates a range of RSSI levels that includes the RSSI level of the corresponding downlink transmission from the access point for the connection attempt. In accordance with the techniques described with respect to fig. 3, a wireless communication device or other system may determine that a threshold enters an RSSI level for a particular SSID/BSSID/channel combination by selecting the lowest RSSI range corresponding to the smallest acceptable (e.g., threshold) connection success rate. For example, if the threshold connection success rate is 75%, the system can select an RSSI level from the range of-50 to-41 dB for "WirelessNet _1", access point "7f. In some embodiments, the selected RSSI threshold is the lowest signal strength in the range (e.g., -50 dB), the highest signal strength in the range (e.g., -41 dB), or an intermediate value. In some embodiments, the system sets the RSSI threshold according to the range that provides the highest success rate, regardless of whether the success rate meets the threshold. Different RSSI thresholds may be maintained for different SSID/BSSID/channel combinations. In some embodiments, the system periodically (or otherwise from time to time) updates the RSSI threshold and/or other entry criteria based on the most recent indications of successful and failed connection attempts.
In some implementations, a wireless communication device or other system can be configured to dynamically adjust entry criteria for the wireless communication device to initiate a connection with a particular access point. For example, the wireless communication device may employ an initial (e.g., default) set of entry criteria. If over time, the wireless communication device uses an initial set of entry criteria to prove that the connection with the access point is sufficiently high in power, the entry criteria can be relaxed (e.g., the minimum downlink RSSI threshold can be lowered). The wireless communication device may even further relax the entry criteria if the relaxed entry criteria continue to produce a sufficiently high connection success rate with the access point. If, on the other hand, the relaxed entry criteria results in too many failed connections (e.g., the connection power fails to meet a specified threshold), the entry criteria may be restored upward again.
Referring again to fig. 3, after having determined the access point-specific entry criteria, at a later time when the wireless communication device has an opportunity to connect to the access point, the wireless communication device may measure one or more downlink transmission quality parameters and compare them to the parameters required by the entry criteria (stage 318). At stage 320, the wireless communication device then determines whether the quality of the downlink transmission from the access point satisfies the entry criteria. In some embodiments, determining whether the downlink transmission quality meets the entry criteria comprises: the downlink transmission power level (e.g., RSSI of a beacon or probe response) of a transmission from an access point is compared to a threshold power level (e.g., a threshold RSSI level). At stage 322, the wireless communication device establishes a connection with the access point if the entry criteria are met. Alternatively, if the entry criteria are not satisfied, the wireless communication device may not establish a connection with the access point (stage 324).
Fig. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for a wireless communication device to set exit criteria for terminating a wireless transmission based on information regarding the relative quality of uplink and downlink transmissions. Typically, after a link has been established between a wireless communication device and an access point, the wireless communication device may monitor the health or quality of the link. If the quality of the link degrades to a point where it is difficult for the wireless communication device to successfully receive downlink transmissions or successfully send uplink transmissions, the wireless communication device may initiate a termination procedure. Initiating the termination process may involve searching for other access points to connect to instead maintaining a link with the currently connected access point, and may sometimes result in immediate termination of the link. Link quality can fluctuate as the wireless communication device moves relative to the access point and will tend to degrade depending on the distance of the wireless communication device from the access point. Other obstacles and interferences may also occur from external conditions. However, to reduce the likelihood that the wireless communication device will maintain a poor quality link if the downlink transmission quality is acceptable but the uplink transmission quality is not, the wireless communication device may perform process 500 to further consider the uplink transmission quality in determining an exit criterion for the link.
At stage 502, a wireless communication device establishes a wireless link (connection) with an access point. Once the link is established, the wireless communication device monitors the health or quality of the link. On a constant or frequent basis, for example, the wireless communication device may measure the quality of downlink transmissions from the access point (stage 504) and identify the quality of uplink transmissions received by the access point (stage 506). In some embodiments, for example, a wireless communication device determines a quality parameter of uplink and downlink transmissions during a connection, such as a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the transmission, a power level of the transmission, a modulation scheme of the transmission, a number of spatial streams provided in the transmission, a coding rate of the transmission, a guard interval of the transmission, or a combination of these. Since downlink transmissions are received by wireless communication devices, the wireless communication devices are typically able to directly determine their quality. For example, the wireless communication device may determine an RSSI level for the downlink transmission and/or an MCS index value for the downlink transmission. However, the wireless communication device may not be able to directly measure certain uplink quality parameters, such as the received signal strength of the uplink transmission at the access point. Thus, the access point may measure the received signal strength of the uplink transmission, either autonomously or upon request from the wireless communication device, and send an indication of the measured signal strength for the uplink transmission to the wireless communication device. In some embodiments where the wireless link is based on the IEEE802.11 protocol, the wireless communication device may utilize the messages originally proposed for beamforming techniques to cause the access point to provide an indication of the received signal strength of the uplink transmission to the wireless communication device. Other uplink quality parameters such as modulation scheme, coding rate and guard interval are set by the transmitter of the wireless communication device and are therefore known to the wireless communication device.
In some implementations, a wireless communication device sets an exit criterion for a link by adjusting a baseline link termination criterion using information about uplink transmission quality and downlink transmission quality. At stage 508, the wireless communication device identifies a baseline termination criteria. As an example, the baseline termination criteria may include a predefined static downlink transmission power threshold (e.g., RSSI level). In the absence of a measurement, the wireless link may be terminated if the measured downlink transmission power level for the downlink transmission from the access point does not meet the static threshold for a period of time. The baseline termination criteria may additionally or alternatively include other quality factors such as a modulation criteria, a code rate criteria, an SNR threshold, or a combination of these and other criteria.
At stage 510, the wireless communication device compares the monitored quality of the downlink and uplink transmissions. If a gap exists between the uplink quality and the downlink quality, the wireless communication device may adjust the exit criteria based on the gap. In some embodiments, the wireless communication device determines a difference between the transmission power levels of the uplink and downlink transmissions (e.g., a difference in RSSI levels of the downlink and uplink transmissions) and then applies the difference as an offset to a predefined static downlink transmission power threshold. For example, the adjusted downlink transmission power threshold may be determined by adding an offset to the baseline threshold, where the offset is equal to the downlink transmission power level minus the uplink transmission power level. Thus, if the received signal strength of the uplink transmission is less than the received signal strength of the downlink transmission, the downlink transmission power threshold may be increased by the difference, thereby making the wireless communication device more sensitive to terminating the existing link.
In some implementations, the wireless communication device determines a difference between Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) index values of the monitored uplink and downlink transmissions, and adjusts a downlink transmission power threshold forming or being part of the exit criteria based on this difference. Each MCS index value may be mapped to a corresponding SNR value. The wireless communication device may then downlinkThe road transmit power threshold is adjusted by an amount equal to the difference between the SNR values of the uplink and downlink transmissions. For example, if the wireless communication device uses the MCS during the course of a connection 1 To broadcast uplink transmissions but the access point uses the MCS 0 To broadcast the downlink transmission, the wireless communication device increases the downlink transmission power level threshold to account for the fact that the access point is using a higher quality modulation and coding scheme. This technique may be beneficial for adjusting the threshold for terminating a link when the wireless communication device cannot access the received signal strength data of the vehicle for uplink transmissions from the access point.
At stage 512, the wireless communication device determines whether the quality of the downlink transmission satisfies the adjusted exit criteria, for example, by comparing the RSSI level of one or more downlink transmissions to an adjusted RSSI threshold. The wireless communication device chooses to maintain the wireless link 514 if the quality of the downlink transmission meets (e.g., equals or exceeds) an adjusted exit criterion, such as a measured RSSI level of the downlink transmission meeting an adjusted RSSI threshold. If, however, the quality of the downlink transmission does not meet the adjusted exit criteria, the wireless communication device may choose to initiate termination of the wireless link (stage 516). In some implementations, the wireless communication device terminates the wireless link only if an alternate access point or network is available that would provide better performance than the current access point. In other embodiments, the wireless communication device terminates the wireless link immediately, regardless of whether an improved link can be established.
Fig. 6 is a flow diagram of an example process 600 for dynamically setting exit criteria for terminating a wireless connection. In some implementations, the process 600 is performed using a wireless communication device (e.g., the wireless communication device 102) and an access point (e.g., the access point 104 or 106).
At stage 602, a wireless communication device establishes a wireless link (connection) with an access point. For example, a wireless communication device may discover an access point through active or passive scanning, may determine that a detected pre-connection downlink transmission from the access point satisfies one or more entry criteria, and may initiate a connection procedure to establish a wireless link.
At stage 604, the wireless communication device can change the quality of its uplink transmission to the access point for a period of time during the course of the link. The variation may be performed explicitly for the purposes of this process 600 in order to derive the exit criteria, or may occasionally vary as a result of typical adjustments to transmission quality parameters by the wireless communication device in response to changing conditions, such as requiring the wireless communication device to compensate for fading or other phenomena over time. The quality of the uplink transmission may be changed by adjusting the power level, modulation scheme, coding rate, guard interval, or a combination of these and/or other quality parameters of the transmission for different transmissions. In some embodiments, a wireless communication device adjusts the quality of its uplink transmissions by transmitting according to quality parameters defined by different MCS index values.
At stage 606, the wireless communication device identifies uplink transmissions that were successfully sent to the access point at different quality levels. In some embodiments, these transmissions may be identified by monitoring for acknowledgment transmissions from the access point. If an acknowledgement is not received, the uplink transmission may not have been successfully sent to and received by the access point. In some embodiments, successfully sent uplink transmissions may be identified as those transmissions for which the access point did not send back an indication that the transmission should be resent.
At stage 608, the wireless communication device identifies a downlink transmission sent from the access point corresponding to a successfully sent uplink transmission. These corresponding downlink transmissions are typically transmissions received by the wireless communication device that are in close temporal proximity to successfully transmitted uplink transmissions. There may also be a logical connection between a successfully sent uplink transmission and a corresponding downlink transmission. For example, the wireless communication device can identify an acknowledgement from the access point as a downlink transmission corresponding to a successfully transmitted uplink transmission. The wireless communication device also determines a downlink transmission power level for the identified downlink transmission corresponding to the successfully transmitted uplink transmission. For example, the wireless communication device may determine an RSSI level of an acknowledgment received in response to a successfully transmitted uplink transmission.
At stage 610, the wireless communication device stores data that maps (i) a downlink transmission power level for an identified downlink transmission corresponding to a successfully transmitted uplink transmission to (ii) a transmission quality level for the successfully transmitted uplink transmission. For example, the data may indicate the MCS 1 The downlink transmission is successfully sent and results in a corresponding downlink transmission received with an RSSI of-83 dB, and in another case the MCS is 0 The downlink uplink transmission is successfully sent and results in a corresponding downlink transmission received with an RSSI of-70 dB. In some implementations, the data includes samples only from a current connection between the wireless communication device and the access point. In other embodiments, the data includes samples additionally from previous connections between the wireless communication device and the access point.
At stage 612, the system determines a threshold downlink transmission power level for terminating the link between the wireless communication device and the access point using data indicative of a history of uplink transmission quality levels (e.g., MCS levels or individual quality parameters) and corresponding downlink transmission power levels. In some embodiments, the threshold is set to or based on a downlink transmission power level mapped to a minimum acceptable uplink transmission quality level. For example, the MCS can be adjusted 1 Is assigned as the minimum acceptable uplink transmission quality level. In some embodiments, the modulation and coding schemes are indexed such that lower values indicate schemes that require less SNR to successfully receive than schemes with higher index values. For example, MCS 1 Transmission and MCS 2 Transmission typically requires less SNR to successfully receive, MCS 2 Transmission and MCS 3 A transmission typically requires a smaller SNR for successful reception than a transmission, and so on. The wireless communication device or a remote system in communication with the wireless communication device may analyze the history of successful uplinks to determine a MCS for the wireless communication device 1 Downlink transmission power corresponding to uplink transmissionRank (e.g., RSSI rank). If there are multiple MCSs indicated in the data 1 For uplink transmissions, the system may calculate the MCS for these 1 An average of the corresponding downlink transmission power levels for the uplink transmissions to generate an exit threshold, or other criteria to select a representative downlink power level as the exit threshold (e.g., an average, median, or pattern of power levels, or a highest or lowest power level).
After the threshold downlink transmission power level for link termination has been set, the wireless communication device continues to monitor the strength of downlink transmissions from the access point during the connection with the access point at stage 614. The measured power level (e.g., RSSI level) of the downlink transmission is compared to a threshold level (stage 616), and if the measured power level is determined to satisfy the threshold power level, the wireless communication device maintains its current connection with the access point (stage 618). However, if the measured power level is determined not to satisfy the threshold power level for a period of time, the wireless communication device may initiate termination of its current connection with the access point (stage 620). In some embodiments, the wireless communication device terminates the connection only if other access points or networks are available that are likely to provide better performance than the currently connected access point. In some embodiments, the wireless communication device may terminate the connection immediately upon identifying that the measured downlink transmission power level does not meet the threshold power level.
