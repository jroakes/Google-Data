Generally speaking, the expense that receives from advertiser 102 is an income.In some embodiments, ad system supvr 104 can set up the Gain sharing scheme with affiliate 112, as participating in or facilitate existing publisher to participate in the excitation of one or more advertising campaigns recruiting other publishers.For example, ad system supvr 104 can distribute to affiliate 112 with 50% total revenue, keeps remaining 50% total revenue simultaneously.As will be described in detail, in other embodiments, the Gain sharing scheme can also comprise publisher 106.
Ad system supvr 104 can define the multiple assembly of Gain sharing scheme, comprises the details and the standard that is used for the Gain sharing scheme is offered affiliate 112 of Gain sharing scheme.The details of Gain sharing scheme can comprise the information of character that for example description is afforded redress and quantity tolerance, and this standard can comprise publisher 106 who for example issues certain types of content and the publisher 106 who is in specific geographic position.
Ad system supvr 104, participate in publisher 106 and affiliate 112 can also based on the income that is produced from the user 108 who checks advertisement (for example, based on flash, point advances, conversion ratio etc.), jointly the Gain sharing strategy is reached an agreement.In some embodiments, affiliate 112 can directly consult about the clause and the publisher 106 of Gain sharing strategy.Clause can comprise the total revenue that receives based on ad system supvr 104, is used for affiliate 112 and shares ratio with publisher 106 estimated earnings.For example, if the total revenue that ad system supvr 104 receives is 100 dollars, and keep wherein 40% be used for the delivery operation expense, then the affiliate can by will remaining 60% total revenue 85% give publisher 106 as split of the profit, encourage publisher's 106 participation advertising campaigns.For reacting Gain sharing ratio higher or still less, clause section at any time is modified.The example that provides more than the use can be that 95% (on the other side is 85%) of remaining 60% total revenue distributed to publisher 106 with clause modification by affiliate 112 after 30 days.
In some embodiments, affiliate 112 can be based on the quality of publisher's content, the popularity of the related web page quantity of user capture (for example based on) or member's rank (for example, participate in gold, silver or bronze medal that the publisher has registered to the affiliate), different Gain sharing rank (for example, the rank of layering) is offered the participation publisher.For example, participation publisher with gold medal membership qualification can receive 60% Gain sharing ratio, participation publisher with silver medal membership qualification can receive 50% Gain sharing ratio, and the participation publisher with bronze medal membership qualification can receive 40% Gain sharing ratio.As another example, the participation publisher with maximum user captures can receive 80% Gain sharing ratio, and other participation publishers can receive 50% Gain sharing ratio.
Certainly, distribute to affiliate 112 and publisher's 106 income and need not be the number percent of total revenue.But affiliate 112 can recommend collect fixed expense from ad system supvr 104 to each publisher, and perhaps publisher 106 can present or advances from ad system supvr 104 at every turn and collect fixed expense each advertisement.Participate on the webpage 116 result of the advertising campaign of operation as the publisher, affiliate 112 can also receive from every click cost, every action cost or the cost that whenever flashes conversion and produce a part the income.In one embodiment, affiliate 112 income share is further segmented between other the third party founders of the embedding content 113 that affiliate 112 and affiliate 112 are provided and permission person.
Still announce the embodiment of different Gain sharing ratios from the Gain sharing ratio of publisher " A " reception 15% affiliate 112 to publisher " B " and publisher " C ", ad system supvr 104 can get involved, with automatic adjustment and publisher " B " and publisher's " C " Gain sharing ratio, thereby make identical with each publisher's Gain sharing ratio.In some embodiments, ad system supvr 104 can be based on comprising the cost that whenever flashes, every click cost and every payable incident of moving into present event, it is inconsistent to follow the tracks of potential ratio, and gets involved so that be matched with the income ratio of stipulating with publisher " B " and publisher " C " by the income expenditure of adjusting affiliate 112.As an alternative, ad system supvr 104 can notify affiliate 112, and before the Gain sharing scheme became effectively, request changed.
In other examples, even the Gain sharing ratio of regulation is consistent between affiliate 112 and each participation publisher 106, but affiliate 112 can control the Gain sharing scheme unrighteously by for example following method: use publisher's content 119 as the means that attract the potential user, and dynamically produce from the advertisement 118 shown in the webpage 116 and other advertising campaign associated advertisement that affiliate 112 may the individual participates in, therefore reduced the number percent of the total revenue that publisher 106 may receive from the advertising campaign of its participation.
More specifically and as discussed above, can insert code segments, advertisement is presented on the webpage 116 by utilizing content 119.This code segment generally comprises publisher sign, and it determines publisher 106 identity, and identification should be received income and flash/click for being presented at which publisher of advertisement 106 on the webpage 119/be changed the account fund that is increased.Generally speaking, this publisher's sign is the sign that has and create the publisher 106 of the content 119 on the webpage 116.In two-way Gain sharing scheme, ad system supvr 104 and publisher 106 may reach an agreement to the Gain sharing ratio, then ad system supvr 104 can increase the account fund of suitable publisher (on the other side is different publishers) by with reference to publisher's sign.In relating to ad system supvr 104, publisher 106 and affiliate's 112 tripartite Gain sharing scheme, affiliate 112 receives the account fund from ad system supvr 104, and a part of account fund is transmitted to publisher 106 based on publisher's sign (for example, discerning) as the ad system supvr.Yet, because affiliate 112 is placed into code segment on the webpage 119 of own trustship publisher's sign of affiliate individual so it has the ability publisher's sign is replaced with.For example, affiliate 112 can show self advertisement with himself distribution indicator in 20% time, with than publisher 106 otherwise the income that can receive is received the income more than 20%.This is called the ad code rotation, and this allows merciless affiliate to replace the publisher that content 119 is carried out monetization and accumulated earnings.
So, in some embodiments, ad system supvr 104 can be ranked or random basis on, the source of each advertisement is determined on contrast publisher content system ground, the unconnected advertisement of advertising campaign that identification and publisher 106 are participated in, and correspondingly notify the publisher.Ad system supvr 106 can also by based on be ranked or random basis on check (for example whether to have more than one publisher to be identified to appear on the two different times example on the same webpage, webpage 116) in the code segment, follows the tracks of potential ad code rotation.If ad system supvr 106 defines more than one publisher and is identified in the code segment that appears on the two different times example on the webpage, then the affiliate who is associated with this webpage may be sanctioned or be punished.
Ad system supvr 104 can implement a kind of expense strategy, and before paying affiliate 112 with total revenue, a part of total revenue that taking-up ad system supvr 104 is kept is used to distribute to publisher 106 therein.For example, if the total revenue that advertising campaign produced is 100 dollars, and the Gain sharing ratio that is used for ad system supvr 104, affiliate 112 and publisher 106 is respectively 40%, 15% and 85%, and then ad system supvr 104 can keep 40 dollars before remaining 60 dollars of incomes being paid should collect 9 dollars the affiliate 112 and 51 dollars the publisher 106 that should collect.
Other orders also are possible.For example, ad system supvr 104 can distribute in reservation before ad system supvr 104 the income share according to the Gain sharing agreement between affiliate 112 and the publisher 106, at first total revenue is paid affiliate 112 and publisher 106.Subsequently, ad system supvr 104 can be from paying that part of of affiliate 112 and deduction and keep the income of certain percentage from pay publisher 106 that part of.
In some embodiments, ad system supvr 104 can be from the income of affiliate 112 and publisher's 106 deduction different weight percentage.For example, if the total revenue that produces from advertising campaign is 100 dollars, and the Gain sharing ratio that is used for affiliate and publisher is respectively 15% and 85%, and then ad system supvr 104 can pay the affiliate with 15 dollars, and pays the publisher with 85 dollars.Then, ad system supvr 104 can deduct 30% in 15 dollars that pay affiliate 112 (promptly 4.5 dollars) and 40% (promptly 34 dollars) paid in 85 dollars of publisher 106 come the up operation expense.This variable proportion allows further excitation and encourage lasting participation that advertising campaign and income are produced valuable affiliate 112 or publisher 106 of ad system supvr 104.For example, affiliate 112 may have the related publisher that very big one group each all participates in advertising campaign.In this example, ad system supvr 104 can (for example deduct certain percentage from the income that affiliate 112 receives, from 30% to 20%), the big number percent of income directly can be consigned to affiliate 112 as the bonus to affiliate's achievement like this, and keep the certain percentage of the income of receiving from each publisher 106 simultaneously.
Similarly, ad system supvr 104 can (for example deduct certain percentage from the total revenue that participation publisher 106 receives, for best achievement person, from 40% to 30%), and keep the certain percentage of the income of receiving from affiliate 112 simultaneously, the big number percent of income directly can be consigned to publisher 106 like this as its content reader number being increased and the bonus of improvement content.
On behalf of advertiser 102, affiliate 112 and publisher 106, ad system supvr 104 can follow the tracks of finance, contract, service and audit matter.For example, ad system supvr 104 can mainly be responsible for withholing, paying, determine the Gain sharing ratio that total revenue, basis are stipulated from advertiser's 102 acceptance existing Gain sharing agreement from advertiser 102, increase affiliate 112 and/or publisher's 106 account fund.Affiliate 112 can be responsible for marking off a part and give publisher 106 according to the clause of arranging between affiliate 112 and the publisher 106 from the income that ad system supvr 104 receives.
In other embodiments, publisher 106 and ad system supvr 104 can reach an agreement with regard to the Gain sharing arrangement under the situation that affiliate 112 does not have to participate in.For example, in order to participate in advertising campaign, publisher 106 can be directly and ad system supvr 104 consult the Gain sharing ratios.In these embodiments, publisher 106 can register as affiliate 112 to ad system supvr 104, and other publishers 106 of trustship or himself embedded content 113 offered other publishers 106.In such embodiment, affiliate 112 can collect variable or fixing expense (or ratio) from publisher 106, to be used for management display ads and/or can embed content 113 on webpage 116.
In one embodiment, ad system supvr 104 can limit affiliate 112 maximum return and share ratio, collects from all or most of income that the content monetization of publisher's networked asset is received thereby hinder affiliate 112.For example, ad system supvr 104 can share proportional limit with each affiliate's 112 maximum return and be made as 75%, to prevent the income drawback.In other embodiments, can use other excitations, so that all total revenues directly can be consigned to publisher 106, this can encourage content is improved potentially, to obtain more a high proportion of reader's number.
In some embodiments, affiliate 112 can revise the clause of existing Gain sharing agreement.For example, affiliate 112 can determine to revise the Gain sharing ratio with related publisher 106.Affiliate 112 can submit to ad system supvr 104 with the change of Gain sharing ratio and confirm.Can submit this change to by being configured to facilitate between affiliate 112 and ad system supvr 104 user interface in communication.As an alternative, can submit this change to the form of message beyond Email or the user interface.
In response to the request that receives change Gain sharing ratio, ad system supvr 104 can notify each related publisher 106 relevant with the rate variable request.For example, ad system supvr 104 can notify all related publishers 106 (or the account that is associated with ad system supvr 104) by electronic information, and corresponding affiliate's 112 Gain sharing ratio will be adjusted into 20% from 15%.In other embodiments, can require affiliate 112 that amended clause directly is notified to the participation publisher 106 that all are associated with it.
In some embodiments, only the ratio change just comes into force after the preset time section, changes so that allow participation publisher 106 to have an opportunity to defer to and adapt to new ratio.For example, the modification clause of existing Gain sharing agreement comes into force after having asked 30 days receiving.Another is exemplified as, and the modification clause of existing Gain sharing agreement participates in coming into force after 30 days from the publisher 106 in that a new ratio change communication is given.
In response to the ratio change request, can give publisher 106 and accept new modification clause or the option that is associated with new affiliate 112 with less affiliate's Gain sharing ratio.
In some embodiments, can before forming association between expection publisher 106 and the related affiliate 112, determine the clause of Gain sharing agreement.For example, during affiliate-publisher's association process, each expection publisher 106 can be to assessing with the related of affiliate 112.This assessment can participate in the Gain sharing ratio that publisher 106 sets up with other based on affiliate 112.The publisher 106 of each expection can with affiliate 112 form related before, the Gain sharing ratio between the affiliate 112 relatively.In some embodiments, if affiliate 112 has submitted also unenforced rate variable request to, then new rate variable and the value relevant with this change can be notified to expection publisher 106.
When the affiliate's 112 frequent submissions with a plurality of publishers 106 of participation change the request of existing Gain sharing terms of agreement, then this frequent change will cause confusion participation publisher 106.So, in some embodiments, can the quantity that affiliate 112 can submit to ad system supvr 104 request be limited.For example, ad system supvr 104 can only allow once to ask in one month.In other embodiments, ad system supvr 104 can apply the observation period between request.For example, the observation period can be formerly ask and current request between 90 days.
Although above embodiment is to be associated with single affiliate 112 according to a publisher 106 to be described, publisher 106 can also form related with a plurality of affiliates 112.For example, publisher " A " can be provided with blog on " blogger.com ", and by making it possible to show one or more advertisements on this blog, participates in the Gain sharing scheme with " blogger.com ".Simultaneously, publisher " A " can also go up a guy's web space at " Myspace.com ", wherein the publisher " A " can set up the personal profiles page, interest, attribute, feature, network and tissue that this personal profiles page-describing is associated with publisher " A ".Publisher " A " can participate in the different Gain sharing schemes with " Myspace.com " by making it possible on this personal profiles page the viewer who browses this page to be illustrated a border advertisement.Similarly, publisher 106 can be embedded in the content from a plurality of affiliates 112 together with related advertisement.
In certain embodiments, affiliate 112 can get rid of some contents 113 and use in Gain sharing, and/or publisher 106 can get rid of some affiliate 112 or content 113 appears on publisher 106 the website 116.Embedding content 113 can be one section content, perhaps can be the content playlist play of form in order.
Reward the plan of recommending
In some embodiments, ad system supvr 104 can also implement to reward the recommendation plan, affiliate 112 is recruited new publishers 106 participate in one or more advertising campaigns that ad system supvr 104 managed and reward.Incentive plan can be organized as: those are received in the income that with it to distribute to the affiliate 112 who participates in publisher 106 than many parts more favourable.Provide more income share can encourage more publishers on affiliate web assets, to issue their content to participating in publisher 106,, also in participating in the publisher, promoted publisher's loyalty simultaneously by issue being provided enough compensation.
Reward the recommendation plan award bonus can be provided, can calculate the award bonus based on after affiliate's income share is adjusted, distributing to each income share that participates in publisher 106.Can also based on about on the webpage 116 management total revenue advertising campaign, before income deduction is distributed to ad system supvr 104 determine the award bonus.
In some embodiments, reward bonus in order to make affiliate's 112 qualified acceptance, the threshold value that can bear interest and time restriction, in this time restriction, publisher 106 must reach revenue threshold.For example, if revenue threshold is set to 10 dollars, time restriction is set to 180 days time period, and then affiliate " A " will be only when publisher " A " obtains 10 dollars income in 180 days, and bonus is rewarded in qualified acceptance.
In some embodiments, if publisher 106 is associated with a plurality of affiliates 112, then can stipulate revenue threshold (and time restriction) at specific affiliate.For example, if publisher " A " is all related with affiliate A and affiliate B, and supposition will be used for affiliate " A " and affiliate's " B " revenue threshold and time restriction and be set in 180 days 10 dollars and 90 days 20 dollars respectively, then only when publisher " A " obtained 10 dollars income on the webpage of affiliate " A " trustship in 180 days, affiliate A just has qualification and accepts to reward bonus, and then only when publisher " A " obtained 20 dollars income on the webpage of affiliate " B " trustship in 90 days, affiliate " B " just has qualification and accepts the award bonus.
In some embodiments, can the function that the recommendation plan is established as shared income, Gain sharing ratio and estimated earnings threshold value will be rewarded.In the time of can working as the income that participates in publisher 106 and reached predetermined threshold, will reward prize payout and give affiliate 112.In some embodiments, pay the revenue threshold that the quantity of affiliate 112 award bonus equals to be scheduled to.For example, if predetermined revenue threshold is set to 10 dollars, when then affiliate 112 will reach 10 dollars in publisher 112 income, receive 10 dollars award bonus.
Can when reach the estimated earnings threshold value at every turn, use and reward bonus.For example, if participate in publisher 106 30 dollars income is arranged, wherein Yu Ding revenue threshold is set to 10 dollars, then Guan Lian affiliate 112 will recommend to receive in the works the award bonus of 30 dollars (3* reaches 10 dollars 10 dollars at every turn) in award except the income of receiving in the Gain sharing agreement.
For example, suppose that publisher " A " two people that affiliate " A " and affiliate " A " are recommended agree 25% and 75% Gain sharing ratio respectively, and the publisher " B " that affiliate " B " and affiliate " B " are recommended agrees 50% and 50% Gain sharing ratio respectively, and supposition remaining total revenue part every day (being net proceeds) after adjusting the gerentocratic income share of ad system is 1 dollar, then under the condition of Gain sharing agreement, in ten days, publisher " A " will receive 7.5 dollars (10 days * 75% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *), and publisher " B " will receive 5 dollars (10 days * 50% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *).If predetermined revenue threshold is set to 10 dollars, then recommend publisher " A " to the affiliate " A " of advertising campaign will under the Gain sharing agreement, receive 2.5 dollars profit (for example, 10 days * 25% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *), but can not receive the award bonus, because the income that publisher " A " receives does not also reach predetermined revenue threshold (promptly 10 dollars).Equally, recommend publisher " B " to the affiliate " B " of advertising campaign will under the Gain sharing agreement, receive 5 dollars profit (for example, 10 days * 50% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *), but can not receive the award bonus, because the income that publisher " B " receives does not also reach 10 dollars of predetermined revenue threshold.
Yet, the same standard of using in the example before the priority of use, then in 15 days, publisher " A " will receive 11.25 dollars (15 days * 75% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *), and publisher " B " will receive 7.5 dollars (15 days * 50% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *).Because publisher's " A " income has surpassed 10 dollars of revenue threshold that require, this makes the qualified acceptance of affiliate " A " reward bonus, affiliate " A " will receive 13.75 dollars, wherein 3.75 dollars (15 days * 25% Gain sharing ratios of 1 dollar of *) are the incomes of receiving under the Gain sharing agreement, and 10 dollars be in the income of reward recommending to receive in the works.On the other hand, because the income that publisher " B " receives does not reach 10 dollars of predetermined revenue threshold, so affiliate " B " does not have qualification to accept to reward bonus.
From above example obviously as seen, affiliate " A " at first income be less than affiliate " B " (for example, in 10 days).Yet, along with rewarding the enforcement of recommending plan, affiliate 112 with low Gain sharing ratio (for example 25%) can be than (for example having higher Gain sharing ratio in long-term, 50%) affiliate 112 benefit from bigger income profit is more (for example, affiliate " A " received 13.75 dollars at 15 days, received 40 dollars in 40 days, received 7.5 dollars at 15 days, received 30 dollars in 40 days) with respect to affiliate " B ".
Utilization is rewarded recommendation and is planned, and high yield is shared proportional distribution can allow affiliate 112 more to overcharge beneficial being benefited from financially receiving for a long time, publisher 106 that attraction is simultaneously expected and the loyalty that promotes the publisher to each participation publisher 106.Reward and recommend plan to allow affiliate 112 to give publisher 106 distribution of income of more shares, simultaneously can be not impaired because of the income that reduces, allow affiliate 112 to construct the income scheme that is fit to the particular business situation neatly.
For example, be to increase business earnings if be used for allowing the publisher by affiliate's business prototype that the ad system supvr participates in advertising campaign, then the affiliate can select to give than the distribution of income of low number percent and participate in the publisher.As another example, if affiliate's business prototype is the publisher who attracts to produce high-quality content, then the affiliate can keep less neatly or not keep from the income share that participates in the publisher.
In some embodiments, have more than one award threshold value, given a definition the award bonus corresponding in each threshold value.This has created the incentive structure of layering.For example,, obtained 10 dollars income, then the award bonus of 10 dollars of qualified acquisitions of affiliate if participate in the publisher at ground floor.At the second layer, if the publisher obtains 100 dollars income, the affiliate can qualified acquisition 250 dollars award bonus, so based on the bonus structure of layering, the affiliate has accumulated 255 dollars award bonus altogether.
In some embodiments, the affiliate can also obtain bonus because of having recruited a plurality of publishers that reach aforesaid one or more revenue threshold.For example, if suppose revenue threshold be set to 100 dollars and have 25 participate in publishers obtained 100 dollars net proceeds (for example, after the income section that the ad system supvr is kept is adjusted), then the affiliate can the extra award bonus (for example, 2000 dollars award bonus) of qualified acceptance.Can the quantity of this class bonus that can be distributed to the affiliate in the given time period be limited.For example, the premiums bonus based on the participation publisher quantity that reaches specific revenue threshold can be restricted to annual one.As an alternative, can the quantity of this class bonus that can be distributed to the affiliate in the given time period not limited.
Example process
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram that is used for determining the example process of Gain sharing between affiliate 112 and the publisher 106.Process 300 can be carried out by for example system 100, and succinct on explaining, below describes and uses these bases as the example of description process 300.Yet the combination of other system or system can be used for implementation 300.
In the example shown, process 300 starts from receiving the request (302) that participates in Gain sharing from the affiliate.The affiliate can be the online service supplier of the one or more web assets of trustship, perhaps can be the source of online content, and this online content can be embedded in the advertisement that will offer the publisher.The web assets can be the online services below for example: be provided for the user is produced the content personal space shared with users interest/viewer, media companies, record company, radio network etc. to the publisher.
In response to this request, can produce graphic user interface (GUI) (304).GUI can operate and allow the affiliate for any appropriate purpose, such as checking advertisement, and mutual with at least one ad system supvr.Generally speaking, GUI to the specific user provide system 100 to provide or within it communication data effectively and user-friendly presenting.GUI can comprise a plurality of customizable framework or views with interactive fields, drop-down list and button.In some embodiments, if the affiliate had before participated in the Gain sharing scheme, then GUI can operate so that user-friendly form is shown Gain sharing ratio in the past.GUI can also present a plurality of portal websites or panel board (dashboard).
GUI can be configurable, with support form and figure (bar, line, cake, state dish etc.), and can set up real time data, comprises the current income of having obtained, current income ratio etc.Should be appreciated that term " graphic user interface " can use with odd number or plural form, is used for describing each demonstration of one or more graphic user interfaces and special pattern user interface.In fact, can refer to as required front end and can quoting quoting of GUI via the particular user interface of advertiser, affiliate or publisher's visit.So GUI discussed herein has expected in system 100 process information and any graphic user interface that the result is effectively presented to the user, such as general-purpose web browser or touch-screen.
In some embodiments, if the affiliate has participated in the Gain sharing scheme, then can omit operation 302, and the affiliate can login (for example, passing through username and password) with the calling party interface.Can for example login, and login process can use encryption, such as Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) by webpage.
Then, process 300 is confirmed affiliate's Gain sharing ratio appointment and the publisher (310).In some embodiments, confirm that the Gain sharing ratio can comprise the Gain sharing ratio that shows other affiliates, relatively each participates in the ratio between the affiliate thereby allow the publisher.In other embodiments, confirming that the Gain sharing ratio can comprise from the publisher who is associated with content type that for example publisher provides to viewer/user receives additional information.The publisher can also be provided user interface, and wherein the publisher can login and check the set Gain sharing ratio of each affiliate that is associated with the publisher at any time.
Then, process 300 is called the automatic Gain sharing (312) between affiliate and the publisher.In some embodiments, call automatic Gain sharing and can comprise when definite previous Gain sharing ratio (if any) comes into force.If the time that previous Gain sharing ratio comes into force is less than the time period of expectation, then calls automatic Gain sharing and can be included in above calling Gain sharing after the time period of expecting.For example, if the time period of expectation is 90 days, and current Gain sharing ratio is last modification the before 30 days, and then process 300 will only be called automatic Gain sharing after 60 days.
In other embodiments, call automatic Gain sharing and can comprise the frequency of determining that the Gain sharing ratio was modified in the section in preset time.In these embodiments,, then call automatic Gain sharing and only can comprise and after preset time, section expired, call Gain sharing if the frequency in the preset time section surpasses predetermined ratio.For example, if predetermined ratio has revised twice in 30 days, determine that then current proposed amendments to the Gain sharing ratio is the third revision in 15 days, then process 300 will be called automatic Gain sharing after 15 days.
Can be by the operation 302-312 in the order of listing, parallel (for example,, basic or non-serial) or the backward implementation 300 by identical or different process.For example, in some embodiments, can carry out from the publisher and receive the request (308) that participates in Gain sharing in the input (306) that receives appointment Gain sharing ratio from the affiliate before.In other embodiments, can carry out from the publisher and receive the request (308) that participates in Gain sharing in the request (302) that receives the participation Gain sharing from the affiliate before.
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of example process 400 that is used for determining affiliate's award.Be similar to process 300, process 400 can be carried out by for example system 100, and easy in order to explain, and below describes and uses these bases as the example of description process 400.Yet the combination of other system or system can be used for implementation 400.
As shown, process 400 starts from receiving total revenue report (402) from the advertiser.In some embodiments, the total revenue report can include but not limited to following information: click-through rate, per thousand ad revenue, every dollar of other translation data that spend conversion and be associated with the affairs that relate to serve ads etc.In some embodiments, the ad system supvr can produce such report based on the data of the online advertising system of flowing through.
In some embodiments, determine revenue threshold based on the Gain sharing ratio.Can set up revenue threshold pro rata with the Gain sharing ratio of affiliate's appointment.For example, reducing the Gain sharing ratio (for example, dropping to 10% from 20%) that is distributed to the affiliate will allow the publisher to reach revenue threshold in the short period section than low revenue threshold (for example, dropping to 10 dollars from 20 dollars).
In some embodiments, based on the total revenue before the deduction operation cost, calculate and reward.The exemplary operation expense can include but not limited to: will pay ad system gerentocratic income share.In these embodiments, revenue threshold and income share remaining after affiliate's income share and operation cost are adjusted are compared.For example, if total revenue is 100 dollars, it is 20 dollars that Gain sharing ratio between affiliate and the publisher is set to 60% to 40% ratio (being that the publisher will receive 40 dollars) and operation cost, and then remaining 20 dollars (promptly deducting operation cost from publisher's income) compare with revenue threshold.Then, can when satisfy predetermined revenue threshold, remaining income share (after income share and operation cost adjustment to the affiliate) will reward Bonus Reward and give the affiliate.
