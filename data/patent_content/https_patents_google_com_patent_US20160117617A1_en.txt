Definitions
- This specification relates to information retrieval.
- Conventional online travel booking sites allow users to identify and purchase travel according to a specified itinerary. For example, a user can purchase an airline flight itinerary for a flight departing from one location on a particular date and arriving at another location. Typically, following the purchase of a particular flight itinerary, the user will follow the flight itinerary and complete the trip.
- Flight delays and/or cancelations can be caused by weather conditions, equipment problems and/or other factors. Flight delays can occur or be predicted at various parts of an itinerary, such as before travel occurs or sometime after travel has commenced.
- This specification describes technologies relating to determining alternative travel itineraries.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of obtaining current flight status information for a plurality of flights; using the current flight status information to determine that a flight itinerary of a user is delayed or cancelled; determining one or more alternative flight itineraries to the flight itinerary that is delayed or cancelled, comprising: determining one or more preferential status indicators from the flight itinerary information of the user, obtaining a collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries occurring within a specified time frame and that correspond to a origin and destination of the user itinerary, wherein the candidate alternative flight itineraries are expanded to include flight itineraries and seat classes that are potentially available to the user based on the one or more preferential status indicators, ranking the collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries according to one or more criteria, and selecting a specified number of highest ranked candidates to generate a group of alternative flight itineraries; and providing one or more of the group of alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- the method further includes determining current flight status information for a specified number of highest ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries; and filtering the highest ranked candidate alternative flights based on the current flight status to generate a group of alternative flight itineraries.
- the one or more preferential status indicators include an elevated frequent flier status on one or more carriers.
- the one or more preferential status indicators include particular booked seat classes.
- the one or more preferential status indicators include historical user travel information.
- the one or more preferential status indicators include specific information provided in a profile associated with the user. Obtaining a collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries includes obtaining flight itineraries with available first-class or business-class seating.
- Providing one or more of the group of alternative flight itineraries for display includes providing an indicator for display with particular alternative flight itineraries considered full but potentially available to the user based on their preferential status.
- Providing one or more alternative flight itineraries for display includes ordering the one or more alternative flight itineraries according to the estimated actual times instead of scheduled times for each alternative flight itinerary.
- a user can be informed of available options for alternative flight itineraries when one or more flight legs of an itinerary of the user is delayed or cancelled.
- a user can be automatically informed of alternative flight itineraries which can save time which can increase the number of alternative flight itineraries to which a user is able to connect.
- a user can use the provided alternative flight itinerary information when negotiating with a carrier after the user's itinerary is delayed or cancelled.
- a user can be made aware of seats that may be available to the user based on one or more preferential status indicators associated with the user, which may expand the number of alternative itineraries open to the user.

- the travel re-accommodation system 106 receives current flight status information from multiple feed providers and aggregates the received current flight status information in the data store 110 .
- the current flight status information 107 can include, for example, information indicating whether each flight itinerary is scheduled, on-time, delayed, cancelled, diverted, or landed.
- the current flight status information 107 can include information that indicates whether there is available seating for each respective scheduled flight itinerary.
- the available seating information can indicate a class (e.g., economy, first-class, business-class) of some or all of the available seats.
- the travel re-accommodation system 106 can determine when a user has purchased a flight itinerary, for users who have given permission for such a determination. Determined user flight itineraries can be stored in a user flight itineraries data store 112 .
- the current flight status information 107 can include current status information for flight itineraries stored in the user flight itineraries data store 112 and for other flight itineraries.
- the travel re-accommodation system 106 can use the current flight status information stored in the data store 110 to determine that one or more user legs from the user itineraries in the data store 112 have been delayed or cancelled.
- a flight leg is a routing between an origin and a destination city.
- the travel re-accommodation system 106 can determine one or more alternative flight itineraries 114 to the current flight itinerary including one or more delayed or cancelled flight legs.
- the current flight status information is also used in determining the one or more alternative flight itineraries 114 .
- One or more of the determined alternative flight itineraries 114 can be provided to a respective user device 104 for display (e.g., as illustrated by provided alternative flight itineraries 116 ).

- the provided alternative flight itineraries 116 can include information that allows the user to make an informed decision when choosing an alternative flight itinerary.
- the automatic providing of alternative flight itinerary information can result in the user knowing available travel-change options at an earlier time as compared to the user attempting to manually or otherwise determine alternative flight itineraries.
- the automatic providing of alternative flight itinerary information can make the user aware of alternative flight itineraries that are currently available but that might soon be unavailable (e.g., unfeasible, due to impending departure times). Accordingly, the automatic providing of alternative flight itinerary information can result in the user being able to select from a larger number of alternative flight itineraries as compared to the user attempting to, for example, manually determine alternative flight itineraries.
- the user can use alternative flight itinerary information, for example, when discussing or negotiating travel change options with a carrier associated with the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary.
- the provided alternative flight itineraries 116 can include, for example, available flight itineraries that are not known to the carrier and/or flight itineraries that a carrier representative might not suggest (e.g., initially or otherwise) to the user.
- the provided alternative flight itineraries 116 can be used by the user, for example, as leverage when negotiating with the carrier.
- the carrier for example, may suggest an alternative itinerary that matches a cancelled or delayed travel leg, but not an alternative itinerary that results in the user reaching their final destination.
- the alternative flight itinerary information can inform the user as to available options for reaching their final destination.
- the travel re-accommodation system 106 can include preferential-status-based alternative flight itineraries in the alternative flight itineraries 114 that are potentially available to the user based on one or more preferential status indicators.
- Preferential status indicators can include, for example, an elevated frequent flier status of the user or a particular booked-seat class (e.g., first class, business class).
- Providing preferential-status-based alternative flight itineraries to the user can, for example, provide the user with information that may be useful for negotiating with the carrier of the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. The user (and/or the carrier) may not have previously known that the preferential-status-based alternative flight itineraries are potentially available to the user.

- FIG. 4A is flow diagram of an example method 400 for providing one or more alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device.
- the method 400 will be described with respect to a system, including one or more computing devices, that performs the method 400 .
- the system obtains current flight status information for a collection of flights (step 402 ).
- the current flight status information can be obtained, for example, from a feed of flight status information, e.g., flight information feed provider 108 of FIG. 1 .
- the system uses the current flight status information to determine that a flight itinerary of a user includes one or more flight legs that are delayed or cancelled (step 404 ). For example, a departure for an initial leg or a subsequent leg of a user itinerary may be delayed or cancelled. In some implementations, a determination can be made that a flight itinerary is in danger of being delayed but not necessarily delayed. For example, the arrival of an airplane to be used on a next travel leg may possibly be delayed, due to a delayed departure of that airplane on its current flight.
- the system determine one or more alternative flight itineraries that are alternatives to the flight itinerary that is delayed or cancelled (step 406 ).
- FIG. 4B is flow diagram of an example method 420 for determining one or more alternative flight itineraries.
- the method 420 will be described with respect to a system, including one or more computing devices, that performs the method 420 .
- the system determines one or more preferential status indicators from flight itinerary information of a user (step 422 ).
- the one or more preferential status indicators can include, for example, one or more of an elevated frequent flier status on one or more carriers or particular booked seat classes in the user's flight itinerary (e.g., first class, business class).
- the one or more preferential status indicators can be determined based on one or more of the current flight itinerary, one or more historical user travel information, or specific information provided in a profile associated with the user.
- the system obtains a collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries occurring within a specified time frame and that correspond to an origin and a destination of the user itinerary (step 424 ). If a connecting flight is delayed or cancelled, the candidate alternative flight itineraries can be alternatives for a next leg of the user flight itinerary.
- Candidate alternative flight itineraries can be obtained from a feed or a data store.
- the specified time frame can be, for example, within forty eight hours of a scheduled arrival time of a user itinerary.
- similar candidate alternative flight itineraries are grouped. For example, codeshare flights and/or flight itineraries that share legs or leg connections can be grouped.
- a codeshare flight can be operating for multiple airlines and can appear multiple times, for example, in a feed of flight information.
- Grouping can include, for example, merging the grouped candidate alternative flight itineraries into a single candidate alternative flight itinerary. Grouping or merging candidate alternative flight itineraries can result in less duplicate (or nearly duplicate) itineraries being included in the collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries.
- the system expands the candidate alternative flight itineraries to include flight itineraries and seat classes that are potentially available to the user based on the one or more preferential status indicators (step 426 ). For example, flight itineraries with available first-class or business-class seating can be obtained. As another example, flight itineraries can be obtained that are listed as full and are associated with a carrier for which the user has an elevated frequent flier status.
- the system ranks the collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries according to one or more criteria (step 428 ).
- the criteria can include one or more of a date that the candidate alternative flight itinerary arrives at the destination or a carrier of the candidate alternative flight itinerary as compared with the carrier of the user's fight itinerary. For example, same-day flights can be considered more important than flight itineraries that arrive on later dates.
- a candidate alternative flight itinerary that has a carrier that matches the carrier of the user's flight itinerary (or that has a carrier that is an affiliated carrier to the carrier of the user's flight itinerary) can be considered more important than candidate alternative flight itineraries that have carriers that are not affiliated with the carrier of the user's flight itinerary.
- the criteria can also include one or more of destination arrival time, duration or number of connections of the candidate alternative flight itinerary. For example, candidate alternative flight itineraries that arrive the earliest can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. Candidate alternative flight itineraries that take a least amount of time between departure and arrival can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. Candidate alternative flight itineraries that use a fewest number of connections can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. As another example, the criteria can include time-in-flight (e.g., candidate alternative flight itineraries with more time-in-flight can be ranked lower than candidate alternative flight itineraries with less time-in-flight).
- time-in-flight e.g., candidate alternative flight itineraries with more time-in-flight can be ranked lower than candidate alternative flight itineraries with less time-in-flight.
- the criteria includes a determined risk factor.
- a weather risk can be determined for each candidate alternative flight itinerary. For example, if the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary is delayed or cancelled due to winter weather in Boston and winter-weather cancellations or delays have also been determined for one or more Chicago arrivals, a candidate alternative flight itinerary that routes through Dallas may be ranked higher than a candidate alternative flight itinerary that routes through Chicago, even when the Dallas itinerary takes longer and the Chicago itinerary is currently not cancelled.
- a determined risk-factor can affect other criteria. For example, when an imminent weather-based risk is determined, a weight of a departure time criteria can be increased (e.g., it may be desirable to depart before a weather event occurs).
- the criteria can include a likelihood of the user being able to make a connection (e.g., based on estimated arrival time for a connecting flight).
- a risk factor is weighted based on whether a connection flight is a last connecting flight of the day. For example, suppose that a first candidate alternative flight itinerary routes the user to Chicago with a tight connection and is a last connecting flight of the day to the user's final destination. Suppose that a second candidate alternative flight itinerary also routes the user to Chicago with a tight connection but there are four other, later connections that day from Chicago to the user's final destination. The first candidate alternative flight itinerary can be determined to be more risky than the second candidate alternative flight itinerary since the first candidate alternative flight itinerary has a higher risk of the user being stranded overnight in Chicago.
- the criteria can also include criteria that are related to one or more of the preferential status indicators. For example, candidate flight itineraries that are associated with a carrier for which the user has an elevated frequent flier status can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. As another example, when one or more of the preferential status indicators indicate that a user had booked a first-class or business-class seat on the delayed or cancelled user flight itinerary, the ranking engine can rank candidate alternative flight itineraries that have available first-class or business-class seats higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries.
- a system selects a specified number of highest ranked candidates to generate a group of alternative flight itineraries ( 430 ).
- the specified number can be a predetermined number (e.g., ten).
- the specified number can be the number of ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries that have a ranking above a threshold ranking.
- Updated current flight status information can be determined for the highest ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries to determine, for example, whether a flight status, arrival time, or other information has changed or is no longer valid for a candidate alternative flight itinerary. If flight information has changed for a ranked candidate alternative flight itinerary, a determination can be made as to whether to adjust the ranking or to remove the candidate alternative flight itinerary from consideration (e.g., if the likelihood of the user being able to make a connection is low or zero). The remaining specified number of highest ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries can be selected as the group of alternative flight itineraries.
- the system provides one or more of the group of alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device (step 308 ).
- information indicating the current flight status of each alternative flight itinerary is provided.
- Flight status can include, for example, on-time, scheduled, delayed, cancelled, diverted, or landed.
- flight status is shown using color coding of different statuses.
- the one or more alternative flight itineraries can be ordered according to estimated actual times instead of scheduled times for each alternative flight itinerary. Terminal and gate information can be provided for each alternative flight itinerary.
- alternative flight itineraries can be initially shown in a summary view, and a respective alternative flight itinerary can be shown with more information presented in a detailed view upon selection of the alternative flight itinerary in the summary view.
- the user can toggle between the summary view and the detailed view.
- the alternative flight itinerary information is automatically displayed in a notification area (e.g., a popup window) on a user device, to notify the user of a delayed or cancelled flight and to present the alternative flight itineraries.
- the group of alternative flight itineraries are grouped into a first group of flight itineraries having the same carrier as the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary, a second group of flight itineraries on a partner carrier of the carrier of the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary, and a third group of other flight itineraries. Flight itineraries can be sorted within respective groups, for example according to departure time.

Description
- This specification relates to information retrieval.
- Conventional online travel booking sites allow users to identify and purchase travel according to a specified itinerary. For example, a user can purchase an airline flight itinerary for a flight departing from one location on a particular date and arriving at another location. Typically, following the purchase of a particular flight itinerary, the user will follow the flight itinerary and complete the trip.
- Existing flight itineraries can be affected by different factors, many of which may be out of control of the user. For example, flight delays and/or cancelations can be caused by weather conditions, equipment problems and/or other factors. Flight delays can occur or be predicted at various parts of an itinerary, such as before travel occurs or sometime after travel has commenced.
- This specification describes technologies relating to determining alternative travel itineraries.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of obtaining current flight status information for a plurality of flights; using the current flight status information to determine that a flight itinerary of a user is delayed or cancelled; determining one or more alternative flight itineraries to the flight itinerary that is delayed or cancelled, comprising: determining one or more preferential status indicators from the flight itinerary information of the user, obtaining a collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries occurring within a specified time frame and that correspond to a origin and destination of the user itinerary, wherein the candidate alternative flight itineraries are expanded to include flight itineraries and seat classes that are potentially available to the user based on the one or more preferential status indicators, ranking the collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries according to one or more criteria, and selecting a specified number of highest ranked candidates to generate a group of alternative flight itineraries; and providing one or more of the group of alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- The foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. The method further includes determining current flight status information for a specified number of highest ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries; and filtering the highest ranked candidate alternative flights based on the current flight status to generate a group of alternative flight itineraries. The one or more preferential status indicators include an elevated frequent flier status on one or more carriers. The one or more preferential status indicators include particular booked seat classes. The one or more preferential status indicators include historical user travel information. The one or more preferential status indicators include specific information provided in a profile associated with the user. Obtaining a collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries includes obtaining flight itineraries with available first-class or business-class seating. Providing one or more of the group of alternative flight itineraries for display includes providing an indicator for display with particular alternative flight itineraries considered full but potentially available to the user based on their preferential status. Providing one or more alternative flight itineraries for display includes ordering the one or more alternative flight itineraries according to the estimated actual times instead of scheduled times for each alternative flight itinerary.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. A user can be informed of available options for alternative flight itineraries when one or more flight legs of an itinerary of the user is delayed or cancelled. A user can be automatically informed of alternative flight itineraries which can save time which can increase the number of alternative flight itineraries to which a user is able to connect. A user can use the provided alternative flight itinerary information when negotiating with a carrier after the user's itinerary is delayed or cancelled. A user can be made aware of seats that may be available to the user based on one or more preferential status indicators associated with the user, which may expand the number of alternative itineraries open to the user.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 4B is flow diagram of an example method for determining one or more alternative flight itineraries. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Users can book travel itineraries, for example, by using an online booking site. A travel re-accommodation system can monitor current flight status information for a booked itinerary and can determine that a flight itinerary of a user is delayed or cancelled based on the current flight status information. The travel re-accommodation system can determine one or more alternative flight itineraries for the user and provide one or more alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device of the user. The displayed alternative flight itineraries can include a group of alternative flight itineraries selected based on one or more preferential status indicators of the user, such as a frequent flier status, a class of booked seat, historical user travel information, or user profile information.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing filters for filtering flight itineraries. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectsuser devices 104 to atravel system 106. Theexample environment 100 may includemany user devices 104, which can each be associated with one or more users. - A
user device 104 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 104 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other suitable devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 104 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. A user of auser device 104 can, for example, use a web browser to search for a particular travel itinerary, including a flight itinerary. - The
travel re-accommodation system 106 can receive currentflight status information 107 from a flightinformation feed provider 108. The currentflight status information 107 can be, for example, real-time flight status information for flights that have an upcoming scheduled departure time within a predetermined time (e.g., twenty-four hours) of transmission of the currentflight status information 107. Thetravel re-accommodation system 106 can store the received currentflight status information 107 in a current flight statusinformation data store 110. Thetravel re-accommodation system 106 can receive the currentflight status information 107 on a periodic basis (e.g., every five minutes). In some implementations, the flightinformation feed provider 108 pushes the currentflight status information 107 to thetravel re-accommodation system 106. In some implementations, thetravel re-accommodation system 106 pulls the currentflight status information 107 from the flightinformation feed provider 108. The flightinformation feed provider 108 can be, for example, one or more carriers. As another example, the flightinformation feed provider 108 can be a third party flight monitoring system or some other third party aggregator. In some implementations, thetravel re-accommodation system 106 receives current flight status information from multiple feed providers and aggregates the received current flight status information in thedata store 110. - The current
flight status information 107 can include, for example, information indicating whether each flight itinerary is scheduled, on-time, delayed, cancelled, diverted, or landed. The currentflight status information 107 can include information that indicates whether there is available seating for each respective scheduled flight itinerary. The available seating information can indicate a class (e.g., economy, first-class, business-class) of some or all of the available seats. - The
travel re-accommodation system 106 can determine when a user has purchased a flight itinerary, for users who have given permission for such a determination. Determined user flight itineraries can be stored in a user flightitineraries data store 112. The currentflight status information 107 can include current status information for flight itineraries stored in the user flightitineraries data store 112 and for other flight itineraries. - The
travel re-accommodation system 106 can use the current flight status information stored in thedata store 110 to determine that one or more user legs from the user itineraries in thedata store 112 have been delayed or cancelled. A flight leg is a routing between an origin and a destination city. For each delayed or cancelled flight leg, thetravel re-accommodation system 106 can determine one or morealternative flight itineraries 114 to the current flight itinerary including one or more delayed or cancelled flight legs. In some implementations, the current flight status information is also used in determining the one or morealternative flight itineraries 114. One or more of the determinedalternative flight itineraries 114 can be provided to arespective user device 104 for display (e.g., as illustrated by provided alternative flight itineraries 116). - The
alternative flight itineraries 116 can be provided to auser device 104 automatically, in response to the determination that a flight itinerary of the user of theuser device 104 has been delayed or cancelled. For example, thealternative flight itineraries 116 can be provided as a push notification sent to a user application. As another example, thealternative flight itineraries 116 can be sent as an electronic message, such as a text or email message. The user can view the providedalternative flight itineraries 116 to determine flight options that are available as a replacement for the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. As described in more detail below, the providedalternative flight itineraries 116 can include information that allows the user to make an informed decision when choosing an alternative flight itinerary. The automatic providing of alternative flight itinerary information can result in the user knowing available travel-change options at an earlier time as compared to the user attempting to manually or otherwise determine alternative flight itineraries. The automatic providing of alternative flight itinerary information can make the user aware of alternative flight itineraries that are currently available but that might soon be unavailable (e.g., unfeasible, due to impending departure times). Accordingly, the automatic providing of alternative flight itinerary information can result in the user being able to select from a larger number of alternative flight itineraries as compared to the user attempting to, for example, manually determine alternative flight itineraries. - The user can use alternative flight itinerary information, for example, when discussing or negotiating travel change options with a carrier associated with the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. The provided
alternative flight itineraries 116 can include, for example, available flight itineraries that are not known to the carrier and/or flight itineraries that a carrier representative might not suggest (e.g., initially or otherwise) to the user. The providedalternative flight itineraries 116 can be used by the user, for example, as leverage when negotiating with the carrier. The carrier, for example, may suggest an alternative itinerary that matches a cancelled or delayed travel leg, but not an alternative itinerary that results in the user reaching their final destination. The alternative flight itinerary information can inform the user as to available options for reaching their final destination. - The
travel re-accommodation system 106 can include preferential-status-based alternative flight itineraries in thealternative flight itineraries 114 that are potentially available to the user based on one or more preferential status indicators. Preferential status indicators can include, for example, an elevated frequent flier status of the user or a particular booked-seat class (e.g., first class, business class). Providing preferential-status-based alternative flight itineraries to the user can, for example, provide the user with information that may be useful for negotiating with the carrier of the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. The user (and/or the carrier) may not have previously known that the preferential-status-based alternative flight itineraries are potentially available to the user. -
FIG. 2A is a block diagram of an example environment 200 that includes atravel system 202. Instage 1, aflight information engine 204 obtains current flight status information 205 for a collection of flights. For example, theflight information engine 204 can obtain current flight status information for a flight itinerary of a user 206 associated with auser device 208 and for other flights. - In
stage 2, auser interface engine 210 can optionally provide current flight status information 211 for a flight itinerary of the user 206 to theuser device 208, such as for presentation in a current itineraryview user interface 212. - For example,
FIG. 3A illustrates an example currentitinerary user interface 300 displayed on auser device 301. Theuser interface 300 includes carrier andflight number information 302, current flight status 304 (e.g., scheduled, on-time, delayed, cancelled, diverted, or landed, and when delayed, an estimated arrival or departure time), and departure andarrival locations 306. A departure andarrival detail area 308 includes departure and arrival time, terminal, and gate information.Controls alternatives area 314 can display information about one or more alternative itineraries to the current flight in response to theuser device 301 receiving a notification that the current flight is delayed or cancelled. When the user's current flight is not delayed or cancelled, thealternatives area 314 can be excluded from theuser interface 300. - Referring again to
FIG. 2A , instage 3, anitinerary evaluation engine 214 can use the current flight status information 205 to determine delayed or cancelledflight itineraries 216 representing user flight itineraries that have one or more legs impacted by a delayed or cancelled flight. Theitinerary evaluation engine 214 can determine, for example, that a flight itinerary of the user 206 includes a flight leg that is delayed or cancelled. Instage 4, theuser interface engine 210 can provide updated current flight status information 211 to theuser device 208 that indicates that the flight itinerary of the user 206 is delayed or cancelled. For example, in reference toFIG. 3A , the current flight status can be updated. - In
stage 5, an alternative flightitineraries determination engine 218 can determine one or more alternative flight itineraries that include one or more alternative flight legs that replace the delayed or cancelled flights in the user's itinerary. For example, the alternative flightitineraries determination engine 218 can determinealternative flight itineraries 220 that include one or more flight legs that are alternatives to a delayed or cancelled flight of the user 206. As described in more detail below with reference toFIG. 2B , the alternative flightitineraries determination engine 218 can determinealternative flight itineraries 220 based at least in part on one or more preferential status indicators associated with a user. - In
stage 6, theuser interface engine 210 can provide, for example, thealternative flight itineraries 220 for display on the user device 208 (e.g., as illustrated by provided alternative flight itineraries 221). For example, some or all of thealternative flight itineraries 221 can be displayed, for example, in a notification area of the current itinerary view user interface 212 (e.g., along with a notification that a current flight itinerary of the user 206 is delayed or cancelled). In references toFIG. 3A , some or all of thealternative flight itineraries 221 can be displayed in thealternatives area 314. - In some implementations, the user 206 can, for example, select a user interface control on the
current itinerary view 212 to view an alternative itineraries viewuser interface 222 to view more information about thealternative flight itineraries 221. As another example, the alternative itineraries viewuser interface 222 can be displayed automatically in response to receipt of thealternative flight itineraries 221. - For example,
FIG. 3B illustrates an example alternative itinerariessummary user interface 340 displayed on auser device 341. The alternative itinerariessummary user interface 340 can be displayed automatically, e.g., as a notification pushed to theuser device 341, for example, in response to theuser device 341 receiving a notification that an itinerary of the user of theuser device 341 has been delayed or cancelled. As another example, the alternative itinerariessummary user interface 340 can be displayed in response to the user selecting a user interface control, such as a control included in the currentitinerary user interface 300 described above with respect toFIG. 3A . - The alternative itineraries
summary user interface 340 includes alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f. The alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f may be determined, for example, by an alternative flight itineraries determination engine (e.g., as described above with respect toFIG. 2A and below with respect toFIG. 2B ). The alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f can be itineraries that include one or more alternative flight legs to the flight legs of the user itinerary that has been delayed or cancelled. - In some implementations, the alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f include one or more itineraries that may be available to the user based on one or more preferential status indicators associated with particular users, such as elevated frequent fliers status of the user or a particular class of a booked seat on the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. Although the alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f are each for a same carrier (e.g., “Carrier A”), the alternative itineraries
summary user interface 340 can present itineraries from multiple carriers. For example, alternative itineraries for carriers for which the user has, for example, an elevated frequent flier status can be presented. - The alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f can be sorted, for example, by departure time. Each of the alternative itineraries 342 a-342 f includes, for example, a scheduled departure time, a scheduled arrival time, a current flight status, an actual departure time (if applicable), an updated (e.g., estimated) arrival time (if applicable), flight code(s), and number of stops.
- Other flight information can be included in an alternative itinerary 342 a-342 f. For example, in some implementations, an alternative itinerary 342 a-342 f can include an indication of seat availability. For example, an
indicator 344 indicates that first-class seats may be available for thealternative itinerary 342 b. As another example, anindicator 346 indicates that the alternative itinerary 342 may is identified as full but may have seats available to users having preferential status. - An availability indicator can be displayed based on a preferential status indicator associated with the user. For example, the user may have purchased a first-class seat on the delayed or cancelled user flight itinerary and therefore may be eligible for an available first class seat on the
alternative itinerary 342 b. As another example, the user may have an elevated frequent flier status on Carrier A, and although thealternative itinerary 342 a is listed as full, the user's elevated frequent flier status may enable the user to negotiate with the carrier, for example, to see if an unlisted seat is available. - In some implementations, an alternative itinerary 342 a-342 f can be selected to view additional details about the selected alternative itinerary 342 a-342 f.
-
FIG. 3C illustrates an example alternative itineraries detailedview user interface 360 displayed on auser device 361. The alternative itineraries detailedview user interface 360 can be displayed, for example, in response to selection of an alternative itinerary 342 a-342 f as described above with respect toFIG. 3B . For example, the alternative itineraries detailedview user interface 360 includes a detailedalternative itinerary area 362 which can be displayed, for example, in response to user selection of thealternative itinerary 342 b ofFIG. 3B . For example, thealternative itinerary 342 b can expand into the detailedalternative itinerary area 362 in response to user selection of thealternative itinerary 342 b. The detailedalternative itinerary area 362 includes, for example, information about travel legs (e.g., leg duration, departing and arriving terminals, and gates when available) and stops (e.g., intervening airports, stop duration). The detailedalternative itinerary area 362 also includes an indicator 364 that indicates that first-class seats may be available on thealternative itinerary 342 b. In some implementations, thedetailed itinerary area 360 includes one or more user interface controls that are configured, for example, to enable the user to purchase thealternative itinerary 342 b, contact Carrier A, or view a web site associated with Carrier A. -
FIG. 2B is a block diagram of an example alternativeflight determination engine 250. The alternativeflight determination engine 250 can determine one or more alternative flight itineraries 252 for each itinerary included in a set of one or more delayed or cancelledflight itineraries 254. In some implementations, the alternativeflight determination engine 250 can determine one or more alternative flight itineraries 252 in response to receiving a notification that a user itinerary has been delayed or cancelled. - In
stage 1, a preferential statusindicator determination engine 256 determines one or more preferential status indicators 258 for a user flight itinerary that has been delayed or cancelled. The preferential status indicator(s) 258 can be determined, for example, fromuser travel information 260 and/or one or more user profiles 262. Theuser travel information 260 can include, for example, flight itinerary information for the user flight itinerary that has been delayed or cancelled. Theuser travel information 260 can also include flight itinerary information for prior (e.g., other) flight itineraries of the user. - The
user travel information 260 can indicate, for example, that the user has booked a particular seat class (e.g., business class, first class) on the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. As another example, theuser travel information 260 can indicate that the user has an elevated frequent flier status on one or more carriers associated with the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. Historical user travel information included in theuser travel information 260 can indicate that the user has an elevated frequent flier status on one or more other carriers other than carriers associated with the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary. The user profile(s) 262 can include, for example, elevated frequent flier status information for the user on one or more carriers, including carriers associated with the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary and other carriers. - The
user travel information 260 can include reservation information (e.g., reservation confirmations, such as email messages, or other records of user travel reservations). A preferential status indicator 258 indicating an elevated frequent flier status can be determined for example, based on the identification of a keyword such as “gold” or “elite” in reservation information (e.g., a reservation email or other reservation record). A preferential status indicator 258 indicating an elevated seating class can be determined, for example, based on the identification of a keyword such as “first class” or “business class” in reservation information. - Other approaches other than keyword identification can be used to determine the preferential status indicator(s) 260. For example, the
user travel information 260 may include explicit fields which include values which may indicate elevated frequent flier status, booked seat class, or other information. The preferential statusindicator determination engine 256 can query the explicit fields to determine the preferential status indicator(s) 258. - In
stage 2, a candidate alternative flight itinerary determination engine 264 determines a collection of candidatealternative flight itineraries 266 occurring within a specified time frame that correspond to an origin and destination of the delayed or cancelled user itinerary. - In
stage 3, the candidate alternative flight itinerary determination engine 264 expands the candidatealternative flight itineraries 266 to generate expanded candidatealternative flight itineraries 268 that include flight itineraries and seat classes that are potentially available to the user based on the one or more preferential status indicators 258. For example, the candidate alternative flight itinerary determination engine 264 can obtain flight itineraries with available first-class or business-class seating. In some implementations, the candidatealternative flight itineraries 266 include all scheduled flight itineraries occurring within a specified time frame that correspond to an origin and destination of the delayed or cancelled user itinerary, regardless of whether a respective candidate alternative flight itinerary appears to have available seating. - In
stage 4, aranking engine 270 ranks the candidate alternative flight itineraries 258 according to one ormore criteria 272 to generate a set of ranked candidatealternative flight itineraries 274. The one ormore criteria 272 can include one or more of a date that the candidate alternative flight itinerary arrives at the destination or a carrier of the candidate alternative flight itinerary as compared with the carrier of the user's fight itinerary. For example, same-day flights can be considered more important than flight itineraries that arrive on later dates. As another example, a candidate alternative flight itinerary that has a carrier that matches the carrier of the user's flight itinerary (or that has a carrier that is an affiliated carrier to the carrier of the user's flight itinerary) can be considered more important than candidate alternative flight itineraries that have carriers that are not affiliated with the carrier of the user's flight itinerary. The one ormore criteria 272 can include the availability of first-class or business-class seating (e.g., when the preferential status indicators 258 indicate that the user may be eligible for such seating). - The one or more criteria 272 (or in some implementations, score-adjustment factors) can include one or more of destination arrival time, duration or number of connections of the candidate alternative flight itinerary. For example, candidate alternative flight itineraries that arrive the earliest can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. Candidate alternative flight itineraries that take a least amount of time between departure and arrival can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. Candidate alternative flight itineraries that use a fewest number of connections can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries.
- The one or
more criteria 272 can include one or more criteria that are based on current flight status information. For example, theranking engine 270 can determine current flight status information for the candidatealternative flight itineraries 256. The current flight status information can indicate, for example, whether respective candidate alternative flight itineraries are delayed, on-time, or cancelled. For example, the one ormore criteria 272 can filter out cancelled candidate alternative flight itineraries. - The one or
more criteria 272 can include criteria that is related to one or more of the preferential status indicators 258. For example, candidate flight itineraries that are associated with a carrier for which the user has an elevated frequent flier status can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. As another example, when one or more of the preferential status indicators 258 indicate that a user had booked a first-class or business-class seat on the delayed or cancelled user flight itinerary, theranking engine 270 can rank candidate alternative flight itineraries that have available first-class or business-class seats higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. In some alternative implementations, candidate flight itineraries for a particular user itinerary are filtered such that a candidate flight itinerary associated with particular preferential status indicator is removed if the user does not share the particular preferential status indicator. - In
stage 5, aselection engine 276 selects a specified number (e.g., five) of highest ranked candidatealternative itineraries 274 to generate the one or more alternative flight itineraries 252. -
FIG. 4A is flow diagram of anexample method 400 for providing one or more alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device. For convenience, themethod 400 will be described with respect to a system, including one or more computing devices, that performs themethod 400. - The system obtains current flight status information for a collection of flights (step 402). The current flight status information can be obtained, for example, from a feed of flight status information, e.g., flight
information feed provider 108 ofFIG. 1 . - The system uses the current flight status information to determine that a flight itinerary of a user includes one or more flight legs that are delayed or cancelled (step 404). For example, a departure for an initial leg or a subsequent leg of a user itinerary may be delayed or cancelled. In some implementations, a determination can be made that a flight itinerary is in danger of being delayed but not necessarily delayed. For example, the arrival of an airplane to be used on a next travel leg may possibly be delayed, due to a delayed departure of that airplane on its current flight.
- The system determine one or more alternative flight itineraries that are alternatives to the flight itinerary that is delayed or cancelled (step 406).
- For example,
FIG. 4B is flow diagram of anexample method 420 for determining one or more alternative flight itineraries. For convenience, themethod 420 will be described with respect to a system, including one or more computing devices, that performs themethod 420. - The system determines one or more preferential status indicators from flight itinerary information of a user (step 422). The one or more preferential status indicators can include, for example, one or more of an elevated frequent flier status on one or more carriers or particular booked seat classes in the user's flight itinerary (e.g., first class, business class). The one or more preferential status indicators can be determined based on one or more of the current flight itinerary, one or more historical user travel information, or specific information provided in a profile associated with the user.
- The system obtains a collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries occurring within a specified time frame and that correspond to an origin and a destination of the user itinerary (step 424). If a connecting flight is delayed or cancelled, the candidate alternative flight itineraries can be alternatives for a next leg of the user flight itinerary. Candidate alternative flight itineraries can be obtained from a feed or a data store. The specified time frame can be, for example, within forty eight hours of a scheduled arrival time of a user itinerary. In some implementations, similar candidate alternative flight itineraries are grouped. For example, codeshare flights and/or flight itineraries that share legs or leg connections can be grouped. A codeshare flight can be operating for multiple airlines and can appear multiple times, for example, in a feed of flight information. Grouping can include, for example, merging the grouped candidate alternative flight itineraries into a single candidate alternative flight itinerary. Grouping or merging candidate alternative flight itineraries can result in less duplicate (or nearly duplicate) itineraries being included in the collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries.
- The system expands the candidate alternative flight itineraries to include flight itineraries and seat classes that are potentially available to the user based on the one or more preferential status indicators (step 426). For example, flight itineraries with available first-class or business-class seating can be obtained. As another example, flight itineraries can be obtained that are listed as full and are associated with a carrier for which the user has an elevated frequent flier status.
- The system ranks the collection of candidate alternative flight itineraries according to one or more criteria (step 428). The criteria can include one or more of a date that the candidate alternative flight itinerary arrives at the destination or a carrier of the candidate alternative flight itinerary as compared with the carrier of the user's fight itinerary. For example, same-day flights can be considered more important than flight itineraries that arrive on later dates. As another example, a candidate alternative flight itinerary that has a carrier that matches the carrier of the user's flight itinerary (or that has a carrier that is an affiliated carrier to the carrier of the user's flight itinerary) can be considered more important than candidate alternative flight itineraries that have carriers that are not affiliated with the carrier of the user's flight itinerary.
- The criteria (or in some implementations, score-adjustment factors) can also include one or more of destination arrival time, duration or number of connections of the candidate alternative flight itinerary. For example, candidate alternative flight itineraries that arrive the earliest can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. Candidate alternative flight itineraries that take a least amount of time between departure and arrival can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. Candidate alternative flight itineraries that use a fewest number of connections can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. As another example, the criteria can include time-in-flight (e.g., candidate alternative flight itineraries with more time-in-flight can be ranked lower than candidate alternative flight itineraries with less time-in-flight).
- In some implementations, the criteria includes a determined risk factor. For example, a weather risk can be determined for each candidate alternative flight itinerary. For example, if the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary is delayed or cancelled due to winter weather in Boston and winter-weather cancellations or delays have also been determined for one or more Chicago arrivals, a candidate alternative flight itinerary that routes through Dallas may be ranked higher than a candidate alternative flight itinerary that routes through Chicago, even when the Dallas itinerary takes longer and the Chicago itinerary is currently not cancelled. A determined risk-factor can affect other criteria. For example, when an imminent weather-based risk is determined, a weight of a departure time criteria can be increased (e.g., it may be desirable to depart before a weather event occurs).
- As another risk-based example, the criteria can include a likelihood of the user being able to make a connection (e.g., based on estimated arrival time for a connecting flight). In some implementations, a risk factor is weighted based on whether a connection flight is a last connecting flight of the day. For example, suppose that a first candidate alternative flight itinerary routes the user to Chicago with a tight connection and is a last connecting flight of the day to the user's final destination. Suppose that a second candidate alternative flight itinerary also routes the user to Chicago with a tight connection but there are four other, later connections that day from Chicago to the user's final destination. The first candidate alternative flight itinerary can be determined to be more risky than the second candidate alternative flight itinerary since the first candidate alternative flight itinerary has a higher risk of the user being stranded overnight in Chicago.
- The criteria can also include criteria that are related to one or more of the preferential status indicators. For example, candidate flight itineraries that are associated with a carrier for which the user has an elevated frequent flier status can be ranked higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries. As another example, when one or more of the preferential status indicators indicate that a user had booked a first-class or business-class seat on the delayed or cancelled user flight itinerary, the ranking engine can rank candidate alternative flight itineraries that have available first-class or business-class seats higher than other candidate alternative flight itineraries.
- A system selects a specified number of highest ranked candidates to generate a group of alternative flight itineraries (430). The specified number can be a predetermined number (e.g., ten). As another example, the specified number can be the number of ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries that have a ranking above a threshold ranking.
- Updated current flight status information can be determined for the highest ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries to determine, for example, whether a flight status, arrival time, or other information has changed or is no longer valid for a candidate alternative flight itinerary. If flight information has changed for a ranked candidate alternative flight itinerary, a determination can be made as to whether to adjust the ranking or to remove the candidate alternative flight itinerary from consideration (e.g., if the likelihood of the user being able to make a connection is low or zero). The remaining specified number of highest ranked candidate alternative flight itineraries can be selected as the group of alternative flight itineraries.
- Referring again to
FIG. 4A , the system provides one or more of the group of alternative flight itineraries for display on a user device (step 308). In some implementation, information indicating the current flight status of each alternative flight itinerary is provided. Flight status can include, for example, on-time, scheduled, delayed, cancelled, diverted, or landed. In some implementations, flight status is shown using color coding of different statuses. The one or more alternative flight itineraries can be ordered according to estimated actual times instead of scheduled times for each alternative flight itinerary. Terminal and gate information can be provided for each alternative flight itinerary. - In some implementations, alternative flight itineraries can be initially shown in a summary view, and a respective alternative flight itinerary can be shown with more information presented in a detailed view upon selection of the alternative flight itinerary in the summary view. In some implementations, the user can toggle between the summary view and the detailed view. In some implementations, the alternative flight itinerary information is automatically displayed in a notification area (e.g., a popup window) on a user device, to notify the user of a delayed or cancelled flight and to present the alternative flight itineraries.
- In some implementations, the group of alternative flight itineraries are grouped into a first group of flight itineraries having the same carrier as the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary, a second group of flight itineraries on a partner carrier of the carrier of the delayed or cancelled flight itinerary, and a third group of other flight itineraries. Flight itineraries can be sorted within respective groups, for example according to departure time.
