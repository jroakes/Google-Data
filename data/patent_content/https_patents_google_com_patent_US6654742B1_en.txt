Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method and a system for searching information corresponding to a large amount of documents, particularly to a method and a system for acquiring a final search result by arithmetical operations between search results sorted by different ranking metrics.
- search results amount to tens of thousands when information is searched with a keyword from a large amount of documents.
- search results amount to tens of thousands when information is searched with a keyword from a large amount of documents.
- the former method includes a method wherein, besides changing a search condition by the user, specifying a condition such as “essential” or “not to be included” for each keyword displayed by a search engine, or providing a sample document to a search engine to get highly ranked documents results where the contents are similar to the sample document. While such methods are known as relevance feedback, it was not possible for them to cope with designation of relevance from multiple viewpoints such as current as possible and also deeply related to the computer field.
- the latter menu method includes a search by document type, a search by Web site, etc. However, while this method is also convenient as classification according to document types, it is not effective for a search of Web pages in large quantities.
- Reference 1 Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 10-143530
- This Reference 1 is an approach which is close to a method of combining multiple search engines so as to obtain a more relevant search result.
- the search result is often in very large quantities due to multiple searching methods. Even if the larger number of correct answers can be acquired by combining search results, it cannot be expected that all of the highly-ranked search results are arranged in the most relevant ordering to a user's demand. A user must sequentially scan in order to find truly necessary data from such enormous search results. In the case of combining search results, the process will be under huge load since it is necessary to always seek search results of the entire database and logically combine them.
- An object of the present invention is to provide a searching method, computer program product, and system for sorting a specific collection of documents in various orderings.
- Another object is to provide a searching method, computer program product, and system for defining a new ranking metric by composing multiple ranking metrics to provide a user with highly relevant search results.
- a further object is to provide a searching method, computer program product, and system for additionally specifying the most suitable arrangement by interactively combining ranking metrics.
- a still further object is to provide a searching method, computer program product, and system for presenting a specific search result by sorting them in various orderings.
- a still further object is to provide a searching method, computer program product, and system wherein, the larger the number of collected data is, the larger the likelihood of finding important data by sorting grows.
- a still further object is to provide a searching method and a system of high practicality and scalability which only requires sorting of the search results acquired by the first search.
- searching documents related to prescribed information from a collection of documents it is organized to sort the collection of documents with multiple ranking metrics; determine a new collection of documents in higher-ranking positions of the sorted collections of documents; perform arithmetical operation between the new collections of documents in higher-ranking positions; and determine documents in higher-ranking positions of a result of the arithmetical operation as a search result.
- rank and to “sort” (by ranking metrics, relevance or weight) are used herein as the same meaning.
- multiple ranking metrics includes, but is not limited to: date and time of document publication; document size; frequency of document update; number of links included in a document; extent of inclusion of terminology related to prescribed information; number of keywords related to prescribed information; etc.
- “arithmetical operation” includes, but is not limited to: the sum of the collections of documents; the intersection of the collections of documents; or the difference between higher-ranking positions of the sorted collections of documents.
- the final search results are acquired by performing arithmetical operation among specific (with fixed search results) collections of documents sorted in various orderings and not by narrowing the search results to gradually reduce the candidates. It also makes it possible to additionally specify the most suitable arrangement of search results by interactively composing such ranking metrics.
- ranking metrics for arranging data other than ranking metrics provide ranking metrics as above, such as an ordering of the date of document publication, an ordering of size of each data, decreasing order of frequency of document update, decreasing order of number of links included in a document, decreasing order of frequency of inclusion or decreasing order of number of terminology included in a specific field, or decreasing order of number of specified keywords.
- the present invention is not only applicable to all the Internet search engines but also available for display of database records in a flexibly ordered manner, so it provides a very effective searching technique as a front end for information searching in general. While it is difficult, by ranking metrics through a mere search with keywords and a degree of their matching, to completely eliminate unnecessary documents adequately containing keywords (SPAM), it becomes easier to find really desirable documents by using the method of the present invention. Moreover, the present invention is capable of not only providing a powerful means for enhancing and differentiating a search engine but also becoming a promising tool for dramatically improving information searching capability of a search engine accumulating data in large quantities.

- FIG. 1 shows an outline of the searching method of the present invention.
- rankings metrics provided as a standard, namely a query of “experiment and success,” for instance, collections of documents of successful examples of recent medical experiment are acquired as final search result by composing ranking of collections of documents in higher-ranking positions in multiple ranking metrics data (in this case, orderings of date and the number of medical terms).
- ranking metrics in various fields are possible likewise.
- all ranking metrics there are two kinds in all ranking metrics, namely descending/ascending order, and besides, in the case of date or size, it is possible to specify order of being close to/far from a specific value such as 1995 or 1 MB.
- all ranking metrics can be modified to specify not a specific value but an arbitrary value so that it becomes the top and other elements are in a line in decreasing order of closeness to the top element.
- ranking metrics As a kind of arithmetical operation (composition of ranking metrics), it is possible to compose the following ranking metrics (where plural ranking metrics are referred to as A, B):
- FIG. 2 shows an example of composition of ranking. Examples of the sum, intersection and difference are shown to collections of documents sorted by ranking metrics A and B. A line is drawn to the result of composition by a threshold, and highly ranked ones become the final search result. These calculations can be freely selected by a user.
- FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of the searching system of the present invention.
- the searching system of the present invention comprises offline data extraction part 302 which extracts meta data for ranking metrics from a data set and provides an evaluable set of ranking metrics on searching, and interactive data manipulation part 308 for sorting in various ways the result of information searching by a user.
- Block 301 is a set of data which is a subject of a database/document (including catalog information) data search. It is assumed that externally defined information of data itself such as frequency of update and the last update date is managed in advance as catalog information of individual data.
- Block 302 is an offline data extraction part for, in collecting source data, extracting an index necessary for searching and information necessary for ranking metrics.
- Offline data extraction part 302 comprises text processing block 303 and meta data management 304 .
- Block 303 is a text processing part which utilizes a dictionary/thesaurus for recognizing a word in text and giving its attribute and processing a tag, etc.
- Block 304 is document meta data which stores information (update date, byte number of text, link number, etc.) necessary for ranking metrics.
- Block 305 is a dictionary/thesaurus which is a resource describing a word and its attribute, synonyms, superordinate/subordinate terms, related words, etc.
- Block 306 is an index which is a resource for acquiring from a word or a string pointers to data or documents containing it.
- Block 307 is ranking metrics data which is a resource describing an attribute necessary for arranging each data or document in specific order and a weight to be given to such an attribute.
- Block 308 is an interactive data manipulation part for providing an interactive interface which provides a means for searching data and documents according to an instruction by a user to narrow them down to highly relevant ones.
- Block 309 is a means for inputting a searching request which accepts, through a menu or a query, an instruction by a user as to a subject of searching.
- Block 310 is a means for processing a searching request which seeks data and a collection of documents meeting a searching request by utilizing an index, etc.
- Block 311 is a ranking/ordering selection part which accepts selection by a user as to an ordering of arranging elements of a search result.
- Block 312 is an element selection part which seeks, from search result arranged by certain ranking metrics, different ranking metrics wherein a specific element is in the top rank according to selection by a user.
- Block 313 is a ranking composition part which prepares, from plural ranking metrics specified by a user, new ranking metrics with their sum or intersection.
- Block 314 is a search result which is data or a collection of documents meeting a searching request by a user.
- Block 315 is composed ranking metrics data which, by composing a ranking, becomes a resource for storing information of temporary ranking metrics applied to current search result.
- Block 316 is a means for displaying a searching request which sequentially displays elements of search result under the search result and given ranking metrics (which may be plural), and simultaneously presenting display of plural results if plural ranking metrics are specified.
- information other than catalog information of individual data is analyzed by text processing part 303 as to its text to be managed as specific attribute/attribute value of meta data management part 304 according to recognition of elements such as word segmentation, links (anchors in the case of a Web page) and extraction respectively.
- Ranking metrics such as order of date or size correspond to mapping from this attribute value to a natural number and sorting them in ascending/descending order.
- a vector space model should be utilized to calculate a page of high conformance to searching conditions on the basis of an arrangement represented by a frequency vector of the terms contained in each Web page.
- huge matrix V which is number of terms N x number of documents M, is approximated by compressing it to principal components of several tens to several hundreds using a technique of singular value decomposition.
- this matrix V is utilized to allow creation of the following ranking metrics for specific domains/terminology. Creation of such ranking metrics is all offline work, so it does not affect efficiency while searching:
- Interactive data manipulation part 308 comprises ordering selection part 311 for displaying search result of a query in order of selection, ranking composition part 313 for composing/displaying new ranking metrics from plural ranking metrics as specified by a user, and element selection part 312 for collecting in higher-ranking positions desirable data centering around a selected element.
- ordering selection part 311 it is possible to specify other ranking metrics displayed in parallel with order of a search result returned by a search engine. It is possible to select by a user's specification or implementation whether to display search result by plural ranking metrics at a time or to always display it by finally selected ranking metrics.
- ranking composition part 313 for composing two orderings Fa and Fb in various forms, it can be simply implemented as follows, for instance.
- composition of ordering can be defined at high speed and to an arbitrary number of ranking metrics.
- Element selection part 312 can arrange data of order value close to the data selected by using the above new ordering functions.
- search result by new ranking metrics can be displayed based on this data and the original query.
- the ranking method of the present invention when a search engine first arranges its search result and highly relevant data does not necessarily exist in higher-ranking positions, highly relevant data can efficiently be found if a user specifies an ordering from another viewpoint instead of searching a large amount of data himself or herself.
- relevance feedback it is possible to quickly reach searching conditions for collecting important data in higher-ranking positions, by adding the highly relevant data to the searching conditions.
- FIG. 4 shows a flowchart of the method for searching of the present invention.
- a query is acquired through means for inputting a searching request 309 . This is referred to as query Q.
- query Q is evaluated based on index 306 so as to generate search result 314 which is a collection of documents to be a solution. This is referred to as solution S.
- a degree of relevance between each element included in search result 314 (referred to as document d i ) and query Q is calculated by a standard method for calculating a degree of relevance R o defined in the system.
- a method for calculating a degree of relevance is a method for calculating weight of a document by using one of the data of ranking metrics data 307 (represented as a vector or a matrix with weight per word/attribute specified). One of the data 307 is assigned to standard calculation of a degree of relevance.
- step 404 since step 403 associates each element d i of search result 314 with a degree of relevance (weight), in step 404 , the elements are sorted in order of this weight. At this time, a certain threshold can be associated with ranking metrics so that any element with weight of the threshold or less can be eliminated as having no relation to query Q. To limit the size of solutions in step 402 , these steps 402 to 404 can be applied by one operation.
- Search result S wherein a degree of relevance of each element was calculated is visualized by means for displaying a searching request 316 .
- step 405 it is confirmed to a user if a satisfactory list of elements (documents) was acquired by the method for calculating a degree of relevance used so far. If such a satisfactory list has not been acquired yet, it proceeds to step 406 in order to newly perform another calculation of a degree of relevance from ranking metrics data 307 . If a current list of elements is satisfactory, it proceeds to step 409 .
- step 406 a table of ranking metrics data 307 provided by the system is displayed to a user for selection.
- the user can select one element d which appears in a search result so far and provide instructions of a change to rank it No.1.
- step 407 when ranking metrics data is newly selected in step 406 , it is R j , and a degree of relevance is calculated under R i by ordering selection 311 as to each element d i of search result S in the same procedure as in steps 403 to 404 . If a certain element d is selected, ranking metrics are changed by element selection 312 so as to render weight of this element maximum (there are plural methods for changing weight, such as changing weight of a word or an attribute of ranking metrics data, and adjusting constants in calculation of a degree of relevance so as to render a degree of relevance of d maximum), and a degree of relevance of each element d i is recalculated.
- step 408 according to the degree of relevance of d i recalculated in steps 407 , newly ranked elements are displayed. Again, user confirmation is sought at step 405 . The process of steps 406 to 408 continues until user confirmation is received sending processing to step 409 .
- step 409 if lists of elements ranked from viewpoints of plural degrees of relevance respectively are all satisfactory, their ranking metrics are composed, and it proceeds to step 410 and displays an ranking composition menu so as to have a selection made whether to newly sort the elements with one ranking metrics. If a current list of elements is satisfactory, or if the current search is to be ended, it is terminated.
- step 410 two ranking metrics R j and R k of ranking metrics data 307 used so far and a composition method such as the sum and difference are selected in a ranking composition menu.
- step 411 a new degree of relevance of each element d i of search result S is calculated in ranking composition 313 based on the ranking metrics and composition method selected in step 410 .
- Ranking metrics data M composed at this time is held effective as composed ranking metrics data 315 through a searching session.
- step 412 a degree of relevance specified in step 411 is calculated, and each element d i of search result S is displayed in means for displaying a searching request 316 .
- FIG. 5 shows an example of search result by the searching system of the present invention.
- the example in FIG. 5 is an example of a search in the case of ranking metrics composition (corresponding to step 412 in FIG. 4) where there are a result of searching a table of information field news by a “computer” (corresponding to step 404 in FIG. 4) and a result in the decreasing order of a degree of relevance calculated with more weight on “software” field (corresponding to step 408 in FIG. 4 ), and the sum (+) was selected for these as a type of calculation.
- a search result which has computer related news especially highly relevant to the software field in higher-ranking positions can be acquired.
