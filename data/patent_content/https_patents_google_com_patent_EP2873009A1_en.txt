- a user 10 can interact with a user device 12, for example, to access a network 14.
- Examples of the network 14 include, but are not limited to, the Internet, a wide area network, a local area network, and a private network.
- a first computing device 16 and a second computing device 18 may be connected to the network 14 and may also be accessed by the user 10 via the user device 12.
- a computing device may include one or more computing devices, such as servers and/or processors.
- the first and second computing devices 16, 18 may include any combination of servers and/or processors common to or distinct from one another.
- the first and second computing devices 16, 18 may each be in communication with a database 20 to store and/or access a set of document clusters.
- a database 20 to store and/or access a set of document clusters.
- FIG. 1 is merely illustrative and different environments (such as those that include more or less components, those that include additional connections, and/or those that are arranged in a different configuration) may be utilized with the present disclosure.
- the first computing device 16 may include a document collection module 22, a base language translation module 24, a document indexing module 26, a clustering module 28 and a duplicate document determination module 30.
- the document collection module 22 is in communication with the network 14 and identifies a collection of documents to be clustered.
- the document collection module 22 may be in communication with and provide the documents to the base language translation module 24 and the clustering module 28.
- the collection of documents may include documents in different languages. Any number of different language documents may be included.
- the first computing device 16 provides a technique for clustering documents in different languages.
- the document indexing module 26, the clustering module 28 and the duplicate document determination module 30 may each be in communication with the database 20.
- the document indexing module 26 may also be in communication with the base language translation module 24 and the clustering module 28.
- An example clustering technique 100 is illustrated in the flow chart shown in FIG. 3.
- the collection of documents to be clustered is identified by the document collection module 22.
- the collection of documents includes documents in multiple languages.
- the collection of documents may include all or any subset of documents on the worldwide web.
- the collection of documents could include a set of documents in a closed system, such as a product database.
- the documents are translated into a common (base) language at 1 12.
- the translation may include a machine translation of the foreign (non-base) language documents into the base language.
- the translation may be done locally by the base language translation module 24 or may be sent to a translation engine 32.
- the translations may be stored in the database 20. Keywords from the documents are determined at 1 14 by the document indexing module 26. Web crawling may be used on the translated and base language documents to generate the keyword listing. Insignificant terms, such as stop words "a", "an” and "the", may be omitted from consideration for keyword determination.
- FIG. 4 provides a simplified representation of the document indexing.
- the document indexing may include assigning a numerical keyword identifier to each keyword in a document.
- the base language may be English.
- "Document 1 " in FIG. 4 may be an English translation of a German language document
- "Document 2" may be a native English language document
- "Document n” may be an English translation of a Spanish language document.
- the techniques determine keywords (keywords 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 in the example) in the base language (English in the example) for the translated and base language documents.
- the technique assigns a language-agnostic keyword index (Id1 , Id2, Id3, Id4, Id5 in the example) to the keywords.
- the translated collection of documents may then be indexed by the keywords.
- the document indexing module 26 may store the language-agnostic keyword index for the documents in the database 20.
- the database 20 has a language-agnostic keyword index to the original collection of documents including both the base language documents and foreign language documents in their native languages.
- the translations of the foreign language documents may be deleted after the keyword indexing is completed. Therefore, the collection of documents may be in multiple languages (English, German and Spanish in the example) and may be indexed in a language-agnostic manner.
- the clustering module 28 then clusters the documents by keyword index at 1 18.
- the clustering module 28 may operate on the documents in a variety of ways including any number of document clustering algorithms.
- the document clustering algorithms may include connectivity models, centroid models, distribution models, density models, subspace models or group models.
- a document may be grouped in one or more document clusters depending on the clustering technique used. The present disclosure is not limited to any specific clustering technique and can be applied using any of a variety of known clustering techniques.
- the clustering module 28 may rank documents within each cluster by a distance function.
- the distance function may generate a distance between two documents corresponding to a level of similarity between the two documents. For example only, assume that "Documents 1 , 2, n" in FIG. 4 are each within a cluster. In a simplified form, the distance between documents may be defined by the number of keywords that the documents have in common:
- the document clusters may also be used to estimate when a first document in a first language in a document cluster corresponds to a second document within the document cluster, but in a second language different from the first language.
- the duplicate document determination module 30 may be in communication with the clustering module 28 to estimate when the first and second documents are the "same" document in different languages.
- the duplicate document determination module 30 may apply the distance function described above to estimate when the first and second documents are the same document in different languages. For example, a predetermined threshold may be established to determine when the documents are the same document in different languages. In the example shown in FIG. 4 if the predetermined threshold was set to "4", then "Document 1 " is estimated to be the German language equivalent of the English language "Document 2".
- the duplicate document determination module 30 may update the database 20 to indicate that the first and second documents are the same document in different languages.
- the duplicate document determination module 30 may additionally be in communication with a machine learning algorithm engine 34.
- the duplicate document determination module 30 may provide document pairs estimated to be the "same" document in different languages as parallel text to the machine learning algorithm engine 34 for use in training the machine learning algorithm engine 34 for machine translation.
- the technique 100 may be applied generally to the worldwide web or may be applied to closed systems.
- An example closed system application includes an e-commerce website.
- the collection of documents identified by the document collection module 22 may include products from an e-commerce product database.

- the document identification module 202 may be in communication with the user interface module 204 and the cluster evaluation module 206.
- An example technique 300 is illustrated in the flow chart shown in FIG. 6. The technique 300 provides expanded search results by locating a document from a user search query in a document cluster and including documents within a predetermined threshold of the document. The additional documents included in the search could be in any language different from the search language due to the use of multiple language document clusters.
- the communication module 200 may be in communication with the user device 12 via the network 14 and receive a search query from the user device 12 at 302.
- the search query may be in a first language.
- the document identification module 202 identifies a first document in the first language related to the search query.
- the document identification module 202 then identifies a document cluster from the database 20 including the first document and identifies at least one document (a second document) in a second language different than the first language in the document cluster at 306.
- the user interface module 204 generates search results including documents in at least two languages including the first and second languages.
