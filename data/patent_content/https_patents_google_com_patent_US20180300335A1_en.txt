Definitions
- the disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for presenting related media content items.
- the user In response to searching for media content, such as a movie, the user is generally presented with a list of related content. For example, upon receiving a search query for a movie entitled “Movie A,” the user can be presented with information relating to “Movie A” that includes a description of the movie, a movie rating, a list of actors and actresses appearing in the movie along with a list of related movies.
- This list of related movies having some relation to “Movie A” is, however, typically lengthy, where only a small number of the movies in the list are of interest to the user.
- a method for providing media guidance comprising: receiving, from a user device, a search query for a media content item; determining a plurality of media content items that are related to the media content item; determining a plurality of keywords associated with each of the plurality of related media content items; generating a document containing the plurality of keywords that are associated with each of the plurality of related media content items; calculating a score for each of the plurality of keywords in the document based on a term frequency and an inverse document frequency for each of the plurality of keywords; selecting a first keyword from a list of the plurality of keywords based at least in part on the calculated score; determining a first subset of related media content items, wherein each media content item in the first subset is associated with the selected first keyword; removing the selected first keyword from the list of the plurality of keywords and selecting a second keyword from the list of the plurality of keywords based at least in part on the calculated score; determining a

- system further comprises means for repeatedly selecting a next keyword from the plurality of keywords until no keywords remain in the list of the plurality of keywords.
- system further comprises means for rank ordering the first subset of related media content items and the second subset of related media content items based at least in part on the score.
- FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of an example of a system for presenting related media content items in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 2 shows an example of hardware that can be used in a server and/or a user device in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIGS. 3 and 4 show examples of user interfaces for presenting related media content items in response to a received search query in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 5 shows an example of a process for presenting subsets of related media content items based on a keyword score in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter.
- mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for presenting related media content items are provided.
- the mechanisms can receive a search query that requests a particular media content item, such as a television program, a movie, a video, a song, an audiobook, and/or any other suitable media content item. It should be noted that these mechanisms can be applied to any suitable content type, such as movies, television programs, books, people, etc.
- the mechanisms can then determine a list of media content items that are related to the media content item. For example, in response to a search query for “Movie A,” a list of movies related to “Movie A” can be determined. This list can then be decomposed or otherwise classified into multiple subsets of related media content items.
- the related media content items can be organized into a subset of media content items that includes “other critically acclaimed movies,” a subset of media content items that includes “other movies with Actor A,” a subset of media content items that includes media content items “based on other works by Author A,” a subset of media content items that includes media content items “about prison escape,” a subset of media content items that includes “dramas about miscarriage of justice,” etc.
- these subsets of related media content items can be generated by extracting keywords associated with each media content item in the list of related media content items.
- movies that are deemed to be related to the movie “Movie A” can include keywords, such as “prison escape,” “Author A,” “Main Character A,” “miscarriage of justice,” etc.
- a document that includes the related media content items and the extracted keywords can be generated.
- the document can include a set of keywords and movies corresponding to each movie in the list of related content items.
- a keyword score for each of the extracted keywords can be calculated.
- the keyword score can be based on a term frequency and an inverse document frequency.
- a term frequency (TF) that represents a frequency of occurrence of the keyword within a field associated with a related media content item can be calculated and an inverse document frequency (IDF) that represents a frequency of occurrence of the keyword across different fields corresponding to the related media content items, such as in a whole document, can be calculated, where the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) can be combined to generate the keyword score for each of the extracted keywords.
- TF term frequency
- IDF inverse document frequency
- a keyword can be selected based on the keyword score. For example, the keyword having the highest keyword score can be selected for use.
- Each of the related media content items containing the selected keyword can be placed into a subset of related media content items. For example, each movie containing the keyword “prison escape” can be placed into a subset of related media content items relating to “prison escape.”
- These selected keywords can, for example, be used to describe a media content item and can be used to determine a subset of media content items that also share the selected keyword or keywords.
- the use of keywords to create subsets of related media items can be repeated. For example, after generating the subset of related media content items that relate to “prison escape,” the previously selected keyword can be removed from a list of available keywords and another keyword can be selected (e.g., the keyword having the highest keyword score now that the previously used keyword has been removed). Each of the related media content items containing this next selected keyword can be placed into another subset of related media content items.
- the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated any suitable number of times and based on any suitable criterion. For example, the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated until no keywords remain in the list of available keywords. In another example, the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated until a threshold N number of subsets have been created (e.g., two, three, ten, etc.). In yet another example, the creation of subset of related media content items can be repeated until there are no keywords that have a keyword score greater than a particular keyword score threshold.
- a user interface can be presented that includes the search result of “Movie A” and associated information, such as rating information, description information, cast information, and/or playback information concurrently with a subset of related media content items (e.g., “Movie B” and “Movie C”).
- the keyword associated with the subset of related media content items can be used to generate a relatedness indicator for presentation along with the subset of related media content items.
- the keyword “prison escape” can be used to generate a relatedness indicator that displays the text “movies relating to prison escapes” along with the subset of related media content items.
- a user interface can be provided that includes the search result of “Movie A” in response to the received search query and a drop-down menu containing various relatedness indicators from the extracted keywords and, in response to receiving a selection of one of the relatedness indicators, an associated subset of related media content items can be presented.

- Various objects, features, and advantages of the disclosed subject matter can be more fully appreciated with reference to the following detailed description of the disclosed subject matter when considered in connection with the following drawings, in which like reference numerals identify like elements.
-
FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of an example of a system for presenting related media content items in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 2 shows an example of hardware that can be used in a server and/or a user device in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIGS. 3 and 4 show examples of user interfaces for presenting related media content items in response to a received search query in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 5 shows an example of a process for presenting subsets of related media content items based on a keyword score in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. - In accordance with various implementations, mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for presenting related media content items are provided.
- In some implementations, the mechanisms can receive a search query that requests a particular media content item, such as a television program, a movie, a video, a song, an audiobook, and/or any other suitable media content item. It should be noted that these mechanisms can be applied to any suitable content type, such as movies, television programs, books, people, etc. The mechanisms can then determine a list of media content items that are related to the media content item. For example, in response to a search query for “Movie A,” a list of movies related to “Movie A” can be determined. This list can then be decomposed or otherwise classified into multiple subsets of related media content items. For example, using keywords extracted from each media content item, the related media content items can be organized into a subset of media content items that includes “other critically acclaimed movies,” a subset of media content items that includes “other movies with Actor A,” a subset of media content items that includes media content items “based on other works by Author A,” a subset of media content items that includes media content items “about prison escape,” a subset of media content items that includes “dramas about miscarriage of justice,” etc.
- In some implementations, these subsets of related media content items can be generated by extracting keywords associated with each media content item in the list of related media content items. For example, movies that are deemed to be related to the movie “Movie A” can include keywords, such as “prison escape,” “Author A,” “Main Character A,” “miscarriage of justice,” etc. In some implementations, a document that includes the related media content items and the extracted keywords can be generated. For example, the document can include a set of keywords and movies corresponding to each movie in the list of related content items.
- In some implementations, a keyword score for each of the extracted keywords can be calculated. For example, the keyword score can be based on a term frequency and an inverse document frequency. In a more particular example, a term frequency (TF) that represents a frequency of occurrence of the keyword within a field associated with a related media content item can be calculated and an inverse document frequency (IDF) that represents a frequency of occurrence of the keyword across different fields corresponding to the related media content items, such as in a whole document, can be calculated, where the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) can be combined to generate the keyword score for each of the extracted keywords.
- Upon generating a keyword score for each of the extracted keywords, a keyword can be selected based on the keyword score. For example, the keyword having the highest keyword score can be selected for use. Each of the related media content items containing the selected keyword can be placed into a subset of related media content items. For example, each movie containing the keyword “prison escape” can be placed into a subset of related media content items relating to “prison escape.” These selected keywords can, for example, be used to describe a media content item and can be used to determine a subset of media content items that also share the selected keyword or keywords.
- In some implementations, the use of keywords to create subsets of related media items can be repeated. For example, after generating the subset of related media content items that relate to “prison escape,” the previously selected keyword can be removed from a list of available keywords and another keyword can be selected (e.g., the keyword having the highest keyword score now that the previously used keyword has been removed). Each of the related media content items containing this next selected keyword can be placed into another subset of related media content items.
- It should be noted that the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated any suitable number of times and based on any suitable criterion. For example, the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated until no keywords remain in the list of available keywords. In another example, the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated until a threshold N number of subsets have been created (e.g., two, three, ten, etc.). In yet another example, the creation of subset of related media content items can be repeated until there are no keywords that have a keyword score greater than a particular keyword score threshold.
- These subsets of related media content items can be presented to the user having a user device using any suitable approach. For example, a user interface can be presented that includes the search result of “Movie A” and associated information, such as rating information, description information, cast information, and/or playback information concurrently with a subset of related media content items (e.g., “Movie B” and “Movie C”).
- It should be noted that, in some implementations, the keyword associated with the subset of related media content items can be used to generate a relatedness indicator for presentation along with the subset of related media content items. For example, the keyword “prison escape” can be used to generate a relatedness indicator that displays the text “movies relating to prison escapes” along with the subset of related media content items. In another example, a user interface can be provided that includes the search result of “Movie A” in response to the received search query and a drop-down menu containing various relatedness indicators from the extracted keywords and, in response to receiving a selection of one of the relatedness indicators, an associated subset of related media content items can be presented.

FIG. 3 , an example 300 of a user interface for presenting media content information associated with a media content item responsive to a search query is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. In some implementations,user interface 300 can be presented on a user device on which the search query was entered. As illustrated,user interface 300 includesmedia content information 302,playback information 304, castinformation 306, a first subset of relatedmedia content items 308, and a second subset of relatedmedia content items 310. -
Media content information 302 can include any suitable information relating to the search result responsive to a search query. For example, as shown inFIG. 3 , media content information can include images relating to the search result, title information relating to the search result, rating information relating to the search result, a link to a trailer video associated with the search result, and description information associated with the search result. Note that, in some implementations, any suitable portion ofmedia content information 302 can be omitted. - In some implementations,
user interface 300 can includeplayback information 302. For example, as shown inFIG. 3 ,playback information 304 can include individual links to the media content item indicated in the search query, where each link is associated with a different content provider. In some implementations, an individual link can include a content provider name, an icon associated with the content provider, and pricing information (or other suitable economic terms). The content provider name can indicate the name of a content provider of the media content item. For example, in some implementations, the content provider name can indicate the name of a web-based service that streams media content items to the user device. The icon can be an icon associated with the content provider. In some implementations, the icon can include any suitable images, icons, graphics, animations, text, and/or any other suitable content. Pricing information can include a price associated with consuming the media content item. In some implementations, pricing information can indicate a price associated with a one-time viewing of the media content item. Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, pricing information can indicate a price associated with a subscription to the content provider, such as a fee associated with a monthly subscription. In some implementations, as shown inFIG. 3 , pricing information can indicate that consuming the media content item from the associated content provider would be free. - In some implementations,
user interface 300 can includecast information 306. For example, as shown inFIG. 3 , castinformation 306 can include links to information relating to actors or actresses associated with the media content item. Note that, in some implementations, any suitable portion ofcast information 306 can be omitted. - In some implementations,
user interface 300 can include first subset of relatedmedia content items 308 and second subset of relatedmedia content items 310. As shown inFIG. 3 , each subset of related media content items can include links, associated images, and/or other suitable information for a related media content item. In a more particular example, as shown inFIG. 3 , in response to receive a search query for “Movie A,” a first subset of relatedmedia content items 308 that includes “Related Movie A,” “Related Movie B,” “Related Movie C,” and “Related Movie D” and a second subset of relatedmedia content items 310 that includes “Related Movie A,” “Related Movie E,” “Related Movie F,” and “Related Movie G” are presented. It should be noted that a related media content item can be included in multiple subsets of related media content items (e.g., “Related Movie A” inFIG. 3 ). - In some implementations, a relatedness indicator can be presented along with each subset of related media content items. For example, as shown in
FIG. 3 , the first subset of relatedmedia content items 308 can be presented with a relatedness indicator that states “Other Critically Acclaimed Movies,” while the second subset of relatedmedia content items 310 can be presented with a relatedness indicator that states “Movies set in prison.” In a more particular example, the keyword from the related subset of media content items can include a keyword and a keyword type, such as “Politics (PLOT_OR_THEME)” and a relatedness indicator that incorporates the keyword and keyword type can be generated, such as “Movies having a political plot” or “Movies where the plot relates to politics.” - Additionally or alternatively, the relatedness indicator can be presented as a drop-down menu and/or any other suitable user interface control. For example, as shown in
FIG. 4 , the relatedness indicator can be used to determine which subset of related media content items is presented. The relatedness indicators or reasons can be ranked ordered based on keyword scores. For example, the keyword having the highest keyword score can be generated into a relatedness indicator or reason (e.g., “Other moves with Actor A”) and the relatedness indicator can appear first in drop-down menu 410. In response to receiving a selection of a relatedness indicator from drop-down menu 410, a corresponding subset of relatedmedia content items 420 can be presented. - It should be noted that, in some implementations, the subsets of related media content items in
FIGS. 3 and 4 , as well as the order in which the related media content items are presented within the subset, can be determined based on any suitable criteria and using any suitable technique(s), such as those described below in connection withFIG. 5 . - Turning to
FIG. 5 , an example 500 of a process for receiving a search query for a particular media content item, determining keyword information associated with media content items related to the particular media content item, generating subsets of related media content items, and presenting a user interface that includes one or more of the subsets of related media content items is shown in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter. -
Process 500 can begin by receiving, from a user device, a search query for a media content item at 510. For example, in some implementations, the search query can include a name of a particular television program, a particular movie, a particular song, a particular book, a particular person, etc. As another example, in some implementations, the search query can include a name and/or an identifier of a particular episode of a particular television program. In a more particular example, the search query can be inputted into a search interface presented by a media guidance application, such as the one shown inFIGS. 3 and 4 . - In response to receiving the search query for a media content item, a search result responsive to the search query can be determined (e.g., the movie “Movie A”). As shown in
FIGS. 3 and 4 , media content information and any suitable information relating to the search result can be presented in response to the received search query. For example, media content information can include images relating to the search result, title information relating to the search result, rating information relating to the search result, a link to a trailer video associated with the search result, and description information associated with the search result. -
Process 500 can continue by determining media content items that are related to the media content item resulting from the search query at 520. For example, using one or more media content sources or data sources,process 500 can generate a list of media content items that are related to the media content item resulting from the search query. In a more particular example,process 500 can generate a list of movies that are related to the movie “Movie A.” - In some implementations, at 530,
process 500 can extract keywords that are associated with each of the related media content items determined in 520. For example, movies that are deemed to be related to the movie “Movie A” can include keywords, such as “prison escape,” “Author A,” “Main Character A,” “miscarriage of justice,” etc. Keywords can be determined for each related media content item using any suitable approach. For example, in some implementations,process 500 can access one or more keyword sources to obtain relevant keywords that are associated with each media content item that appears in a list of related media content items from 520. In a more particular example, keyword sources can include sources that mines movie reviews or content reviews, sources that determine related entity information, sources that determine keywords associated with a particular media content item, sources that include comments, commentary, and/or any other suitable user-generated information relating to content items, etc. In another more particular example, keywords and additional classification information or signals can be determined from multiple keywords sources. For example, a keyword source can be accessed to determine related entity or keyword information along with a related keyword source associated with a media content item (e.g., “John Doe (0.2)” and “Steven Director (0.15)”). In yet another more particular example, keyword sources can include one or more sources that have been selected by a user (e.g., a selection of a particular source that includes user-preferred reviews of content items, a selection of a particular source that the user has a subscription, etc.). - In some embodiments, a graph of related media content items can be generated. The graph along with information from the one or more keyword sources can be used to determine a number of strongly related media content items (e.g., a relatedness score that is greater than a given threshold value with the same keyword), a total number of related media content items with the same keyword, an average score of a current keyword in related media content items, an average relatedness strength of related media content items with the same keyword, etc. For example, to generate the graph of related media content items, each related media content item that is related to a single media content item can be assigned a weight that is proportional to its relatedness score to the single media content item (weightR) and each keyword (K) can be assigned a power that is proportional to its original relevance to the single media content item (powerK). In continuing this example, a similarity function between two keywords (simK1K2) can be defined as a function proportional to a Jaccard distance between the tops of two collections of media content items assigned to those keywords.
- In a more particular example, for each partial permutation of (K1, K2, K3) in Keywords (M):
-
powerK2:=powerK2/(1−simK1K2) -
powerK3:=powerK3/(1−simK1K3)/(1−simK2K3) -
score:=0 - For each related media content item R in Related (M):
- for each K in (K1, K2, K3)
-
score+=weightR*powerK -
weightR:=weightR−weightR*powerK - In this example, if the weight and power are set to 1, related movies containing the keyword can be counted and can be eliminated from use by another keyword.
- It should be noted that, in some implementations, the one or more keyword sources can indicate which keywords should be removed and/or clustered together. For example, the keyword source can determine that the keywords “World War” and “World War II” would yield similar related media content items and, as such, these keywords should be clustered together and represented by a single keyword instance.
- It should also be noted that, in some embodiments, a user of the media guidance application can indicate one or more keyword sources, one or more keyword types, and other suitable keyword information for use in determining subsets of related media content items and relatedness information. For example, the user can be presented with an interface for selecting from multiple keyword sources (e.g., a source that includes reviews of media content items, a source that includes social media contacts that provide commentary on one or more media content items, etc.). In another example, the user can provide specific authorization to access one or more user accounts associated with the user (e.g., messaging accounts, media provider accounts, social media accounts, etc.), which can be accessed to determine a subset of keywords that are used in association with one or more of the user accounts. In yet another example, the user can indicate factors that are relevant for generating a keyword score (e.g., weighting one keyword source differently from another keyword source).
- In some implementations, the extracted keywords and the related media content items can be treated a document at 540 and a keyword score can be determined for each of the extracted keywords at 550.
- For example, a keyword score for each of the extracted keywords can be calculated based on a term frequency (TF) and an inverse document frequency (IDF) (e.g., a TF-IDF score). In a more particular example, a term frequency (TF) that represents a frequency of occurrence of the keyword within a field associated with a related media content item can be calculated and an inverse document frequency (IDF) that represents a frequency of occurrence of the keyword across different fields corresponding to the related media content items, such as in a whole document, can be calculated, where the term frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) can be combined to generate the keyword score for each of the extracted keywords. Term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) can be combined, for example, by the multiplication of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).
- In a more particular example, upon determining that the related movie “The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring” has the associated keywords “JRR Tolkien,” “Fantasy,” “Magic,” “Lord of the Rings,” and “Peter Jackson,” etc., each keyword can receive a keyword score—e.g., keywords JRR Tolkien (0.742), Fantasy (0.684), Magic (0.648), Lord of the Rings (0.632), and Peter Jackson (0.586).
- Upon generating a keyword score for each of the extracted keywords, a keyword can be selected based on the keyword score at 560. For example, the keyword having the highest keyword score can be selected for use. In a more particular example, the keyword “prison escape” having the keyword score 0.824 can be selected for having the highest keyword score among the list of available keywords and for having a keyword score greater than a particular threshold keyword score (e.g., greater than 0.600).
- In response, at 570, each of the related media content items containing the selected keyword can be placed into a subset of related media content items. For example, each movie having the same keyword “prison escape” can be placed into a subset of related media content items relating to “prison escape.” It should be noted that the order of the related media content items in the subset of related media content items can be determined based on term frequency (e.g., the frequency of occurrence of the keyword in the media content item) or any other suitable metric.
- In some implementations, as shown in
FIG. 5 , the use of keywords to create subsets of related media items can be repeated. For example, after generating the subset of related media content items that relate to “prison escape,” the previously selected keyword can be removed from a list of available keywords at 580 andprocess 500 can return to 560 to select another keyword (e.g., the keyword having the highest keyword score now that the previously used keyword has been removed). Each of the related media content items containing this next selected keyword can be placed into another subset of related media content items. - It should be noted that the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated any suitable number of times and based on any suitable criterion. For example, the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated until no keywords remain in the list of available keywords. In another example, the creation of subsets of related media content items can be repeated until a threshold N number of subsets have been created (e.g., two, three, ten, etc.). In yet another example, the creation of subset of related media content items can be repeated until there are no keywords that have a keyword score greater than a particular keyword score threshold.
- In some implementations, these subsets of related media content items can be presented to the user having a user device using any suitable approach at 590. For example, a user interface can be presented that includes the search result of “Movie A” and associated information, such as rating information, description information, cast information, and/or playback information concurrently with a subset of related media content items (e.g., “Movie B” and “Movie C”).
- It should be noted that, in some implementations, the keyword associated with the subset of related media content items can be used to generate a relatedness indicator for presentation along with the subset of related media content items. For example, the keyword “prison escape” can be used to generate a relatedness indicator that displays the text “movies relating to prison escapes” along with the subset of related media content items. In another example, a user interface can be provided that includes the search result of “Movie A” in response to the received search query and a drop-down menu containing various relatedness indicators from the extracted keywords and, in response to receiving a selection of one of the relatedness indicators, an associated subset of related media content items can be presented.
- In some implementations, the keyword along with keyword information can be used to generate a relatedness indicator for presentation along with the subset of related media content items. For example, the keyword from the related subset of media content items can include a keyword and a keyword type, such as “Politics (PLOT_OR_THEME)” and a relatedness indicator that incorporates the keyword and keyword type can be generated, such as “Movies having a political plot” or “Movies where the plot relates to politics.”
- It should be noted that, in some implementations, the order of the relatedness indicators in a user interface control (e.g., drop-
down menu 410 inFIG. 4 ) can be determined based on any suitable criterion. For example, the order of the relatedness indicators in drop-down menu 410 ofFIG. 4 can be determined based on the keyword score associated with the relatedness indicator. - Examples of user interfaces that include information relating to a media content item responsive to a search query, subsets of media content items related to the media content item (e.g., “Dramas about miscarriage of justice,” “Movies about prison escape,” “Movies with Actor A,” etc.), and relatedness indicators are shown, for example, in
FIGS. 3 and 4 . - It should be noted that the user interfaces that include subsets of related media content items shown in
FIGS. 3 and 4 are merely illustrative. Subsets of related media content items can be shown in any suitable manner. For example, a scrollable banner that is presented above a list of search results can include a subset of related media content items along with a relatedness indicator corresponding to the subset. - It should be understood that at least some of the above described blocks of the process of
FIG. 5 can be executed or performed in any order or sequence not limited to the order and sequence shown in and described in the figure. Also, some of the above blocks of the process ofFIG. 5 can be executed or performed substantially simultaneously where appropriate or in parallel to reduce latency and processing times. Additionally or alternatively, some of the above described blocks of the process ofFIG. 5 can be omitted. - In some implementations, any suitable computer readable media can be used for storing instructions for performing the functions and/or processes herein. For example, in some implementations, computer readable media can be transitory or non-transitory. For example, non-transitory computer readable media can include media such as magnetic media (such as hard disks, floppy disks, and/or any other suitable magnetic media), optical media (such as compact discs, digital video discs, Blu-ray discs, and/or any other suitable optical media), semiconductor media (such as flash memory, electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or any other suitable semiconductor media), any suitable media that is not fleeting or devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable tangible media. As another example, transitory computer readable media can include signals on networks, in wires, conductors, optical fibers, circuits, any suitable media that is fleeting and devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable intangible media.
- In situations in which the systems described here collect personal information about users, or make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- Accordingly, methods, systems, and media for presenting related media content items are provided.
- Although the invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing illustrative implementations, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example, and that numerous changes in the details of implementation of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is limited only by the claims that follow. Features of the disclosed implementations can be combined and rearranged in various ways.
