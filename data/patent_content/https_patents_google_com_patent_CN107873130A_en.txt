The e-mail address of user, the address of user, the birthday of user, the URL of the page etc. of user.
Method 100 continues to make simple document search engine 1324 related to one or more attributes from global data library searching 106
The profile information of connection.For example, one or more attributes can be used for from any database outside client device 1215, example
Such as, social networks 1202, profile server 1230, web search server 1232, e-mail server 1236 or third party's clothes
Those database retrieval profile informations of business device 1234.One example of third-party server 1234 is can to receive telephone number
And respond " white page " server that user name is provided.In some instances, 1206 and social networking service are applied in profile renewal
The simple document search of device 1202 is searched the social networks ID associated with one or more attributes and retrieved using 1207 cooperations
The profile information associated with social networks ID.The profile information is sent to client device from social network server 1202
1215.Similarly, can be taken in profile server 1230, web search server 1232, e-mail server 1236 or the 3rd
Other inquiries or search operation are performed similarly to generate profile information using one or more attributes on business device 1234.
By generating and providing 108 notices to the first user, method 100 continues.Method 100 in block 106 using being examined
The notice of profile information generation 108 of rope.The profile information retrieved in the process block 106 of method 100 determines that what information will wrap
Include in the notification.For example, new or non-redundant information (for example, not being stored in the information on client device 1215) can be by
It is determined that and it is selected for including in the notification.Moreover, the part of profile information can be prioritized over other information.It is logical
Example is crossed, title, telephone number and e-mail address can be prioritized over the information of similar photo, date, comment etc..
In some instances, it is logical to determine whether that the first user of client device 1215 provides 108 for notification engine 1326
Know.Notification engine 1326 can be to social signal, call signal, profile information in itself or the different algorithm of its combined running or survey
Examination is notified with determining whether that the first user provides 108.For example, call signal can be used and notify that can include first uses
Between the second user associated with the activity with being detected of family various types of communication histories (for example, Email and/or
The frequency of call, nearest degree and quantity).In another example, social signal can be used and notify to include
Profile information or the social networks ID associated with attribute.Social signal can include putting up, commenting in the socialgram of user
By, share, support, recommend again, the separating degree between the user in user social contact figure in presence or absence, socialgram, from another
Social action in the content of user etc..In another example, other signals (for example, relevance rank, position etc.) can be by
For determine profile information (on than on another Geography of enterprise closer to the first user an enterprise information) one
Divide with including in the notification.In another example, whether notice can include wanting to take on the first user and profile information
The request of first user of relevant specific action (for example, addition second user is as connection in social networks).
Then, method 100 receives 110 inputs in response to notice using information updating engine 1328 from the first user.It is defeated
Enter to indicate that the first user wishes to carry out the action asked in notice.For example, user can indicate that the first user wants society
Hand over the second user connection on network.In another example, input can indicate that the first user wants the letter of storage second user
Shelves information is as the contact person in the associated person information on client device 1215.
The associated person information kept by updating 112 first users on second user or other users, method 100 after
It is continuous.In some instances, profile information is stored in the profile of the second user in the associated person information of the first user by method 100
In.For example, the profile information from external data base can be utilized to update the profile on client device 1215.In another example
In, can utilize profile information renewal profile server 1230, web search server 1232, e-mail server 1236 or
The information of the first user on third-party server 1234.In particular example, information updating engine 1328 is based on coming from user
Input, utilize profile information update 112 social networks on the first user socialgram.For example, in response to the first user's
Input the first user of instruction wants to be connected with second user, and social networks adds second user and used as first on social networks
The connection at family.
In some instances, information updating engine 1328 utilizes the profile information retrieved associated with second user
(for example, title, telephone number, position etc.) updates the associated person information of the first user in multiple external data bases.For example, letter
Breath renewal engine 1328 can utilize the title and phone of service provider in response to receiving the calling from service provider
Number renewal is related to the contacts list of the first user in the external data base of enterprise's networking.Or based on from the first user
To the calling of the magazine editor of the publication for the article for being working on the first user, information updating engine 1328 can utilize magazine
The publication group for the first user that the available hours renewal of editor is concentrated in the external data base in institute.Or information updating
Engine 1328 can match the contact person of the user interest of the first user in response to preserving, and utilize the title of contact person, photo, meeting
View time, conference location renewal are related to the list of matches of the first user in the external data base of appointment.Or information updating is drawn
Hold up in 1328 socialgrams that new contact name can be added to the first user in different social networks.
In some instances, except the contact person using information updating first user that is retrieved associated with second user
Outside information, the first user is also connected to second user by information updating engine 1328.Second user can be with using on first
The calling at family is associated and the telephone number by calling determines.Second user, which can also be, to be stored in external data base
New contact person.In some instances, information updating engine 1328 can suggest connection between the first user and second user simultaneously
And in fact responsive to the receiving for the connection for receiving at least one suggestion in the first user and second user, establish
Connection between first user and second user.In other examples, information updating engine 1328 can notify the first user with
Second user connects.
Referring now to Figure 2, description is retrieved into profile information in response to call and utilizes retrieved profile information
Update the exemplary method 200 of the socialgram of the first user.Method 200 detects 202 client devices from activity detection engine 1320
Calling on 1215 starts.For example, calling can be set to the incoming phone call of client device 1215 or from client
Standby 1215 outgoing telephone call.Attributes extraction engine 1322 retrieves 204 one or more associated with the calling detected
Attribute.For example, attribute can be the telephone number of calling.In some instances, attributes extraction engine 1322 has to access and called
The acquiescence license of information.In other examples, profile renewal can for example utilize READ_CALL_LOG command requests using 1206
License.In some instances, whether attributes extraction engine 1322 determines telephone number for individual or enterprise.If for enterprise
Industry, the then search to profile information can be directed to enterprise name, address and other information on web search server 1232.Such as
Fruit telephone number is for individual, then the search to profile information can be in profile server 1230 or social network server
On 1202.It is therefore to be understood that attribute can determine which external data base is searched.Simple document search engine 1324 from
The global data library searching 206 associated with one in the aforementioned server profile information associated with telephone number.For example,
The social networks ID associated with telephone number and corresponding from the retrieval of social network server 1202 is searched in profile renewal application
In social networks ID profile information.More specifically, if the telephone number associated with the calling detected is (111) 222-
3333, the associated social networks ID for corresponding to the telephone number is searched in profile renewal using 1206, and the result is that entitled
" John doe " user.Profile renewal is using the 1206 retrievals profile information associated with social networks ID John Doe.With

The social networks ID of connection.In another example, notice can include whether wanting addition second user as connection on user
Inquiry to the first user.Information updating engine 1328 receives 210 inputs in response to presentation from the first user.For example, user
It can indicate that the first user wants to be connected with the second user on social networks.In another example, input can be with instruction user
The information of storage second user is wanted as the contact person in the associated person information on client device 1215.Information updating engine
1328 based on the input from user, by the socialgram of the first user in profile information addition 212 to social networks.For example,
Input in response to user indicates that the first user wants to be connected with second user, and social networks adds another user as social
Connection on network.In certain embodiments, it is not the socialgram of 212 first users of renewal, information updating engine 1318 passes through
Profile information is added to the associated person information of the first user on the client device 1215 of contact person information updating 212.The party
Method 200 is particularly advantageous, because movable (call) is used as by being extended based on activity automatically addition connection by it
The mode of the socialgram of first user., should moreover, although block 208 has been rendered as a part for above method 200
It is appreciated that, in some instances, the profile of the first user in social networks is automatically updated without providing notice in method 200
Or receive and input from user.Moreover, method 200 can update the connection of the first user in multiple social networks and external data base
It is people's information or socialgram.For example, information updating engine 1328 can update the cause concentrated on the new employer of second user
The associated person information of the first user in the first external data base in connection, and the profile information of new 3rd user is added
To the socialgram of the first user in the second social networks.
Referring now to Figure 3, the modification for describing to be used in response to contact person is utilized into the social activity of profile information renewal user
The exemplary method 300 of figure.Activity detection engine 1320 detects the associated person information on the client device 1215 of 302 first users
In contact person record modification.For example, modification can be that new contact person record is added to the contact in client device 1215
In people's information.In another example, modification can utilize the associated person information for being added/being compiled into client device 1215

Photo, the true name or the pet name of contact person, the birthday of user, the URL of the page etc. of user.The retrieval of attributes extraction engine 1,322 304
With the one or more attributes relevant as the change caused by the modification detected (for example, inputting the number in modified field
According to).For example, attributes extraction engine 1322 can be from the contact person record retrieval title changed or other identification informations.Profile
Search engine 1324 is from the profile information associated with one or more attributes of global data library searching 306.For example, profile updates
The social networks ID associated with attribute can be retrieved using 1206 from block 304 and retrieves social networks ID profile information.
Profile information can be stored in any portion of social networking application 1204 and the profile information associated with social networks ID
Divide or whole.
Notification engine 1326 generates and provides first user of 308 notices to client device 1215.Notice can wrap
Various types of communication histories between the first user second user associated with the calling with being detected are included (for example, electronics
Mail exchange and call etc.).In another example, notice can include associated with attribute from block 306 and be examined
The profile information or social networks ID of rope.In another example, notice can include whether wanting addition on the first user
Confirmation request of the second user as connection to the first user.Information updating engine 1328 from the first user receive 310 in response to
The input of notice.For example, user can indicate that the first user wants the second user connection on social networks.In another example
In, during input can be using the information of the desired storage second user of instruction user as the associated person information on client device 1215
Contact person.For example, information can include the e-mail address or Mobile Directory Number of second user, and the information can be in

To be stored in the contact person record of the associated person information of client device 1215.In another example, information can include
The user name of second user on social networks.Information updating engine 1328 is added profile information based on the input from user
Add the socialgram of 312 the first users to social networks.For example, the input in response to user indicates that the first user wants and the
Two users connect, and social networks adds second user as the connection on social networks.It should be understood that for socialgram
Modification can be social visible action or private actions.More specifically, in social visible situation, if the first user updates
Information such as its e-mail address on second user, social networking service signal notice second user are social networks clothes
The existing user of business, and the first user indicates the group for the first user that second user should be added in social networking service
Group；Method 300 updates the socialgram of the first user to reflect the relation.In private actions situation, the first user can be simple
Ground updates the profile on the social networks that the first user has on second user.For example, substitution signal notice system should incite somebody to action
Second user is added to one in the group of I in social networking service, and the first user conversely can notify it will by earth signal
Only want to update the profile that has on second user of the first user, such as by adding provided from social networking service the
The picture of two users, but do not establish actually and connect with the second user on social networks.In some instances, method 300
Also update the associated person information or socialgram of the first user in multiple social networks and external data base.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart for the exemplary method 400 retrieved profile information and generate the notice for including profile information.At some
In example, method 400 is performed using 1207 by the simple document search of social network server 1202.Simple document search includes using 1207
Request receive engine 1422, profile information search engine 1428, API (application programming interfaces) 1420, web search engine 1424,
Email exchange data retrieval engine 1426, name resolution service engine 1432 and alternatively rubbish (spam) filter
1430.Simple document search is described in more detail below using 1207 with reference to figure 14.Although it is being used as letter for social networks ID below
Method 400 is present described in the context of breath search social network server 1202, it should be understood that, the energy of method 400
Other data sources for different, same valuable profile information are enough used to search for, and society is used only by example
Hand over the webserver 1202 and social networks ID.
Method 400 receives engine 1422 using 1207 request from simple document search and is based on one or more attributes from for letter
The client device 1215 of first user of shelves information receives 402 requests and started.Include for example, request receives engine 1422 and received
Request of the telephone number as attribute.In another example, request receives engine 1422 and receives other call informations (calling is opened
Begin time, the end time of calling, the quantity of calling, calling come from, call go to, call duration etc.) be used as attribute.
In another example, request receives engine 1422 and receives the request for the associated person information for including updating or changing as attribute.Again
In one example, request receives request 1422 and receives unique identification information (for example, telephone number, title, e-mail address etc.)
As attribute.Unique identification information can be updated using 1206 from the local contact information's of client device 1215 by profile
The call or modification export of contact person record.
By using one or more data sources outside the attribute search client equipment 1215 received, method 400
Continue.As described above, data source can include social network server 1202, profile server 1230, web search server
1232nd, one or more databases of e-mail server 1236 or any third-party server 1234.In some instances,
Profile information is directly retrieved using the attribute received from these data sources.For example, the attribute received can be used for letter
The inquiry of shelves server 1230.In another example, the attribute received is used as on web search server 1232
Search search terms.More specifically, this can be the search of the local manufacturing enterprises with the attribute received.In another example
In, the attribute received can be used for the e-mail address searching email server for another user.Another
In example, the attribute received can be used for the profile of the user of any third-party server 1234.Finally, the category received
Property can be used to inquire about social network server 1202 and its for the social networks ID associated with one or more attributes
Its server.For example, social network server 1202 can access name resolution service and provide the attribute received to come really
The fixed social networks ID associated with one or more attributes.Name resolution service is the portion for giving associated title or title
The service of Divided Retrieving numerical value or attribute.In some instances, API 1420, web search engine 1424, e-mail data retrieval
Engine 1424 and name resolution service engine 1432 work to search the social networks associated with one or more attributes together
ID.It should be understood that method 400 can perform the combination of one or different of above example and by from different data
The result in source is combined as profile information.Further, block 404 produces profile information under such circumstances wherein, performs block
406 needs are optional.
In some instances, it is two step process to retrieve profile information, wherein, unique identification information (example is determined in block 404
Such as, social networks ID), and in block 406 using unique identification information retrieval profile information.For example, profile information retrieval is drawn
Hold up 1428 retrievals 406 profile information associated with social networks ID.For example, simple document search can be with social networks using 1207
Interacted using 1204 API 1420 to search social networks ID.In another example, simple document search can be with using 1207
Interacted with web search engine 1424 with the social networks for searching for web page to search associated with one or more attributes
ID.In another example, simple document search using 1207 can be interacted with email exchange data retrieval engine 1426 with
Searching email server 1236 searches social networks ID.Pay attention to, simple document search using 1207 can with other sources or on
The combination in source and other sources that text is previously mentioned interacts to find social networks ID.In some cases, simple document search application
1207 can find more than one social networks ID associated with same alike result or same alike result group.Name resolution service engine
1432 also identify the social networks ID from other relevant social network ID.It should be understood that it can be directed to relevant with attribute
Profile information the multiple sources of different part searches.Those parts can be combined as the profile information for being presented to user.
For example, it may search for web search server 1232 and title and the address of enterprise be provided.It may search for social network server
1022 and provide the social networks ID for enterprise.It may search for e-mail server 1236 and the president of enterprise be provided
E-mail address.Then the data can be combined and be presented to user as profile information.Moreover, the identical letter
Shelves information can be stored in web search server 1232, client device 1215, social network server 1022 and electronics postal
In one or more of part server 1236 as the first user profile a part.
In some instances, method 400 performs the form of rubbish filtering or data filtering so that user is not presented relevant
In the too many notice of profile information.In some instances, these steps 408 and 410 are optional, therefore using dotted line in Fig. 4
Middle description step 408 and 410.In the example that wherein step 408 and 410 are not performed, the generation of method 400 is notified and connect
The profile that the first user is updated after confirming is received, or the profile of the first user is automatically updated merely with profile information.
More specifically, method 400 may determine whether based on including social signal, call signal or other interactive signals
Various signal generation notices.In some instances, method 400 is used in social signal, call signal and other interactive signals
One or combination determination score.In some instances, simple document search is based on the first user using 1207 spam filters 1430
Interactive history between the user corresponding to social networks ID calculates 408 scores for being used for social networks ID.Score can be with base
Calculated in frequency and other factorses.For example, when associated person information correlated activation is call, and this is in pre- timing
The area of a room (for example, one week in the past) the first user of period (that is, the user of client device 1215) is associated with the telephone number
Second user between the 3rd call, then if social networks ID score ratio only exists between two users
The calling of two or less is higher.Spam filters 1430 determine whether 410 scores calculated in block 408 exceed predetermined threshold
Value.If score is no more than predetermined threshold, method 400 continues without performing block 412.The purpose of block 408 and 410 is to ensure that life
Into and to be presented to each notice of the first user be interested for the first user to a certain extent.This also prevents first
User is not that the bad of useful notice is experienced with she is as one man received for her wherein.It is also conceivable to when calculating score
Other factorses (for example, whether email exchange frequency, second user have been contact persons in associated person information etc.).
In some examples, rule may be adapted to determine whether generation notice.For example, rule can include：1) contact person of the user at me
In list, and this is at least first time user called；2) user is in another contacts list, and this is at least
It is third time user called；3) in one in my definition group of the user on social networks, and this is at least
It is third time user called；4) telephone number in my call history and this be at least the 5th user by
Calling.It should be understood that these rules can also be translated for the threshold value corresponding to calculated score.It is if identified
Score exceedes predetermined threshold, then method 400 proceeds to block 412.Simple document search includes the logical of profile information using 1207 generations 412
Know and send a notification to the first user of client device 1215.Retouched in more detail below with reference to figure 9A-9E and 10A-10E
Example notification is stated.
Fig. 5 shows another exemplary method of the socialgram for utilizing retrieved supplement profile information renewal user
500.Method 500 is favourable because its with phone dialer using exercisable other on 1330 and client device 1215
Using 1332 cooperations.In addition, detecting the action relevant with associated person information or activity and retrieving profile information as response
And update the example of method 500 described in the context of the socialgram of user using it.It should be understood that profile information
With these examples of update action be only from other examples noted above an example and Fig. 5 method 500 it is same
Sample is applied to other types of profile information and update action.
The detection of activity detection engine 1,320 502 is in client device 1215 (for example, mobile computing device) by the first user
Performed action.For example, activity can be contact person's letter of calling on client device 1215 or client device 1215
The modification of contact person record in breath.One or more associated with the activity detected of the retrieval of attributes extraction engine 1,322 504
Individual attribute.For example, when the calling on client device 1215 be present, attribute can be telephone number；Or contacted when existing
During the modification of the contact person record in people's information, attribute can be the data and field of modified contact person record.At some
In example, the profile information retrieved (for example, photo, e-mail address etc.) can be stored and arrived by profile renewal using 1206
Local linkages people record in the associated person information of client device 1215.
In some instances, method 500 determine by update apply 1206 operations generally performed in certain operations whether
Performed via other parts in client device 1215 or application.For example, client device 1215 can include retrieval letter
Shelves information or the other application of the outside of renewal client device 1215 or long-range profile.In this case, to method 500
Optimize so that renewal does not repeat it by the usual action for performing but having performed using 1206.Profile renewal application
Whether 1206 506 client devices 1215 of determination have installed the application for automatically retrieving profile information.For example, smart phone
Some pre-installation dialers automatically retrieve profile information from cloud.In this case, search and retrieve the profile letter of user
Breath will be redundancy.Result such as the determination in fruit block 506 is that client device 1215 has automatically retrieval profile letter really
The application of the installation of breath, then method 500 proceeds to block 518, as will be described below.On the other hand, as in fruit block 506 really
Fixed result is client device 1215 without the application installed for automatically retrieving profile information, then 500 turns of method
To step 508, wherein, whether profile renewal is installed on client device 1215 using 1206 determination social networks and profit
Social networks is automatically updated with the profile information associated with one or more attributes.Block 506 and 508 be it is optional and because
This is depicted in Figure 5 using dotted line.
As fruit block 508 determines that the social networking application of the first user is configured to automatically update, then profile renewal application
1206 do not perform block 510 to 518, and method 500 continues after block 518.On the other hand, as fruit block 508 determines social network
Network is applied to be not present or be not set to and automatically updated, then profile renewal sends 510 using 1206 based on one or more attributes
Ask for profile information and receive 512 and include the notice of profile information.Notification engine 1326 is to client device 1215
The first user provide 514 notice.Notice can include various information and take the various forms as having been described above.Information
Update the input that engine 1328 receives 516 response notices from the first user.It is that take update action really in response to input
Recognize, information updating engine 1328 updates the first user on 518 social networks based on the input from user using profile information
Socialgram.For example, the input in response to user indicates that the first user wants to be connected with second user, it is another that social networks adds this
One user is as the connection on social networks.In some instances, information updating engine 1328 also update multiple social networks and
The associated person information or socialgram of the first user in external data base.
Fig. 6 shows another exemplary method of the socialgram for utilizing retrieved supplement profile information renewal user
600.Method 600 is favourable, because it will be added to user for the condition that notice is presented.This is favourable, because it makes
Circular mail filtering minimizes.In addition, detecting the action relevant with associated person information or activity and retrieving letter as reaction
Shelves information and the example for using method 600 described in the context of the socialgram of its renewal user.It is it should be understood that simple
The method that these examples of shelves information and update action are only from an example and Fig. 6 for other examples noted above
600 are equally applicable to other types of profile information and update action.
Activity detection engine 1320 detects 602 activities relevant with the associated person information on client device 1215.Attribute
Extract engine 1322 and retrieve the 604 one or more attributes associated with the activity detected.It is one or more in response to retrieval
Attribute, simple document search engine 1324 is from the profile information associated with one or more attributes of global data library searching 606.Example
Such as, profile renewal searches the social networks ID associated with these attributes using 1206 and retrieves social networks ID profile letter
Breath.
In some instances, profile renewal is based on meeting that preassigned determines whether 608 provide notice using 1206.Example
Such as, this is determined to based on the interactive history between the first user and second user.When interactive history shows that the first user has
During big potentiality interested in the profile information of second user, notice can be provided.Preassigned can include Multiple factors,
For example, the frequency of calling, frequency of email exchange etc..If determine to be unsatisfactory for for providing the pre- of notice in block 608
Calibration is accurate, then method 600, which does not provide, notifies and do not update any profile and continue after block 616.On the other hand, if
Determining to meet to be used for the preassigned that notice is provided in block 608, then method 600 goes to block 610, wherein, profile renewal application
Whether 1206 the first users of determination have released (dismiss) previously presented notice associated with same profile information.Example
Such as, client device 1215 can store the discharged blacklist each notified and profile renewal application before showing user
1206 check whether notice to be supplied is associated with the same profile information in blacklist.It should be understood that it can be
The releasing of other quantity more than one.Up to it will infer that three times and after that and will no longer present for example, notice can be presented
The notice.In other examples, notice can include two releasing buttons, and one for the only example and another is for complete
Portion's future instances, this is that the clearly feedback from user can be used in following determine in step.In some instances, black name
List can store by every DeviceMode rather than in a manner of every account.If any in releasing notice in notice matching blacklist
It is individual, then this mean the first user of client device not to this notify it is interested.In order to improve Consumer's Experience, method 600 is in block
Continue after 616 and no longer will bother the first user with identical notice again.On the other hand, if the first user not yet solves
Except the notice that previously presents associated with same profile information, then method 600 goes to block 612.
Notification engine 1326 provides 612 notices to the first user of client device.Information updating engine 1328 from first
User receives 614 inputs in response to notice.For example, input can indicate that the first user wants to use with second on social networks
Family connects.In another example, input can be used as client device using the profile information of the desired storage second user of instruction user
On associated person information in contact person.Profile updates engine 1328 based on the input from user, is updated using profile information
The socialgram of the first user on social networks.In some instances, information updating engine 1328 also updates multiple social networks
With the associated person information or socialgram of the first user in external data base.For example, external data base can be related to cause company
The database connect, the database or other databases of general interest or specific focal point that concentrate on local manufacturing enterprises.
