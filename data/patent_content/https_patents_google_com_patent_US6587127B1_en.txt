- the music testing component 152 in FIG. 1 Based upon any of the user-generated rating information and comments described herein, the music testing component 152 in FIG. 1 generates and provides reports including the actual data and/or summaries thereof.
- Each report can be specific to one or more songs associated with an entity such as a record company.
- the report is communicated to the entity to provide rating information and comments for its music items.
- the report can be stratified by demographics such as gender, age, occupation, and geographical region of the end users.
- Each report can be automatically generated either at periodic or predetermined times, or after a predetermined number of end users have rated an item, or upon receiving a request.
- a report for an item can be automatically generated and communicated to the entity via the electronic network 100 after one hundred end users have rated the item.
- a report for an item can be communicated to an entity in response to a request received from the entity via the electronic network 100 .
- the music testing component 152 and the promotions component 156 function as follows. To initiate music testing, a client supplies an album to be tested (either on CD or another medium), indicates which four tracks are to be tested, identifies a 30 -second clip from each track, and provides additional testing information. If desired, this initiation process can be performed on-line via the electronic network 100 .
- the client is associated with a promoter of the album such as a record label for the album.
- the client also supplies additional copies of the album for end users who redeem their credits to obtain the album.
- the additional copies of the album can be supplied by a fulfillment house indicated by the client. The number of additional copies is based upon a required batch size.
- the 30-second clips are digitally encoded for streaming, and made available to the server 102 .
- An entry for the music test is made in a database (herein referred to as MusicTestingBatch).
- the entry (herein referred to as Batch) includes a Universal Product Code (UPC) for the album, a scheduled start date for testing, either a scheduled end date for testing or a scheduled number of testing days, a required number of responses (batch size), a genre of the album, and descriptive information such as liner notes, credits, and lyrics.
- the entry is assigned a unique identification code (herein referred to as BatchID).
- the database includes a client identification code (herein referred to as ClientID) used for billing and report generation purposes.
- ClientID client identification code used for billing and report generation purposes.
- data indicating a total number of songs submitted by the client is updated based upon the entry.
- Each entry in MusicTestingBatch is assigned a queue position for its genre.
- a batch queue cache stores an active queue position identifier and an associated BatchID for each genre.
- the database includes data (herein referred to as BatchResponse) that identifies all of the end users (by their CustomerIDs) that have rated a particular album (using its BatchID). Using this data, a check is performed to ensure that the end user has not previously completed rating of the album identified by the batch queue cache. Alternatively, the check can be performed using data stored in the user profile. In this case, the user profile includes an AlbumID for each album rated by the end user.
- the queue position is incremented to a subsequent position.
- the queue position is repeatedly incremented until a previously-unrated album is identified. If all albums in the genre were rated by the end user, a message suggesting that the end user choose another genre is communicated to and displayed by the client apparatus 106 .
- the music testing component 152 registers the response and increments the queue position. To register the response, the music testing component 152 stores the scores in a MusicTestingResponse table and a MusicTestingScore table by CustomerID and BatchID.
- the MusicTestingScore table tracks user ratings by correlating BatchID, SongID, and CustomerID.
- the AlbumID is stored in the user profile to prevent the album from being rated more than once by the end user. If the end user has not scored all of the samples, no information is stored for the end user.
- the customer profile of the end user can be modified based upon the test. If the end user is enabled to receive promotions (e.g. by having a preferred customer profile), the music testing component 152 credits his/her account upon completing the rating. If the end user is unable to receive promotions (e.g. by having a lesser status such as basic customer or guest), no credit is provided to the end user's account. Optionally, each credit has an expiration date after which the credit is purged.
- a promotions-enabled customer profile maintains a number of testing credits (herein referred to as NumMusicTestingCredits) and a promotion enable date (herein referred to as PromotionEnableDate).
- the presence of a PromotionEnableDate greater than the current date indicates that the end user has already received a promotional item, and will not receive credit for the test. If the PromotionEnableDate is not present (e.g. if the end user has not received a promotional item) or if the PromotionEnableDate is less than the current date, then the end user is eligible to receive credit for the test. In this case, the number of testing credits is incremented upon performing the test.
- an entry is made in a promotions database (herein referred to as PromotionResponseAlbumsPresented).
- the entry includes the BatchID, the CustomerID, and a false value is assigned to a flag (herein referred to as PromoUsedFlag).
- PromoUsedFlag a flag assigned to a flag
- a promotional item such as a CD is offered to the end user.
- the end user is allowed to select the promotional item from a plurality of promotional items having a false PromoUsedFlag in the promotions database. It is noted that each promotional item can have a limited duration of availability based upon its scheduled end date.
- the promotions component 156 receives a response (accept or reject) from the end user. If the end user accepts an item, the following steps are performed.
- a flag (herein referred to as SelectedFlag) associated with the item is set to true in the promotions database.
- Information in the customer profile needed to distribute the item to the end user e.g. a name and a shipping address or an electronic mail address
- the fulfillment house can deliver a physical copy of the item or can deliver an electronic copy of the item via the electronic network 100 .
- the number of testing credits is reset to zero.
- the PromotionEnableDate is set to a date equal to a predetermined time duration beyond the current date.
- the end user can continue rating items after the accumulated number of credits has attained the threshold, however, credit accumulation for the end user is inhibited for the predetermined time duration.
- the PromoUsedFlag is set to true for all entries associated with the CustomerID of the end user in PromotionResponseAlbumsPresented. This step assures that the same albums are not presented to the end user in a subsequent promotion.
- the end user rejects receiving an item e.g. by not selecting an item from a list of available items
- the following steps are performed.
- the number of testing credits is reset to zero.
- the PromoUsedFlag is set to true for all entries associated with the CustomerID of the end user in PromotionResponseAlbumsPresented. As a result, the end user has forfeited his/her credits, and may not select from these items in a subsequent promotion. However, the PromotionEnableDate is maintained so that the end user's ability to acquire credits is not affected.
- a notification message can be occasionally sent to the end user via the electronic network 100 to the end user of his/her credit status.
- the end date for testing is set to the current date, and a batch complete flag is set to a logical true. It is noted that the number of responses can be allowed to slightly exceed the required number of responses in this case.
- the batch response data is summarized and packaged into a report.
- the report provides demographic data on the respondents and provides a measure to compare results across albums within a genre for a specific client.
- the client can be a record label that submitted the test request or a radio station seeking well-rated music.
- the report can include: the BatchID; a report date and time; the scheduled start and end times; the actual start and end times; the MusicID for the album, the title of the album; the first and last name of the primary artist for the album; the SongID, title, artist, and publisher of each tested song from the album; a count of the number of testing responses for the album; a hit index providing a count of responses which rate each song as least/highest; an average music testing score for each song and for the batch; a bar graph showing a percentage of responses at each score; and listener demographics.
- the report can also indicate a number of promotions that were accepted and a number that were declined, a promotion completion time, and a comparison of respondent ratings of redeemed albums versus non-redeemed albums.
- Either the report or a notification thereof can be delivered to the client via the electronic network 100 .
- the music testing component 152 can initiate that an electronic mail message be sent to the client after one hundred persons have rated songs from an album.
- the client navigates to a Web site having the report in a marking language format such as HTML.
- the client can review the report using a browser program.
- the music testing component 152 generates a bill for providing the testing service for the client.
- the report can be generated after a predetermined time duration. Once the predetermined time duration has elapsed, the music testing component 143 generates a report summarizing as much information that was gathered. If a client wants to receive ratings within a shortened time period, the queue can be adjusted to make the album more likely to be presented to an end user than other albums in its genre or category. If desired, the queue can be adjusted to present the album to all end users which select its genre or category.
- a batch can comprise songs from a plurality of albums.
- the songs in a batch have some relationship with one another. It is also preferred that each song being tested be included in only one batch.
- the music genre or category is associated with an entire album.
- a multi-genre category can be provided.
- the music testing component 152 frequently checks tables in the database to ensure that null pointers do not exist. For example, a tested album may still reside in the database after its associated audio files have been removed and/or archived.

- the listener log databases can be maintained by archiving the data, and purging the databases on a daily basis.
- the archived data includes a record of the start time and end time for each end user based upon a plurality of entries in the listener log databases.
- the advertising component 160 maintains a database of advertising records.
- Each advertising record can include an advertisement type, an electronic address, such as a URL, for an audible or visible advertisement, client information identifying the advertiser, and information designating a target audience (e.g. based on customer display information, music, and radio station genre).
- client information identifying the advertiser
- information designating a target audience e.g. based on customer display information, music, and radio station genre.
- a plurality of banner advertisements from the database are queued for display with the player 142 .
- the banner advertisements are successively displayed based on an automated process performed by the advertising component 160 .
- a subsequent banner advertisement in the queue can be displayed every 150 seconds in the banner advertising region 1304 described with reference to FIG. 47 .
- a plurality of attractions advertisements from the database are queued for display with the player 142 .
- the attractions advertisements are successively displayed based on an automated process performed by the advertising component 160 .
- the attractions advertisements can be displayed in the attractions region 1306 or the region 1312 described with reference to FIG. 47 .
- attractions advertisements are contextually associated with audio content played using the player 142 .
- an attractions advertisement can promote an upcoming concert or an album signing related to audio content being played using the player 142 .
- the advertising component 160 can provide content-specific advertisements.
- a plurality of feature advertisements from the database are selected based upon broadcast signals.
- the feature advertisements can include static information such as a radio station logo presented continuously while the player 142 is playing content from an associated radio station.
- the feature advertisements can include dynamic information such as an image of each album being played.
- the feature advertisements can include a visible advertisement tailored to appear during a broadcast commercial.
- the feature advertisements can be displayed in the information space 1314 described with reference to FIG. 47, for example.
- the audio advertisements replace advertisements within the broadcast prior to communication to the client apparatus 106 .
- alternative Internet-based broadcasts and regional-based broadcasts can be generated.
- the advertising component 160 can determine an associated subset of the advertisements targeted to each end user. Further, the advertising component 160 can determine the sequence in which the subset of advertisements are to be presented. Advertisements can be selected for an end user based on any of the following: online and off-line purchasing, demographics, psychographics, geographies, sonagraphics (e.g. listening preferences), and listener behavior. In this way, the advertising component 160 can provide user-specific advertisements.
- the advertising component 160 tracks viewership and listenership of each of the advertisements in the database. Data is recorded indicative of which end users have seen or heard an advertisement in an active window for at least a predetermined time duration, and times at which the advertisement was seen or heard. The data can further track which end users click through or otherwise select each advertisement to get additional information, and track the contemporaneous activity of the end users.
- the advertising component 160 generates reports based upon the tracking data.
- the reports correlate end user demographics with metrics of the viewing and listening data.
- Client advertising billing reports can also be generated based upon the tracking data.
- advertising images and audio files can be cached to the storage device 132 of the client apparatus 106 to improve system performance.
- Audio files can be pre-queued and pre-buffered for streaming at the client apparatus 106 .
- Either in-band signaling or out-of-band signaling can be used to trigger the images and audio files.
- An example of in-band signaling includes a tone encoded within an audio data stream to identify and trigger content insertion.
- An example of out-of-band signaling includes data streamed with the audio data stream.
- the server 102 can provide the client apparatus 106 with content, in addition to the active content, based on a nearest subset of content selections on the graphical radio dial, presets, or favorites based on the end user's listening behavior.
- the additional content can be pre-buffered by the client apparatus 106 .
- the herein-described components of the server 102 can interact with the player 133 (and optionally player 142 ) to provide personalized content to each of a plurality of end users of client apparatuses 104 and 106 .
- Personalized content can be provided to a first user by: (i) communicating from the server 144 first audio content 1700 associated with a broadcast to a first user location 106 , together with control data with information relating to the content, the broadcaster, the user or other attributes such as location of the user, examples of which are set out below; (ii) selecting (at the server 102 ) second content 1710 based upon a first user profile (preferably located at the server 102 ); and (iii) communicating a first signal to the first user location.
- the first signal to the first user location comes from a server such as server 102 or 144 , and the player (player 142 and player 133 in combination) causes switching of content from a first server 102 to a second server 144 or from the server 144 to another server (not shown), from which the inserted advertisement or other material is derived.
- the switching of content can take place at the player 133 or at the player 142 .
- the player 133 upon detection of the relevent code, the player 133 can cause the additional content to be inserted from either a local storage device 132 or from the additional content server (not shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the server Upon registration of the client with the server 102 the server will preload a queue of advertisements or other content items into the storage device or will preload addresses or URLs for those content items into the storage device 132 . Thereafter, as the client 106 receives content from the server 144 and as it identifies an insertion point 1720 from the associated data, instead of presenting any content that it receives from server 144 at that insertion point, the client will present one of the preloaded advertisements or other content items from its storage device 132 .
- These advertisements can be of appropriate length in the case of audio advertisements such that an insertion point 1720 that indicates an opportunity for (for example) a twenty or thirty second sound advertisement can cause such an advertisement to be retrieved from the storage device 132 .
- these insertion points 1720 can indicate addresses or URLs which cause the client 106 to turn to another server (not shown) to find a content item to be inserted at that point, and that other server will decide what that content should be.
- an insertion item could be a complete song from a local artist, and the insertion point 1720 indicates that this should be the item inserted, whereupon the client refers to the local server and the server delivers whatever is the selected local song for the selected local artist.
- the server 102 can provide the client 106 with a schedule of insertion times and the client 106 can maintain a real time clock and at the designated insertion times it will turn to its next insertion item for insertion into the content being received from server 144 .
- data is interleaved into the audio indicating such information as to the artist or song currently being played. This interleaved data can be used by the client 106 as the trigger for causing a replacement of the data being received from server 144 . For example an entire song could be replaced. Alternatively, that data could have a separate logical connection rather than being interleaved into the audio.
- the first audio content 1700 and the first signal are communicated via an electronic network including at least one of the Internet, an intranet, and an extranet.
- the first signal synchronizes playback of the second content with respect to playback of the first audio content 1700 .
- the second content 1710 can include a first at least one image selected in dependence upon the first user profile 150 .
- the first signal is to synchronize display of the first at least one image to playback of the first audio content 1700 .
- the first at least one image can be selected further in dependence upon content within the first audio content 1700 .
- the first image is a content-specific image and/or a broadcaster-specific image.
- Personalized visual content can be provided to a second user 104 by communicating the first audio content 1700 associated with the broadcast (from server 144 ) to a second user location 104 , selecting a second at least one image based upon second user profile stored in customer profile 150 , and communicating a second signal to the second user location (e.g. from server 102 or from another server not shown).
- the second signal synchronizes display of the second at least one image to playback of the first audio content 1700 .
- the second at least one image can differ from the first at least one image.
- the second content 1710 can include second audio content selected in dependence upon the first user profile.
- the first signal is to synchronize playback of the second audio content with respect to playback of the first audio content 1700 .
- the second audio content can be synchronized for insertion within the first audio content 1700 .
- the second content 1710 includes at least one of advertising content and programming content.
- Personalized audible content can be provided to the second user by communicating the first audio content 1700 associated with the broadcast to the second user location, selecting third audio content based upon the second user profile, and communicating a second signal to the second user profile, and communicating a second signal to the second user location to synchronize playback of the third audio content with respect to playback of the first audio content 1700 .
- the third audio content can differ from the second audio content.
- the third audio content can be synchronized for insertion within the first audio content 1700 .
- Each user profile is updated by monitoring information associated with user-specific, apparatus-independent use of a plurality of audio content player apparatus via the electronic network.
- the user profile for a user can be based upon his/her use at both the client apparatus 106 and the client apparatus 104 .
- Each user profile can include transaction information, demographic information, psychographic information, geographic information, sonagraphic information, and listening behavior information for its associated user.
- Embodiments of the present invention can provide an Internet-based digital audio service that combines an easy-to-use, customizable audio player interface with a wide variety of audio content. Users are able to access audio-on-demand through an archive of music and spoken word titles, and are able to tune to live radio broadcasts from around the world. Further, content information is integrated with content distribution. In this way, an end user can obtain information about content to which he/she is listening. Additionally, the end user is provided a means for purchasing the content, such as music content, to which he/she is listening.
- User preferences and behavior are tracked to generate information of interest for each user.
- This information can relate to his/her music taste, geographical location, and/or other personalized criteria.
- the information can also be used by radio stations and record labels to determine which music is worth playing.
- Embodiments of the player advantageously support browsing of audio content on the Internet using two metaphors: (i) a radio station metaphor and (ii) a record store listening booth metaphor.
- Additional features include: concurrent display of visual information based on material broadcast by a radio station; paging of the end user for scheduled events; an interactive schedule for radio programming; listing available stations for a day; and a map to show a location of origin of a radio station.
