- a limited screen space e.g., a portable computer, mobile phone, media player/recorder, PDA.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram for an exemplary scaling process 200 .
- the process 200 begins when a viewport is launched in a user interface (e.g., a browser window) in response to a trigger event.
- the dimensions of the viewport can be determined from default values or based on the current size of the user interface ( 202 ). For example, if a user clicks a link corresponding to a result of a book search, the viewport can be launched based on default settings, and a default image can be displayed in the viewport (e.g., a title page or first page of a book).
- books are previously scanned and processed to extract and/or determine information (e.g., dimensions) that can be used to later manage the display of images in a viewport.
- information e.g., dimensions
- Such processing can include, but is not limited to: determining a typical text bounding box for the book page images, determining a text bounding box for each book page image, removing artifacts in book page images (e.g., artifacts due to systematic scanning error), etc.
- the selected book page image can be retrieved from an image repository ( 204 ) or other suitable data structure for storing images (e.g., cache memory).
- the image is scaled to fit in the viewport given the current dimensions of the viewport and other factors ( 206 ).
- the user is provided with zoom controls with predetermined zoom “stops”.
- the zoom stops can be set as a function of viewport size (e.g., height, width).
- the zoom stops fit the image to the height and/or width of the viewport.
- the zoom stops can have absolute bounds to prevent the image from being made arbitrarily large or small.
- the scaled image is displayed in the viewport ( 208 ). If the user interface (e.g., browser window) is resized ( 210 ), then the viewport can be re-sized based on the current dimensions of the user interface ( 212 ) and the process 200 returns to step 206 . Alternatively, the viewport can be maintained based on user settings or preferences. For example, a user may want the size of the viewport to remain fixed when the user interface is resized.
- the dimensions of the viewport 102 are provided by a window manager service, which is commonly included as part of an operating system (e.g., Windows XP).
- a window manager service which is commonly included as part of an operating system (e.g., Windows XP).
- Other factors that can be used to scale an image for display in the viewport can include, but are not limited to:
- scaling can be determined empirically using some principles (e.g., rules, guidelines, options, etc.). Some exemplary principles for determining a scaled size include, but are not limited to:
- a bounding box of the text on the page can be padded. If the padded bounding box is “close” to fitting in the display area 108 of the viewport 102 , then the image is scaled to fit the display area 108 . In some implementations, the scaling is performed provided the text does not drop below a minimum x-height. In some implementations, the bounding box is “close” to fitting in the viewport if a certain portion (e.g., a percentage) of the bounding box fits within the viewport. Otherwise, more than one “viewportful” of vertical space may be needed to display the page.
- a certain portion e.g., a percentage
- any given book page image can have a fixed aspect ratio
- the viewport 102 containing the book page image does not have to have a fixed aspect ratio.
- the image could be long and narrow if the whole page is being displayed or short and wide if the top half of the page is displayed.
- the page image can be scaled to a size so that a predetermined percentage of the page image fits in the viewport 102 (e.g., the top 55% of the page).
- a predetermined percentage of the page image fits in the viewport 102 (e.g., the top 55% of the page).
- the remaining portion of the page image can be displayed in the viewport 102 (e.g., the bottom 55% of the page), rather than a new page.
- a separate control e.g., a toggle button
- a scaled image is displayed by default.
- a zoom feature can be included that allows the user to zoom between a scaled image and the image with its original dimensions.
- software can be used to implement a multi-stage zoom.
- a zoom dropdown menu can be presented to the user with options such as 50%, 75%, default (the scaled size), zoom to fit, or actual size. Once a size is set, the size can persist from image to image.
- images e.g., the next book page image of the sequence
- the user is presented with zoom controls upon display of a default page.
- the zoom controls allow users to zoom-in or zoom-out the book page images.
- the zoom controls can include zoom “stops” which can be customized using, for example, information about the image that was previously determined during a scanning process (e.g., image dimensions).
- the zoom “stops” can be zoom percentages (e.g., 10%, 38%) that have been customized to provide better user experience for the particular image being zoomed and the particular viewport size.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram for an exemplary margin adjusting process 300 . Since book page images are digital images of actual book pages, the sometimes ample margins used in a conventional book are captured in the digital image. Such ample margins, however, can diminish the readability of the book in electronic form. The process 300 makes small adjustments to book page margins in the digital domain to maximize readability of book page images.
- the process 300 begins by retrieving an image including content and margins from an image repository ( 302 ).
- the process 300 determines whether margins exist, and if margins exist, also determines the dimensions of the margins ( 304 ). For example, the process 300 can look for white space in the outer portion of a page image to determine if page margins exist. If page margins exist, then a difference between page dimensions and a text bounding box can be calculated to determine page margin dimensions. Once the margin dimensions are known, standard image cropping or magnifying techniques can be used to adjust (e.g., trim or increase) the margins based on the margin dimensions to provide appropriate (e.g., additional or less) space for the content ( 306 ).
- the image content (e.g., text) can be rescaled to fill the space provided by the margin adjusting ( 308 ).
- the book page images with adjusted margins can be stored in an image repository (e.g., image repository 504 ) for future retrieval when a user requests a book page having a particular scale ( 310 ).
- cropping rules are used to provide a uniform presentation of images in the viewport.
- each book page image in a sequence of book page images can have a designated anchor point, such as the top left-hand corner of the book page image, which can be used to anchor the text in substantially the same location of the image.
- a template can be used to scale each image in a uniform manner.
- the template can be a page bounding box with standard dimensions (height, width). The dimensions of the template bounding box can be determined by processing an entire image sequence and determining a typical height and width of the text in the image sequence (e.g., a median height and width). If a given text is close to the template bounding box, than the template is used. Otherwise, the text is processed, as described in reference to FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram for an exemplary TOC creation process 400 .
- a TOC is presented in the viewport 102 with hypertext links to other pages in a book page sequence.
- the process 400 begins by retrieving a book page sequence for an image repository ( 402 ).
- the book page sequence is searched using, for example, an OCR engine, to identify which images contain a TOC.
- Various clues, attributes or heuristics can be used to determine whether an image includes a TOC. For example, an image can be determined to be a TOC if the image contains white space, text with large fonts (e.g., a large title), ellipses, roman numerals, italicized text, or any other attributes associated with TOCs.
- Some or all of these clues, attributes or heuristics can be combined into a score, which can be compared to a reference to determine whether a TOC has been found.
- the image is tagged ( 408 ) and hypertext links are created for one or more (e.g., each) of the TOC entries ( 410 ) and embedded in the TOC image.
- the TOC image, including the links, can then be presented in the viewport 102 .
- the various clues, attributes and heuristics can be used to determine breaks in the book page sequence ( 412 ). For example, the first page of each chapter or section in a book can be identified as a break in the book page sequence. The breaks in content can then be used to create a TOC ( 414 ). For example, the first page of each chapter or section of a book can be the entries of the TOC. Chapter and/or section title names used in the book can be used for naming entry points in the created TOC, if available. Otherwise, names can be created for the TOC entry points, for example, “Section 1”, “Section 2”, . . . , “Section N”.
- links can be created for the TOC entries, and the TOC, including the links, can be presented in the viewport 102 , as described in reference to FIG. 6 .
- the first few sentences or paragraphs of each chapter or section of a book can be displayed in a panel (e.g., a side panel 612 in FIG. 6 ).

Abstract
Description
-
- the x-height (approximately the line height in pixels) of text on the book page, which can be provided by an optical character recognition (OCR) system, such as the Tesseract OCR engine developed by Hewlett-Packard, Inc.;
- a bounding box for text on the book page image, as given by margin recognition or the user's current browser text size; and
- the user's current browser text size. For example, text can be rendered to a hidden portion of the user interface (e.g., a browser window) and measured to estimate the user's browser text size, and a scale factor can be determined from the measurement for correcting the image size.
-
- Rule 1: At the scaled size there should not be horizontal scrolling within the viewport.
- Rule 2: At the scaled size, the height “x” should not be below a threshold value of N (e.g., 10 or 12 pixels).
- Guideline 1: If the text on the book page image is “close” to fitting in the viewport (vertically), the scaled size image should fit entirely in the viewport. In some implementations, the scaling can be performed by a user with “zoom” controls having zoom “stops” that are customized to the particular image being zoomed.
- Guideline 2: In general, minimize the number of times the viewport is filled to consume a book page image. This minimization can be achieved in part through margin cropping, as described in reference to
FIG. 3 .
-
- Option 1: Minimize the number of “viewportfuls” needed to show a single book page image, at the expense of text size (e.g., place as much text into the viewport as possible by scaling down the text until the text reaches nearly the minimum line height).
- Option 2: Scale the image up to get larger text, at the cost of needing more “viewportfuls” to consume a single book page. The upper bound on the up scaling can be set by Rule 1—no horizontal scrolling. This approach can be better suited for a shorter, wider viewport.
