Definitions
- the invention generally relates to social networks. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for the display and navigation of a social network.
- Conventional websites may present a member's connections together with profiles associated with those connections in a list format. In such conventional websites, only a small subset of the member's connections is exposed. Conventional methods for displaying connections do not provide information or pointers to facilitate further navigation. Some conventional websites provide a network graph that displays the names of a member's connections in concentric circles depending on whether the connection is a friend, or a friend of a friend, etc. and allows a user to see links between connected profiles. Such conventional websites do not present information to the user to facilitate further navigation or allow custom viewing of the network.

- the client devices 102 a - n can include, for example, personal computers executing a browser application program such as Microsoft Corporation's Internet ExplorerTM, Netscape Communication Corporation's Netscape NavigatorTM, and Apple Computer, Inc.'s SafariTM.
- a server device 104 is also coupled to the network 106 .
- the server device 104 shown comprises a server executing a social network engine application program, also known as a social network engine 120 .
- the social network engine 120 allows users, such as user 112 a , to interact with and participate in a social network.
- a social network can refer to a computer network connecting entities, such as people or organizations, by a set of social relationships, such as friendship, co-working, or information exchange.
- a social network can refer to a computer application or data connecting such entities by such social relationships. Examples of social networks include Orkut.com and Friendster.com.
- Social networks can comprise any of a variety of suitable arrangements.
- An entity or member of a social network can have a profile and that profile can represent the member in the social network.
- the social network can facilitate interaction between member profiles and allow associations or relationships between member profiles. Associations between member profiles can be one or more of a variety of types, such as friend, co-worker, family member, business associate, common-interest association, and common-geography association. Associations can also include intermediary relationships, such as friend of a friend, and degree of separation relationships, such as three degrees away.
- Associations between member profiles can be reciprocal associations. For example, a first member can invite another member to become associated with the first member and the other member can accept or reject the invitation. A member can also categorize or weigh the association with other member profiles, such as, for example, by assigning a level to the association. For example, for a friendship-type association, the member can assign a level, such as acquaintance, friend, good friend, and best friend, to the associations between the member's profile and other member profiles. In one embodiment, the social network engine 120 can determine the type of association between member profiles, including, in some embodiments, the degree of separation of the association and the corresponding weight or level of the association.
- the server device 104 shown comprises a processor 116 coupled to a computer-readable memory 118 .
- the server device 104 is in communication with a social network database 130 .
- Server device 104 depicted as a single computer system, may be implemented as a network of computer processors. Examples of a server device 104 are servers, mainframe computers, networked computers, a processor-based device, and similar types of systems and devices.
- Client processor 110 and the server processor 116 can be any of a number of computer processors, such as processors from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. and Motorola Corporation of Schaumburg, Ill.
- Each profile within a social network can contain entries, and each entry can comprise information associated with a profile.
- entries for a person profile can comprise contact information such as an email addresses, mailing address, IM name, or phone number; personal information such as relationship status, birth date, age, children, ethnicity, religion, political view, sense of humor, sexual orientation, fashion preferences, smoking habits, drinking habits, pets, hometown location, passions, sports, activities, favorite books, music, TV, or movie preferences, favorite cuisines; professional information such as skills, career, or job description; photographs of a person or other graphics associated with an entity; or any other information describing, identifying, or otherwise associated with a profile.
- Entries for a business profile can comprise industry information such as market sector, customer base, location, or supplier information; financial information such as net profits, net worth, number of employees, stock performance; or other types of information associated with the business profile.
- the social network engine 120 comprises a path processor 122 and display processor 124 .
- the path processor 122 can determine an association path between profiles.
- An association path can comprise the fewest number of associated profiles associating a first profile with a second profile. For example, if a profile A is associated with a profile B, and profile B is associated with a profile C, then the association path for profiles A and C comprises A,B,C.
- An association path comprising the fewest number of associated profiles associating a first path and a second path is referred to as a shortest association path.
- a type-specific association path can also be determined, wherein the fewest number of associations of a specific type are determined by the path processor 122 .
- the path processor 122 can also determine a navigation path.
- a navigation path is an ordering of profiles viewed by the user 112 a to reach a particular profile. For example if user 112 a starts by viewing profile A and then views profile B by following a link from profile A, and finally follows another link from profile B to view profile C, the display path can be A,B,C.
- the social network engine 120 further comprises a display processor 124 .
- the display processor 124 can receive an association path from the path processor 122 and configure the association path for presentation to a user, such as user 112 a .
- the display processor 124 can also configure a social network, or a portion of a social network, for presentation. For example, the display processor 124 can determine one or more representative entries in the profile, for example, a name and a picture, and arrange the name and picture associated with the profile so that the user 112 a can easily identify the profiles when presented on the client device 102 a .
- Configuring a social network, or a portion of a social network for presentation can further comprise determining a ranking for each of the profiles in the social network, or portion of a social network, and displaying the profiles based at least in part on the ranking for each profile.
- the display processor 124 can determine a ranking for a profile based on a number of total profiles associated with the profile and can then arrange profiles based at least in part on ranking. For example, higher ranking profiles—in one embodiment, those having relatively greater associated profiles—an be displayed in a central location, or otherwise distinguished from lower ranking profiles when presented to the user 112 a.
- the display processor 124 can also present profiles in a social network, or a portion of a social network, based on entries or associations of each of the profiles. For example, the display processor can display in bold type, or otherwise emphasize or distinguish, profiles that are associated with a member currently viewing the social network such as the user 112 a . Thus, for example, when the user 112 a is viewing the social network, the display processor 124 can configure a portion of the social network being presented to the user 112 a such that each of the names of profiles that represent friends of the user 112 a are displayed in bold type.
- embodiments of the present invention can display the names associated with profiles A and B in bold type.
- Server device 104 also provides access to storage elements, such as a social network storage element, in the example shown in FIG. 1 , a social network database 130 that can be used to store profiles.
- Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs. Other similar types of data storage devices can be accessed by the server device 104 .
- the social network engine 120 can receive data comprising profiles from the social network database 130 and can also send data comprising profiles to the social network database 130 for storage.
- the social network database 130 may be physically attached or otherwise in communication with the social network engine 120 by way of a network or other connection.
- server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to help explain the social networks and methods illustrated in FIGS. 2-5 .
- FIG. 2 shows a diagram of a social network 200 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the social network 200 is illustrated with a graph comprising vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 and edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , 234 , 236 , 238 , and 240 .
- the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 comprise profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G respectively.
- Each profile can represent a member profile of a member of the social network 200 .
- one or more of the vertices can represent a community.
- the methods and systems discussed below are equally applicable to an embodiment where the vertices comprise one or more communities, but for purposes of illustration, the vertices depicted in FIG. 2 represent member profiles.
- the exemplary network 200 shown in FIG. 2 has seven members. Considerably more members can be part of the social network 200 .
- a member can be an entity such as, for example, a person, an organization, a business, a corporation, a community, a fictitious person, or other suitable entity.
- Each member profile can contain entries, and each entry can comprise information associated with a profile.
- a person's member profile can contain: personal information, such as relationship status, birth date, age, children, ethnicity, religion, political view, sense of humor, sexual orientation, fashion preferences, smoking habits, drinking habits, pets, hometown location, passions, sports, activities, favorite books or music, TV or movie preferences, and favorite cuisines; contact information, such as email addresses, location information, instant messenger name, telephone numbers, and address; professional information, such as job title, employer, and skills; educational information, such as schools attended and degrees obtained, and any other suitable information describing, identifying, or otherwise associated with a person.
- a business'member profile can, for example, contain a description of the business, and information about its market sector, customer base, location, suppliers, net profits, net worth, number of employees, stock performance, contact information, and other types of suitable information associated with the business.
- a member profile can also contain rating information associated with the member.
- the member can be rated or scored by other members of the social network 200 in specific categories, such as humor, intelligence, fashion, trustworthiness, sexiness, and coolness.
- a member's category ratings can be contained in the member's profile.
- a member can have fans. Fans can be other members who have indicated that they are “fans” of the member. Rating information can also include the number of fans of a member and identifiers of the fans. Rating information can also include the rate at which a member accumulated ratings or fans and how recently the member has been rated or acquired fans.
- a member profile can also contain social network activity data associated with the member.
- Membership information can include information about a member's login patterns to the social network, such as the frequency that the member logs in to the social network and the member's most recent login to the social network.
- Membership information can also include information about the rate and frequency that a member profile gains associations to other member profiles.
- a member profile may contain consumer information. Consumer information may include the frequency, patterns, types, or number of purchases the member makes, or information about which advertisers or sponsors the member has accessed, patronized, or used.
- a member profile may comprise data stored in memory.
- the profile in addition to comprising data about the member, can also comprise data relating to others.
- a member profile can contain an identification of associations or virtual links with other member profiles.
- a member's social network profile may comprise a hyperlink associated with another member's profile. In one such association, the other member's profile may contain a reciprocal hyperlink associated with the first member's profile.
- a member's profile may also contain information excerpted from another associated member's profile, such as a thumbnail image of the associated member, his or her age, marital status, and location, as well as an indication of the number of members with which the associated member is associated.
- a member's profile may comprise a list of other social network members' profiles with which the member wishes to be associated.
- An association may be designated manually or automatically.
- a member may designate associated members manually by selecting other profiles and indicating an association that can be recorded in the member's profile.
- associations can be established by an invitation and an acceptance of the invitation.
- a first user can send an invitation to a second user inviting the second user to form an association with the first user.
- the second user can accept or reject the invitation.
- a one-way association can be formed between the first user and the second user.
- no association may be formed between the two users.
- an association between two profiles may comprise an association automatically generated in response to a predetermined number of common entries, aspects, or elements in the two members' profiles.
- a member profile may be associated with all of the other member profiles comprising a predetermined number or percentage of common entries, such as interests, hobbies, likes, dislikes, employers and/or habits.
- Associations designated manually by members of the social network, or associations designated automatically based on data input by one or more members of the social network, can be referred to as user established associations.
- Associations between profiles within a social network can be of a single type or can be multiple types and can include, for example, friendship associations, business associations, family associations, community associations, school associations, or any other suitable type of link between profiles. Associations can further be weighted to represent the strength of the association. For example, a friendship association can be weighted more than a school association. Each type of association can have various levels with different weights associated with each level. For example, a friendship association can be classified according to which of a plurality of friendship association levels it belongs to. In one embodiment, a friendship association may be assigned a level by the member from a list of levels comprising: a best friend, a good friend, a regular friend, an acquaintance, and a friend the member has not met.
- the edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , 234 , 236 , 238 , and 240 shown comprise associations between profiles.
- the social network 200 comprises a plurality of differing types of associations represented by edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , 234 , 236 , 238 , and 240 .
- the types of associations shown in FIG. 2 for illustration purposes are business associations, activity partner associations, friendship associations, community associations, and common characteristic associations.
- Common characteristic associations may include, for example, associations based on some characteristic, such as attending the same high school or being from the same hometown, and can indicate a lower level of significance than another type of association, such as a friendship association.
- edge 220 and edge 222 each comprise an association between profile A at vertex 202 and profile D at vertex 208 .
- the edge 220 represents a business association
- the edge 222 represents a friendship association.
- Profile A is also associated with profile E by a common characteristic association comprising edge 218 .
- the association between profile A and profile E may be more attenuated than the association between profile A and D, but the association can still be represented by the social network depicted in FIG. 2 .
- Each member represented by the profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G comprising the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 respectively, for purposes of illustration, comprises a person.
- Other types of members can be in social network 200 .
- communities, special interest groups, organizations, political parties, universities, and legal persons, such as corporations and business partnerships may be members of the social network 200 .
- the associations 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , 234 , 236 , 238 , and 240 illustrated in FIG. 2 comprise bi-directional associations.
- An association between two profiles may comprise a bi-directional association when both parties to the association are associated with each other.
- profile A is associated with profile D
- profile D is also associated with profile A.
- profiles A and D will not be bi-directionally associated with each other until both profiles consent to such an association.
- profile A may invite profile D to be associated therewith, and the bi-directional association occurs upon profile D's acceptance of such invitation.
- the invitation may include sending an email or other message to profile D indicating that profile A has requested an association with profile D.
- Directed associations can associate a first profile with a second profile while not requiring the second profile to be associated with the first profile.
- profile A can be associated by a friendship association with profile B, and profile B can be unassociated with profile A, or profile B can be associated with profile A through a different type of association, such as a business association.
- a display of profile A's friends can include profile B, but a display of profile B's friends would not include profile A.
- a directed or single direction association can be formed when one member indicates an association with a second member but the second member does not reciprocate the association.
- a member associated with profile A can indicate that he is a friend of a member associated with profile B.
- the member associated with profile B in this example can decide not to indicate that the member associated with profile A is a friend.
- profile B would not be displayed with profile A's friends nor would profile A be displayed with profile B's friends as the association was not reciprocated by profile B.
- profile B may not be included, for example, within a listing of friends of profile A for purposes of determining degrees of separation, for example.
- the displaying of profile B can be controlled by the associations the member associated with profile B assents to.
- a degree of separation can be determined for associated profiles.
- a degree of separation between two profiles can be determined by the fewest number of edges of a certain type separating the associated profiles.
- a type-specific degree of separation may be determined.
- a type-specific degree of separation comprises a degree of separation determined based on one particular type of association. For example, a profile A has a friend association degree of separation of two from profile E. The fewest number of friendship associations between profile A and profile E is two—the friendship association comprising edge 222 between profiles A and D and the friendship association comprising edge 234 between profiles D and E.
- the degree of friendship separation determined according to one aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, is two.
- Another type-specific degree of separation can also be determined for profiles A and E.
- a common characteristic degree of separation can be determined by determining the fewest number of common characteristic associations separating profile A and profile E.
- the common characteristic association degree of separation is one.
- the common characteristic in this example can be that profile A attended the same high school as profile E.
- a common characteristic association may be selected by profiles A and E to represent that they are associated in some fashion, but to not create a close association, such as with a friendship association.
- a type-neutral degree of association can also be determined.
- a type-neutral degree of association can be determined by determining the fewest number of edges connecting two vertices, regardless of type.
- the degree of separation may be determined by use of a weighting factor assigned to each association. For example, close friendships can be weighted higher than more distant friendships. According to certain aspects of embodiments using a weighting factor, a higher weighting factor for an association can reduce the degree of separation between profiles and lower weighting factors can increase the degree of separation. This can be accomplished, for example, by establishing an inverse relationship between each association and a corresponding weighting factor prior to summing the associations. Thus, highly weighted associations would contribute less to the resulting sum than lower weighted associations.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a display 300 of a social network according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the display 300 comprises a selected member graphic 302 , a selected member profile 304 , an association path 306 , and a display grid 308 .
- the selected member graphic 302 comprises a graphic associated with the selected member profile.
- the selected member profile can represent a profile the user 112 a has selected by clicking on a link, or other suitable input method, in order to view additional information about the profile.
- the selected member graphic 302 can comprise, for example, a picture, graphic, drawing, or other image associated with the selected member profile.
- the selected member profile 304 can comprise information describing the selected member, for example, a name, location, age, sex, and interests.
- the selected member profile can also contain other suitable information determined, for example, by the display processor 124 to be representative of the selected member. Alternatively, the selected member profile can display all of the information associated with the selected member.
- the association path 306 can comprise one or more association paths determined by the path processor 122 including, for example, a shortest association path, a type-specific association path, or a navigation path.
- the association path 306 can display a name associated with each profile in the association path. For example, in the embodiment depicted in FIG. 3 , “Orkut” represents the user 112 a , “Larry” represents an associated profile within the association path of the user 112 a and the selected member, and “Brandon” represents the selected member.
- the present invention can allow the user 112 a to visualize the chain of connections linking the user 112 a , Orkut, to a selected member. For example, Orkut can see that he is linked to Brandon by way of Larry.
- the names representing the profiles in the association path can comprise links to the represented profile.
- the display grid 308 can further comprise graphics associated with a plurality of associated profiles, names associated with each of the profiles within the plurality of profiles, and a number representing a total number of associations for the associated profile. For example, a graphic above “Kerah” in FIG. 3 can represent an associated profile “Kerah,” and the number “28” to the right of “Kerah” can represent a total number of profiles associated with “Kerah.”
- the number representing a total number of profiles associated with an associated profile can help a user navigate the social network by pointing the user 112 a towards profiles that will be associated with more profiles and thus pointing the user 112 a away from “dead ends,” or profiles that are associated with few or no other profiles.
- One exemplary method according to the present invention comprises identifying a first profile in a social network, identifying associated profiles associated with the first profile, ranking the associated profiles, wherein ranking is not based exclusively on a degree of separation, and outputting the associated profiles based at least in part on the ranking.
- the ranking can be based at least in part on social network activity data.
- the social network activity data can comprise one or more of login frequency, number of logins, date of last profile update, existence of an email address, existence of a picture, and instant messaging availability status.
- the ranking can be based at least in part on biography data.
- the biography data can comprise one or more of age, name, interests, and geographical location.
- the ranking can be based at least in part on popularity data.
- the popularity data can comprise one or more of a number of profiles associated with a first profile, feedback, and rating data.
- the ranking can be based at least in part on data indicating relatedness.
- the data indicating relatedness can comprise one or more of an amount of common entries, a degree of separation, and an amount of contacts between profiles.
- the ranking can be based on custom settings entered by a user.
- Another exemplary method of one embodiment of the present invention comprises identifying a user profile, identifying a member profile, determining an association path for the user profile and the member profile, and outputting the association path.
- the association path can comprise a shortest path, type specific path, or navigation path.
- the profiles can be displayed in a grid format and can be positioned based on ranking order.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method 400 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the method 400 illustrated in FIG. 4 begins in block 402 , wherein the social network engine 120 identifies a user profile.
- the user profile can correspond to the profile of the user viewing the social network, such as the user 112 a .
- the method 400 proceeds to block 404 , wherein the social network engine 120 determines a member profile.
- the member profile can be, for example, a profile of a member of the social network that the user 112 a desires to learn more about and selects, for example, by clicking on a link to the profile, such as the link “Larry” depicted in FIG. 3 .
- the member profile can be identified by other suitable methods such as selecting a default member profile or selecting a last viewed member profile.
- the method 400 proceeds to block 406 , wherein the social network search engine 120 identifies associated profiles associated with the member profile determined in block 404 .
- the associated profile can comprise, for example, profiles associated by a specific type of association, such as a friendship association, or profiles associated by any or all other types of associations within a social network.
- the method 400 can cause the display of a type-specific social network.
- the method 400 can cause the display of a type-neutral social network.
- the method 400 proceeds to block 408 , wherein the display processor 124 determines a ranking for each associated profile.
- Ranking associated profiles can help the user 112 a find profiles more likely to be of interest and otherwise facilitate navigation of the social network. For example, some users of a social network may initially set up an account but access the account infrequently or cease using it altogether. Such users may not be as desirable of associations as users who frequently access the social network.
- the display processor 124 can rank profiles to help users easily identify, for example, which profiles are more active than others.
- the associated profiles can be ranked.
- the ranking for an associated profile can be determined, for example, based on social network activity data, biography data, popularity data, relatedness data, or other suitable types of data tending to distinguish profiles.
- Ranking profiles based on social network activity can comprise, for example, ranking users based on how frequently or how often a member of the social network logs on to the social network, how often or how recently a member has updated his profile information, when a member joined the social network, whether a member is currently available for instant messaging, whether a member has an available email address, a picture, or other identifiers associated with his profile, or other information tending to indicate that a member is actively using or available on the social network.
- Ranking profiles based on biography data associated with a profile can comprise, for example, ranking profiles based on age, name, geographical location, interests, or other suitable information associated with the profile.
- the display processor 124 can require a permission indication for sharing biography information prior to ranking profiles based on such information.
- the display processor 124 can identify an age associated with the user's 112 a profile and identify ages for associated profiles. The display processor 124 can then rank the profiles based on closeness of age and output the profiles such that profiles closer in age to the user 112 a are emphasized over other profiles, for example.
- the display processor 124 can cause the profiles to be ranked alphabetically to facilitate locating known profiles, or ranked based on geographical location.
- the user's 112 a profile can indicate a geographical location of California, and associated profiles can be ranked according to the closeness of their geographical to California.
- a profile indicating a geographical location of New York can be ranked lower than a profile indicating a geographical location of Arizona, and thus the user 112 a can more readily identify local users.
- Ranking based on popularity data can comprise, for example, ranking profiles based on a number of profiles to which the profile is associated, ranking profiles based on feedback or ratings from social network members, or raking profiles based on other suitable indications of popularity for a user profile.
- the display processor 124 can determine how many profiles are associated with each profile and rank profiles associated with a greater number of profiles higher than those associated with fewer profiles. In determining how many profiles are associated with a given profile, the display processor 124 can identify how many profiles are within a certain degree of separation from the given profile.
- the display processor 124 can identify how many profiles are within one degree of separation and thus determine a popularity based, for example on how many “friends” a profile has and not on how many “friends of a friend” the profile has. Alternatively, other degrees of separation could be used. Additionally, the display processor 124 can determine a rating score recursively factoring in a number of profiles associated in turn with each associated profile.
- Ranking based on popularity can also comprise receiving feedback or ratings from members of the social network.
- the social network engine 120 can allow members of the social network to enter ratings for a given member of the social network and store the ratings in association with the given member. Ratings can include, for example, indications of how friendly, attractive, cool, trustworthy, etc. the given member is perceived to be.
- the ratings can be compiled by the display processor 124 to determine a ranking for the profiles of the social network thus enabling a user to easily identify which profiles are perceived to be more popular.
- Rankings based on relatedness data can comprise, for example, ranking based on an amount of common entries between profiles, a degree of separation between profiles, an amount of contacts such as instant messages or emails between contacts, or other suitable data indicating how closely related two profiles are.
- the display processor 124 can identify that the user 112 a has sent and received a high number of emails from a certain member of the social network. The display processor 124 can thus determine a higher ranking for the certain member of the social network than for an other members with whom the user 112 a has had little contact.
- the ranking for each associated profile can be specific to the user 112 a viewing the social network, or non-user specific. For example, if the user 112 a has indicated a strong association with the associated profile receiving a ranking, the associated profile can receive a higher ranking. If another user, for example user 112 b , has indicated a dislike of the same associated profile, the associated profile can receive a lower ranking when the social network is being viewed by user 112 b . Alternatively, each associated profile can receive the same ranking based on factors independent of which user is viewing the social network.
- the methods 400 proceeds to block 410 , wherein associations with the user profile are determined.
- the associations with the user profile can comprise associations between an associated profile and the profile of the user 112 a .
- “Kerah” is an associated profile
- “Orkut” is the profile of the user 112 a .
- the social network engine 120 can determine associations between “Kerah” and “Orkut.”
- the associations determined in block 410 can be passed to the display processor 124 .
- the display processor 124 can then format the name representing the associated profile based in part on the associations received from the social network engine 120 .
- “Kerah” comprises a friend association with “Orkut.”
- the social network search engine can determine the friend association between “Kerah” and “Orkut” and pass this association to the display processor 124 .
- the display processor 124 can then configure the social network so that the name “Kerah” is highlighted in some fashion such as with a distinguishing color, font, or typeface. For example, in FIG. 3 , the name “Kerah” appears in bold typeface. The distinguished typeface for “Kerah” can indicate to the user 112 a that “Kerah” is a friend of the user 112 a .
- the social network engine 120 can determine other associations between the associated profile and the user 112 a including other types of profile associations, such as business associations or acquaintance associations, as well as other associating information such as common interests, common location, common age, or any other suitable associating information.
- the associating information can be determined, for example, by matching entries within profiles. Entries can be matched by determining same or similar entries, determining matching part and counter-part entries—such as “men seeking women” and “women seeking men,” or by concept clustering.
- the method 400 proceeds to block 342 wherein the display processor 124 causes the display of the member profile.
- the display processor 124 can cause the member profile to be displayed, for example, similar to the display illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the display processor 124 can select representative entries within the member profile, for example a name, age, sex, relationship status, location, and interests of the member.
- the display processor 124 can also cause an icon, graphic, picture, or other image associated with the profile to be displayed. Additionally, the display processor 124 can determine a background color for the member profile corresponding to an entry, attribute, rating, or score associated with the member profile.
- the display processor 124 can reflect this by causing the display of a blue background color for the member profile.
- background patters are used instead of colors to indicate profile attributes. According to other embodiments, other distinguishing patterns of suitable features can be used.
- the method 400 proceeds to block 414 , wherein the display processor 124 causes the display of the associated profiles.
- the associated profiles can be displayed, for example, in a display grid similar to the display grid 308 illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the display processor 124 can order the associated profiles based on the ranking determined in block 408 .
- the display processor can cause profiles with a higher ranking to be displayed closer to the center of a display grid.
- “Larry (204)” in the center of the display grid 308 has a higher ranking than “Gaku (11)” in the bottom left of the display grid 308 .
- the ranking can be determined by any suitable method, including any or all of the methods previously discussed.
- the display processor 124 can determine a background color associated with each associated profile indicating an entry association, score, rating, or other feature of the associated profile.
- the display processor 124 can use a threshold number to determine the number of associated profiles to display in a display grid.
- the threshold number can be a set integer, or a variable based in part, for example, on the size of graphics or pictures associated with the profiles, the size of a browser window, the bandwidth, or other limiting capacity, of a network connection between the client device 102 a and the network 106 , a time constraint, performance constraint, or any other suitable factor.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method 500 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the method 500 begins in block 502 , wherein a user profile is identified.
- the user profile can correspond to the profile of the user viewing the social network, such as user 112 a .
- the social network engine 120 identifies a user profile
- the method 500 proceeds to block 504 , wherein the social network engine 120 identifies a member profile.
- the member profile can be, for example, a profile of a member of the social network that the user 112 a desires to learn more about and selects, for example, by clicking on a link to the profile, such as the link “Larry” depicted in FIG. 3 , or by any other suitable method.
- the method 500 proceeds to block 506 , wherein the patch processor 122 determines an association path for the user profile and the member profile determined in blocks 502 and 504 .
- the path processor 122 can determine any suitable type of association path including a shortest association path or a type-specific association path.
- An association path can be determined by determining the fewest number of edges separating associated profiles and then determining the profiles comprising the vertices joined by the edges. For example, in FIG. 2 , the fewest number of edges between profiles A and F is 3, edges 232 , 236 , and 240 .
- the vertices joined by those edges are 202 , 206 , 214 , and 212 .
- the profiles represented by these vertices are profiles A, C, G, and F.
- the association path for profiles A and F can be A, C, G, F.
- Another method of determining an association path is to determine the fewest number of edges of a certain type separating the associated profiles and to then determine the profiles comprising the vertices joined by the edges.
- This method of determining an association path can produce a type-specific association path.
- a type-specific association path is an association path determined based on one particular type of association. For example, in FIG. 2 , the fewest number of friendship associations between profile A and profile E is two—the friendship association comprising edge 220 and the friendship association comprising edge 234 .
- the profiles comprising the vertices 202 , 208 , and 210 joined by the edges are A, D and E.
- the friendship association path determined according to one embodiment of the present invention, is A, D, E.
- Another type-specific association path can also be determined for profiles A and E.
- a common characteristic association path can be determined by determining the fewest number of common characteristic associations separating profile A and profile E.
- there is one common characteristic association comprising edge 218 , separating profiles A and E.
- the common characteristic association path is simply A, E.
- the path processor 122 can also determine a navigation path.
- the navigation path can comprise the path the user 112 a follows to reach a selected member profile.
- the navigation path can be “Orkut,” “Larry,” “Brandon.” The navigation path can thus help the user 112 a visualize the sequence of profiles viewed in reaching a selected member profile.
- the path processor 122 determines an association path, the path processor 122 passes the association path to the display processor 124 .
- the method 500 proceeds to block 508 , wherein the display processor 124 causes the association path to be presented.
- the association path can be presented by displaying the association path on a social network display such as the social network display depicted in FIG. 3 , or by any other suitable method.
- a display of the association path can comprise the names of the members associated with the profiles comprising the association path presented, for example, as links to a detailed view of the profile associated with the name.
- the names can be presented in order of association, for example, in the social network display illustrated in FIG.
