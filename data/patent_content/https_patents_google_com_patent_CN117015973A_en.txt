Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
The present application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No.17/666,459, filed 2/7 at 2022, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Technical Field
The disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for presenting user comments containing timing references in synchronization with media content items.
Background
Users often use websites or applications associated with particular services to view media content (e.g., streaming or downloading media content such as music, television programs, movies, videos, etc.), connect with other users (e.g., via social networking services), perform tasks (e.g., purchase items, edit documents, receive or send messages, etc.).
Such services typically include a section for viewers to submit comments on the media content being consumed. For example, a creator that has uploaded media content to a media sharing service may allow a viewer to submit one or more comments to the uploaded media content, where the submitted comments may be presented with the media content. Comments generally contain the attitudes or reactions of viewers to media content. In some instances, a viewer may react to a particular moment in media content by adding a timestamp of that moment in his comments, as well as any other comments. However, these comments are typically provided linearly in a comment section where comments are displayed in the order in which comments are received from viewers (e.g., most recent comments first) or in the order based on endorsements of comments from other viewers (e.g., most favored comments first). Thus, it can be a burdensome task for a viewer to review a review of video or any other media content submission.
It is therefore desirable to provide new mechanisms for presenting user comments containing timing references in synchronization with media content items.

Detailed Description
In accordance with various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, mechanisms (which may include methods, systems, and media) are provided for presenting user comments containing timing references in synchronization with media content items.
In general, the mechanisms described herein may identify and present comments related to content presented in a media content item. More specifically, in response to associating the comment into a plurality of time windows generated for the media content item and selecting a comment for each of the plurality of time windows (e.g., a top comment for each time window, a first three comments for each time window, etc.), the mechanism may concurrently present the selected one or more comments and the media content item currently in a play position corresponding to the associated time window.
In some embodiments, the mechanism may include retrieving comments associated with the media content item. For example, the mechanism may determine a subset of comments from the retrieved comments, the subset of comments including a timing reference to a portion of the media content item. In another example, the mechanism may determine that each comment in the subset of comments is related to a portion of the media content item. In a more specific example, for a comment for which a reference to a particular time or timestamp is not included within the text portion or body of the comment, the mechanism may determine that the comment in the comment subset relates to a time instant within the media content item (e.g., based on the text portion or body of the comment describing or relating to the time instant occurring in the media content item) and may assign the comment to the timestamp or time window within the media content item corresponding to the time instant.
In some embodiments, the mechanism may determine a series of time windows for the media content item and may assign comments into each of the time windows. For example, the mechanism may generate a series of time windows (e.g., five second windows of video with a two minute duration) based on the duration of the media content item. In continuing with this example, comments may be assigned into each of these time windows based on the associated time reference (e.g., a 5 second time window with a start time of 1:31 and an end time of 1:35 may be assigned to include in the reference video1:32A comment on the text of the play position). In another example, the mechanism may generate the time window based on comment density, engagement data, any other suitable criteria. In yet another example, the mechanism may generate a time window corresponding to a chapter, segment, or other video segment specified within the media content item (e.g., a chapter and chapter start time specified by a creator of the media content item, a segment automatically generated by a machine learning model based on increased user engagement or interesting scenes within the media content item, etc.).
In some embodiments, the mechanism may rank and/or select comments associated with each of the time windows. For example, the mechanism may rank the comments based on relevance to the content presented in the time window, based on engagement data, and so forth. In continuing with this example, the organization may select one or more reviews associated with a particular time window based on the ranking (e.g., the top three reviews based on time windows ranked between 1:00 and 1:05).
The mechanism may then present the timed comment in synchronization with the playing of the media content item. For example, a first comment may be promoted or otherwise presented during presentation of a media content item at an associated first time window, and a second comment may be promoted or otherwise presented during presentation of a media content item at an associated second time window. For example, the timed comments may be presented in response to receiving a user-selected interface element to receive comments synchronized with the playing of the media content item. For example, the comment interface that currently presents comments in the order in which they were received (e.g., the latest comment first) may be updated to present timed comments selected according to the mechanisms described herein. In another example, a comment overlay interface may be generated to present timed comments selected according to the mechanisms described herein, where the comment overlay interface may be positioned adjacent to a media content item (e.g., a comment overlay interface presented below a video, a comment overlay interface positioned within a top of a video, etc.).
These mechanisms may be used for any suitable application. For example, these mechanisms may be used to automatically modify a comment area associated with a media content item to present comments regarding a current timestamp of the media content item without requiring user scrolling. In another example, these mechanisms may be used to identify user-generated content, which refers to a product or service that appears within a media content item. In a more specific example, these mechanisms can be used to present timing references to specific products or services that the creator of the media content item is promoting, with the overlay interface presenting supplemental content associated with the products or services that are related to the time of day in the media content item. In another more specific example, these mechanisms may be used to present timing advertisements or timing sponsorship information during particular portions of a media content item.
Turning to FIG. 1, an example flow diagram of a process 100 for presenting user-submitted ratings containing timing references in synchronization with media content items is shown, according to some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, process 100 may run on a server, such as server 402, and/or a user device, such as user device 406, described below in connection with fig. 4.
It should be noted that process 100 may be performed at any suitable time. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 may be performed by a server in response to receiving a request from a user to play a media content item. In a more specific example, the process 100 can be performed on a server hosting a media content item in response to receiving a request to stream the media content item to a user device. In another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 may be performed periodically in connection with any suitable indexing service that indexes and/or compiles statistics associated with media content items (e.g., viewing counts, praise or any other suitable endorsements, new and/or revised comments, etc.). In yet another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 may be performed when the process 100 (or any other suitable mechanism) detects a new comment associated with a given media content item.
In some embodiments, process 100 may begin at 102 by retrieving comments associated with a media content item or any other suitable user-generated submissions using any suitable technique or combination of techniques. For example, when submitted by a user of a user device (e.g., user device 404 described in connection with fig. 4), comments associated with a media content item (e.g., video that has been uploaded to a media sharing service) may be received at a server device (e.g., server device 402 described in connection with fig. 4). In such examples, process 100 may access, request, and/or retrieve comments from a server device. In a more specific example, in response to transmitting a request that includes a media content identifier that identifies a media content item or a portion of a media content item, a server device may access comments and associated comment information from a comment database. Comment information from the comment database may include a comment identifier that identifies a comment, an author identifier that identifies a user account associated with a user or group of users, a representation of an author that created, modified, and/or posted the comment, a timestamp indicating a time at which the comment was created, content of the comment, a media content identifier that identifies a media content item or a portion of a media content item related to the comment, and so forth. As another example, the comment may be included in metadata associated with the media content item. In such examples, the process 100 may access, request, and/or retrieve comments associated with the media content item concurrently with metadata associated with the media content item (e.g., title of the media content item, description of the media content item, content creator of the media content item, etc.).
In a more specific example, fig. 2 shows an illustrative example 200 in which comments associated with a video are submitted by multiple users, in accordance with some embodiments. As illustrated, comment interface 200 may include any number of comments 201 through 207. Also by way of illustration, comments 201 through 207 associated with a particular video may be presented in the order in which the comments were submitted (e.g., the most recent comment was first).
In some embodiments, the process 100 may identify a subset of the retrieved comments that contains a reference to a particular time within the media content item. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 may identify within the retrieved comments a comment associated with a media content item that includes a timestamp within the comment content (e.g., comment "I see what you did here at1:30(I see you are1:30What is done here), "comment"3:47"etc.). Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the process 100 may identify a comment within the retrieved comment that includes a character indicating a time reference to a location within the media content item, such as including a "@" symbol within the content of the comment (e.g., comment "What is going on here @3:45 (how this is back @3: 45)"). Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the process 100 may identify a comment within the retrieved comment that includes a link to a location within the media content item. For example, comment sections containing links may be distinguished by using one or more of the following techniques: highlighting; underline; bold; italics; presented in different colors; presented in different sizes; using different font presentations, etc.
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the process 100 may identify a subset of the retrieved comments that contain a reference to a particular time within the media content item by determining whether the content of the comments matches, correlates, or is otherwise similar to the audio portion of the particular time in the media content item using any suitable method.
For example, in instances where the comment includes text, the process 100 may compare the text from the comment to the text from the media content item to determine if there is any correlation between the text of the comment and the text of the media content item. For example, if the comment includes a solicitation or a solicited paragraph from the media content item, a relevance may exist. In a more specific example, the process 100 can compare text from the comment to a word record or closed caption data for the media content item to determine whether there is a correlation (e.g., via a comparison with the word record or caption data) between the text of the media content item and a conversation or other word (whether verbal or written) in the media content item.
In another example, in instances where the comment includes text, the process 100 may input the text from the comment into a context model that determines whether the comment refers to or is otherwise related to media content presented within the media content item. For example, the context model may determine that a particular entity is present at a particular time within the media content item (e.g., michael runs in the scene), and may determine that text from the comment refers to the particular entity (e.g., the comment includes the text "The part where he showed Michael running was the best (the portion of his presentation running to Michael is most bar)").
In yet another example, in instances where the comment includes text but does not include a reference to a particular time or timestamp within the comment text, the process 100 may determine whether the comment is related to a time of day when there is no media content item. In a more specific example, the media content item may be input into a machine learning model that identifies key moments within the media content item, and the process 100 may determine whether the comment corresponds to one of the key moments identified within the media content item. In another more specific example, a media content item and user engagement data associated with the media content item may be input into a machine learning model that identifies times within the media content item that correspond to high user engagement (e.g., greater than a particular threshold amount of user engagement), and the process 100 may determine whether the comment corresponds to one of the identified times within the media content item. In some embodiments, the process 100 may determine a degree of correlation between the portion of the comment and the portion of the media content item based on a comparison between the comment data and the media content item. For example, the degree of relevance may indicate how similar (or dissimilar) a portion of the comment is to one or more portions of the media content item. For example, if a reviewer solicits a portion of a media content item, but misspells the terms, the solicitation from the review may be considered to be closely related to the solicited portion of the content item. Alternatively, if the comment has a word (or words) in common with a portion of the media content item, then the portion containing the common word is unlikely to be closely related, except in some instances where the common word is a word unique to the content or a word that is rarely used. In continuing with this example, the comment may be associated with a particular portion of the media content based on a degree of relevance that is greater than a particular threshold.
In some embodiments, a relevance score may be generated for the comment based on a degree of relevance between a portion of the comment and a portion of the media content item. For example, a comment containing a portion that directly solicits or describes a particular portion of a media content item may have a higher score for that portion of the media content item than a comment that does not contain a solicitation from that portion of the media content item. In continuing with this example, comments having a relevance score greater than a particular threshold may be associated with the portion of the media content item.
In yet another example, in instances where the comment includes text, the process 100 may input text from the comment into a text model that predicts whether the comment is related to a time or time location within the media content item. In response, the text model may provide the comment with a score as to whether the comment relates to the media content presented at a particular time location within the media content item.
It should be noted that although the comments are described as containing text, the comments may contain any suitable type of content, such as video or image content, that may be analyzed to extract data using techniques similar to those used to analyze content items to extract data. For example, in instances where the comment includes an image or video segment, the process 100 may compare one or more images within the video segment of the image or comment to image content from the media content item to determine if there is any correlation between the image in the comment and the image content in the media content item. In another example, the process 100 may be implemented to determine whether a product or service promoted by a creator of a media content item corresponds to image content in the media content item. In yet another example, the process 100 may be implemented to determine whether sponsorship information corresponds to image content in a media content item.
It should also be noted that while a subset of search reviews that contain references to particular times within a media content item are identified, this is merely illustrative. For example, a subset of the retrieved reviews may be identified as including a particular keyword, a particular mention of a product or service, or the like. In another example, the process 100 may be used to determine whether a product or service promoted by a creator of a media content item corresponds to a time instant in the media content item, wherein the overlay interface may present supplemental content associated with the product or service related to the time instant in the media content item. In yet another example, the process 100 may be used to determine whether a timed advertisement or a timed sponsorship message corresponds to a moment in a media content item, wherein the overlay interface may provide the timed advertisement or the timed sponsorship message.
In some embodiments, at 104, the process 100 may filter inappropriate and/or negative comments from the subset of retrieved comments that contain references to particular times within the media content item. For example, in some embodiments, the process 100 may filter out comments that contain harassment language, profanity, and/or violate any terms of use, community policies, etc., for facilitating submission of services for comments to media content items. In a more specific example, the process 100 may input a subset of the retrieved reviews into a negative content model that compares text or other content of the reviews, where the negative content model has been trained with a training set of reviews that contain negative content examples (e.g., visceral speech, harassment language, etc.). In another example, in some embodiments, the process 100 may filter out comments that are disliked by other users (e.g., a number of dislikes greater than a particular threshold), reported comments (e.g., in response to selecting a reporting interface element in a comment window), or otherwise marked as comments containing inappropriate content.
In some embodiments, at 106, the process 100 may assign the remaining comments to a time window of the plurality of time windows associated with the media content item. For example, each of the remaining comments may be assigned to a corresponding time window of the media content item based on a reference to a particular time within the media content item.
In a more specific example, the media content items may be divided into a series of time windows based on the duration of the media content items. For example, for video having a 90 second duration, a series of five second time windows may be created for the media content item, with at least one comment assigned to each of the time windows. In continuing with this example, in response to determining that the comment contains a timestamp 0:33 (thirty-three seconds) of the video having a duration of 90 seconds, the comment may be associated with a five second time window having a start time 0:31 (thirty-one seconds) and an end time 0:35 (thirty-five seconds).
It should be noted that the media content item may be divided into time windows using any other suitable data and/or metadata associated with the media content item.
For example, a media content item may be divided into time windows based on video chapters created by the creator of the media content item, advertisement inserts inserted into the media content item, closed caption tracks, and so forth. This may include, for example, a video chapter and chapter start time designed by the creator of the media content item. For example, this may also include video clips or any other suitable segments automatically generated by inputting the media content items into a machine learning model, where the machine learning model may output video clips and associated timestamps based on interesting scenes, increased user engagement, and/or any other suitable criteria.
In another example, the media content items may be partitioned into time windows of different lengths based on the density of the reviews and/or based on engagement data associated with each of the reviews. For example, in response to determining that a high density of comments are associated with a time window, a time window may be generated for the media content item-e.g., between 1:00 and 1:15 and between 1:33 and 1:55 of the media content item, a particular number of comments have been submitted, and the engagement data associated with the comments indicates a particular number of endorsements, shares, endorsements, etc. In continuing with this example, process 100 may generate a time window of the media content item based on the density of the comments or based on the amount of user engagement, where the time window is generated between time windows having a high comment density and/or a high user engagement.
It should be noted that the process 100 may use any suitable method to sort, match, rank, pair, and/or otherwise determine the time windows in the media content items that correspond to the time references in the timing comment. It should also be noted that timing comments may be assigned to more than one time window, for example, in examples where the timing comment contains two or more time stamps or in examples where the timing comment is related to two or more portions of a media content item.
In response to assigning each of the reviews into a time window (e.g., assigning review A1 into a time window spanning 1:00 and 1:05 of the video based on the content of review A1), process 100 may continue to 108 and determine which review or reviews to present when the media content item is presented at a particular time window. For example, for each time window, the process 100 may rank and select comments to be presented to viewers of the media content item in a comment section during playback of the media content item, such as comment { C1} for the time window from T1 to T2, comment { C2} for the time window from T2 to T3, foremost comment { C3, C4, C5} for the time window from T3 to T4, and so forth.
In some embodiments, process 100 may determine that multiple reviews are associated with a particular time window. In response, process 100 may rank the reviews according to any suitable ranking condition. For example, comments associated with a particular time window may be ranked by relevance to media content presented in the particular time window. In a more specific example, as described above, each comment may be associated with a degree of relevance or a relevance score for the portion of the media content, and each comment may be ranked (e.g., from a highest relevance score to a lowest relevance score) by the degree of relevance or the relevance score. In continuing with this example, a particular number of top-ranked reviews may be associated with a particular time window (e.g., the review with the highest relevance score, the top three reviews with the highest relevance score, each review with a relevance score greater than a particular threshold, etc.).
The process 100 may associate a video identifier (e.g., video ID 123456) with a plurality of time window identifiers (e.g., timestamp id_1, timestamp id_2, etc.) in a video index and, for each time window identifier, with one or more comments (e.g., comment id_1 and comment feature, comment id_2 and comment feature, etc.). In response to transmitting a query including the video identifier to the video index, the video index may return one or more comments that may be presented during presentation of the media content in each time window of the video.
It should be noted that any suitable number of comments may be selected for each time window. For example, for a time window with a comment density greater than a certain threshold (e.g., a high comment density), additional comments may be selected as opposed to a time window with a low comment density in the time window (e.g., one comment is selected for time window a with a low comment density and three comments are selected for time window B with a high comment density). In another example, for a time window in which engagement data indicates that a viewer has approved comments in the time window (e.g., comments in the time window have more than a certain threshold number of praise), as opposed to a time window having engagement data indicating that a viewer has not reacted to comments in the time window, additional comments may be selected (e.g., one comment is selected for time window a having a comment with low engagement and three comments are selected for time window B having a comment with high engagement).
It should also be noted that process 100 may perform this selection of comments for each time window associated with a media content item and may determine that any suitable number (including zero) of timed comments occur in any suitable number of time windows.
At 110, the process 100 may cause the selected comment to be presented at the assigned time window during presentation of the media content item. For example, the selected comment may be presented in the comment interface concurrently with the presentation of the media content item. In another example, the selected one or more comments may be presented in an overlay interface with the media content item (e.g., a comment overlay interface presented below the video, a comment overlay interface positioned within the top of the video, a comment advance notice interface including a single selected comment positioned near the video on the video viewing page, etc.).
In some embodiments, process 100 may display the selected comment separately from the comment that was not identified at 102 as containing the timing reference. For example, in some embodiments, selected comments corresponding to a particular play position in a media content item may be presented in a comment interface located below the video on a video viewing page. In some embodiments, the process 100 may cause the user interface to display the timed comment at the determined time window in any suitable order, including in the order determined by the ranking in 108. In some embodiments, process 100 may cause only a portion of the timed reviews in a given time window (e.g., the first 3 most relevant reviews in the high review section) to be displayed.
At 112, in some embodiments, the process 100 may update the display of the timed comment as the presentation of the media content item proceeds. For example, after a first five second duration containing one timed comment, process 100 may cause the timed comment display to be updated with any suitable number of timed comments that have been selected and associated with a second five second continuous time of the video.
In some embodiments, process 100 may provide reviewers with an opportunity to compose timed reviews when viewing timed reviews associated with media content items. For example, a reviewer may create a new comment with a timing reference and, in response, the new comment may be associated with a time window of the media content item and may be ranked relative to the comment associated with the particular time window. In another example, in response to creating a new comment with a timing reference, process 100 may indicate that such new comment is to be considered a timing comment, and process 100 may determine whether the new comment is to be selected as a top comment associated with a particular time window of the media content item. In yet another example, in response to creating a new comment with a timing reference, process 100 may indicate that such new comment is to be selected as the top comment for a particular time window based on the ranking and/or selection performed in 108.
In some embodiments, process 100 may remove the timed comment displayed in 110 and/or may determine that no timed comment is to be presented in association with a subsequent time window. In some embodiments, process 100 may take any suitable action, such as not displaying timing comments for the duration of the time window, continuing to present timing comments from one or more previous time windows, presenting timing comments associated with an upcoming time window, and/or any other suitable action.
Note that while process 100 may display timed reviews in 110 and 112, in some embodiments process 100 may cause non-timed reviews to be displayed in 110 and 112, as shown and discussed below in connection with fig. 3A and 3B. In some embodiments, any other suitable mechanism may determine when and how to display comments that are not included in the timed comment identified in 102 of process 100.
Turning to FIG. 3A, an illustrative example 300 of a display screen containing comments having timing references synchronized with media content items is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As illustrated, in some embodiments, the display 300 may include a media content item 310 at a play time 312, a closed caption 314, a comment interface 315, and a timed comment interface. In some embodiments, the comments in comment interface 315 and the comments in timed comment interface 320 may be submitted by a user with a user account, as discussed in connection with FIG. 2. In some embodiments, any suitable device may be used to present display 300, such as user device 406 discussed below in FIG. 4.
In some embodiments, the media content items 310 may be any suitable songs, videos, clips, and/or other media content items. In some embodiments, the media content item 310 may be streamed from a remote content source or stored locally for playback. For example, in some embodiments, the media content item 310 may be a social media post that includes a video portion and an audio portion. In another example, in some embodiments, the media content item 310 may be a podcast downloaded and/or streamed from a podcast feed.
In some embodiments, the play time 312 may be included in the display screen 300. For example, as shown in FIG. 3A, the current play time 312 is 1 minute 30 seconds of the total media content item duration of 18 minutes 5 seconds. In some embodiments, the play time 312 may be omitted from the display screen 300 and may be included in the metadata of the media content item 310. In some embodiments, the play time 312 may be formatted in any suitable time format.
In some embodiments, the closed captioning 314 may be automatically created by the text generation program and/or may be included by the media content creator with the media content item 310. In some embodiments, the closed captioning 314 may be omitted from the display screen 300. In some embodiments, the closed captioning 314 may be stored in metadata included in the media content item 310 and may be used to identify timing references in user-submitted comments, as discussed above in connection with fig. 1.
In some embodiments, display screen 300 may include comments in comment interface 315, where a comment may be any comment that does not contain an identified timing reference. In some embodiments, the comments in comment interface 315 may be displayed in any suitable order, such as most relevant, most recent, oldest, etc. In some embodiments, any suitable number of comments may be included in comment interface 315. In some embodiments, comment interface 315 may be omitted.
In some embodiments, timed comment interface 320 may includeIncluding any suitable comments that include timing references. In some embodiments, any suitable method may be used to identify the comments displayed in timed comment interface 320, such as process 100 described above in connection with FIG. 1. As illustrated, timed comment interface 320 includes comment 202, comment 201, and comment 207. As discussed above in connection with FIG. 2, comment 202 includes a 1 minute 30 second @ comment1:30) Comment 201 includes 1 minute 29 seconds @ of1:29) And comment 207 includes a reference that matches or is otherwise related to the content presented at time stamp 312. In some embodiments, comments 202, 201, and 207 may be included in timed comment interface 320 based on a time window determined during process 100, as discussed above in fig. 1. For example, in some embodiments, timestamp 312 may be referenced in comments 202 and 201. In another example, in some embodiments, comment 207 may be included in timing comment 320 based on an identification (via process 100 and/or any other suitable method) that text submitted by a user in comment 207 substantially overlaps with the audio track at closed captioning 314 and/or timestamp 312.
In some embodiments, timed comment interface 320 may include any suitable number of comments. For example, timed comment interface 320 may present a single comment for a particular amount of time-e.g., a top comment for an entire 10 second time window of a media content item. In continuing with this example, in instances where multiple reviews are ranked and selected for a particular time window, timed review interface 320 may be configured to present a first review for five seconds (e.g., the highest ranked review for that time window) and a second review for the next five seconds (e.g., the review with the next highest ranking).
In some embodiments, where multiple reviews are presented within timed review interface 320, timed review interface 320 may display the reviews in any suitable order, such as most relevant, most recent, oldest, etc.
In addition to or as an alternative to presenting comment interface 315 and timed comment interface 320, display screen 300 may also present a timed comment interface in response to receiving a selected preference from a user of display screen 300. For example, display screen 300 may include a timed comment interface element that, when selected, replaces a comment interface, such as the comment interface shown in FIG. 2, in which comments are presented in the order in which they were received, in timed comment interface 320, the selected comment associated with a particular time window is presented concurrently with the media content item.
In addition to or as an alternative to presenting comment interface 315 and timed comment interface 320, display screen 300 may present timed comment interface 320 as an overlay interface. For example, the selected timed comment associated with a time window corresponding to a particular play position in the media content item may be presented as an overlay under the media window or in the top of the media content item (e.g., when the media content item is being played in full screen mode).
In some embodiments, the timed comment interface 320 may be updated, changed, altered, and/or remain unchanged as the media content item 310 progresses. For example, in some embodiments, once the media content item 310 progresses beyond the time referenced in the comments 202, 201, and 207, the timed comment interface 320 may remove the comments 202, 201, 207 from the display screen 300. In another example, as shown in display 350 of fig. 3B, media content item 310 may display comment 204 at play time 352, where comment 204 includes a 6 minutes 35 seconds timestamp. In some embodiments, comment 204 may be included in timed comment interface 320 based on a time window determined during process 100, as discussed above in FIG. 1. For example, in some embodiments, a timestamp 352 or a timestamp within a window (e.g., a timestamp 352 of 5 seconds) may be included in comment 204.
In some embodiments, the play time 352 may be included in the display screen 350. For example, as shown, the play time 352 is 6 minutes 34 seconds of the total media content item duration of 18 minutes 5 seconds. In some embodiments, the play time 352 may be omitted from the display screen 350 and/or may be included in metadata of the media content item 310. In some embodiments, the play time 352 may be formatted in any suitable time format.
In some embodiments, closed captions 354 may be automatically created by the text generation program and/or may be included by the media content creator with the media content item 310. In some embodiments, closed captioning 354 may be omitted from display 350. In some embodiments, closed captions 354 may be stored in metadata included with media content item 310 and/or may be used to identify timing references in user-submitted comments, as discussed above in connection with fig. 1.
