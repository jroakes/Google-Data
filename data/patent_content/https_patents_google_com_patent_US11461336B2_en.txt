Definitions
- Search results are provided by Internet search engines in response to a user's search query.
- Some search engines tailor search results to locations derived from the text of a user's query. For example, if a user searches for “pizza new york,” a search engine could look for search results for “pizza” in the location “new york” or “pizza new” in the location “york.”
- Some search engines tailor the search results to an inferred location of interest to the user, rather than a location derived from the query.
- Example inferred locations of interest are the current location of a user (e.g., estimated from the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address) or the location represented by a map displayed to a user at the time he or she enters a search query.
- IP Internet Protocol
- a search engine selects between location-specific sets of search results specific to inferred locations of interest to a user and a global set of search results that are not specific to any inferred location of interest.
- the search engine generates at least one location-specific set of search results and a global set of search results, generates one or more scores measuring the quality, responsiveness, or geographic qualities of each set, and selects between the global set and the location-specific set according to the scores.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a query and a location identifier identifying a geographic location; obtaining a location-specific set of search results responsive to the query and a global set of search results responsive to the query, wherein the location-specific set of search results is specific to the associated geographic location for the query and the global set of search results is not specific to the associated geographic location for the query; determining a cluster score for the global set of search results, wherein the cluster score is a measure of how geographically clustered entities associated with the global set of search results are; selecting either the global set of search results or the location-specific set of search results as a primary set of search results according to one or more scores for the location-specific and global sets of search results, wherein the one or more scores include the cluster score; and identifying one or more identified search results in the primary set of search results for presentation in response to the query.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured
- the associated geographic location is a geographic location determined to be of interest to a user based on information that does not include text of the query.
- the actions further include presenting the one or more identified search results.
- the actions further include selecting a secondary set of search results, and presenting a selectable user interface element that, when activated by a user, causes the system to present the secondary set of search results.
- the query is received from a user through a map-based search user interface, and presenting the primary set of search results comprises presenting the primary set of search results in the map-based user interface.
- the one or more scores for the location-specific and global sets of search results further include one or more responsiveness scores that each estimate how responsive one of the sets of search results is to the query.
- the one or more scores for the location-specific and global sets of search results further include one or more quality scores that each estimate a quality of the search results in each results set.
- the one or more scores for the location-specific and global sets of search results further include one or more scores derived from an estimate of a physical distance between search results in one of the sets of search results and the associated geographic location for the query.
- Selecting either the global set of search results or the location-specific set of search results as a primary set of search results comprises selecting the global set of search results if the clustering score for the global set of search results indicates that a pre-determined percentage of entities associated with search results in the global set of search results are physically located within a pre determined distance of each other. Selecting either the global set of search results or the location-specific set of search results further comprises only selecting the global set of search results if an aggregate distance between search results in the global set of search results and the inferred location is greater than a first threshold. Selecting either the global set of search results or the location-specific set of search results further comprises only selecting the global set of search results if at least one of the search results in the global set of search results has a name that matches the query.
- Selecting either the global set of search results or the location-specific set of search results further comprises only selecting the global set of search results if a top ranked result of the global set of search results is different from a top ranked result of the location-specific set of search results. Selecting either the global set of search results or the location-specific set of search results further comprises only selecting the global set of search results if the query does not match a category associated with search results in the global set of search results.

- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example method for selecting a primary set of search results.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example user interface 100 depicting search results 102 a , 102 b , and 102 c and their corresponding locations on a map 104 .
- the search results 102 a , 102 b , and 102 c were generated by a search engine, the operation of which will be described below, in response to the query “patxi's pizza,” 106 , entered by a user using a computer physically located in New York City while viewing a map of New York City.
- the map 104 presented in response to the search query depicts the San Francisco Bay area, and the search results 102 a , 102 b , and 102 c are for businesses in the San Francisco Bay area.
- the user interface 100 also includes a hyperlink 108 with the text “Did You Mean: patxi's pizza new york, new york.” If a user selects this hyperlink 108 , e.g., with a mouse or other input device, search results for the New York City are will be displayed.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example search system 200 that can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 200 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- the search system 200 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- a user 202 interacts with the search system 200 through a client device 204 .
- the client device 204 can be a computer coupled to the search system 200 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- the search system 200 and the client device 204 can be one machine.
- a user can install a desktop search application on the client device 204 .
- the client device 204 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 206 and a processor 208 .
- RAM random access memory
- the user 202 submits a query 210 to a search engine 212 that is a module of the search system 200 .
- the query 210 is transmitted through a network to the search engine 212 .
- the search engine 212 When the query 210 is received by the search engine 212 , the search engine 212 generates multiple sets of search results that are each responsive to the query. The search engine then selects one of the sets of search results as a primary results set 214 , which is returned to the user 202 through the network. The search engine 212 generates and selects from one or more location-specific results sets that are specific to particular inferred locations of interest to the user (“inferred locations”) and a global results set that is not specific to any particular location. A set of search results is specific to a particular location if the search results are filtered so that only search results within a predetermined distance of the location are included in the set.
- the search engine 212 either returns location-specific search results to the user, or returns more general global search results to the user. In some implementations, the search engine 212 only generates the global results set when there is no reference to a location, e.g., no city name, state name, zip code, etc. in the text of the query 210 .
- Each inferred location is a location determined to be of interest to the user based on something other than the text of the query 210 itself. For example, when the user 202 is submitting a search through a map interface, one example inferred location is the location shown on the map. As another example, an inferred location can be a location estimated from an Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with the user 202 . As yet another example, an inferred location can be a physical location of the client device 204 . The physical location of the client device 204 can be determined, for example, using Global Positioning System (GPS) data, cell phone tower triangulation, or other conventional location-determination methods.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- the inferred location can be a location determined from past searches performed by the user 202 . For example, if the past five queries the user 202 has submitted to the search system 200 reference New York or things located in New York, an inferred location of interest to the user is New York.
- the inferred location can be a default location specified by the user.
- the size of the location is dependent on the technique used to infer the location. For example, if GPS data is used to infer the location, the size of the location can be the area in which the GPS data indicates the user is located. If the default location is specified by the user, then the size of the location is whatever is specified by the user.
- the location would be the entire state of California. If the user specifies San Francisco, Calif., the location would be the city of San Francisco. If the user specifies a particular zip code within San Francisco, Calif., the location would be that zip code.
- the search engine 212 determines whether to search an entity index 216 to generate the sets of search results for each inferred location and to generate the global results set, or whether to perform a conventional document search. In some implementations, the system makes the determination according to whether the user specified that an entity search should be performed, for example, because the user indicated that a search should be done over map data. If the user does specify that an entity search should be performed, the system performs the entity search. In other implementations, the system makes the determination according to the type of user interface through which the user 202 submitted the search query 210 . For example, if the user submits the query through a user interface, such as the maps user interface illustrated in FIG.
- the system determines to search the entity index 216 .
- the system makes the determination according to features of the query. For example, if the query has previously submitted more than a pre-determined threshold number of times by users through a map user interface, the system can search the entity index 216 even if the query 210 is not submitted through a map user interface.
- the search engine 212 always searches the entity index 216 .
- the entity index 216 includes records for individual entities. Each entity is a place or thing of interest. Example entities are businesses, landmarks, and events. For example, the restaurant Patxi's Pizza in Palo Alto, Calif. is an entity, the landmark the Statue of Liberty is an entity, and the event Bay to Breakers is an entity. Each search result in the search results set corresponds to one of the entities in the entity data.
- the records for the entities can include various types of information.
- the record for a given entity can include one or more of the following pieces of information: name, location, type, category, number of reviews, representative document, and number of documents referring to the entity.
- the location of an entity is a physical location associated with the entity. For example, if a business is located at 12345 Anywhere St., the address 12345 Anywhere St. would be its location.
- the type of an entity is, for example, whether it is a business, a landmark, or an event.
- the category of an entity is a label that has been assigned to the entity.
- a restaurant that serves pizza could have the category “restaurant” or “pizzeria.”
- the categories can be manually assigned or automatically derived from an analysis of information about the entity, e.g., using conventional methods such as classifiers trained using machine learning.
- the representative document for an entity is a web page (or other document) that is closely associated with the entity.
- a restaurant homepage could be the representative document for the restaurant entity.
- the entity index 216 is created, for example, by the search system 200 .
- the search system crawls documents, for example, on the Internet, and identifies information relevant to individual entities. This information is aggregated on an entity-by-entity basis to generate the entity index 216 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example method 300 for selecting and presenting a primary results set in response to a user query.
- the method 300 is described in reference to a system of one or more computers that performs the method.
- the system can be, for example, the search system 200 described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system receives a query and one or more location identifiers ( 302 ).
- Each location identifier is a representation of a geographic location.
- each location identifier can be latitude and longitude coordinates, a name of a city, county, or state, a zip code, or data referencing one of these.
- the one or more locations can be, for example, inferred locations derived from information other than the text of the query.
- the query is received from a user device, e.g., a personal computer running a web browser, and the one or more inferred locations are generated by the system in response to receiving the query.
- the system obtains sets of search results responsive to the query ( 304 ).
- the sets of search results include at least one location-specific set of search results and a global set of search results.
- the system obtains the sets of search results by searching a repository of information, e.g., the entity index 216 described above with reference to FIG. 2 , to select and rank search results that are responsive to the query.
- the system ranks search results according to scores it assigns to the search results.
- the system can select and rank search results, for example, using conventional techniques.
- the search results in each set are filtered so that only search results having a score above a particular threshold are selected and ranked.
- the system identifies the location-specific set of search results by performing a location-specific search that only identifies search results that are both responsive to the query and for entities within a predetermined distance of the location associated with the query. For example, the system can score each search result according to a function of distance from the location, and optionally other conventional factors, for example, responsiveness and quality. If the distance is greater than a threshold, the score goes to zero, indicating the search result should be omitted.
- the system uses a different function that never reaches zero when scoring and selecting the global search results.
- this different scoring function does not take location into account.
- the search results can be scored according to conventional quality and relevance factors, without regard to distance from a location.
- this different scoring function is relative to a location. For example, if there is just one inferred location, the system can score the global search results according to their distance from the inferred location. If there are multiple inferred locations, the system can calculate scores for the search results for each inferred location, and then select the maximum score, or the average score, for each search result. Alternatively, if there are multiple inferred locations, the system can select the most-likely inferred location and calculate the score of the global search results according to their distance from the most-likely inferred location.
- the system can determine that Palo Alto is the most-likely inferred location for the user. In other words, the system can select the location that appears the most frequently in the inferred locations for the user as the most-likely inferred location. Scoring the search results according to the relative distance from one or more of the inferred locations for the user causes the search results to be ranked, based in part, on their distance from a user.
- the system performs one search for search results satisfying the query, and then groups the search results into local results sets based on their relative distance from the inferred locations to generate the results sets.
- the system can also generate a global results set from the search results.
- the system selects a primary results set from the sets of search results ( 306 ).
- An example method for selecting a primary results set is described below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the system identifies search results in the primary results set as search results to be presented in response to the query ( 308 ). For example, the system can select a pre-determined number of top-scoring search results in the primary search results set, can select all search results in the primary search results set that have a score that satisfies a threshold, or can select all of the search results in the primary results set.
- the system presents the identified search results in response to the query ( 310 ).
- the system presents the identified search results by transmitting the search results to a client device for presentation to a user.
- the search results can be presented as search results in a conventional search results page, or on a map interface, for example, the map interface illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the system also selects one or more secondary results sets from the sets of search results, for example, as described below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the secondary results sets are results sets that are not determined to be as relevant to the user's query as the primary results set, but that are determined to have at least some relevance.
- the system presents a user selectable user interface element, e.g., a hyperlink or a button, corresponding to the selected secondary search results set or sets.
- the system presents a user selectable user interface element for each secondary results set. When a user activates the element for a particular secondary results set, e.g., by clicking on or otherwise selecting it, the system causes the particular secondary results sets to be presented to the user.
- the system presents a hyperlink with the text, “Did you mean” followed by the query plus the location associated with the corresponding selected secondary search results in a particular set.
- the system presents the secondary search results.
- the system presents a single selectable user interface element for all of the one or more secondary results sets.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example method 400 for selecting a primary set of search results.
- the method 400 is described in reference to a system of one or more computers that performs the method.
- the system can be, for example, the search system 400 described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system obtains sets of search results ( 402 ).
- the sets of search results include a location-specific set of search results and a global set of search results.
- the sets of search results are represented, for example, as sets of identifiers referring to records in a repository, e.g., the entity index 216 .
- Each set of search results is responsive to a query.
- the sets of search results include a global set of search results and a location-specific set of search results.
- the sets of search results can be obtained, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system determines one or more scores for each set of search results ( 404 ).
- the scores for each set of search results include one or more quality scores that estimate a quality of the search results in each set in general, and one or more responsiveness scores that estimate how responsive the search results in each set are to the query.
- the system can also generate other scores, including, for example, a clustering score that estimates how geographically clustered entities associated with a set of search results are, and a distance score derived from the distance between the physical location of the entity for each search result in a given set and a location associated with the user. These scores can be generated for all of the sets of search results or for just the global sets of search results.
- the system determines the one or more quality scores for each results set from individual scores estimating the quality of individual search results in the set. For example, the system can derive an individual quality score from the amount of information available for each result in the results set, for example, the number of reviews or documents associated with the result.
- the system can also receive a quality score along with each search result, e.g., from the search engine.
- the system aggregates the individual quality scores for the search results in the set, or for some pre-determined number of results in the set, e.g., the top ten ranked search results, to determine quality scores for the set of search results as a whole. For example the system can sum or average the individual quality scores for the search results.
- the system determines the one or more responsiveness scores for each results set from individual responsiveness scores estimating how responsive the individual search results in each results set are to the query. For example, the system can derive a responsiveness score for a given search result from whether the query matches the name of the entity associated with the search result. For example, if the query is “patxi's” and the name of entity associated with a search result is “Patxi's Pizza,” then the responsiveness score could have a value indicating that the query matches the name of the entity. As another example, the system can derive a responsiveness score for a given search result from whether words in reviews or other documents associated with the entity for the search result match the words in the query. This can be a binary score, or a score that indicates the number of matches.
- the system can derive a responsiveness score for a given search result from whether the words in the query match a category associated with the search result. For example, if the query is “pizzeria” and a search result is for a business categorized as being a “pizzeria,” the score can have a value indicating that the query matches a category for the entity.
- the responsiveness score for a given search result can be a score for the search result received from the search engine that identified the search result.
- the system aggregates the individual scores of the search results in the set, or for some pre-determined number of results in the set, e.g., the top ten ranked search results, to determine responsiveness scores for the set of search results as a whole. For example the system can sum or average the individual scores.
- the clustering score for a results set is a measure of how geographically clustered entities associated with the results set are.
- the system considers either all of the search results in the results set, or a number of top-scoring search results, for example, according to the scores used by a search engine to rank the search results.
- the system then derives the clustering score from the distribution of the physical locations of entities corresponding to the search results.
- the clustering score could be the percentage of search results for entities physically located within a pre-determined radius of each other, or the radius needed to encompass a pre-determined percentage of the entities associated with the search results.
- Other conventional metrics of the degree of clustering of the locations can alternatively be used.
- the system derives a clustering score for the global set of search results and does not derive a clustering score for any of the location-specific sets of search results. In other implementations, the system derives a clustering score for all of the sets of search results.
- the system derives the distance score from the distance between the physical location of the entity for each search result in a given set and a location associated with the user, for example, one or more of the inferred locations for the user. If there is just one inferred location, the system can use the distance between the physical entity for search results in a given set and the one inferred location. If there are multiple inferred locations, the system can derive a distance score for each inferred location, and then select the maximum score, or the average score, for each search result. Alternatively, if there are multiple inferred locations, the system can select the most likely inferred location, for example, as described above, and calculate the distance score for that inferred location.
- the system can use an aggregate of these individual distances, for example, a sum or an average, as a score for the results set as a whole.
- the system can use an aggregate of a subset of the individual distances, for example, a number of smallest distances, or the distances for a number of top-scoring search results, e.g., according to scores provided by the search engine.
- the system rather than generating all of the scores described above, the system generates a subset of the scores. For example, the system could generate responsiveness and clustering scores, but not quality and distance scores, for the sets of search results.
- the system compares the scores for each set of search results to determine whether one set of search results is substantially better than the other sets of search results ( 406 ).
- One set of search results is substantially better than the other sets of search results if it is the highest scoring set of search results according to an overall score derived from one or more of the scores described above, and there is at least a threshold drop-off between its overall score and the overall score of the next highest scoring set of search results.
- the threshold drop-off can be a pre-determined amount or a pre-determined percentage of the score of the top scoring search result.
- the system can determine an overall score for each set of search results from the responsiveness scores for the sets of search results.
- the system can use an overall score derived from whether the search results in each set are for entities having names that match the query and the percentage of search results in each set that fall within a predefined radius.
- Another example overall score can be derived from a distance between locations mentioned in documents associated with the entities in each of the results sets and an inferred location of the user. If many of the documents that are associated with the entity only mention locations that are far away from the inferred location of the user, then it is less likely that the result set is good.
- Other overall scores can be determined, for example, empirically.
- the system selects that search result ( 410 ). Otherwise, the system determines whether to select the global results set based on the clustering score for the global results set ( 412 ). In general, if the clustering score indicates that the global set of search results are clustered around a single location, then the system will be more likely to select the global search results. Tightly clustered global search results indicate that a specific entity responsive to the query exists somewhere other than at any of the inferred locations.
- the system uses the clustering score for the global set of search results along with other scores for the sets of search results to make the selection. For example, the system can select the global set of search results when the search results in the global set of results are far away from any of the inferred locations for the user, the search results in the global set of search results are clustered around a geographic location, and the search query matches the name of at least one entity corresponding to one of the search results in the global search result sets.
- the system can require that the aggregate distance between (i) search results in the global set of search results and (ii) an inferred location of the user exceeds a threshold, that a pre-determined percentage of entities associated with the search results in the global search results set are physically located within a pre-determined radius of each other, and that at least one of the search results in the set have a name that matches the words of the query. If the system does not select the global set of search results the system can select, for example, the top-scoring set of location-specific search results according to one of the scoring methods described above.
- search results are compared two sets of search results for the query “garyrocho,” a restaurant in San Francisco, Calif.
- One set of search results is a location-specific set of search results corresponding to the query “garyrocho” and the inferred location New York City.
- the search results in this location-specific set of search results are scattered across New York City and correspond to restaurants that have been compared to Gary Danko in user reviews and other websites.
- the other set of search results is a global set of search results corresponding to the query “garyrocho” with no requirement that search results be located near a particular location.
- the system will determine that the distance between New York and San Francisco satisfies the threshold, the search results in the global set of search results are clustered around San Francisco, since there is only one search result in the set, and that the name of the restaurant “Gary Danko” matches the query text.
- the system will select the global set of search results as the primary set of search results in response to these determinations.
- the system can additionally implement other conditions that have to be satisfied before the system selects the global search results. For example, the system can require that the first results in the set of global search results be non-categorical in nature. To make this determination, the system can use the score described above that indicates whether the words in the query match a category associated with one or more of the first search results in the set. If the score indicates that the words in the query match a category for one or more of the first search results, the set of search results can be determined to be categorical. In some implementations, a threshold number of search results, e.g., a number greater than a pre-determined number or a pre-determined percent of the search results, must be categorical for the results set to be classified as categorical.
- a threshold number of search results e.g., a number greater than a pre-determined number or a pre-determined percent of the search results, must be categorical for the results set to be classified as categorical.
- the system can require that the query was not for a chain of businesses.
- the system can determine that the query is for a chain of businesses, for example, from a percentage of the top-ranked search results responsive to the query that are in the same domain. If the percentage exceeds a threshold, then the query is determined to be for a chain of businesses. For example, if nine of the top ten search results for the query “best buy” are from the domain “http://www.bestbuy.com,” then the system can determine that Best Buy is likely a chain.
- the system can compare the top ranked search result from each set, according to the ranking assigned to the search results by the search engine. If the top ranked search result from the global set of search results matches one of the top ranked location-specific search results, the system does not select the global set of search results, but instead selects the matching set of location-specific search results as the primary set of search results.
- the system does not select the global results set, but instead selects one of the location-specific sets of search results.
- the system combines the scores to generate an overall score for each set of search results, and then selects the set of search results with the best overall score as the primary search result.
- the scores used, and the way the scores are combined can be determined, for example, empirically. In general, the scores and the way of combining the scores are determined so that location-specific sets of search results that have the same responsiveness and quality as global search results will score better than the global search results. In other words, the global set of search results is used only if it is substantially better in some respects than all of the location-specific sets of search results.
- the system also selects one or more secondary sets of search results.
- the system can select the one or more secondary sets of search results by performing the analysis described above for all of the remaining sets of search results, excluding the primary set of search results.
- the system lowers the thresholds for selecting sets of search results. For example, when selecting the secondary search results, the system can select the global set of search results even if the global set of search results are not tightly clustered. As another example, the system can use a smaller threshold for determining whether a particular set of search results is substantially better than the other sets of search results.
