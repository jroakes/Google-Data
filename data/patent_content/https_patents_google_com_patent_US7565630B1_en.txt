Definitions
- This invention relates in general to online search engines, and in particular to customization of search results.
- search engines can quickly retrieve specific documents that match the terms of the query.
- Web site operators often contract with a search engine provider to obtain an interface to the search engine on the operator's website. This allows users who are on the operator's website to perform a search of the entire internet from a search box on website. Conventionally, these searches will return the same results as if they were done directly from the web site of the search engine provider, in that they do not reflect any influence on the results in view of the contents or theme of the website, or the interests of the website operator.
- a general search on “giants” will typically return search results oriented to giants.
- the site operator would prefer to customize the search results to reflect the interests of users of the site, who presumably are interested in baseball.
- the generalized search instead returned results oriented towards the San Francisco Giants baseball team.
- the present invention provides allows a site operator specify a set of interests or topics which will influence the presentation of search results provided by general search engine in response to queries received the website of the operator.
- the present invention has multiple embodiments, including a system for providing a search engine, a methodology for processing a search query, and a site operator interface for the site operator to specify topics, and the degree of influence such topics have on search results.
- the present invention provides a mechanism for customizing search results provided by a general search engine in response to queries received from the site operator's website.
- a general search engine is a search engine that performs a search on a generalized corpus such as the Internet and World Wide Web, and not limited to the contents of the site operator's website; a search essentially limited to the content of the site operator's site is called a site specific search.
- the site operator provides a set of interests, for example as a set of topics or categories from a topical hierarchy or directory, which reflect the interests of the site operator or the expected users of the site operator's website. For example a site operator of a sports oriented website may choose topics such as “baseball,” “football,” “basketball”, etc. as topics of interest.
- these topics are stored in a site profile associated with the site operator's website; alternatively the site profile can be stored at the search engine website.
- the interests are encoded as parameters (e.g., topic IDs) that are stored with the code for the search query interface on the site operator's website, and passed to the general search engine as query string parameters, along with the search query terms, when a search query is entered in the search query box by a user. This approach may be described as runtime passing of the site operator's site profile.
- the interests can be extracted by keyword analysis of one or more web pages on the site operator's website to identify topical keywords; by link analysis of one or more web pages on the site operator's website or that link to the website; by analysis of site-to-site browsing of users who access the website; by analysis of prior search queries done on the site operator's website.
- any attribute of the site operator's website can be used to define the interests of the site operator.
- the site operator can also specify the degree to which the site profile influences the search results from a search.
- the site operator provides one or more web pages on its website that include a search query interface to the general search engine, such as a search query box.
- a user visiting the website can input a search query to the general search engine via this search query interface.
- the general search engine either retrieves the site profile (which contains the interests of the site operator) or receives the site profile in the query string parameters. In either case, the general search engine retrieves documents that are relevant to the query terms and presents these as search results.
- the search results are ranked according to the site operator's interests, as expressed in the site profile. Thus, the results that more relevant to the interests of the site operator will have a higher placement in the overall presentation of the search results.
- the ranking of search results operates to increase the relevance score of documents that are associated with topic directory.
- Each topic in the directory is associated with a group of documents (e.g., websites) that are deemed relevant to the topic.
- a weight equivalently, a “boost”
- the boost value may be understood as a scaling factor that represents the relevance of the site to the topic.
- the document's relevance score is adjusted by the weight, if any, of that website with respect to the topic.
- the adjustment may be, for example by multiplying the relevance score by the boost value, thereby scaling the relevance of the document to the query.
- boost value a value that assigns a higher priority to the search results.
- the site operator can specify the degree of influence that the site profile has on the search results. This is done by using a customization control, which allows the site operator to specify a degree of influence from 0% to 100%.
- the input of the degree of influence can be textual (e.g., input of a number) or graphical.
- the ranking of the documents in accordance with their boosted relevance scores is then a function of the degree of influence, either from no influence (where the boost value has no effect on the relevance score) to complete influence, wherein boost value for a document is applied 100% to the document's relevance score, and any number of intermediate levels of application.
- the site operator can thus control the degree by which the site profile influences the ranking of documents in the search results by adjusting the position of the customization control.
- a system embodiment includes a topic directory for providing topics (categories) to a site operator, a general search engine and index for searching indexed websites in response to a query received from a search query interface on the site operator's website, and in one embodiment, customization component for allowing the site operator to specify a degree of influence that the site profile will have determining the rankings of the search results to the search query.
- a site operator interface embodiment includes a topical directory, with various topics, and graphical controls (e.g., checkboxes) in which the site operator can select topics of interests, and, in one embodiment, a control that allows the site operator to adjust the search result ranking in accordance with his site profile.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a third party website of a site operator including search query interface to a general search engine.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a topical directory
- FIG. 3 further illustrates the topical directory, including various subtopics.
- FIG. 4 further illustrates various subtopics of the topical directory.
- FIG. 5 illustrates s software architecture and associated dataflow for one embodiment.
- FIG. 1 there is shown a page 100 of site operator's website, including a search query interface to a general search engine.
- the general search engine is operated at a different website provided by a search engine operator than the site operator's website.
- a site operator's website will also be referred to herein as a “third party website,” as it is a third party with respect to the general search engine operator.
- the page 100 includes a query entry field 102 in which a user who is visiting the third party website can enter the terms of a search query.
- a search button 106 submits the query to the general search engine for processing.
- the site operator defines a site profile via an interface provided by the general search engine operator.
- a topical directory 202 that may be provided by general search engine operator to the third party site operator to define a site profile.
- the site operator uses the topical directory in order to identify the topics or interests to be used for customizing searches on the third party website.
- FIG. 2 shows the top level topics 204 of a topical directory 202 .
- the topics in the directory can be, for example, the topics defined in the Open Directory Project, found at http://dmoz.org/ or can be some other topical directory.
- the top level topic links may have a set of subtopics, as indicated by the arrows 206 . Clicking on a particular top level topic takes the site operator to a page associated with that topic's subtopics.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the result of this step, where the site operator has clicked on the topic “Computers” on page 200 .
- the subtopics 302 of the topic “Computers” have been displayed in the right hand column.
- a checkbox 314 Next to each subtopic 302 is a checkbox 314 .
- the site operator can select the checkbox 314 to indicate his interest in a specific subtopic.
- the site operator can select the checkbox 316 for the entire subtopic itself, “Computers (General)”. This indicates that the site operator is interested in all of the subtopics of the topic “Computers”.
- the set of topics selected by the site operator is called a site profile or a customization profile. On the left side of FIG.
- each topic is a delete link 308 that allows the site operator to delete individual topics.
- the site operator can also delete all topics by selecting the “Delete all topics” link 310 .
- the subtopics themselves can have any number of additional levels of subtopics.
- FIG. 4 illustrates that the subtopic “Games” has further subtopics 402 , “Board Games,” “Card Games,” etc. These were presented to the site operator in response to the site operator clicking on the subtopic arrow 206 next to the “Games” topic label. Again, the site operator can select either the entire subcategory by selecting checkbox 404 , or any of the individual subtopic checkboxes 406 .
- the site operator has indicated his interest in the “computers” topic generally.
- Clicking on the Generate Code button 208 causes the generation of a HTML code segment that the site operator can insert into one or more pages of the third party website.
- This code segment defines the search query interface 102 , and contains parameters (here topic IDs) that describe the site profile defined by the site operator.
- An example of such a code segment is as follows:
- line 5 which includes the variable site_profile as a set of integer topic IDs ⁇ 127,126,61,45,5 ⁇ , which are passed to the general search engine when the query is submitted.
- the general search engine maps the topic IDs to specific topics in the topical directory, to determine an associated boost value for documents that come from websites associated with the topic.
- code segment there are five topic IDs, but any number of IDs may be encoded here, depending on the number of topics that the site operator selects from the topical directory.
- the site operator adds the appropriate code segment to the desired webpages of the third party website, and publishes those pages for users to access.
- the site operator's site profile is stored locally to the general search engine, for example in a site profile database.
- the query interface simply returns a site_ID value instead of the list of topic IDs in site_profile.
- the general search engine then maps the site_ID value to the site operator's site profile in the database.
- the site operator can (optionally) specify a degree of influence by which the search results will be customized by the general search engine using the site profile.
- the input may be textual, such as value from 0 to 10 (which is then scaled an appropriate weighting scale) or graphical (e.g., using a slider type graphical control along an graphical axis; the position of the slider relative to the start and end points of the axis is then scaled to a weight).
- the customization control 309 allows the site operator to adjust the ranking of the individual documents/pages of the search results with respect to his interests, preferably as expressed in the customization profile.
- the customization control may be explained as controlling a degree of influence or contribution of the site operator's site profile to the ranking of the search results, and more specifically, scaling the boost that is applied to documents from websites associated with topics in the site profile.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a graphical customization control in an embodiment where it is a slider type control that includes a control handle 313 that is moved along a linear dimension between a minimum 312 to a maximum value 314 .
- This type of control 309 is generally very intuitive and easy for site operators to understand how it operates.
- Alternative embodiments include dial type controls, similarly providing a variable adjustment between a minimum and maximum value, and radio buttons each with an associated predetermined adjustment amount (e.g., five radio buttons, associated respectively with 0%, 20%, 40%, 80%, and 100%).
- Those of skill in the art of site operator interface design will appreciate that other types of controls may be implemented to achieve essentially the same effect.
- Another embodiment does not require the site operator to specify topical interests directly. Rather, the topics are automatically (e.g., programmatically) derived from attributes of one or more pages of the third party website or interactions by users of the site.
- the selected pages can be just the page(s) on which the search query interface appears, or all pages of the website, or some other set of pages.
- Various different types of attributes can be used to construct the site profile.
- textual attributes such as keywords
- keywords may be automatically associated with one or more pages of the site operator' website, based on frequency of appearance in the document and the general corpus, appearance (e.g., words in headings, boldface, etc., indicating relevant topics), or based on other statistical, morphological, syntactic, or grammatical features.
- the keywords are then mapped to previously identified topics in the topical directory, and the matching topics are included in the site profile.
- the mapping is easily done, for example, by providing a list of matching terms for each topic.
- An alternative approach is simply to scan the selected website pages for any of the topic terms themselves, and use the N (e.g., 10) most frequently appearing topic terms as the topics for the site profile.
- keywords for describing documents e.g. websites and webpages
- Any known or later developed algorithm that generates one or more keywords (or topics) from a given input of pages may be used, and the particular technique employed for this purpose is not a material aspect of the invention.
- structural attributes of the selected pages may analyzed, in particular the outbound and/or inbound link structure.
- the inbound links to, and the outbound link from of a page, including the anchor text and the outbound URL of each link, are useful indicators of what a given page is about.
- the anchor text terms of inbound and/or outbound links may be used to topical keywords, and the domains of the linked pages may also be used by weighting any search results pages from these linked domains to improve their ranking in the final search results.
- the site profile of a site operator includes a list of the most relevant domains related to the site operator's website.
- the site operator may provide a list of M (e.g., 5) domains that it deems of most relevant to user of the third party website.
- Documents from these websites will have their relevance scores weighted by the boost values associated with these website, and thereby improve the ranking of any document in the search results which is from one of these sites.
- interaction attributes of users of the third party website may also be used for determining a site profile.
- Interaction attributes includes searches conducted by users and browsing patterns.
- the site operator or the general search engine can keep track of some number of prior searches by users at the third party website.
- the search query terms themselves can be analyzed, and some subset of them (e.g., the most frequently occurring query terms), can be used as the topic terms themselves, mapped onto the topic terms, or scanned for topic terms, as described above, to obtain the site profile topic IDs.
- Interaction attributes also include the browsing patterns of site users.
- a user's site browsing patterns can be captured in a client side browser tool, such as a search query interface that is resident in the browser toolbar.
- the browser tool can maintain a list of domains that a user accesses, including the order in which domains are accessed.
- the domain information can be stored in domain tuples, as pairs of domains ⁇ origin_domain, destination_domain ⁇ , where the origin_domain is the site from which the user then links or access the destination_domain. From this domain access information, the relevant domains for any selected domain can be readily determined. First the domain access information from a plurality (e.g., hundreds or thousands, or more) users is obtained.
- the general search engine site maintains for each of the third party sites that use its services, a list of the domains that are accessed by those users who also access the third party site, as well as the frequency of those visits to such domains.
- the customization of search results is provided by the following methodology and system.
- Those of skill in the art of search engine design can readily understanding the basic structure of a general search engine and its operation in which this methodology can be implemented.
- FIG. 5 there is shown one embodiment of a software architecture and associated dataflow for practicing the present invention.
- the user operates a client application 118 , including a browser.
- the user accesses the site operator' website 119 , enters a search query in the search query interface 102 , as illustrated above.
- the search query (Q) along with the site profile parameters (e.g., site_profile topic IDs or site profile ID, depending on the implementation) is provided to the general search engine 104 via a front end server 102 .
- the front end server 102 issues a search request the general search engine 104 on the query Q and site profile.
- the front end server will receive back from the search engine 104 the customized search results, R_profile.
- the search engine 104 can apply any type of information retrieval scoring and relevance ranking process to determine an information retrieval score for each of a number of documents.
- the IR score can be determined, for example, using the PageRank algorithm, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, “Method for node ranking in a linked database”, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all of its teachings.
- the customized query contains the site operator's topic IDs (or site ID again, depending on the embodiment).
- the general search engine 104 follows a similar processing control flow as any normal query that is otherwise receives, but it accesses a customization server 108 during the scoring function by providing the site profile (or site ID) to the customization server 108 .
- the customization server 108 “boosts” documents that are relevant to the site profile for the site operator. If the customization server 108 receives the site profile directly, then it can determine the appropriate topic boosts for each topic identified in the site profile. If the customization server 108 receives a site ID of the third party website 119 , then it can lookup the site profile in the site profile database 110 .
- a site profiling tool 107 can be used to either generate the code segment as described above, or to generate the site profile directly using any of the various automated site analysis methods described above.
- the topic boosts are implemented using a set of maps (one map for each topic/subtopic in the directory), of the form:
- the category “Health” has a topic map of the form
- nih.gov, cdc.gov, and med.Stanford.edu are various sites (domains) that have been determined (either manually or automatically) to be related to the topic “Health.”
- a boost value is defined for each topic in the directory.
- the boost for the sites listed in the topical directory is generally determined as follows:
- a “site graph” is generated where nodes of the graph are sites (basically, pages on the same host) and edges between nodes are weighted based on the number of pages from one site that link to pages on another. This same type of graph can be used to compute all topic boost maps.
- start sites For each topic in the directory, say “Health”, a number of sites are selected as “start sites” S 0 whose home page is listed in the Open Directory. For example, for a university like Stanford, start sites may be selected as any site ending in .stanford.edu.
- the customization server 108 consults the respective maps for these topics.
- the customization server 108 boosts the IR score for the document by the boost value associated with topic, so that the document gets its IR score improved.
- the customization server 108 can obtain the corresponding boost value for each of these sites from the topic maps.
- the front end server 102 receives the customized search results R_profile, and passes them back the client application 118 for display to the user.
- the front end server 102 makes two search requests to the search engine 104 , the customized query R_profile, as above, and another request, a base query, just on the query Q with the site profile being set to NULL.
- the base query (Q,NULL) is the same as searching for Q on the search engine 104 without any profile information, so R_base is the result set that the general search engine 104 would normally return in response to the query.
- This search corresponds to the degree of influence being 0%, e.g., the customization slider 309 set at its minimum position 312 .
- R_profile represents the degree of influence of the site profile being maximal (i.e., 100%), for example, where the slider is at its maximum position 314 .
- control 309 has 11 positions (positions 0 through 10), but any number of positions may be used, and the rankings for intermediate positions between 0 and 10 are linearly interpolated; this means using R_base and R_profile, the customization server 108 can determine the appropriate ranking of the documents.
- the customization server 108 appends the results in R_profile that are not in R_base to R_base to get a list of all unique results (either in R_base or R_profile) called R_all.
- the customization server 108 assigns consecutive identification numbers to the results in R_all that serve as identifiers (R_IDs). For each of these result documents then, the customization server 108 boosts (e.g., multiplies) each document's IR score by the boost value from the topic directory (if any) of its domain, and the interpolated weighting factor for the site operator's specified degree of influence (e.g. 0.5, when the customization control 309 is set halfway between the maximum and minimum values).
- the customization server 108 boosts (e.g., multiplies) each document's IR score by the boost value from the topic directory (if any) of its domain, and the interpolated weighting factor for the site operator's specified degree of influence (e.g. 0.5, when the customization control 309 is set halfway between the maximum and
- Certain aspects of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of an algorithm. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention could be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, could be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by real time network operating systems.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored on a computer readable medium that can be accessed by the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
