- processing systems are comprised of a personal computer (PC) 12 having a nonvolatile storage device 14 such as a hard disk and a processing subsystem 16 that includes a digital processor 18 and a volatile storage 20 device such as a RAM.
- PC personal computer
- a nonvolatile storage device 14 such as a hard disk
- a processing subsystem 16 that includes a digital processor 18 and a volatile storage 20 device such as a RAM.
- Spreadsheet software 22 is stored within the nonvolatile storage 14 where it is fetched by the processing subsystem 16 and loaded into the volatile storage 20 for execution by the digital processor 18.
- the digital processor 18, under control of a spreadsheet processor 24 (which is essentially a copy of the spreadsheet software 22 in volatile storage 20), can be controlled by a user to retrieve one of a plurality of versions of documents 26, 28 or 30, stored as files in the nonvolatile storage 14.
- each version 26, 28 and 30 is a stand-alone document, that is, each document can be retrieved by the processing subsystem 16 without any reference to a prior version.
- This technique ignores the potential commonalities between versions and thus much of the contents of the nonvolatile storage 14 is potentially redundant on prior versions of documents.
- the file size of each version of a document will be essentially identical.
- the PC 12 is still comprised of nonvolatile storage 14, a processing subsystem 16, spreadsheet software 22 that is loaded into volatile storage 20 in the processing subsystem 16 for processing documents under control of the spreadsheet processor 24.
- preferred embodiments of the present invention additionally comprise version manager software 34.
- the version management software 34 and the spreadsheet software 22 are loaded into the volatile storage 20 in the processing subsystem 16 to form a version manager processor 36.
- the version manager processor 36 serves as an interface between the spreadsheet processor 24 and information stored in a library directory 38.
- the information in the library directory 38 includes a pair of version control files (a version data file 40 and a difference data file 42) corresponding to all existing document versions (Versions 1-N), all stored in the nonvolatile storage 14.
- the version manager processor 36 additionally comprises a delta processor 44 that stores and retrieves each version of a document in reference to each prior version using the version control data files 40 and 42.
- each version of a document is stored as a set of variable-sized delta-formatted data records representing characters, words, lines, paragraphs, or any other elementary portion of a document.
- the Version manager processor 36 recognizes this document as an original version and thus transfers this document, essentially unchanged, as a current version 46 to a working directory 48 where it is accessible to the spreadsheet processor 24.
- Version 1 of a document may be used in its entirety without significant processing.
- Version 2 of a document is checked out from the library directory 38, the version manager processor 36 recognizes this as a subsequent version.
- the version manager processor 36 will first retrieve Version 1 of the document from the common version control data files 40 and 42 and then fetch the set of data records pertaining to Version 2 from the version control data files 40 and 42 and use their contents to modify the data previously retrieved from Version 1 of the document.
- the spreadsheet processor 24 drives a displayer 50 to generate a display 52.
- the displayer 50 is usually a video monitor and/or a printer and the display 52 is a video screen and/or a printed page.
- version control data files 40 and 42 contain only difference or delta data from each prior version document, this data is referred to as being delta formatted.
- Document versions saved in a delta format generally require less disk space than the original documents.
- the version manager processor 36 will first fetch Version 1 of the document from the version control data files 40 and 42 to generate the original document and then fetch data records pertaining to Version 2 of the document from the version control data files 40 and 42.
- the version manager will then use the delta processor 44 to apply the delta-formatted data contained within the version control data files 40 and 42 to regenerate an intermediate Version 2 document.
- the version manager processor 36 will then process the delta-formatted data from version control data files 40 and 42 pertaining to Version 3, and the delta processor 44 will apply this delta-formatted data to the intermediate Version 2 document that was just regenerated, to regenerate the Version 3 document.
- This regenerated Version 3 document is then stored as the current version 46 for processing by the spreadsheet processor 24.
- This process can similarly iteratively repeat for Version N of a document.
- Embodiments of the present invention preferably support versions and subversions of a document and thus limit the number of regeneration iterations required.
- a Version 2.1.1 of a document is regenerated from Version 1 of a document and a regenerated Version 2 document but will not require regenerating Version 3 of a document.
- the delta-formatted data within the version control data files 40 and 42 can directly reflect Version N changes from Version 1, the original version, of a document 26 without referencing any intermediate delta-formatted data and thus without generating any intermediate versions, e.g., Version 2, Version 3, etc.
- FIG. 3 shows the basic structure of the version control data files 40 and 42.
- the difference data file 42 contains sets of data records reflecting the delta-formatted differences from each prior version of a document, e.g., the changed data and the cell location in a spreadsheet.
- the first set of data records pertains to Version 1 of a document, that is the original unmodified document. Since this is the first version it reflects the differences from a void document and thus contains Version 1 of the document essentially intact.
- the difference data file can contain a large number of data records since there can be a large number of versions and changes peculiar to each version. If a system required access to each data record to determine its relevance for a particular version, the performance of such a system would be degraded.
- the version data file 40 preferably contains a set of pointers 54 for each stored document version that point to a set of data records in the difference data file 42 that are used to regenerate each document version.
- the version data file 40 additionally stores identification data 56 for providing attributes to each version changed from the prior version.
- the identification data 56 preferably identifies the date and time the version was created, a version name associated with the version, text describing the reason for the change, and the user making the change.
- the version manager processor When a new document is saved, i.e., checked in, to the library directory the version manager processor generates the version data file 40 and the difference file 42 for the new document.
- the version manager processor 36 using the delta processor 44 updates and stores the version data file 40 and the difference data file 42 to reflect the changes in the subsequent version.
- embodiments of the present invention can generate data adapted to display the differences between any two selected document versions.
- the set of delta-formatted data for a particular version preferably contains data that directly represents the difference between two consecutive versions of the document.
- a regenerated version file is displayed as a plurality of display fields, each having a character display format inherent to each display field.
- the user can direct the version manager processor 36 to alter the character display format for display fields which reflect differences between selected document versions.
- the method used to display this data is determined by the user and stored within a configuration file 58 (FIG. 2) retained in the nonvolatile storage 14. In a preferred embodiment, these differences can be displayed through any combination of bolding, font type, or changes in color of display.
- a preferred embodiment of the present invention is currently under development by the assignee of the present invention.
- a version management system adapted for a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet processing system operating under Microsoft Windows is described. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the teachings of this application are equally applicable to other spreadsheet processors and word processors operating on a PC or any computing system.
- the following comprises a Product Description that includes a description of different parts of software in processing data, and a User Interface Description that includes features that can be selected by a user.
- a user identifies a document by its name and by an available version number, preferably from a list of available documents and associated versions. These two choices are provided to the version manager processor 36 that uses the previously described process to regenerate the selected document version.
- the spreadsheet version control processor 36 stores document versions in an independent library directory 38, as defined by the user. Alternative versions of a document will be stored in delta file format, thus minimizing storage space. Stored versions can be retrieved at any time, worked on, saved in a working directory, and then checked back into the library structure as a new version. If a document version before the "latest” version is checked out, the user can save it as the "latest” or "interim" (branch) version.
- This product will be installed so that it will automatically execute whenever the host application is initiated, where the host application is defined as the spreadsheet application using version control. Additional menu selections will provide access to all software functionality.
- This product will store all of its data in the library directory 38 on a hard disk, which is designated by the user.
- a file is checked out and locked from the library directory, and copied to the working directory 48. While the file is being updated, it can be saved using the File-Save option from the main menu, and it will be stored in the working directory 48 during this period.
- the user can then perform a Version Save which will be an option provided in this product's main menu. At this point, the file will be automatically saved again to the working directory 48. It is then copied to the library directory 38. While a copy of the file will remain in the working directory 48, it will have the read-only attribute switched on so that modifications cannot be made to it without performing a check-out from the library 38.
- Data storage will be performed by creating directory structures to separate project areas. Each project will further be divided into sub-directories as needed by the software. There will be a base library directory. In the base library directory, project sub-directories will be created--one to each project. As project names can be more than 8 characters long, a database file will be written to the library directory which will map each project name to a given project directory. (The maximum length of a project name is 40 characters.)
- each project directory there will be two sub-directories--one is d and the other is v where d is for storing the difference data files 42 and v is for storing the version data files 40.
- a sample directory tree is shown in FIG. 5.
- cfilelib is the base library directory.
- Revenue, bookings, and forecast are project sub-directories that represent various areas, such as would be used by an accountant.
- additional sub-directories known as d and v, as described above.
- the current status of each given document is maintained in its respective version data file 40 within sub-directory v. This will be accomplished in the file header.
- data strings will be inserted in each version's records in the version data file 40. This will include the name of the version, the person who changed it and the change comment. (Other information, such as date & time and version number are already stored in this file.)
- the file header will hold information about whether a document is checked in, checked out, read/write status and the version that is checked out.
- this product will create a new version number automatically.
- the baseline copy of a given document will be version number 1. Its revisions would then be versions 2, 3, 4, and so on.
- Branched versions are numbered 1.1.1, 3.2.2, 5.1.2.3.2, 3.10.23.1.2, or some combination fitting this pattern. Periods are used as branching level separators.
- each version number will be required to have an odd number of numbers. Thus, 1, 1.1.1, 1.1.1.1.1, and 1.1.1.1.1.1.1 are valid version numbers, and 1.1, 2.2.2.2, and 3.3.3.3.3.3 are invalid version numbers.
- Branching will be utilized on demand by the user. Under normal conditions, versions of a document will be designated by single-level version numbers. If the stored versions are 1, 2, and 3, and version 3 is the latest version and versions 1 or 2 are checked out, the newly-created version will be version 4. Branching can be manually selected by the user at save. In this specific case, a check-out of version 2 and then a check-in with branching will yield version 2.1.1. Checking in a new version 2.1.1 will yield version 2.1.2. The branch of version 2.1.1 would be version 2.1.1.1.1. Up to five (5) branching levels will be allowed (i.e., Version 1.2.1.1.1 has the maximum number of parts available) in the display, although the software itself allows for more branching levels.
- a sample tree with branches is as follows:
- Version names will be limited to 25 characters.
- a new spreadsheet will be created in the ordinary way of selecting File-New from the menu bar. As soon as data is entered, the user selects Version Save As . . . from the FileVersion menu.
- Any number of files can be stored in one group. This group will be known as a project. Groups of related files and their offspring ("versions") will reside in a given project directory. This concept is illustrated in FIG. 6.
- On-line help will be available to the user by selecting help from the main menu. This will be accomplished using a separate help file in conjunction with the Microsoft Windows help engine.
- a menu selection will be added to the spreadsheet menu bar. This will consist of the word FileVersion and it can be activated by a mouseclick, or by hitting the ⁇ ALT> key followed by the "l" key (standard Window's functionality). This menu modification will occur during host application initialization and will appear as shown in FIG. 7.
- the program execution associated with this menu selection process can be generally described by the block diagram shown in FIG. 8.
- the Version Open dialogue allows the user to perform library check-out functions. Selection is done by project, file (document), and version number/name. A checkbox appears for the latest version to be checked out by default. The user can change this by un-checking the latest version checkbox and selecting an alternate version. The version combo-box will be disabled by changing its color from black to gray when the latest version checkbox is checked.
- the Version Open dialogue appears as shown in FIG. 9.
- the Save dialogue allows the user to perform library check-in functions. If the document to be checked in does not yet have a baseline version (that is, the document does not yet exist in the selected project), then the Save as . . . dialogue automatically appears. The Save dialogue appears as shown in FIG. 10.
- the Save As . . . dialogue allows the user to perform library check-in functions for documents that did not previously exist in the library.
- the dialogue appears the same as the Save dialogue box except that the project name field is a combo-box and the file name field is an edit box, and version-related items are not present except for the version name.
- the Save As . . . dialogue appears as shown in FIG. 11.
- This feature allows a whole spreadsheet, i.e., all versions, to be copied or moved to another project group, or to be renamed within a project.
- the copy function is best used when the user wants different copies of the same thing for different purposes and the two copies of the spreadsheets are to be maintained independently.
- the Move/Copy dialogue box appears as shown in FIG. 12.
- This feature will allow the user to delete all or part of a spreadsheet document from a project group. All document versions will be listed in the Version combo box. The user can select any number of versions, including all versions. However, if all versions are selected, an alert message will appear upon clicking on the OK button indicating that all but Version 1 will be deleted, and indicating that to delete Version 1, the user should select Delete all versions. This will happen even if there is only one version in the repository file, and Delete all versions is not checked.
- the Delete dialogue box is shown in FIG. 13.
- Comparisons are accomplished between differing versions of a given spreadsheet in a project.
- the version combo boxes show version numbers and version names to facilitate selection.
- the differences will be shown by creating a new spreadsheet file and writing the differences to it. Once created, the difference file will be in the same format as the original versions with changes highlighted according to settings accomplished with Compare setup.
- the File Version Compare dialogue box is shown in FIG. 14.
- Options allow the user to alternatively select a display of a first, e.g., old, version of a document with differences from a second, e.g., new, version indicated, a display of the second version of a document with differences from the first version indicated, or a delta report showing subtractive differences for numerical data.
- the report is generated on a selected spreadsheet with changes being shown according to user-selected format options.
- FIG. 15 there is shown a display of an "Old" version of a document according to its normal display format as determined by its internal data and the spreadsheet processor.
- FIG. 16 shows a display of a "New" version of a document. In a first report format shown in FIG.
- data from the "Old” version of the document is displayed according to the normal display format for the "Old” version of the document.
- the normal display format is modified by italicizing the cells that are different in the "New” version of the document as well as italicizing labels that are different in the "New” version.
- FIG. 17B data from the "New” version of the document is displayed with italicizing of the cells and labels that are different in the "Old” version of the document.
- a third report format, as shown in FIG. 17C shows subtractive differences of numerical data.
- DELTA.XLS shows the newer version of labels with the changed alphanumeric information and non-zero subtractive differences italicized.
- Numerical data is displayed by computing the difference on a cell-by-cell basis such that:
- Compare setup operations when performed, are written to an configuration file 58 (CCCFILE.INI) to retain setup options for later usage. Any combination of report options and highlight options may be selected. If no report options are selected, a Delta Report will be generated. Likewise, if no highlight options are selected, all changes will appear in italics.
- the Compare Setup dialogue box is shown in FIG. 18.
- a name for a new project is created in this dialogue as shown in FIG. 18. If a given project already exists, then the user is alerted accordingly and is requested to select another name.
- the project name uses a combo bar so the user can see what project names are already in use.
- Creation information about an existing project will be shown as in FIG. 20 to facilitate the user's decision whether or not to delete a whole project. Since deleting a whole project database has major implications, the user will be asked to verify deletion once OK is selected.
- File path names are originally set during program installation, however, they can be changed by the user at any time using this dialog as shown in FIG. 21.
- the library path is the base directory for the currently-selected library. It is possible for a user to have more than one library.
- the Program Path is where the program software and help files reside. While the program path is not changed unless the software is moved, the option is provided to facilitate a user changing resident directories for this software.
- FIGS. 22-53 there is shown a top level flow chart of the user interface to the previously described embodiment. There are found software listings of a presently preferred embodiment corresponding to these flow charts. FIGS. 54-64 provide a top level flowchart referencing the software.
- FIG. 22 shows a block diagram of top level implementation for a user interface. From Windows 200 Excel is invoked 202, run 204, and exited 206. Invoke Excel 202 includes initialization sequence 208. Run Excel 204 includes a menu 210. Exit Excel 206 includes exit sequence 212.
- FIG. 23 shows a block diagram of an initialization sequence for the user interface.
- Initialization sequence 220 includes initialize menu block 222 and read CCCFILE.INI file & initialize variables 224.
- FIG. 24 shows a block diagram for an initialization menu for a user interface. From initialize menu 230 get DLL name 232. Next, register menu functions 234. From register menu functions 234, for number of functions to be registered 236, register function 238. After register menu functions 234, test for an existence of menu 240. In testing for existence of menu 240, if menu item exists, no action 244, and if menu item does not exist, create menu 246. In creating menu 246, allocate memory for menu 248. For number of menu rows 250 do the following: For number of menu parameters 252, set storage to string type 254, store menu string 256, and increment pointer 258.
- set menu record type to Multi 260
- copy menu array to menu record 262
- set number of menu rows 264 set number of menu columns 266
- call Excel function to place menu 268, unlock and free menu handle 270
- initialize dialogue box database variables to zero and blank 280.
