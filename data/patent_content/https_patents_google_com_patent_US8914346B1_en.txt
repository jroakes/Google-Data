Definitions
- the present disclosure generally relates to searching correlated data groups, and in particular, to producing and utilizing a clustered search index to enable searching correlated data groups.
- Creating a relatively efficient indexing scheme can be especially difficult for television (TV) program search services because of overlap between the vast number of channel lineups (i.e. combinations of channels) offered by various providers.
- channel lineups i.e. combinations of channels
- providers For example, currently in the United States, there are approximately 16,000 different TV channels that are included in approximately 55,000 channel lineups that have been created based on factors such as geographic location, regional preferences and available modes of delivery (e.g. cable, satellite, over-the-air).
- a first lineup offered in New York by a cable provider may include 900 channels
- a second lineup offered in San Francisco by a satellite provider may include 750 channels.
- the first and second lineups may have 200 common channels.
- a particular user may have access to tens, hundreds or even thousands of TV channels depending on the lineup selected by the user.
- searching for a TV program the user will typically only want search results for TV programs on channels the user actually has access to.
- Previously known methods of creating a search index applicable for TV program listings have flaws that are exacerbated by the enormous number of correlated lineups that need to be searched in order to service a query from a particular user. For example, indexing by channels or by TV programs results in computationally expensive search processes that are relatively inefficient, and consequently, are often slow even when executed by data centers or the like.
- methods and devices are operable to create a clustered search index that includes clusters of TV channels frequently provided together in various channel lineups in order to improve searching efficiency. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations systems, methods and devices are operable to process a search query by selecting a number of pertinent channel clusters from a clustered search index associated with one or more characteristics associated with the query.
- channels are clustered into groups of similar channels, including but not limited to national groups of channels commonly included in lineups across an entire country, regional groups of channels commonly used in lineups across an entire region, and to local tiers of channels used in local lineups. By clustering channels into groups, storage for common channels is reduced (e.g., national channels do not need to replicated across hundreds of lineups) and the number of channel lineups that need to be searched in response to a user TV search query is also reduced.
- One aspect of the disclosure is a method producing a search index for correlated data groups.
- the method includes identifying one or more sets of data elements shared by two or more data groups; generating a respective cluster of data elements for each of the one or more identified sets of data elements; indexing each cluster so that each cluster can be selected and retrieved independently for searching; and storing each indexed cluster in a non-volatile memory space allotted for the search index.
- Another aspect of the disclosure is a method of searching a clustered index.
- the method includes parsing a received search query to identify at least one query characteristic; selecting one or more clusters based on at least one query characteristic; searching the selected clusters; and merging the search results.

- methods and devices are operable to create a clustered search index that includes clusters of TV channels frequently provided together in various channel lineups in order to improve TV program searching efficiency. That is, the resultant search index is based on sub-lineups of channels that are shared by multiple channel lineups. Each sub-lineup includes channels that are frequently provided together, as determined by analysis of the channel lineups offered by the various providers.
- methods and devices are operable to process a search query by selecting a number of pertinent channel clusters from a clustered search index associated with one or more characteristics associated with the query.
- a search server system parses the query to identify one or more pertinent query characteristics, selects and searches one or more clusters from the clustered search index based on at least one pertinent query characteristic, and returns search results to the client device.

- the lineup monitor module 135 is configured to collect information about lineups and store the information in the lineup database 136 . To that end, in some implementations the lineup monitor module 135 includes a set of instructions 135 a and heuristics and metadata 135 b.

- the actual number of servers used to implement the TV program search server 130 and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of three (first, second, and third) simplified example channel lineups 301 , 302 , 303 and clusters 310 , 320 , 330 , 340 , 350 , 360 that may be derived from the channel lineups 301 , 302 , 303 .
- the example lineups 301 , 302 , 303 are simplified lineups provided for demonstrative purposes only, and that actual channel lineups typically include more detailed compositions of channels than shown in FIG. 3 .
- the first lineup 301 is provided by a first provider, Provider A, for the San Francisco, Calif. market.
- the first lineup 301 includes three national channels 311 , 312 , 313 (also shown as National A, National B and National C, respectively), two regional channels 321 , 323 (also shown as Regional A and Regional B, respectively), and two local channels 331 , 332 (also shown as Local A and Local B, respectively).
- the second lineup 302 is provided by a first provider, Provider B, for the San Jose, Calif. market.
- the second lineup 302 includes two of the national channels 311 , 313 , the same two regional channels 321 , 323 , and a different local channel 333 (also shown as Local C).
- the third lineup 303 is provided by a third provider, Provider C, for the New York, N.Y. market.
- the third lineup 303 includes the same three national channels 311 , 312 , 313 , three different regional channels 351 , 352 , 353 (also shown as Regional C, Regional D, and Regional E, respectively), and two different local channels 361 , 362 (also shown as Local D and Local E, respectively).
- How a TV program search query from a user subscribing to any of the lineups 301 , 302 , 303 is processed depends on how the search index is configured (i.e. indexed).
- Lineups tend to be correlated data groups.
- Correlated data groups include elements that are duplicated in two or more of the data groups.
- the resultant system would require storing each lineup and the corresponding channel and program data associated with each lineup, and providing a mechanism for first selecting a particular lineup for searching.
- the problem with such an approach is that it is memory intensive, because the corresponding channel and program data for each channel would be duplicated in the memory as many times as each channel appears in a different lineup. Consequently, the resultant lineup database would be very large, and thus it would be difficult to transmit and store multiple copies of the search index in distributed datacenters that handle the search requests.
- a distributed search system configured to store multiple copies of a large lineup database, including duplicate copies of corresponding channel and program data, would be prone to synchronization errors between the separately stored copies.
- channel and program data are indexed based on channel clusters derived from lineups offered by various providers.
- the resultant search index is based on sub-lineups of channels that are shared by multiple channel lineups (i.e. each sub-lineup includes channels that are frequently provided together).
- the three national lineups 311 , 312 , 313 are included in the same sub-lineup 310 because these three channels are typically included in multiple lineups with one another.
- sub-lineup 320 includes the regional channels 321 , 322 provided to subscribers of either lineup 301 or 302 .
- sub-lineup 350 includes the regional channels 351 , 352 provided to subscribers of lineup 303 .
- sub-lineups 330 and 360 include local channels 331 , 332 and 361 , 362 , respectively.
- sub-lineups may be derived from the relative frequency with which channels are included in the various lineups. Additionally and/or alternatively sub-lineups may be derived from lineups by threshold values that characterize how correlated/uncorrelated the various sub-lineups may be for a particular implementation. For example, with further reference to FIG. 3 , although the second lineup 302 only includes two of the three national channels in the example, it may be more efficient to use sub-lineup 310 for a search query from a subscriber of lineup 302 than define another sub-lineup 340 that is specific to lineup 302 . In general, there may be less duplication of channel and program data in the index if the sub-lineups are generally less correlated with one another.
- sub does not imply a relatively smaller grouping of channels as compared to lineups offered by a cable or satellite provider.
- a particular sub-lineup may include either a lesser or a greater number of channels than a particular lineup.
- An example of the resulting lineup may include without duplication all three national channels 311 , 312 , 313 , both regional channels 321 , 322 , and all three local channels 331 , 332 , 333 . The example resulting lineup would thus have more channels than either of the first and second lineups 301 , 302 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart representation of an example implementation of a server system method of generating a clustered search index.
- the method is performed by a server system in order to produce a clustered search index, which is indexed by clusters derived from lineups offered by various providers.
- the method generates a clustered search index by combining lineups that are similar with respect to one another within a particular threshold, so that duplicate channels in the combination of lineups can be eliminated.
- clustering of channels is performed according to the respective channel call signs because the mapping between channel numbers and the channel call signs is often different between different lineups.
- search results as discussed below with reference to FIG. 8 , are filtered using both the channel call signs and channel number mapping in order to provide a user in a particular area, that subscribes to a particular lineup, accurate channel numbers in response to search queries.
- the method includes selecting a non-clustered lineup as a base lineup ( 4 - 1 ).
- the method includes selecting a non-clustered target lineup to compare to the previously selected base lineup ( 4 - 2 ).
- the method includes determining whether the base and target lineups match within a threshold ( 4 - 3 ).
- the threshold includes a percentage and/or a number of overlapping channels between the base and the target lineups.
- the threshold may be defined as 90% overlap between the base and the target lineups.
- the method includes clustering the target with the base lineup ( 4 - 6 ). In some implementations, at this point, clustering includes grouping the lineups together without yet merging the two lineups, so as to allow for later modification of the clustering. In some implementations, at this point, clustering includes both merging the base and the target lineups and eliminating duplicates (i.e. merging without duplication), so that the resultant cluster includes no more than one of each constituent channel from the combination of the base and target lineups. On the other hand, if the base and the target lineups do not match within the threshold (“No” path from 4 - 3 ), the method includes determining whether or not there are additional target lineups to consider relative to the selected base lineup ( 4 - 4 ).
- the method determines whether or not there are additional candidate base lineups to consider ( 4 - 5 ). For example, in some implementations, candidate base lineups are lineups that have yet to be clustered with another lineup.
- the method loops back to the portion of the method represented by block 4 - 1 .
- the method includes merging each of the respective base lineups with the corresponding matched target lineups and eliminating duplicates from clusters, so that the resultant cluster includes no more than one of each constituent channel from the combination of a respective base lineup and the corresponding matched target lineups ( 4 - 7 ). For example, with reference to FIG.
- an example of a resulting lineup (not shown), derived from the first and second lineups 301 , 302 , may include without duplication all three national channels 311 , 312 , 313 , both regional channels 321 , 322 , and all three local channels 331 , 332 , 333 .
- the example resulting lineup would thus have more channels than either of the first and second lineups 301 , 302 .
- the method includes storing and addressing the pruned clusters to produce a clustered search index ( 4 - 8 ).
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of example channel lineups, clusters and channel number mapping.
- FIG. 5 is similar to and adapted from FIG. 3 .
- elements common to FIGS. 3 and 5 include common reference numbers, and only the differences between FIGS. 3 and 5 are described herein for the sake of brevity.
- the mapping between channel numbers and the channel call signs is often different between different lineups.
- the three national channels 311 , 312 , 313 have respective call signs CNN, ESPN, CNBC.
- the three national channels 311 , 312 , 313 are mapped to corresponding channel numbers 231 .
- FIG. 6 is a chart 600 of example clusters based on relative channel frequencies. That is, the chart 600 schematically illustrates the ordering of channels according to the number of times (i.e. the frequency) each channel appears in a lineup. For example, the lineups considered may be the approximately 55,000 lineups available in the United States.
- the chart 600 includes five groups of channels 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 , 650 that are arranged in order of descending channel frequency and are defined by threshold frequency levels TH f1 , TH f2 , TH f3 , TH f4 , TH f5 .
- the first group 610 for example, includes first, second and third channels 611 , 612 , 613 (also shown as channels a1-a3, respectively), which each have a frequency greater than the first threshold TH f1 .
- the second group includes six channels (i.e. channels b1-b6), which each have a respective frequency between the first and second thresholds TH f1 , TH f2 .
- the other groups 630 , 640 , 650 are similarly defined with respect to the thresholds TH f3 , TH f4 , TH f5 . As discussed below with reference to FIG. 7 , there are a number of ways by which the thresholds that define the groups may be empirically identified.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart representation of an example implementation of a server system method, which is described with continued reference to FIG. 6 .
- the method is performed by a server system in order to produce a clustered search index, which is indexed by sub-lineups of channels (i.e. clusters) included together in lineups offered by various providers.
- the method generates a clustered search index including sub-lineups of channels that are frequently provided together, as determined by analysis of the channel lineups offered by various providers.
- the method includes calculating the relative frequencies for each channel in the collection of lineups available ( 7 - 1 ).
- the method includes sorting the channel frequencies from high-to-low (or vice versa) to reveal patterns based on the channel frequencies ( 7 - 2 ).
- the method includes identifying relative frequency plateaus in the sorted channel frequencies ( 7 - 3 ).
- the groups 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 , 650 may each be identified by a corresponding relative plateau or a corresponding average frequency value.
- the method includes identifying threshold values between the relative plateaus in order to define the groups ( 7 - 4 ).
- each threshold value is an indicator of substantial separation between two groups of channels.
- the first threshold value, TH f1 defines separation between the first group of channels 610 and the second group of channels 620 .
- the method includes defining candidate clusters based at least on the threshold values previously identified ( 7 - 5 ).
- the groups 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 , 650 may be considered candidate clusters, which are defined by at least the threshold values TH f1 , TH f2 , TH f3 , TH f4 , TH f5 .
- the groups (e.g. 610 , 620 ) defined by relatively high threshold values e.g. TH f1 , TH f2
- relatively high threshold values e.g. TH f1 , TH f2
- the groups (e.g. 640 , 650 ) defined by relatively low threshold values (e.g. TH f4 , TH f5 ) likely include the plethora of regional and local channels that are each only included in a relatively small number of channel lineups. As a result, in some implementations, it is beneficial to employ additional factors to cluster channels defined by the relatively low frequency thresholds.
- the method includes further sub-dividing the groups (e.g. 640 , 650 ) defined by relatively low threshold values (e.g. TH f4 , TH f5 ) based on factors such as location, popularity, language and/or type of content ( 7 - 6 ). For example, with reference to FIG. 6 , clusters 641 and 651 are separated from groups 640 and 650 , respectively.
- the method includes eliminating duplicates from clusters, so that the resultant cluster includes no more than one of each constituent channel from the combination of a respective base lineup and the corresponding matched target lineups ( 7 - 7 ).
- the method includes storing and addressing the pruned clusters to produce a clustered search index ( 7 - 8 ).
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart representation of an example implementation of a server system method.
- the method is performed by a server system in order to service a search query by utilizing a clustered search index.
- the method includes receiving a query for a program listing from a subscriber ( 8 - 1 ).
- a user may submit a search query for a particular program on a national news network.
- the user may submit a search query for a particular program on a local station.
- the user may submit the query through either the second screen device 120 or the client device 103 .
- the method includes parsing the query to identify pertinent query characteristics ( 8 - 2 ).
- a query includes a location indicator, an IP address, an indication of the lineup subscribed to by the user submitting the query.
- the method includes selecting clusters based at least on one of the pertinent query characteristics ( 8 - 3 ). For example, if the user search query is for a program on a national news channel, the cluster including national news channel would be selected. In another example, if the user search query is for a program that may be on a number of regional channels and a national channel, then the clusters including the pertinent region channels and the national channel would be selected.
- the method includes searching the selected clusters ( 8 - 4 ).
- the method includes merging the results based on, for example, relevancy scores ( 8 - 5 ).
- the method includes filtering the merged search results based at least on user information ( 8 - 6 ).
- the method includes returning the filtered search results for the program listing requested by the user ( 8 - 7 ).
- clustering of channels is performed according to the respective channel call signs because the mapping between channel numbers and the channel call signs are often different in different lineups.
- search results are filtered using both the channel call signs and channel number mapping in order to provide a user in a particular area, that subscribes to a particular lineup, accurate channel numbers in response to search queries.
- the respective one or more channel numbers from the mapping for a particular lineup are retrieved after the search process using the clusters has been performed.
- an aspect described herein may be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects may be combined in various ways.
- an apparatus may be implemented and/or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein.
- such an apparatus may be implemented and/or such a method may be practiced using other structure and/or functionality in addition to or other than one or more of the aspects set forth herein.

- the term “if” may be construed to mean “when” or “upon” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “in response to detecting,” that a stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context.
- the phrase “if it is determined [that a stated condition precedent is true]” or “if [a stated condition precedent is true]” or “when [a stated condition precedent is true]” may be construed to mean “upon determining” or “in response to determining” or “in accordance with a determination” or “upon detecting” or “in response to detecting” that the stated condition precedent is true, depending on the context.
