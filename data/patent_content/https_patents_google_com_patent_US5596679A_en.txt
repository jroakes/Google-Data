Definitions
- This invention relates generally to speech-recognition systems and, in particular, to a method for identifying continuous speech.
- Dynamic time-warping is a technique which uses an optimization principle to minimize the errors between an unknown spoken word and a stored template of a known word. Reported data shows that the DTW technique is very robust and produces good recognition. However, the DTW technique is computationally intensive. Therefore, it is currently impractical to implement the DTW technique for real-world applications.
- the hidden-Markov modeling technique uses stochastic models for known words and compares the probability that the unknown word was generated by each model.
- the HMM technique will check the sequence (or state) of the word, and find the model that provides the best match.
- the HMM technique has been successfully used in many commercial applications; however, the technique has many drawbacks. These drawbacks include an inability to differentiate acoustically similar words, a susceptibility to noise, and computational intensiveness.
- a time-delay neural network is a type of neural network which addresses the temporal effects of speech by adopting limited neuron connections.
- a TDNN shows slightly better results than the HMM method.
- a TDNN suffers from two serious drawbacks.
- the training time for a TDNN is very lengthy, on the order of several weeks.
- the training algorithm for a TDNN often converges to a local minimum, which is not the globally optimum solution.

- FIG. 1 shows a contextual block diagram of a prior art speech-recognition system.
- the diagram shows microphone 2 or other means for receiving audio input in the form of speech input and converting sound into electrical energy.
- Speech-recognition system 6 receives signals from microphone 2 over transmission medium 4 and performs various tasks such as waveform sampling, analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, feature extraction and classification.
- Speech-recognition system 6 provides the identity of spoken sounds to computer 10 via bus 8.
- Computer 10 executes commands or programs which may utilize the data provided by speech-recognition system 6.
- the system depicted by FIG. 1 is used for recognizing spoken sound from continuously spoken speech.
- Continuously spoken speech or continuous speech, takes place when a person speaking into the microphone does not un-naturally pause between each spoken sound. Rather, the person speaking only pauses when the natural form of speech dictates a pause, such as at the end of a sentence. For this reason, continuous speech can be thought of as "natural" speech which occurs in an ordinary conversation.
- Continuously spoken speech includes at least one spoken sound, wherein a spoken sound may be a word, syllable, or phoneme.
- a phoneme is the smallest element of speech sound which indicates a difference in meaning.
- a syllable includes one or more phonemes, and a word includes one or more syllables.

- speech-recognition system 50 is implemented by software running on a computer processor such as a microprocessor.
- a computer processor such as a microprocessor.
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- Continuous speech is received by microphone 2 and converted to signals which are transmitted across transmission medium 4 to converter 20.
- converter 20 Upon receiving a speech sample, converter 20 performs various functions which utilize the speech sample. These functions include waveform sampling, filtering, and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion.
- Converter 20 generates as output a speech signal which is passed to feature extractor 24 via bus 22.
- Feature extractor 24 produces a plurality of features from the speech signal. These features are passed to the plurality of classifiers over bus 26.
- each classifier generates a sequence of outputs.
- the classifier outputs are then passed to selector 46 over buses 32, 36, 40, and 44. In turn, selector 46 generates a system output on bus 48.
- FIG. 2 An example of the operation of the system presented by FIG. 2 is as follows.
- microphone 2 When a user utters continuous speech, microphone 2 generates a signal which represents the acoustic waveform of the speech.
- the signal from microphone 2 is an analog signal.
- This signal is then fed to converter 20 for digitization.
- Converter 20 includes appropriate means for A/D conversion.
- An A/D converter may sample the signal from microphone 2 several thousand times per second (e.g. between 8000 and 14,000 times per second, depending on the frequency components of the speech signal from the microphone). Each of the samples is then converted to a digital word, wherein the length of the word is between 12 and 32 bits.
- sampling rate and word length of A/D converters may vary and that the numbers given above do not place any limitations on the sampling rate or word length of an A/D converter used in conjunction with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the speech signal comprises one or more of these digital words, wherein each digital word represents a sample of the continuous speech taken at an instant in time.
- the speech signal is passed to feature extractor 24 where the digital words, over an interval of time, are grouped into a data frame.
- each data frame represents 10 milliseconds of speech signal.
- the data frames are in turn subjected to cepstral analysis, a method of feature extraction, which is performed by feature extractor 24.
- the cepstral analysis a method of feature extraction, which is performed on the speech signal, results in a representation of the speech signal which characterizes the relevant features of the continuous speech over the interval of time. It can be regarded as a data reduction procedure that retains vital characteristics of the speech signal and eliminates undesirable interference from irrelevant characteristics of the speech signal, thus easing the decision-making process for the plurality of classifiers.
- the vector of cepstrum coefficients is usually weighted by a sine window of the form
- cepstrum liftering This weighting is commonly referred to as cepstrum liftering.
- the effect of this liftering process is to smooth the spectral peaks in the spectrum of the speech signal. It has also been found that cepstrum liftering suppresses the existing variations in the high and low cepstrum coefficients, and thus considerably improves the performance of the speech-recognition system.
- the result of the cepstral analysis is a smoothed log spectra which corresponds to the frequency components of the speech signal over an interval of time.
- the significant features of the speech signal are thus preserved in the spectra.
- Feature extractor 24 generates a respective feature frame which comprises data points from the spectrum generated from a corresponding data frame. The feature frame is then passed to the plurality of classifiers.
- a feature frame contains twelve data points, wherein each of the data points represents the value of cepstrally-smoothed spectrum at a specific frequency over the interval of time.
- the data points are 32-bit digital words.
- the present invention places no limits on the number of data points per feature frame or the bit length of the data points; the number of data points contained in a feature frame may be twelve or any other appropriate value, while the data point bit length may be 32 bits, 16 bits, or any other value.
- a parametric decision method is used by each of the classifiers to determine whether a set of features belongs to a certain class.
- a class may represent spoken sound.
- the set of features may include cepstrum, linear predictive, or Fourier coefficients.
- a classifier Upon receiving a set of features, a classifier computes its respective discriminant function and produces a result.
- the magnitude of the result indicates whether a set of features belongs to the class which corresponds to the discriminant function.
- the magnitude of the result is directly proportional to the likelihood that the set of features belongs to the corresponding class.
- the discriminant function implemented by each of the classifiers is based upon the use of a polynomial expansion and, in a loose sense, the use of an orthogonal function, such as a sine, cosine, exponential/logarithmic, Fourier transformation, Legendre polynomial, non-linear basis function such as a Volterra function or a radial basis function, or the like, or a combination of polynomial expansion and orthogonal functions.

- the spoken sound is identified by determining a winning classifier within the voting window.
- the winning classifier produces the most winning outputs during the predetermined interval of the voting window.
- a winning classifier identifies the spoken sound since each classifier has an associated class label which represents a spoken sound.
- a system output is generated which includes the class label of the winning classifier.
- decision box 100 a check is made to determine whether another system output should be generated. If so, the method proceeds to box 102. If not, the method terminates.
- box 102 another voting window is defined which includes a different subset of classifier outputs and corresponds to a different predetermined interval of time. Upon exiting box 102, the method returns to box 94.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the concept of a voting window.
- Graph 110 depicts the outputs of a first classifier; graph 112 depicts the outputs of a second classifier; and graph 114 depicts the outputs of a third classifier.
- Axis 116 indicates time and axis 118 indicates the magnitude of the classifier outputs.
- the voting window is defined by a starting time, which is depicted by dotted line 120; an ending time, which is depicted by dotted line 122; and a predetermined windowing interval, or duration, which is depicted by arrow 124.
- the voting window includes outputs of the first, second, and third classifiers which occur at specific feature intervals t 5- t 10 .
- FIG. 4 shows a voting window which includes a sequence of three outputs from six different classifiers, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that a voting window may include a sequence having more or less than three outputs from any number of classifiers.
- FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an example of two voting windows.
- a first voting window is defined by a first starting time, which is depicted by dotted line 120; a first ending time, which is depicted by dotted line 122; and a first predetermined windowing interval, which is depicted by arrow 124.
- the first voting window includes outputs of the first, second, and third classifiers which occur at specific time intervals t 5- t 10 and is used to determine a first system output.
- a second voting window is defined by a second starting time, which is depicted by dotted line 126; a second ending time, which is depicted by dotted line 128; and a second predetermined windowing interval, which is depicted by arrow 130.
- the second voting window includes outputs of the first, second, and third classifiers which occur at specific time intervals t 9- t 14 and is used to generate a second system output corresponding to a later portion of the continuous speech than the first system output.

- the predetermined interval of time may vary between different voting windows.
- voting window 170 shows magnitudes which are real numbers ranging between 0 and 20, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a magnitude may be any number type within any range.
- Voting window 172 shows an example of how the winning outputs of voting window 170 are identified.
- a winning output is given by a one.
- the winning output is the classifier output with the greatest magnitude. Losing outputs are given by a zero.
- classifier C4 generates the winning output; at intervals t 2 and t 3 , classifier C3 generates the winning outputs.
- the winning classifier corresponding to voting window 172 is C3, since it generated the greatest number of winning outputs within voting window 172.
- Voting window 174 shows an example of identifying more than one winning output at each interval within voting window 170. Similar to voting window 172, winning outputs are identified by a one and losing outputs are identified by a zero. However, at each interval, two winning outputs are determined. The two winning outputs correspond to the classifier outputs having the greatest and second greatest magnitudes. In the example shown, the winning classifier corresponding to voting window 174 is classifier C3.
- the reason for representing a classifier output as non-parametric values, i.e., either one or zero, for example, as depicted by voting windows 172 and 174, is to prevent a "shouting classifier" from skewing the determination of a winning classifier.
- a shouting classifier is a classifier which, for one reason or another, generates a disproportionately large output relative to the other classifiers.
- the magnitudes of the classifier outputs are not converted to non-parametric values, one and zero as an example, a classifier which shouts at only one time interval within the voting window could be erroneously identified as the winning classifier. This could negatively affect the overall performance of the speech-recognition system.

- a winning output is simply a discriminant function output having the greatest magnitude at a corresponding specific feature interval. Since the duration of a voting window includes more than one specific interval, more than one winning output will be determined for the voting window.
- the spoken sound is identified by determining a winning classifier or class label within the voting window.
- the winning class label corresponds to the discriminant function which produces the most winning outputs during the predetermined windowing interval.
- decision box 210 a check is made to determine whether another system output should be generated. If so, the method proceeds to box 212. If not, the method terminates.
- box 212 another voting window is defined which includes a different subset of discriminant function outputs and corresponds to a different predetermined windowing interval. Upon exiting box 212, the method returns to box 204.

- Determining means 226 determines a plurality of winning outputs 228, each winning output being a signal corresponding to one of the plurality of classifiers, by comparing each of the subsequence of outputs corresponding to a same interval of time to determine the output with the largest magnitude.
- Identifying means 230 identifies the spoken sound corresponding to the particular voting window by determining a winning classifier from the plurality of classifiers, based on the classifier with the most winning outputs for that voting window.
- a signal 232, indicative of the winning classifier is output by the identifying means 230.
