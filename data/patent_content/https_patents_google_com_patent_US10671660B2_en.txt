Definitions
- Embodiments within the disclosure relate generally to determining content in response to a request.
- One aspect includes a method for determining relevant content in response to a request for information.
- One or more computing devices may receive a query requesting information regarding a place of interest and identify a first place which satisfies the query associated with a first database and a set of displayable content associated with the first place within a second database.
- the one or more computing devices may identify a subset of the displayable content for display in response to the query, the identification of the subset of displayable content comprising determining a ranking for each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content according to the query.
- the subset of displayable content and the first place may be provided for presentation on a client device.
- identifying the first place includes identifying particular attributes within the query. For each place in a set of places, one or more place attributes may be determined and assigned a relevance score based on the one or more place attributes and the particular attributes. The place with the highest assigned relevance score may be selected as the first place.
- determining the ranking for each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content may include identifying particular attributes within the query. For each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content, one or more place attributes may be associated and a relevance score based on the one or more place attributes and the particular attributes may be assigned.
- identifying the subset of the displayable content may include selecting one or more items of displayable content in the set of displayable content which are assigned the highest relevance scores.
- one or more additional places are identified which satisfies the query within a first database and additional sets of displayable content associated with each of the one or more additional places within a second database. Additional subsets of the additional sets of displayable content may be identified for display in response to the query, the identification of the additional subsets of displayable content comprising determining a ranking for each item of displayable content in the additional sets of displayable content based on the query.
- the additional subset of displayable content and the one or more additional places may be provided.
- identifying the ranking for each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content is weighted according to the one or more associated place attributes.
- the displayable content includes one or more of webpage addresses, contact information, business information, reviews, ratings, images, and social media accounts.
- the system may include one or more computing devices and memory storing instructions, the instructions executable by the one or more computing devices.
- the instructions may include receiving a query requesting information regarding a place of interest; identifying a first place which satisfies the query associated with a first database and a set of displayable content associated with the first place within a second database; identifying a subset of the displayable content for display in response to the query, the identification of the subset of displayable content comprising determining a ranking for each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content according to the query; and providing the subset of displayable content and the first place for presentation on a client device.
- Another aspect includes a non-transitory computer readable medium on which instructions are stored, the instructions when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the steps of receiving a query requesting information regarding a place of interest; identifying a first place which satisfies the query associated with a first database and a set of displayable content associated with the first place within a second database; identifying a subset of the displayable content for display in response to the query, the identification of the subset of displayable content comprising determining a ranking for each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content according to the query; and providing the subset of displayable content and the first place for presentation on a client device.
- FIG. 1 is a functional diagram of an example system in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a pictorial diagram of the example system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates a place associated with place attributes in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 4 illustrates displayable content associated with place attributes of a place in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is an example query box with filled input parsed into particular attributes in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 6 illustrates example displayable content associated with a place in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating aspects of the disclosure.
- the technology relates to ranking photos and text based on specific attributes of a place of interest.
- the ranking applies to receiving a user query for a place, such as a place of business, and ranking displayable content related to that place based on the query.
- machine learning infrastructure may be used to associate attributes to a set of displayable content of the place, such as images or reviews. The attributes may then be used to rank the set of displayable content of the place in relation to the query.
- One or more classifiers may be trained through the machine learning infrastructure to associate attributes to a place. Annotations from text based information related to a place may be input into the machine learning infrastructure to create associations between the place and attributes detected in the input information.
- Features of the displayable content may also be associated with the place attributes of the place by the machine learning infrastructure.
- the classifier(s) may identify features in the images, such as a patio and a high-chair, as being related to one or more place attributes of “outdoor seating” and “kid-friendly,” respectively.
- the place attributes of “outdoor seating” and “kid-friendly” may then be associated with the images.
- input received from a user may be parsed to identify particular attributes within the received input.
- a text query may be parsed to identify one or more particular attributes contained in the words or phrases in the text query.
- a name of a place may be retrieved based on its relevance to the particular attributes in the received input.
- the relevance may be a relevance score calculated by determining, for each place, a level of correlation between the place attributes and the particular attributes of the received input.
- the level of correlation between place attributes and the identified particular attributes may have a greater weight than a correlation between place attributes and only some of the identified particular attributes.
- the name of the place with the highest relevance score may be retrieved and displayed in a list of search results or elsewhere, such as on an information page.
- a set of displayable content related to the retrieved place may be retrieved from a database.
- the retrieved displayable content associated with a retrieved place may be based on particular attributes ranked to determine which displayable content of the set of displayable content should be displayed in association with the place.
- the set of displayable content may be ranked based on at least one of the particular attributes in the received input and the attributes associated with each respective piece of displayable content. Specifically, displayable content of the same type, such as images, may be ranked against one another based on a relevance score.
- the relevance score may be calculated by using an impact implementation, a dot product, and/or normalization for each type of displayable content. For example, for visual content, such as an image, the level of confidence of an associated place attribute may be multiplied by a predetermined weighting factor for that particular place attribute to provide a relevance score. In the case of textual displayable content, such as reviews, the number of times an associated place attribute is mentioned may be multiplied by a predetermined weighting factor for that type of attribute to provide a relevance score.
- the relevance score may additionally or alternatively be determined by calculating the dot product between each level of confidence of an associated place attribute and the predetermined weight factors for each particular place attribute of the place. Additionally, or alternatively, the relevance score may be determined by averaging the dot products. The normalized dot products may be averaged together to determine a relevance score.
- the displayable content having the top ranking may then be prepared for presentation on a display device to a user.
- the displayable content may be displayed in a place page in association with the retrieved place, such as in a thumbnail.
- Other displayable content associated may also be present.
- the above features may be used to rank and display a plurality of reviews of the place or a set of ranked lists associated with the place.
- Ranked lists may be lists compiled based on an identified attribute.
- the features allow for returning relevant content to a user query.
- the returns may be based on the contents of the user query, therefore the retrieved information may be more relevant to the user sending the query.
- the features also allow for a user to more easily and quickly access and find information relevant to what in the user query.
- the processing speed of the system may be improved, as the system does not need to associate the content with terminology at the time of the search. Because more relevant information is retrieved, a user is more likely to return to use the system.

- machine learning infrastructure comprising one or more classifiers may be trained to associate attributes to a place.
- annotations from images, webpages, reviews, metadata, and other text based information related to a place may be input into the machine learning infrastructure, operating on a computing device, such as server 110 , to create associations between the place and attributes detected in the input information.
- Separate classifiers may be used for each attribute.
- a restaurant in Mountain View, Circle Pies 301 may be associated with place attributes such as “outdoor seating” 305 , “kid-friendly” 303 , “Mountain View” 307 and “Restaurant” 309 based on reviews associated with the restaurant.
- the place attributes may be stored in a database such as storage system 150 .

- the one or more classifiers may identify features in the images, such as a patio and a high-chair, as being related to one or more place attributes of “outdoor seating” 305 and “kid-friendly” 303 , respectively.
- the place attributes of “outdoor seating” 305 , “kid-friendly” 303 , “Mountain View” 307 and “Restaurant” 309 may then be associated to the images.
- the one or more classifiers learn to identify and associate place attributes in displayable content.
- the identification of features may be performed using image label technology.
- techniques which analyze features within an image to assign a place attribute describing the features to the image such as those that utilize statistical classification methods, may be used to automatically assign place attributes to the image.
- a machine learning model may be trained manually by assigning place attributes to features in images relative to a reference taxonomy. The trained machine learning model may then automatically assign place attributes to images in accordance with the reference taxonomy.
- Particular attributes may be identified based on input received from a user.
- Received input from the user may be a text query, a user selection, or other input received by a user.
- a text query 520 stating “outdoor seating restaurants in Mountain View,” may be input by a user into a query box 530 in response to a request for information 510 .
- the text query 520 may be parsed to identify one or more particular attributes such as “restaurant” 560 , “has outdoor seating” 570 and “in Mountain View, Calif.” 580 .
- a name of a place may be retrieved based on its relevance to the particular attributes in the received input.
- the relevance may be a relevance score calculated by determining, for each place, a level of correlation between the place attributes 303 - 309 and the particular attributes 560 - 580 of the received input.
- the name of the place with the highest relevance score may be retrieved and displayed in a list of search results or elsewhere, such as within an application or on a webpage.
- a relevance score may be determined for a subset of places. More than one place may also be retrieved and displayed. For example, the top ten places containing the highest relevance scores may be displayed.
- a greater weight may be placed on having a correlation between place attributes and all of the identified particular attributes than on a correlation between an place attributes and only some of the identified particular attributes.
- Square Pies may be associated with place attributes of “Mountain View” and “kid-friendly” while Circle Pies is associated with the place attributes of “Outdoor Seating,” 305 , “Restaurant” 309 , and “Mountain View” 307 and the particular attributes are “restaurant” 560 , “has outdoor seating” 570 and “in Mountain View, Calif.” 580 .
- Circle Pies has a strong correlation between three place attributes “Outdoor Seating,” 305 , “Restaurant” 309 , and “Mountain View” 307 with the particular attributes of “restaurant” 560 , “has outdoor seating” 570 and “in Mountain View, Calif.” 580 , instead of Square Pizza's two place attributes, in this example Circle Pies has a higher level of correlation than Square Pies.
- displayable content associated with a retrieved place is retrieved based on particular attributes.
- a set of displayable content related to the retrieved place may be retrieved from a database.
- the set of displayable content related to the retrieved place is ranked to determine which displayable content of the plurality of displayable content should be displayed in association with the place.
- the plurality of content is retrieved after receiving user input selecting the place from a list of search results.
- the set of displayable content is ranked based on at least one of the particular attributes in the received input and the attributes associated with each respective piece of displayable content. Specifically, displayable content of the same type, such as images, is ranked against one another based on a relevance score.
- a relevance score is calculated by identifying attributes associated with the displayable content and determining a level of confidence that the attributes associated with the displayable content match at least one of the particular attributes. Displayable content with the highest level of confidence that the associated attributes correlate to the particular attributes has a high relevance score, and therefore the highest ranking.
- displayable content 401 associated with Circle Pies restaurant may include image ‘A’ 601 and image ‘B’ 603 , as shown in FIG. 6 .
- image ‘A’ 601 may be associated with place attributes of “restaurant” and “has outdoor seating” and image B′ may be associated with the attribute of “restaurant”.
- image ‘A’ containing both place attributes of “restaurant” and “has outdoor seating” may be assigned a high level of confidence and thus, a high relevance score
- image ‘B’ containing only the attribute of “restaurant” may have a lower level of confidence and thus, a low relevance score. Since image ‘A’ has a higher confidence level, image ‘A’ is ranked higher than image ‘B’.
- the relevance score may be calculated by using an impact implementation, a dot product, and/or normalization.
- a relevance score may be calculated for each type of displayable content.
- the impact implementation may be determined for both visual and textual displayable content.
- the level of confidence of an associated place attribute may be multiplied by a predetermined weighting factor for that particular place attribute to provide a relevance score.
- the level of confidence of the associated place attribute “restaurant” may be multiplied by a predetermined weighting factor of, e.g., 0.8
- associated place attribute “has outdoor seating” may be multiplied by a weighting factor of, e.g., 0.2.
- the number of times an associated place attribute is mentioned may be multiplied by a predetermined weighting factor for that type of attribute to provide a relevance score.
- the relevance score may additionally or alternatively be determined by calculating the dot product between each level of confidence of an associated place attribute and the predetermined weight factors for each particular place attribute of the place. Using the dot product accounts for the presence of negative features which lower the ranking of the displayable content. For instance, if an image included a feature of wine, that image may initially be considered to be of a romantic location. However, if the image included the additional feature of a high chair, the image would likely not be considered to be of a romantic location.
- the relevance score may be determined by averaging the dot products.
- the level of confidence may be normalized by calculating the dot product for every feature-attribute pair and then dividing the dot products by monotonically increasing functions.
- the monotonically increasing functions may be a function of the number of identified features in the displayable content.
- the relevance score may be determined by averaging the normalized dot products. Normalization of the dot product may result in levels of confidence that are not as skewed towards displayable content that has a larger number of identified features, such as longer reviews or images with more tags. In some examples, normalization may further include using a threshold value for weights, such that features with weights below the threshold value are removed from the calculation of the level of confidence. Alternatively, the weights for a given displayable content may be normalized so that the average of the weights is 0.
- the displayable content having the top two rankings may be two images ‘A’ 601 and ‘B’ 603 . These two images may be displayed in a place page in association with the retrieved place. In this regard, the two images may be displayed as thumbnails.
- the place page may display the other displayable content associated with the place, such as the name of the place the ranking, the contact information, the business information, and the reviews.
- the above features may be used to rank and display a plurality of reviews of the place or a plurality of ranked lists associated with the place.
- Ranked lists may be lists compiled based on an identified attribute. For example, Circle Pies may be associated with ranked lists such as “Top Ten Kid-Friendly Restaurants in Mountain View” and “Top Ten Italian Restaurants in the Bay Area.”
- Flow diagram 700 of FIG. 7 is an example flow diagram of some of the aspects described above that may be performed by one or more computing devices such as client computing devices 120 and 130 .
- a query requesting information is received.
- a first place which satisfies the query and an associated set of displayable content is identified as shown in block 703
- a subset of the displayable content for display in response to the query is identified as shown in block 705 .
- the identification of the subset of displayable content comprises determining a ranking for each item of displayable content in the set of displayable content.
- the subset of displayable content is selected for display on a display of the client computing device.
