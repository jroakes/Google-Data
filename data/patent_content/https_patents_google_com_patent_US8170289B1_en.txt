Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to alignment of two text sequences, e.g., of a optical character recognition (OCR) output with an electronic version of the same document. More specifically, systems and methods for character-by-character alignment of two character sequences (such as OCR output from a scanned document and an electronic version of the same document) using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in a hierarchical fashion are disclosed.
- OCR optical character recognition
- HMM Hidden Markov Model
- the digitally recorded image can be manipulated or otherwise processed. For example, preprocessing algorithms may be performed to de-warp, reformat, supplement with additional information, and/or compress the digitally recorded image. After performing the preprocessing algorithms, the preprocessed image may be processed with optical character recognition (OCR) software and may be indexed to facilitate electronic search.
- OCR optical character recognition
- each preprocessing algorithm performed on the digitally recorded images as well as the particular OCR software engine utilized may affect the accuracy of the OCR output.
- the imaging conditions and/or the original (hardcopy) document itself may also affect the accuracy of the OCR output, depending on, for example, the contents of the document (e.g., language, font, font size, page size, margins, text format such as columns, embedded images, etc.), the imaging conditions (e.g., operator, positioning of the document, camera zoom, camera focus, camera angle, and the like), etc.
- the imaging conditions e.g., operator, positioning of the document, camera zoom, camera focus, camera angle, and the like
- HMM Hidden Markov Model
- Hierarchical alignment as described herein may advantageously and successfully generate an alignment even where the two character sequences are long and/or when the one or both of the characters sequences include many errors.
- the two character sequences may be an OCR output from a scanned document such as a book and an electronic text version (groundtruth) corresponding to the book.
- a typical book may have, e.g., more than 1 million characters, and/or there may be many errors in one or both of the character sequences.
- Hierarchical alignment can achieve alignment even when large portions of text are missing from one or both of the characters sequences.
- Such a scenario may occur, for example, where the two character sequences, although representing text from the same source, may be generated from or based on different editions of the same source such that one edition of the source may have a preface, introduction, and/or chapter missing as compared to the other edition of the same source.
- Such a scenario may also occur, for example, where one of the character sequences is generated by scanning the source and one or several consecutive pages are missing and/or duplicated due to errors in the scanning process.
- hierarchical alignment can also achieve alignment even when one or both of the characters sequences include many errors, such as a result of OCR errors.
- the method for character-by-character alignment may generally include aligning two character sequences utilizing multiple hierarchical levels. For each hierarchical level above a final hierarchical level, the aligning may include parsing character subsequences from the two character sequences, performing an alignment of the character subsequences, and designating aligned character subsequences as the anchors, the parsing and performing the alignment being between the anchors if the current hierarchical level is below the first hierarchical level. For the final hierarchical level, the aligning may include performing a character-by-character alignment of characters between anchors. At each hierarchical level, an HMM may be constructed and the Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the alignment.
- the hierarchical levels may, for example, include three hierarchical levels in which the character subsequences corresponding to the second hierarchical level are words such that in the second hierarchical level, the alignment is performed on words in the character sequences between the anchors obtained from the first hierarchical level.
- the two character sequences may be the output of an optical character recognition (OCR) engine on a scanned printed version of a document and an electronic text version (groundtruth) for the same document.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the document may be, for example, a book, an article, a magazine, or the like.
- the character subsequences corresponding to the first hierarchical level may be sentences.
- the alignment may be performed on sentences in the first sequence and corresponding matching sentences in the second sequence.
- the alignment may be performed on words.
- the character subsequences corresponding to the first hierarchical level may be unique words where the parsing may include locating words that occur only once in the first character sequence (e.g., groundtruth) as unique words and locating words in the second character sequence (e.g., OCR output) that correspond to the unique words. Note that words (if any) in the second character sequence corresponding to each unique word may not exist, may be unique, or may not be unique.
- the unique words in the first character sequence are aligned with words in the second character sequence corresponding to the unique words. Using unique words for the first hierarchical level in the hierarchical alignment, the hierarchical alignment may successfully generate an alignment even when there are no aligned, e.g., exactly matching, sentences in as many as, e.g., 80 pages.
- a system for generating a character-by-character alignment between a first and a second character sequence representing text in a document may generally include a text alignment engine configured to align the two character sequences in a hierarchical manner utilizing a plurality of hierarchical levels. For each hierarchical level above a final hierarchical level, the text alignment engine may be configured to parse character subsequences from the two character sequences at a current hierarchical level, perform an alignment of the parsed character subsequences, and designate aligned character subsequences at the current hierarchical level as anchors, the parse and the alignment being between the anchors if the current hierarchical level is below the first hierarchical level. For the final hierarchical level, the text alignment engine may be configured to perform a character-by-character alignment for characters between anchors.
- the system may further include a document scanner and/or an OCR engine.
- the system for generating a character-by-character alignment between a first and a second character sequence representing text in a document may be implemented as a computer program product for use in conjunction with a computer system, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium on which are stored instructions executable on a computer processor.
- the instructions may generally include aligning the two character sequences in a hierarchical manner utilizing a plurality of hierarchical levels.
- the instructions for aligning may include parsing character subsequences from the two character sequences at a current hierarchical level, performing an alignment of the parsed character subsequences, and designating aligned character subsequences at the current hierarchical level as anchors, the parsing and the alignment being between the anchors if the current hierarchical level is below the first hierarchical level.
- the instructions for aligning may include performing a character-by-character alignment for characters between the anchors.

- HMM Hidden Markov Model
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary system 20 for generating a character-by-character alignment 32 between the OCR output 28 of a scanned document 26 and an electronic version 22 of the document 24 .
- documents 24 include books, articles, magazines, and other printed material.
- the electronic version 22 of the document 24 is also referred to herein as the groundtruth.
- Examples of errors in the electronic version 22 of the document 24 include missing pages or sections.
- the electronic version 22 is typically of the exact same document 24 , the electronic version may be of a different version or edition of the same document 22 .
- the document 24 may first be scanned (e.g., imaged) using a document scanning systems 25 to generate one or more digital images 26 of the document 24 on which OCR may be performed by an OCR engine 27 to generate OCR text output 28 .
- a document scanning systems 25 to generate one or more digital images 26 of the document 24 on which OCR may be performed by an OCR engine 27 to generate OCR text output 28 .
- Any suitable combination of various document scanning systems 25 and OCR engines 27 e.g., any commercially available OCR engine
- the OCR text output 28 and the electronic version of the document 22 may then be used as input to a text alignment engine 30 .
- the text alignment engine 30 may model the alignment utilizing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in a hierarchical fashion in that each hierarchical level corresponds to a different subsequences of the document text and the aligned subsequences in a given hierarchical level are used as anchors in a subsequent lower hierarchical level until character by character alignment is completed.
- HMM Hidden Markov Model
- the text alignment engine 30 may employ various hierarchical structures in performing character-by-character alignment.
- character by character alignment can be achieved in a hierarchical fashion by first aligning sentences in the groundtruth and the OCR text output.
- this sentence hierarchical level only the sentences are aligned using an HMM.
- This sentence level alignment produces sentence anchors where sentence align.
- These sentence anchors can then be used to divide the text sequence into smaller subsequences, i.e., the text between the sentence anchors.
- an HMM is used to align words between two sentence anchors.
- the characters between any two aligned words can then be aligned using an HMM.
- character by character alignment can be achieved in a hierarchical fashion by first aligning unique words in the groundtruth with words in the OCR text output that correspond to the unique words in the groundtruth.
- This unique word hierarchical level only the unique words are aligned using an HMM.
- This unique word level alignment produces unique word anchors where the unique words align.
- These unique word anchors can then be used to divide the text sequence into smaller subsequences, i.e., the text between the unique word anchors.
- an HMM is used to align the remaining (non-unique) words between two unique word anchors to generate non-unique word anchors.
- the characters between two aligned non-unique word can then be aligned using an HMM.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process 40 for generating the character-by-character alignment in a hierarchical fashion between the OCR output of the scanned document and the electronic version of the document.
- the document is scanned or otherwise imaged to generate digital images.
- OCR is performed on the digital images.
- a character-by-character alignment between the OCR output and the groundtruth is performed, as designated by reference numeral 60 .
- the process 40 then outputs the character-by-character alignment at block 54 .
- any extra OCR text e.g., text included in the OCR text but not included in the groundtruth
- Examples of extra OCR text include pages that are scanned multiple times, preface (which is often not included in the groundtruth text), and the like.
- the character-by-character alignment process 60 may be implemented as an iterative process in which alignment is modeled using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in a hierarchical fashion.
- HMMs are an effective way of aligning sequences.
- the HMM is constructed with a state for each position (corresponding to the unit, e.g., sentence, word, character, etc. being aligned) in the OCR text output.
- the state space is the set of all positions of unit strings (corresponding to the unit or subsequence being aligned) in the groundtruth sequence. Each state is assumed to generate one of the OCR unit strings.
- probabilities or costs are associated with each state.
- At each state there is a probability for generating the observation (observation or generative probabilities) and a probability associated with each transition between states (transition probabilities).
- the transition probability can be computed using an exponential decay function.
- the observation probability can be estimated by examining the difference between the OCR unit string corresponding to the current state and the unit string being generated. Where the alignment criterion is an exact match, a state with an exact match can be given a very high probability and a state without an exact match can be given a very low probability.
- the probability can be estimated as a function of the alignment criterion (e.g., edit distance) between the two unit strings (e.g., sentences) being aligned.
- the transition probability is generally a function of how many groundtruth positions are skipped and can be estimated using an exponential backoff algorithm.
- the alignment can be generated by finding the most probable (least cost) sequence in the HMM, e.g., using the Viterbi algorithm. In other words, the alignment of the sequence is simply the highest-probability, or lowest-cost, path through the HMM.
- the Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the alignment at each hierarchical level.
- the HMM is employed in a hierarchical fashion in that each hierarchical level corresponds to a different document subsequence and the aligned document subsequences in a given hierarchical level are used as anchors in a subsequent lower hierarchical level until character by character alignment is completed.
- the hierarchical structure may be employed for purposes of speed and/or accuracy. Specifically, because a document such as a book may be very long, i.e., a very long text sequence of characters, character by character alignment can be achieved more efficiently and effectively in a hierarchical fashion. Aligning every word or character in a book (i.e., in a non-hierarchical fashion) would likely create a very long state sequence resulting in a very slow alignment process.
- the alignment could be erroneous as it would be much more difficult to recover from errors.
- the hierarchical structure allows alignment even in situations where there are a large number of consecutive pages missing and/or there are large number of errors in the OCR text output.
- each hierarchical level 46 document subsequences are parsed and aligned between the OCR text output and the groundtruth at block at block 48 .
- each aligned document subsequence may be designated as an anchor for use in the next hierarchical level 52 until character by character alignment is completed.
- post-processing based on heuristic rules can also be performed at block 50 to deal with any extra OCR text in the OCR output after the HMM-based alignment.
- Extra text in the OCR output may result from, for example, omitted texts in the groundtruth and/or other reasons.
- the HMM tends to align all the extra unit strings in a continuous section of OCR output to one unit string in the groundtruth.
- Heuristic rules may be used to decide which unit string in a given continuous section of OCR output is the real correspondence of that aligned unit string in the groundtruth and decide that other unit strings in the continuous section of the OCR output is extra OCR text.
- the heuristic rules may require that, if there are unit strings in a given section of OCR output that exactly match the assigned unit string in the groundtruth, the first exactly matched string in the section of OCR output be selected and designate the other unit strings in the section of the OCR output as extra OCR text.
- the heuristic rules may require that the similarities of each unit string in this section of OCR output to the assigned unit string in the groundtruth as well as the neighbors of the assigned unit string in the groundtruth may be calculated.
- the heuristic rules may further require that if the similarities are lower than some predetermined threshold, this unit string in the OCR output is designated as extra OCR text.
- a character-by-character alignment process 60 may employ various hierarchical structures.
- a character-by-character alignment process 60 a may employ three hierarchical levels in which the document subsequences corresponding to the three hierarchical levels include sentences, words, and characters.
- sentences are parsed and aligned between the OCR output and groundtruth using a sentence level HMM.
- perfectly aligned sentences or sentences satisfying other sentence alignment criteria
- sentence anchors for the next (lower) hierarchical level.
- sentences may be parsed using, for example, periods, exclamation points, and question marks.
- sentence anchors typically, only sentences that are aligned with relatively high accuracy are designated as sentence anchors.
- edit distance may be used as a criterion for determining the accuracy of the alignment at the sentence level.
- sentence level HMM each position in the HMM is assumed to correspond to a sentence in the OCR output.
- the generative probabilities in the sentence level HMM can be estimated by examining the similarity between the sentences in the OCR text output and the groundtruth while the transitional probabilities can be estimated using a backoff algorithm.
- a Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the most likely sentence alignment.
- words are parsed and aligned between the OCR output and groundtruth using an HMM and using the sentence anchors.
- the output of the sentence level alignment e.g., the sentence anchors
- the sentence anchors can be used to constrain the word level alignment such that a word level HMM model is used to align only words between the sentence anchors, e.g., word level alignment is performed only for words between the sentence anchors.
- the sentence anchors facilitates in breaking up the character sequences into subsequences that can then be separated and thus efficiently aligned at the next hierarchical (e.g., word) level.
- perfectly aligned words are designated as word anchors for the next (lower) hierarchical level.
- the word level HMM is similar to the sentence level HMM. For example, each position in the word level HMM is assumed to correspond to a word in the OCR output and the word level alignment is only done for words in the OCR output that are between the sentence anchors.
- the generative probabilities in the word level HMM can be estimated by examining the similarity between the words in the OCR text output and the groundtruth while the transitional probabilities can be estimated using a backoff algorithm.
- a Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the most likely word alignment.
- characters are aligned between the OCR output and groundtruth using an HMM and using the word anchors.
- the process for character level alignment is similar to that for word alignment.
- the output of the word level alignment e.g., the word anchors
- each position in the character level HMM is assumed to correspond to a character in the OCR output.
- the generative probabilities in the character level HMM can be estimated by examining the similarity between the characters in the OCR text output and the groundtruth while the transitional probabilities can be estimated using backoff algorithm.
- a Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the most likely character alignment.
- constructing the HMM for character-by-character alignment in a hierarchical fashion e.g., by constraining the HMM construction at each subsequent hierarchical level using anchors or points determined in a previous (higher) hierarchical level, can help increase computational speed and thus reduce time and cost.
- the anchors generated at each hierarchical level (except the final hierarchical level) break up the character sequences into subsequences that can then be separately and efficiently aligned.
- such hierarchical HMM construction may also facilitate achieving higher accuracy, e.g., by allowing character-by-character alignment even in situations where there are a large number of consecutive pages missing and/or there are a relatively large number of errors in the OCR text output.
- the character-by-character alignment process 60 may employ various suitable hierarchical structures.
- character by character alignment can be achieved in a hierarchical fashion by first locating unique words, i.e., words that occur only once, in the groundtruth, as well as words in the OCR text output corresponding to those unique words.
- the words in the OCR text output corresponding to the unique words in the groundtruth may or may not be unique due to, for example, errors and/or other differences between the two versions of the documents. Only the unique words in the groundtruth and their correspondences in the OCR text output are aligned using an HMM. This unique word level alignment produces unique word anchors where the unique words align.
- unique word anchors can then be used to divide the text sequence into smaller subsequences, i.e., the text between the unique word anchors.
- an HMM is used to align words between two unique word anchors.
- all the characters between any two aligned words can then be aligned using an HMM. This example of hierarchical alignment is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating another example of a character-by-character alignment process 60 b that employs three hierarchical levels in which the document subsequences corresponding to the three hierarchical levels include unique words, words between unique word anchors, and characters. In other words, rather than using sentences for the top level alignment, the top level alignment utilizes unique words.
- each unique word in the list is located in the OCR text output. Note that for each unique word in the list generated from the groundtruth, 0, 1 or multiple matches may be located in the OCR text output due to scanning errors (e.g., a missing page(s) and/or page(s) scanned multiple times), OCR output errors, a different edition of the document, a portion of the document (e.g., the preface) not included in the groundtruth, etc.
- unique words are aligned between the OCR output and groundtruth using a unique word level HMM.
- the unique word level HMM uses the unique words in the groundtruth and their correspondences in the OCR text output.
- perfectly aligned unique words or unique words satisfying other unique word alignment criteria
- unique word anchors are designated as unique word anchors for the next (lower) hierarchical level.
- unique word anchors typically, only unique words that are exactly matching are designated as unique word anchors.
- only unique words in the groundtruth and their correspondences in the OCR text output are used for the alignment.
- multiple-word sequences may be used for alignment at the unique word hierarchical level.
- Each multiple-word sequence may include the unique word (or its correspondence) as well as adjacent words (e.g., one or two words to each side of the unique word or its correspondence).
- each position in the HMM is assumed to correspond to a unique word in the OCR output.
- the generative probabilities in the unique word level HMM can be estimated by examining the similarity between the unique words in the OCR text output and the groundtruth while the transitional probabilities can be estimated using a backoff algorithm.
- a Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the most likely unique word alignment.
- the unique word level alignment provides unique word anchors or points to constrain or guide the alignment at the next hierarchical, e.g., the non-unique word level alignment at block 78 .
- the unique word anchors break up the character sequences into subsequences that can then be separated and thus efficiently aligned.
- the non-unique word level alignment at block 78 is similar to the word level alignment of block 64 as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the remaining (e.g., non-unique) words are aligned between the OCR output and the groundtruth using a remaining word level HMM and the unique word anchors.
- perfectly aligned words may be designated as remaining word anchors for use in alignment in the next (lower) hierarchical level.
- characters are aligned between the OCR output and groundtruth using a character level HMM and using the non-unique word anchors.
- the character-level alignment at block 80 is similar to the character alignment of block 66 as described above with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the output of the non-unique word level alignment e.g., the non-unique word anchors
- each position in the character level HMM is assumed to correspond to a character in the OCR output.
- the generative probabilities in the character level HMM can be estimated by examining the similarity between the characters in the OCR text output and the groundtruth while the transitional probabilities can be estimated using backoff algorithm.
- a Viterbi algorithm may be employed to solve for the most likely character alignment.
- the automatic alignment of OCR output can be utilized to evaluate various factors that affect the error rate of the OCR output.
- factors include, for example, effect of any preprocessing algorithms performed on the scanned (e.g., digitally recorded) images, the particular OCR software engine utilized, factors relating to the original document itself and/or the imaging conditions.
- factors that relate to the original document itself may include, for example, the language, font, font size, page size, margins, text format such as columns, embedded images, etc.
- Factors that relate to the imaging conditions may include, for example, the operator, positioning of the document, camera zoom, camera focus, camera angle, and the like.
- the automatic alignment systems and methods described herein may also be utilized to calibrate other techniques for estimating OCR error rates on the fly, for example. Further, the systems and methods described herein can also be utilized to generate training data to help improve existing OCR software.
