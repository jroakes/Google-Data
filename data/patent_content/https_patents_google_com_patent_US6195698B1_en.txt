Definitions
- This invention relates generally to accessing computer systems using a communication network, and more particularly to accepting service requests of a server computer on a selective basis.
- the Internet is a highly-distributed computer network that connects computers all over the world.
- One way to classify the computers of the Internet is as client computers and server computers. Operators of the server computers provide “Internet” services and products to users of the client computers.
- the different types of client and server computers are too numerous to detail here.
- Providers of Internet services may want to restrict access to their servers only to human users. That is, the providers would like to deny accesses made by automated “agents” operating on behalf of users.
- An agent is some software program, or script generator that can mimic user accesses. It is well known on the Internet that many agents are intentionally designed to behave in a malicious, destructive, or otherwise annoying “anti-social” manner. Therefore, service providers would like to deny access by agents.
- advertising revenue is usually based on the number of times that advertisements are displayed when service requests are made. Unlike displaying the advertisement to a user, displaying the advertisement to an automated agent has no value. Consequently, useful advertising impact is better estimated when accesses by automated agents are denied.
- spam is the term used to describe useless electronic messages (e-mail).
- a spamming agent usually at a very low cost, sends a message to a large number of users.
- spamm is of narrow interest. The hope of the spammer is to make a profit even if only a small fraction of the recipients respond.
- spamming agents are generally considered counter-productive because processing spam wastes network resources and people's time. Therefore, suppressing spam generated by agents can save substantial resources.
- a variant of spam arises in the context of Web search engines, such as Digital Equipment Corporation's AltaVista search engine.
- Search engines maintain full word indexes of Web pages. Users submit queries to locate Web pages of interest. In the case where many Web pages satisfy the query, the result set of Web pages is rank ordered according to some weighted frequency metric.
- Search engines are subject to abuse, in particular by electronic agents.
- an electronic agent may request the search engine to index many useless or deceptive Web pages to boost the visibility of a particular topic.
- the agent could use AltaVista's “Add-URL” facility to add pages to its index.
- “page-boosting” cannot be entirely eliminated because users can always submit individual pages one at the time, denying access to agents will reduce this abuse to a manageable trickle.
- Agents should also be denied access to proprietary information.
- a server might maintain an on-line encyclopedia, or an online collection of web pages such as the Yahoo service. Providers of such services would like to eliminate improper access to their proprietary information because an agent could otherwise easily obtain a large percentage of a database and establish a competing service.
- Digital Equipment Corporation offered a Web service that collected and displayed polling data during the primary elections of October 1996.
- this service displayed an American flag in a random position on the screen, and then required the user to click on the flag before entering an opinion.
- a person could not quickly enter an opinion many times.
- a server computer to be able to distinguish an ordinary user from an automated agent so that access by the agent can be denied, and while still permitting access to real human users.
- a method and apparatus for selectively accepting access requests from a client computer connected to a server computer by a network for example, the Internet and the World Wide Web.
- the connection between the client and server can use the Internet Protocol, and the interactions between the client and server can be conducted using Web pages.
- the server computer receives an access request from the client computer via the network.
- the server computer generates a predetermined number of human-perceptible random characters, for example, letters and numbers.
- the random characters are used to form a string in the server computer.
- the string is randomly modified either visually or audibly to form a riddle.
- the character can be visually distorted and overlaid on a random visually “noisy” background such as a maze.
- the string is processed by a speech synthesizer with an appropriate level of distortion or noise added.
- the original string i.e., the correct answer to the riddle, is still easy to recover by the user. While automated computation of the answer will take a substantial amount of time, if it can be done all.
- the server computer renders the riddle on an output device of the client computer, for example a display terminal or a loudspeaker.
- the client computer sends an answer to the server. Hopefully, the answer is a user's guess for the correct answer.
- the server determines if the guess is the correct answer, by comparing the answer with the unmodified string.
- the access request is accepted. If the correct answer is not received within a predetermined amount of time, the connection between the client and server computer is terminated by the server on the assumption an automated agent is operating in the client computer on behalf of the user.

- a widely distributed network of computers 100 includes numerous client computers 110 connected to server computers 120 by a network 130 , e.g., the Internet.
- the servers 120 provide “Internet” services and products to users of the clients 110 .
- the Internet includes an application interface called the World Wide Web (the “Web”) 131 .
- the computers communicate with each other using messages that include the addresses of the sending and receiving computers; these addresses are called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the client computers 110 can be personal computers, workstations, or laptops. Typically, the clients 110 are equipped with input devices 115 , such as a keyboard and a mouse, and output devices 116 such as a loudspeaker and a display terminal.
- Software in the form of a Web browser 111 for example, the Netscape Navigator, or the Microsoft Internet Explorer, interacts with the I/O devices 115 - 116 to provide an interface between the client user and the Web 131 .
- the server computers 120 are usually larger computer systems, although this does not always need to be so.
- Some of the servers e.g., Web “sites,” maintain a database (DB) 121 of Web pages 122 .
- Each Web page 122 is identified and can be located by its name, e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- the pages 122 can include “links” to other pages. A user can “click” on a link of a page viewed with the browser 111 to retrieve a linked page.
- Other servers maintain an index 123 of the content of Web pages. These servers are called search engines. Search engines accept search requests in the form of queries posed by users to locate Web pages having content on a specified topic. Some of the servers may provide other products and services 124 that can be reached by using the browser 111 .
- agent script generator
- a procedure 300 randomly generates “riddles” with corresponding answers that are easy for human users to answer.
- the riddles are very difficult to solve by the automated agent 119 .
- An access protocol 500 that interacts with the riddle generator ensures that a server only responds to requests from clients that are capable of solving the generated riddles.
- procedure 300 and the protocol 500 act to bar requests made of the server by automated agents. We describe particular implementations for each of these parts; others are possible, but the embodiments we described herein are preferred.
- FIG. 3 shows the details of the procedure 300 for generating riddles.
- step 310 we generate human perceptible random characters 311 . Any of the generated characters 311 can be rendered on the output devices 116 so that they can be viewed by a user.
- step 320 we select a small number of the random characters to form a string 321 .
- the number of characters used to form the string 321 needs to be long enough to prevent the agent 119 from solving the riddles simply by using brute-force guessing techniques, yet not so long as to unnecessarily annoy the user.
- the number of characters used depends on the processing power of available computers and how much time is available to solve the riddle. At this time, a string of eight characters long combined with a time limit of five minutes seems sufficient.
- step 330 we next randomize the “appearance” of the string 321 to obtain a “morphed” string 331 .
- This can be done using several techniques. For example, each character can be rendered in a different randomly selected font. The spacing between characters can be varied depending on the size of the character, and distance from a baseline to the character. Some of the characters can be rendered close enough together so that they partially intersect.
- Each character, as well as the entire string, can randomly be stretched or distorted in any number of ways.
- the string can follow a random path, e.g., rather than following a straight path, the characters of the string can follow a curved path like the letter W, although care must be taken here to ensure that the string does not loop back on itself.
- the string can randomly be rotated around a randomly selected point; e.g., the string might be mirror-reversed.
- a confusing random background 341 is chosen on which the string is overlaid; a random maze may be one good choice.
- the characters of the string can be rendered in various randomly chosen colors that are visually distinct from the background pattern, for instance the character coloring can use a different maze-type pattern.
- OCR optical character recognition
- step 350 the randomly-processed string is rendered so that it can be seen by a user of one of the client computers 110 .
- the rendering can be done on the display terminal 116 of the client computer 110 using the browser 111 .
- Alternative rendering techniques are described below.
- FIG. 4 shows an example use of the randomly-generated string.
- a portion of a Web page 400 is shown.
- the Web page 400 is constructed using Hyper-Text Mark-up Language (HTML) so all rendering and protocol interactions can be managed from the server.
- the server in this example is a search engine, e.g., AltaVista.
- the AltaVista search engine has a feature called Add-URL that allows Web-site owners to register their site(s) with the search engine's index 123 , see “http://www.altavista.digital.com/av/content/addurl.htm”.
- the user submits a URL, and the search engine indexes all Web pages at this site.
- the Add-URL feature is subject to abuse by people who wish to unfairly increase the chances of AltaVista serving up their pages in response to a query. They do this by using electronic agents to submit a large number of URLs for each site. Our method can be used to prevent this.
- the page 400 fundamentally includes three fields 410 , 420 , and 430 ; some of these fields, called forms, allow user interaction—that is, the fields accept typed input from the user.
- the riddle is displayed in field 410 .
- the human eye can easily discern a sequence of letters “5@3wp %1u” among the background clutter.
- the guess is typed in the field 420 . Checking of the guess is done in a case-insensitive manner. If the guess is correct, and a predetermined time constraint is met, then the server accepts input from field 430 , a URL, to add the user's Web page to the search engines index.
- the search engine can also index any other Web pages at the same site, or perform other services, for example, a request to delete a Web page.
- the server 120 possesses a master secret, denoted “MS,” known to it alone.
- the server also can perform a cryptographic hash function H that combines terms (D 1 , D 2 , . . . , Dn).
- the cryptographic hash function can be a function such as MD 5 or SHS. Hash functions “scramble” bits, and as a result tampering with hashed values is easily to detect.
- Cryptographic hash functions have the useful property that they are hard to invert. For example, given H(D1, D2), and D2, there is no efficient way to determine D1.
- Cryptographic hash functions are also collision-resistant in the sense that it is hard to find two inputs that yield the same output. See “Applied Cryptography” by Schneier for details on known cryptographic hash functions.
- the basic protocol between the client 110 and the server 120 proceeds as follows.
- the client 110 sends a request Q 510 to the server 120 .
- the request Q 510 might be “Add my URL to your index.”
- the server upon receipt of the request, replies to the client 110 with information R, T, Q, H(S, T, Q, MS) 520 , where R is the randomly-generated riddle from the string of random characters as described above.
- R is the randomly-generated riddle from the string of random characters as described above.
- the value T is the current server time
- Q is the original request 510
- S is the string that is used to form the riddle—that is the correct answer to the riddle.
- the hashing of the combination of the correct answer S, the values T, and the request Q, with the secret MS This information can only be used by one who has possession of the master secret, i.e., the server computer.
- the client replies to the server with A, T, Q, H(S, T, Q, MS) 530 , where A is the user's guessed answer to the riddle, as typed with any hard-to-distinguish characters, case adjusted, in field 420 above.
- the other values are copied directly from the server's reply 520 .
- the other values can be copied using HTML as stated above, so all the user needs to do is to type the guess; the server controls the rest of the interaction.
- the server Upon receipt of the message containing the guess, the server computes H(A, T, Q, MS) and compares this value with H(S, T, Q, MS) to determine if the guess is the correct answer, i.e., the string S. If the riddle is not answered in the required time, then the server can terminate the connection under the assumption the request was generated by an agent of the client, and not the user. Otherwise, if the riddle is solved in less than the required time, for example less than five minutes, the server can allow the request Q and provide a response 540 .
- Our basic protocol has the advantage of being totally confined to a static state, initially knowing the master secret and a cryptographic hash function to apply to any sequence of bits. Other than that, the server 120 does not have to remember anything beyond the current message being processed according to our protocol, no matter how many requests are outstanding from other users. This saves memory resources, and simplifies our protocol implementation.
- the client sends a generic request for service message Q 610 to the server.
- the particular request, Q is sent later with the guess in this variation of the protocol.
- the server replies in message 620 with R, a random riddle generated as described above, the current server time T, and H(S, T, MS), where S is the correct answer to R.
- the client replies with A (the user's answer), Q (the particular request the user wishes granted, T, and H(S, T, MS), all but S copied directly from the server's reply 620 .
- the server computes H(A, T, MS) and compares this value with H(S, T, MS). If these values are identical, and the difference between T and the current server time is less than the maximum time allowed to solve the riddle, and the server has not recently honored a request with the same associated hash value H(S,T, MS), then the server carries out the request Q and provides a response 640 .
- the server must store a list of the H(S, T, MS) values it has recently sent out. After the time in the saved hash value is older than the maximum time allowed to solve the riddle, the hashed value can be discarded as it is no longer needed to prevent replays.
- the server can detect replays by keeping a list of T's it has recently sent out in 620 . If a given T is the same as that of a request recently serviced, then the new request is refused.
- This alternative relies on the fact that the server's clock increments time at a fast enough rate so that no user-generated requests can be received in the same clock tick; in other words the value T also uniquely identifies service requests.
- the server only needs to keep recent T values. In fact, it suffices to keep just the lower-order bits of the T values; that is, only those bits that change during the riddle-solving time period. This reduces the amount of memory needed to store the states associated with various user requests.
- the client sends a generic request Q for service 710 .
- the server replies with R, ID 720 , where R is our random riddle, Q is the user's actual request, and ID is a unique transaction identifier.
- the server stores the values ID, S, and T together; in other words, the answer and the current time are associated with the ID.
- the client replies A, Q, and ID 730 , where A is the user's guess for the correct answer to the riddle, and ID is copied from 720 .
- the server compares the correct answer S of the associated ID with the guessed answer A. If these values are identical, and the time T is close enough to the current time, and the server has not recently honored a request with transaction identifier ID, then a response 740 is provided.
- the values ID, S, and T can be removed after the predetermined interval has expired, or when multiple requests are received in a very short time interval, i.e., a rate which could not generated by a user, but could be indicative of an automated agent. This variation uses more state, but may be faster because there is no need to compute cryptographic hash functions.
- Extra space can also be used to increase security by maintaining a count with each ID of how many times its associated riddle has been guessed at. If too many wrong answers are submitted for a given riddle before the correct answer is given, then service may be refused. This is equivalent to adding a maximum number of guesses per riddle limit in addition to the existing maximum time limit.
- identifications of the client and the server can be based on IP addresses, or on more elaborate cryptographic credentials.
- IP addresses we consider the use of IP addresses, as these are most immediately applicable in the current context of the Web. We describe how to add the client's IP address to our basic protocol. The treatment of the other protocols is analogous.
- the client 110 sends a request Q 810 to the server 120 .
- the server replies R, T, Q, H(S, T, Q, AC, MS) 820 , where AC is the IP address of the client.
- the client replies to the server with A, T, Q, H(S, T, Q, AC, MS) 830 , where all values but A are copied from 820 .
- the server computes H(A, T, Q, AC, MS) and compares this value with H(S, T, Q, AC, MS) to determine if the guess is correct in which case the request 810 is honored.
- the IP address AC it can be determined when messages 810 and 830 came from the same source.
- the above described protocol variants require the user to solve one riddle for each request. It may be desirable in some cases to relax this requirement. For example, the server may present a new riddle less frequently, for example, a new random riddle is generated for each five requests. This requires much less work of the user while still greatly limiting the abilities of automated agents. Our protocols are easily modified to support limited replay of this form.
- the server can combine any of our protocols with a standard revokable password system.
- a user without a valid password is required to answer one riddle per request. If it is determined after a trial period that the user is acting responsibly, then the server can issue the user with a personal password that would allow users to request services without the need to solve further riddles.
- the password can be sent to the client using any type of private/public key exchange, for example, Diffie-Hellman.
- the server can subsequently monitor the rate of requests, and if the rate is indicative of an agent, the server can revoke the user's password, forcing the user to start solving riddles again.
- IP address of the originating client can be used for this purpose, or, in the case of Web services, we could employ the HTTP “‘cookie” mechanism for this purpose, see
- a cookie is a file that a server can leave in a client's memory for subsequent examination.
- the riddle does not necessarily need to be presented to the user as an image on a display device.
- Other rendering modalities such as text or speech, can also be used.
- the riddle can be expressed as a natural language question, for example, “Please type the third letter of the word seventeen, followed by a comma and a semi-colon.” In this case, the string “v,;” is the correct answer.
- the server can randomly pose other types of natural language questions. It should be noted that presenting riddles in this manner may be easier for agents to decipher.
- the string generator 910 produces a random string 911 .
- a speech synthesizer 920 is used to convert the string 911 to an audio file 921 .
- the audio file is then distorted by a noise generator 930 to produce a noisy string 931 .
- the string is rendered ( 940 ) on the loudspeaker 116 of the client as audible text.
- the invention can be used by visually-impaired users.
- Our invention poses riddles that are difficult to solve by agents, but easy to answer by humans.
