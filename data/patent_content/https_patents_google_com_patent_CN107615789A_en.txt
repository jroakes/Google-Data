Embodiment
It is related to the notice participated in based on downstream user in terms of the disclosure and orients (target).Content shared platform can to
Family provides media content item (for example, video), and can provide a user and be notified on some items of media content purposes.Example
Such as, notice can be provided a user to be uploaded to content shared platform to user's alarm particular media content item.Notice can
Identify media content item and the items of media content purpose pointed at content shared platform is provided and link so that user can pass through
Chain in notice, which fetches, checks or accesses the media content item.
Negative consequence can be had by providing a user a large amount of notices.For example, unsolicited notice may be considered as not conform to
Need, and user's deactivation notice may be caused to receive.In some cases, user may stop using be transmitted across it is more or not
The content shared platform of relevant notice.
Tight ness rating score can be used for by notify be directed to user and indicate be supplied to user notice whether with user's phase
Close and/or needed for user.Tight ness rating score can be interacted based on user with what is notified.For example, if user passes through in notice
Links and accesses media content item, then it can increase the tight ness rating score corresponding to the classification of the notice.Tight ness rating can be next based on
The subsequent notification of same category is supplied to user by score.For example, if tight ness rating score is in instruction user to corresponding point
Level of the notice with high interest-degree of class, then the subsequent notification for being supplied to user can be same or similar classification.Point of notice
Class can be channel of notification type (for example, transmitting type), the theme of the content item notified including the content item etc.
Deng.In certain embodiments, user can be associated with multiple tight ness rating scores, wherein each in the tight ness rating score of user
Corresponding to the different classifications of notice.
However, do not notified for user's generation on items of media content purpose notice but user by described described in access
Participated in the case of media content item in the items of media content purpose situation, may relatively be difficult to be directed to the notice metering user
Interest-degree.May be in first device (for example, mobile for example, it may be possible to which the notice for particular media content item is supplied to
Phone) on receive and check the notice for particular media content item but the media content may not be accessed by the notice
The user of project.But the media content can be accessed from second device (for example, desktop computer) in time later, user
Project.Similarly, can be that user generates notice and placed it in notification queue, but user may be for media content
The notice of project is provided to user and accesses the media content item before.In both cases, user's access media content
Project may not cause the tight ness rating score associated with the classification of corresponding notice to increase.
The aspect of the disclosure solves above and other shortcoming by following：Analyze downstream user behavior is to identify user
It is no may to be the user generation notify it is interested, although user not over it is described notice access media in
Appearance project.Notice (for example, be transmitted to the device of user or be placed in notification queue) is being generated for example, can analyze
To identify, whether user has checked spy after having generated for items of media content purpose notice for the behavior of user afterwards
Determine media content item.If user has checked media content item without passing through generated notice access media content
Project, then it can increase the tight ness rating score corresponding to the classification of the notice.Tight ness rating score, which can be then used in, to be notified later
It is directed to user.For example, the subsequent notification corresponding to the classification of the tight ness rating score can be supplied to the user.
As an example, content shared platform can receive video.It can will identify video and the link of the sensing video is provided
Notification transmission to user mobile phone.User can check the notice on her mobile phone and can be in the time later
The video is searched in content shared platform from her desktop computer.Participated in by analyzing downstream user, user can be based on
Media content item rather than the notice access media content project by being transferred to mobile phone are checked on the desktop
To increase the tight ness rating score corresponding to the notice transmitted.
Therefore, the aspect of the disclosure by identification is possible to user related and/or is that notice needed for user improves
Notice orientation.The notice orientation of this improvement can increase the movement of the Mobile solution utilization rate of user to depending critically upon notice
Using particularly important.

It is controlled by by how content shared platform 120 collects on the information of user and use.
Fig. 2 is for being participated in based on downstream user come the flow chart of the illustrative methods of directed media content notice.Typically
For, method 200 can be by may include hardware (for example, processing unit, circuit, special logic, FPGA, microcode etc.), soft
Part (for example, the instruction run in processing unit) or the processing logic of its combination perform.In certain embodiments, method 200
It can be performed by Fig. 1 notification manager 131.
As shown in Fig. 2 method 200 can by handle logic identification for user generate notice (on media content
Project) start.Notice can identify from the data acquisition system of user behavior.The data acquisition system of user behavior may correspond to user in content
The compilation of the activity (for example, viewing video) participated in shared platform.For example, the data acquisition system of user behavior may include user
The list of all videos through being checked in special time period (for example, 30 days in the past).The data acquisition system of user behavior can also wrap
Include the list of the notice corresponding to user.The list of notice may include the notice (" having transmitted notice ") for having been communicated to user and
It is queued for passing to the notice of user (" having been lined up notifying ").Data acquisition system may correspond to user and content shared platform
Interactive daily record or record.In certain embodiments, notification manager 131 is recognizable by the notice transmission of new music video
To the mobile phone of user, or for user generate the notice of new music video and place it in notification queue with
For time tranfer later to user mobile phone to user.Notice may include the reference (for example, link) to music video.
In frame 220, processing logic can determine that whether user interacts with the media content item.For example, notification manager
131 can parse the data acquisition system of user behavior to identify whether user accesses or watched the music video.It is for example, executable
Search for identify user in special time period (for example, first first three ten days) the interior media content item checked, and can hand over
Fork may be received with user with reference to the media content item that user has checked or for any of user's generation
Notice.For example, search can be based on MapReduce framework.
In frame 230, processing logic may further determine that whether user has interacted with items of media content purpose notice.Example
Such as, whether notification manager 131 can parse the data acquisition system of user behavior and be had clicked on to identify user or otherwise selected
The link in notice is selected to watch music video.For example, it may be determined that whether provided a user specific notification and user
Through checking in notice the media content item identified with notifying to interact.
At frame 240, processing logic may be in response to determine that user has interacted with media content item and not yet with leading to
Bosom friend mutually calculates tight ness rating score of the user relative to notice.For example, user may be total to by search or browsing content
Platform is enjoyed to find out music video rather than watch music video by the links and accesses video in notice.In such situation
Under, positive tight ness rating signal will be provided to the tight ness rating score associated with notice, even if user is not over the link in notice
Access video.
Tight ness rating signal can be used for increasing or reducing tight ness rating score.For example, positive tight ness rating signal can increase corresponding to logical
The tight ness rating score for the classification known, and negative tight ness rating signal can reduce tight ness rating score.In some embodiments, it is higher close
Degree score may indicate that user can find to notify in media content item it is similar media content item it is more desirable.In other realities
Apply in mode, relatively low tight ness rating score may indicate that user can find to notify in the similar items of media content of media content item
Mesh is more desirable.
Various factors on notice can influence contribution level of the tight ness rating signal to tight ness rating score.One such factor
Can be on the transmission method (for example, mobile notice, chat notice, email notification etc.) of notice.In certain embodiments, move
The tight ness rating signal of dynamic notice is contributed tight ness rating score bigger than the tight ness rating signal of email notification.It is for example, mobile
The positive tight ness rating signal of notice can make tight ness rating score increase two points, and the positive tight ness rating signal of email notification can make tightly
Density score increases a point.Thus, the type for the notice for providing the user or generating can have the different changes of tight ness rating score
Change so that the first notification type can cause the first of tight ness rating score to change, and the second notification type can cause tight ness rating score
Second change, wherein first change it is different with the second change.
The media content that tight ness rating signal can be notice to another factor of the contribution level of tight ness rating score can be influenceed
The type of project.In certain embodiments, items of media content purpose type can on subscribe to media content, suggest media content,
Popular media content refers to media content.Subscription media content may correspond to subscription topic channel, and (user is shared flat in content
The video channel subscribed on platform) in media content item.Built it is recommended that media content may correspond to content shared platform to user
The media content item of view.Popular media content may correspond to the media content that a large number of users of content shared platform is checked recently
Project.Refer to that media content may correspond to media content item that another user is recommended (for example, friend suggests that user may
The popular video of interesting viewing).In one embodiment, the tight ness rating signal of the notice on subscribing to media content is comparable closes
Tight ness rating score is contributed in the tight ness rating signal for the notice for referring to media content bigger.For example, on subscribing to media content
The positive tight ness rating signal of notice can make tight ness rating score increase three points, and the positive tight ness rating of the notice on referring to media content
Signal can make tight ness rating score increase two points.
In frame 260, processing logic can determine the condition for providing a user subsequent notification based on tight ness rating score.Bar
Part can be whether to should be user to generate subsequent notification, should use which notification type for subsequent notification, for subsequently logical
Sequential known etc..Tight ness rating score may indicate that user can be to similar media content item in future, similar topic channel or specific
Other of author or uploader media content item are interested.If tight ness rating score exceedes threshold value, processing logic can be to use
Family generates subsequent notification.For example, if the threshold value for music video channels is in particular value, can exceed in tight ness rating score
In the case of particular value subsequent notification is generated for uploading to the new video of music video channels.
In certain embodiments, tight ness rating score can determine that the type of subsequent notification and when be transferred to subsequent notification
User.For example, tight ness rating score at a high value can determine that subsequent notification can be the mobile notice for being transferred to user immediately, and locate
It can determine that subsequent notification can be the email notification that was transmitted in 24 hours in the tight ness rating score of lower value.Therefore, closely
Degree score can be used in selection notice the subsequent media content project identified and how or when can be user's transmission or raw
Into subsequent notification.

Put (for example, mobile phone).Can be 493 by the first device of notification transmission to user.For example, it can be based on knowing at first device
The user account of other user is by the first device of notification transmission to user.However, user can be determined not with being transferred to first
The notice interaction of device, and can be changed to watch video in second device.For example, notification manager 131 can be to the shifting of user
Dynamic device transmission is on from the notice for most liking band and uploading new music video of user.User can check notice, but can
Can it is extremely busy when receiving notice and determine do not watch music video.However, user can determine in the on knee of user later
On computer video is browsed by navigating directly to content shared platform.User is not interacting with notice on a cellular telephone
In the case of watch video on a laptop computer.
Processing logic can identify that user watches video in second device in the time 494.In the time 495, processing is patrolled
Collect and may further determine that user not yet interacts with notice on the first device.For example, notification manager 131 can parse user as described above
The data acquisition system of behavior further determines that user still to identify that user watches music video on a laptop computer
The link having been transferred in the notice of mobile device is not clicked on or selects.In the time 496, processing logic can provide just for notice
