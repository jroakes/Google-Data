Description
Description of the cases
The present application belongs to the divisional application of Chinese patent application 201680029985.8 with the application date of 2016, 9, month and 27.
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to a query composition system.
Background
The advent of cloud-based services, search engines, and other services and media has greatly expanded the utility of user devices over the past decade. Many user devices, particularly mobile devices and smart phones, now provide services and applications in addition to voice and data access. Further, the internet, which can be accessed on a user device, is a global network of computers that provide information in response to requests. The information is in the form of an electronic resource, such as, for example, a web page, an electronic file, or other resource. The search engine organizes these resources according to the information it contains, which allows users to submit search queries to find resources that contain information pertaining to a particular query.
In many instances, it will be convenient for a user to provide a search query without requiring all of the characters of the search query to be included. Thus, many systems now provide query suggestions as the user types in a query.
Disclosure of Invention
This specification relates to selecting and providing query suggestions to a user device. In some implementations, a set of queries (e.g., movie times, movie trailers) related to a particular topic (e.g., movie) can be grouped in context clusters (context clusters). Given a context for a user device of a user, one or more context clusters may be presented to the user when the user is initiating a search operation but before the user enters one or more characters of a search query. For example, based on the user's context (e.g., location, date and time, indicated user preferences and interests), when a user event occurs indicating that the user is initiating the process of providing a search query (e.g., opening a web page associated with a search engine), one or more context clusters (e.g., "movies") may be presented to the user for selection input before the user enters any query input. The user may select one of the presented context clusters and then a list of queries grouped in that context cluster may be presented as an option for query input selection.
In general, the first innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in the following actions: accessing, by a data processing apparatus, query data indicative of query inputs received from user devices of a plurality of users, the query data further indicative of an input context describing, for each query input, the query input that differs from content described by the query input; grouping, by the data processing apparatus, the query inputs into context clusters based in part on the input context for each of the query inputs and the content described by each query input; determining, by the data processing apparatus, for each of the context clusters, a context cluster probability based on a respective probability of entry of the query inputs belonging to the context cluster, the context cluster probability indicating a probability that at least one query input belonging to the context cluster and providing an input context of the context cluster will be selected by the user; and storing data describing the context clusters and the context cluster probabilities in a data storage system accessible by the data processing apparatus.
An indication of a user event including data indicative of a context of a user device may be received. The context may be independent of query input at the user device. Data describing context clusters and context cluster probabilities may be accessed and, based on the context cluster probabilities and a context of the user device for each of the context clusters, a context cluster may be selected as the selected context cluster for selection input by the user device. Data may be provided to the user device in response to the selection, the data causing the user device to display a context cluster selection input indicative of the selected context cluster for user selection.
Data indicating a selection of a context cluster selection input may be received from a user device. In response to the selection, query input belonging to the selected context cluster may be provided to the user device as a query input option.
Data indicating a selection of a context cluster selection input may be received from the user device and, in response, provide one or more sub-context cluster selection inputs to the user device, each sub-context cluster selection input indicating a context cluster that is a subset of query inputs belonging to the selected context cluster.
Grouping query inputs in context clusters may further include: determining context similarity metrics for the input contexts, wherein each context similarity metric measures similarity of at least two input contexts; determining query similarity metrics for the query inputs, wherein each query similarity metric measures similarity of at least two query inputs; and grouping the query inputs in the context cluster based on the context similarity metric and the query similarity metric.
Grouping query inputs in the context cluster based on the context similarity metric and the query similarity metric may include: query inputs for which a contextual similarity measure of input contexts of the query inputs satisfies a contextual similarity threshold and for which the query similarity measure of the query inputs satisfies the query similarity threshold are grouped in context clusters.
Determining a context cluster probability indicating a probability that at least one query input belonging to the selected context cluster will be selected by the user may comprise: determining, for each query input in each context cluster, an entry probability for the query input at the user device; and determining, for each context cluster, a context cluster probability based on the probability of entry of each query input in the context cluster.
Determining, for each context cluster, a context cluster probability based on the entry probability of each of the query inputs in the context cluster can include: the entry probabilities for the query inputs in the context cluster are aggregated.
Selecting a context cluster as the selected context cluster for selection input by the user device based on the context cluster probability for each of the context clusters and the context of the user device may include: for each context cluster, comparing the context cluster probability to a selection probability threshold; and provide data to the user device that causes the user device to display a context cluster selection input for a context cluster having a cluster probability that satisfies the selection probability threshold.
The input context may describe at least one of: location data, time data, and user data.
The user event may include an indication that the user is accessing a search engine input in the user interface.
The second innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in the following actions: receiving, from a user device, an indication of a user event comprising data indicative of a context of the user device, wherein the context is independent of a query input at the user device; accessing data describing context clusters and context cluster probabilities, wherein each context cluster includes query inputs based in part on an input context for each query input and content described by each query input, and each context cluster probability indicates a probability that at least one query input that belongs to the context cluster and provides an input context for the context cluster will be selected by a user; selecting a context cluster as the selected context cluster for selection input by the user device based on the context cluster probability of each context cluster and the context of the user device; and in response to the selection, provide data to the user device that causes the user device to display a context cluster selection input indicative of the selected context cluster for user selection.
Each context cluster probability can be based on a respective probability of entry for query inputs belonging to that context cluster.
Data indicating a selection of a context cluster selection input may be received from the user device and, in response to the selection, a query input belonging to the selected context cluster may be provided to the user device as a query input option.
Data indicating a selection of a context cluster selection input may be received from a user device and, in response, one or more sub-context cluster selection inputs are provided to the user device, each sub-context cluster selection input indicating a context cluster belonging to a subset of the respective query inputs of the selected context cluster.
Each context cluster includes a group of one or more queries. As each query input is provided and/or content is described by each query input, the grouping may be based on the input context of the query input (e.g., location, date and time, indicated user preferences and interests). One or more context clusters can be presented to a user for input selection based on the context cluster probabilities. For example, a context cluster probability for a context cluster may be compared to a threshold probability to determine whether to include the context cluster for input selection by a user. Selective transmission of query suggestions for the user based on context cluster probabilities further reduces network traffic.
The context cluster probability may be based on a context of the user device. The context cluster probability can be based on a respective probability of entry for each query input belonging to the context cluster. The context cluster probability may indicate a probability that at least one query input belonging to the context cluster will be selected by the user. Based on a selection of one of the context clusters presented to the user, a list of queries grouped in that context cluster may be presented as an option for query input selection. This advantageously results in individual query suggestions for query inputs that belong to the context cluster but that would not otherwise be provided separately due to their respective lower individual selection probabilities.
The first and second inventive aspects may be combined. For example, a first innovative aspect can be performed to provide appropriate context clusters and a second innovative aspect can leverage those context clusters to facilitate search operations by users.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Embodiments of the subject matter described below allow a user to provide a search query without being required to enter any characters as part of the search query and without presenting the user with an overly large array of query entry choices, thereby reducing the number of different operations and overall time for completing the search operation. In this particular context, only the most relevant and possible query inputs to the user are communicated to the user without query inputs by the user and are user-selectable. By transmitting only query suggestions that are present in the context cluster selected by the probability, the amount of network traffic involved in performing the search operation and the time it takes to perform the search operation is reduced compared to other approaches.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an environment 100 in which context clusters may be presented to and utilized by a user. A computer network 102, such as the internet, provides data communication between electronic devices and systems. Examples of such electronic devices and systems include websites 104 and user devices 106. The computer network 102 may also include or be in data communication with one or more wireless networks 103.
Website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements such as scripts. Each website 104 is maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages, and/or owns the website 104. A resource 105 is any data that can be provided by a website 104 over a network 102 and associated with a resource address.
The user devices 106 are electronic devices that are capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102, establishing communication channels, such as voice communications, with other user devices 106, and also capable of performing other actions. Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices capable of sending and receiving data over the network 102. User equipment 106 may communicate over networks 102 and 103 by means of wired and wireless connections.
To facilitate the search of these resources 105 and other resources derived from the resources, the search system 110 identifies the resources by crawling the publisher web site 104 and indexing the resources provided by the publisher web site 104. The resources are indexed and the index data is stored in index 112. Although the index 112 is depicted as a single entity, it can include multiple portions and different indices.
The user device 106 submits a search query to the search system 110. The search query is submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and optionally a unique identifier that identifies the user device 106 that submitted the request. If the user maintains an account with the search system 110, the unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device or a user account identifier, or the unique identifier can be some other identifier that identifies the user device 106 or the user using the user device.
In response to the search request, the search system 110 uses the index 112 to identify resources and other information related to the query. The search system 110 identifies resources and other information in the form of search results, answers, indicator cards, etc., and returns data describing the responsive information to the user device 106 in the search results page resources. Search results are data generated by the search system 110 that identifies resources or provides information that satisfies a particular search query, which is a command input for the search system 110. Other information, such as answers and knowledge cards, may include facts derived from the resources, and optionally may also include links to the resources from which the facts were derived.
The search results are ranked based on the scores related to the resources identified by the search results. The user device 106 receives the search results page and renders the page for presentation to the user according to the ranking.
Queries submitted during a search session are stored in log data 114. In particular, the log data 114 stores queries for search sessions by a set or subset of users. Log data 114 also includes data describing the input context for each query input. The input context of the query input differs from the content described by the query input in that the input context describes an environment surrounding the input of the query input. The environment is independent of the actual content described by the query input.
For example, the input context for a particular query may include one or more of: the location of the user device 106, the time and date the query was provided, and the preferences and interests of the particular user. The preferences and interests of the user include data describing user interactions of the user's particular user device. Preferences and interests may be provided explicitly or implicitly. Explicit indication occurs when a user specifically identifies a topic of interest, such as motion, travel, or video games in a user profile. The implicit indication is derived from the content consumed by the user. Other ways of determining the interests of the user can also be used.
As described further below, the context cluster selection input may be presented to the user of the user device 16 when there is a particular user event in which the user is initiating an indication of a search query, such as when the user accesses a search engine website in a web browser on the user device 106. Context clusters are groupings of queries that are contextually related, at least due to similar input, and optionally based on query similarity, as will be described in more detail below.
User contexts (e.g., location, time of day, user preferences, and preferences) associated with the user device 106 can be included to determine whether to present one or more context clusters and which context clusters to present to the user device 106. Context clusters 124, 126, and 128 may be presented, for example, in search engine website 120 when a user event is determined to have occurred.
If the user selects, for example, context cluster 2(126), then queries grouped within context cluster 2 may be presented to the user as query input selection options. The user may select one of the query input choices, which includes query 1: cluster 2(126a), query 2: cluster 2(126b), and query 3: cluster 2(126c), and when selection occurs, initiate a query input selection as a query in the query input area 122. For example, if a cluster of queries generated from queries submitted by users in the vicinity of a particular theater, MegePlex, is selected by the user, the three queries 126a, 126b, and 126c may be "movie showtimes", "movie trailers", and "MegaPlex auditorium".
Fig. 2 is a system flow diagram 200 for selecting a context cluster and providing it to a particular user device 106 for input selection. The context cluster system 210 can access the log data 114 to group queries in clusters based on input contexts associated with each query and optionally the content of each query. For example, the context cluster processor 212, which may be a computer or set of computers programmed to perform the options described below, may access information in the log data 114 to determine an input context associated with each query, and the context clusters determined by the context cluster processor 212 may be stored as context cluster data 214.
For example, input context for a set of queries may indicate that the queries are provided in an area within or near a mixed-use complex (referred to herein as "MegaPlex") that includes department stores, restaurants, and movie theaters. Based on input contexts being the same or similar-i.e., submitted from within the area surrounding the location, the queries can be grouped in a context cluster.
Queries may also be grouped based on the content of the query, such as the characters included in the query and/or the topic or theme of the query. For example, assume that the five queries provided in the region are "movie time", "movie preview", "atlanta warrior", "restaurant menu" and "restaurant fix". Based on the input context of each of these queries and the content of the query, "movie times" and "movie trailers" may be placed in a context cluster (e.g., movies), and "restaurant menus" and "restaurant seats" may be placed in different context clusters (e.g., restaurants). However, the "atlanta warrior" may not be placed in any of these context clusters, or it may be used to create its own context cluster, as the characters and/or keywords of the query and topics associated with the query (e.g., motion) may not define content that is determined to be similar to the content of other queries assigned to other context clusters.
Further, other queries that include the same topic or have a level of similarity to the queries in a context cluster may be added to the context cluster. For example, queries for times and trailers of a particular movie may be grouped in a context cluster with "movie times" and "movie trailers. Moreover, each query in the context cluster can include all query input selections that are significantly similar to one another and/or include a subset of the same keywords (e.g., "movie time," "movie show time," "movie time option," etc.).
Further, additional input contexts may be considered for grouping and creating context clusters, such as the time and date a particular query was provided and/or the similarity of interests and preferences of the user providing the query. For example, queries provided within or near MegaPlex between 6-10PM on friday nights may be grouped in a first context cluster, and on saturday noon with 6: 00PM queries provided within or near MegaPlex may be grouped in another context cluster, and so on.
In some implementations, grouping the query inputs in the context cluster includes determining a level of similarity of input contexts between each query in the queries. For example, queries provided from the same location or at the same date and time may be determined to have a higher level of similarity to each other than input contexts between queries provided from different locations and/or dates and times. The threshold may be used to provide an indication that the input context of two or more query inputs includes a sufficient level of similarity to each other.
Further, for each of the query inputs associated with each of the input contexts that includes a level of similarity (e.g., a threshold), the level of similarity can be determined between content of each of the query inputs. For example, queries related to the same topic (e.g., movie, sports, news, etc.) or the same characters and/or keywords may be determined to have a higher level of similarity to each other than queries related to different topics or including different characters. When a similarity metric measuring similarity of content of a query satisfies a threshold, the threshold may be used to provide an indication that two or more query inputs include a sufficient level of content similarity to each other. When content similarity is also considered, query inputs that are both similar in input context and content (e.g., satisfying a threshold level of similarity in input context and a threshold level of similarity in content) can be grouped in a context cluster relative to each other.
The system 210 may determine a probability for each cluster. For example, the probability of entry for a given context for each of the queries in the cluster of contexts can be aggregated for the context clusters to determine a context cluster probability. For example, from the query log data 114, for a context cluster, the system 210 can determine a respective likelihood of being submitted at a particular location during a particular time period for each query. Alternatively, the possibility of context-independent query entry may be used. Regardless of which likelihood is used, the likelihoods of queries belonging to a cluster can be summed to generate a context cluster probability. The context cluster probability of a context cluster may be compared to a threshold probability to determine whether to include a context cluster for selection by an input of a user, as described in more detail below.
The search system 110 and/or context cluster system 210 may receive the context of a particular user device 106 when the user device 106 executes a user event indicating that the user is initiating a process to provide a search query (e.g., open a web page associated with a search engine). For example, at a user event, the user device 106 may provide the user device 106 location and user interests and preferences, and the date and time may be included in the user's input context.
In response to such an indication, context cluster system 210 may access context cluster data 214 to determine whether one or more context clusters are to be provided to user device 106 as an input selection. Since there may be multiple context clusters available, the context cluster probability is used for which context clusters the user is most likely to select. The context cluster probability may be used as a likelihood if the context of the user device exactly matches the context for the context cluster. Context clusters having likelihoods of meeting the selection threshold can then be identified to the user. In some implementations, if more than the maximum number of context clusters meets the selection threshold, up to the maximum number of context clusters, e.g., four, may be identified for the user.
In some implementations, various similarity metrics can be used to determine the likelihood. For example, the location, date and time, and user preferences and interests may be input contexts that may be compared between the context of a particular user and the input context of queries obtained from log data 114. Further, in some implementations, the context can be weighted to determine a probability that the user will provide each query. For example, if one location for the query "movie showtime" is the same as the user's input context when the user event occurs, there may be a higher probability that the user will provide the same query. However, if the user is not in the same location as the input context indicated by the stored query, then the probability may be reduced.
Further, a user query history may be provided by the user device 106 (or stored in the log data 114) that includes queries and contexts previously provided by the user, and this information may also be decomposed into probabilities that the user may provide a particular query or queries within a particular context cluster. For example, if a user initiating a user event provides a query for "movie showtimes" between many Friday afternoons of 4PM-6PM, the probability associated with the user entering "movie showtimes" may rise for the user when the user initiates a user event between these times on the future Friday afternoon. As a result, based on this example, the corresponding context cluster probability of the context cluster to which the query belongs may likewise be elevated relative to the user.
Once one or more context clusters are determined to be provided (e.g., an aggregation probability threshold is met), the search system 110 and/or the context cluster system 210 may provide data to the user device that causes the user device to display selection input for the one or more context clusters. If a context cluster is selected at the user device 106, a query within the context cluster is presented as query input to the user device 106 for user selection. Alternatively or in addition to displaying the selection input, the user device may also provide audio feedback to describe the context cluster and facilitate the user in making a selection of the context cluster.
In some implementations, context clusters can have sub-context clusters and be arranged in a hierarchical fashion. For example, queries that are typically related to movies may be grouped in a context cluster for "movie". However, among queries belonging to this context cluster, those queries having similar input contexts for a particular subcontext (e.g., "movie a's trailer," "movie B's trailer," etc.) may include a subcontext cluster for "movie trailer"; a query for showtimes may be provided in another subconscious cluster for "movie showtimes" (e.g., "showtimes for movie a," "showtimes for movie B," etc.). Thus, if a user is presented with a context cluster for "movie" and selects a context cluster, the user is presented with a second level of context clusters, which includes "movie trailers" and "movie showtimes". After the user selects one of these context cluster options at this level, then the user may select a particular query that is grouped in each of these context clusters.
Alternatively or in addition to displaying the query in response to selection of the context cluster, the user device may also provide audio feedback to describe the query of the context cluster and facilitate the user in making a selection of the query.
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of a process 300 for generating and providing one or more context clusters for selection input. The process 300 can be implemented in a context cluster system 210 using one or more computers.
The process 300 accesses query data indicative of query inputs received from user devices of a plurality of users (302). The query data also includes input context that describes, for each query input, the query input that differs from the content described by the query input. For example, as previously discussed, the context cluster system 210 can access the log data 114 to group queries in clusters based on the input context associated with each of the queries. The context cluster processor 212 may access information in the log data 114 to determine an input context associated with each query, and the context clusters determined by the context cluster processor 212 may be stored in the context cluster data 214.
For clustering, a location may be decomposed into the nearest address or within a location grid; time may be broken down into small-long slots, e.g., 6PM-7PM, 7PM-8PM, etc., so that a particular location may have up to 24 context clusters for the same context on a particular date. In other implementations, grouping the query inputs in context clusters includes determining a level of similarity of input contexts between each query. The threshold may be used to provide an indication that the input context of two or more query inputs includes a sufficient level of similarity to each other.
Further, a level of similarity may be determined between the content of each of the query inputs. For example, queries related to the same topic (e.g., movie, sports, news, etc.) or the same character may be determined to have a higher level of similarity to each other than queries related to different topics or including different characters. The threshold may also be used to provide an indication that two or more query inputs include a sufficient level of content similarity to each other. Query inputs that are both similar in input context and content (e.g., satisfying a threshold level of similarity in input context and a threshold level of similarity in content) may be grouped in a context cluster relative to each other.
For each of the context clusters, the process 300 determines a context cluster probability based on the respective probabilities of entry of the query inputs belonging to that context cluster (306). As previously described, the similarity of a user context to the input context of a particular query and/or context cluster may be used to determine a probability that the user will provide each query.
The probability of each of the queries may be aggregated for the context cluster of which the query is a part to obtain an aggregated probability (i.e., context cluster probability) for each context cluster. For example, the probability of providing the query "movie trailer" may be 1% and the probability of providing the query "movie showtime" may be 2%. As a result, if the queries are grouped in a context cluster of "movie", the aggregate probability of the context cluster of "movie" may be 3%. Further, a user query history may be provided by the user device 106 (or stored in the log data 114) that includes queries and contexts previously provided by the user, and this information may also be decomposed into probabilities that the user may provide a particular query or queries within a particular context cluster.
The process 300 receives an indication of a user device of a user event from a user device that includes data indicative of a context of the user device (308). The context is independent of query input at the user device. A user event in which there is an indication that the user is initiating a search query, e.g., when the user accesses a search engine website in a web browser on the user device 106, may be determined to have occurred. The indication can be received without the user actually entering any characters or any other input into the search input field. When a user device 106 executes a user event indicating that a user is initiating a process to provide a search query (e.g., open a web page associated with a search engine), search system 110 and/or context cluster system 210 may receive a context for a particular user device 106. For example, at a user event, the user device 106 may provide the user device 106 location and user interests and preferences, and the date and time may be included in the user's input context.
Flow diagram 300 also includes selecting a context cluster to provide a selection input based on the context cluster probabilities for each of the context clusters (310). For example, in some implementations, context clusters having a context cluster probability greater than a threshold context cluster probability can be included. However, in other implementations, other types of methods for selecting context clusters may be used.
In response to the selection, data is provided to the user device that causes the user device to display a context cluster selection input that indicates a context cluster for the user selection (312). Once one or more context clusters are determined to be provided (e.g., an aggregation probability threshold is met), the search system 110 and/or the context cluster system 210 may provide the one or more context clusters to the user device 106 for input selection (as shown in fig. 1). If a context cluster is selected at the user device 106, queries within the context cluster may be presented to the user device 106 as query inputs for user selection. Such query selections may be provided by the user without any characters entered by the user.
Fig. 4A-4B depict example user device user interfaces for displaying and selecting context clusters and query inputs associated with context clusters. In the example user interface 400a of fig. 4A, a user event has been performed (e.g., a user accesses a search engine website in a web browser on a tablet device on the user device 106), and the search engine website 410 is displayed in a display of the user device 106 along with a query input area 420. In the current example, the user may be in a MegaPlex location, which includes department stores, restaurants, and movie theaters. Further, the user context may indicate that a user event was initiated on friday evening at 6 PM. Upon a user initiating a user event, the search system 110 and/or the context cluster system 210 can access the context cluster data 214 to determine whether one or more context clusters are to be provided to the user device 106 based at least in part on the user's context. Based on the user's context, the context cluster system 210 and/or the search system 110 can determine, for each query in each context cluster, a probability that the user will provide the query and aggregate the probabilities for the context clusters to obtain context cluster probabilities.
In the current example, there may be four queries grouped in "movie" cluster 422, four queries grouped in "restaurant" cluster 424, and three queries grouped in "department store" cluster 426. Based on the analysis of the context cluster data 214, the context cluster system 210 may determine that the aggregate probability of queries in each of the "movie" cluster 422, the "restaurant" cluster 424, and the "department store" cluster 426 has a sufficiently high likelihood to be input by the user (e.g., satisfies a threshold probability) based on the user contexts that the context clusters 422, 424, and 426 are to be presented to the user for selection input in the search engine website 410.
For example, the aggregate probability for a query in "movie" cluster 422 may be 5%, the aggregate probability for a query in "restaurant" cluster 424 may be 4%, and the aggregate probability for a query in "department store" cluster 426 may be 3%. A threshold of 2% may be required for a cluster of contexts to be presented to a user for selecting input. Based on the user context, the aggregate probability of queries in a context cluster of a grocery store may be, for example, only 1%, such that the context cluster may not be presented to the user as a selection input. Further, if there is more than one, the order of context clusters presented to the user can be ranked and presented based on the aggregate context cluster probability for a particular context cluster. However, in other embodiments, other options for presentation may be used (e.g., randomized, alphabetical, etc.).
In the example user interface 400B of FIG. 4B, the user has selected "movie" cluster 422 from FIG. 4A, and the current query selection input is presented to the user in FIG. 4B. The query selection inputs in FIG. 4B include "movie show times" 422a, "movie trailers" 422B, "MegaPlex theater auditorium" 422c, and "MegaPlex movie listings" 422 d. In the current example, these four query inputs are query inputs in the "movie" context cluster. However, in other implementations, more query inputs may be in the "movie" context cluster, but only some of the query inputs may be presented to the user for query input selection after their respective context cluster is selected. For example, there may be a threshold probability of query input required for a particular query to be presented as a query input selection, or in some embodiments, the highest number (e.g., four) of queries in a context cluster may be presented to the user for query input selection. However, in other implementations, all of the query inputs within a context cluster may be presented for query input selection after a respective context query is selected by a user. Further, in some implementations, the order in which the query input selections are presented can be based on a ranking of probabilities in each of the query input selections of the context cluster.
From the example of the user interface 400B in fig. 4B, the user may select one of the query input selections, and after the user makes the selection, the selected query input selection will be placed into the query input area 420 and sent to the search engine system 110 as a query. The query results page may then be presented to the user device 106 based on the results from the search engine system 110, and the user may interact with the query results page. Such query input may be performed without any input by the user in the query input area 420.
For the cases in which the systems discussed herein collect or may utilize personal information about a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs and features collect personal information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, the user's preferences, or the user's current location) or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user obtaining the location information may be generalized (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content server.
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an example mobile computing device. In this illustration, the mobile computing device 510 is depicted as a handheld mobile phone (e.g., a smartphone or an application phone) that includes a touchscreen display device 512 for presenting content to a user of the mobile computing device 510 and receiving contact-based user input. Other visual, tactile, and audible output components may also be provided (e.g., LED lights, a vibrating mechanism for tactile output, or a speaker for providing a tonal, speech-generated, or recorded output) as may be a variety of different input components.
An example visual output mechanism in the form of a display device 512 may take the form of a resistive or capacitive touchscreen capable display. The display device may be used to display video, graphics, and text and to coordinate user contact input locations with the location of the displayed information so that the device 510 can associate user contact at the location of the displayed item with the item. The mobile computing device 510 may also take alternative forms, including being a laptop computer, a tablet computer or tablet computer, a personal digital assistant, an embedded system (e.g., a car navigation system), a desktop personal computer, or a computerized workstation.
The mobile computing device 510 may be able to determine the location of physical contact with the touchscreen display device 512 (e.g., the location of contact by a finger or stylus). Using the touch screen 512, various "virtual" input mechanisms may be generated in which a user interacts with graphical user interface elements depicted on the touch screen 512 by contacting the graphical user interface elements. An example of a "virtual" input mechanism is a "software keyboard," where a keyboard is displayed on the touch screen and the user selects a key by pressing the area of the touch screen 512 corresponding to each key.
The mobile computing device 510 may include mechanical or touch-sensitive buttons 518 a-d. Further, the mobile computing device may include buttons for adjusting the volume output by the one or more speakers 820, as well as buttons for turning the mobile computing device on or off. The microphone 522 allows the mobile computing device 510 to convert audible sound into an electrical signal that may be digitally encoded and stored in a computer-readable memory or transmitted to another computing device. The mobile computing device 510 may also include a digital compass, an accelerometer, a proximity sensor, and an ambient light sensor.
The operating system may provide an interface between the hardware (e.g., input/output mechanisms and a processor executing instructions retrieved from a computer-readable medium) and software of the mobile computing device. The operating system may be an execution providing platform for application programs that facilitate interaction between the computing device and a user.
The mobile computing device 510 may present a graphical user interface using a touch screen 512. The graphical user interface is a collection of one or more graphical interface elements and may be static (e.g., the display appears to remain the same over a period of time) or may be dynamic (e.g., the graphical user interface includes graphical interface elements that have an animation effect without user input).
The graphical interface elements may be text, lines, shapes, images, or combinations thereof. For example, the graphical interface element may be an icon displayed on a desktop computer and text associated with the icon. In some examples, the graphical interface element is selectable with user input. For example, a user may select a graphical interface element by pressing an area of the touch screen of the display that corresponds to the graphical interface element. In some examples, a user may manipulate a trackball to highlight a single graphical interface element as having focus. User selection of a graphical interface element may invoke a predefined action by the mobile computing device. User selection of a button may invoke a predefined action.
The mobile computing device 510 may include other applications, computing subsystems, and hardware. The voice recognition service 572 may receive voice communication data received by the microphone 522 of the mobile computing device and translate the voice communication into corresponding text data or perform voice recognition. The processed speech data can be input to a command model stored in command model data 122 to determine whether the speech input used to generate the speech data invokes a particular action for a particular application, as described above. One or more of the following applications, services and units may have corresponding actions invoked by such voice commands.
The call processing unit may receive an indication of an incoming telephone call and provide the user with the ability to answer the incoming telephone call. The media player may allow a user to listen to music or play movies that are stored in local memory of the mobile computing device 510. The mobile device 510 may include a digital camera sensor, and corresponding image and video capture and editing software. An internet browser may enable a user to view content from a web page by typing in an address corresponding to the web page or selecting a link to the web page.
A service provider operating a network of base stations may connect the mobile computing device 510 to the network 650 to enable communication between the mobile computing device 510 and other computing systems providing the service 560. Although the service 560 may be provided over different networks (e.g., the service provider's internal network, the public switched telephone network, and the internet), the network 650 is illustrated as a single network. The service provider may operate a server system 852 that routes packets and voice data between the mobile computing device 510 and computing systems associated with the service 560.
The network 650 may connect the mobile computing device 510 to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)562 in order to establish voice or fax communication between the mobile computing device 510 and another computing device. For example, the service provider server system 852 may receive an indication from the PSTN562 for an incoming call for the mobile computing device 510. Conversely, the mobile computing device 510 may send a communication to the service provider server system 652, which initiates a telephone call using a telephone number associated with a device accessible through the PSTN 562.
The network 650 may connect the mobile computing device 510 with a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service 564 that routes voice communications over an IP network as opposed to the PSTN. For example, a user of the mobile computing device 510 may invoke a VoIP application and initiate a call using a program. The service provider server system 562 may forward voice data from the call to a VoIP service, which may potentially route the call over the internet to a corresponding computing device using the PSTN for the final leg of the connection.
The app store 566 may provide the user of the mobile computing device 510 with the ability to browse a list of remotely stored application programs that the user may download over the network 650 and install on the mobile computing device 510. The application store 566 may serve as a repository for applications opened by third party application developers. An application installed on the mobile computing device 510 may be able to communicate over the network 650 with a server system designated for the application. For example, a VoIP application may be downloaded from the application store 566, which enables the user to communicate with the VoIP service 564.
The mobile computing device 510 may access content on the internet 568 through the network 650. For example, a user of the mobile computing device 510 may invoke a web browser application that requests data from a remote computing device accessible at a specified universal resource location. In various examples, some of the services 560 are accessible over the internet.
The mobile computing device may communicate with a personal computer 570. For example, the personal computer 570 may be a home computer for the user of the mobile computing device 510. Thus, the user may be able to stream media from his personal computer 570. The user may also view the file structure of his personal computer 570 and transfer selected documents between the computerized devices.
The mobile computing device 510 may communicate with a social network 574. A social network may include many members, some of which have been agreed to be associated as acquaintances. An application on the mobile computing device 510 may access the social network 574 to retrieve information based on acquaintances of the user of the mobile computing device. For example, the "address book" application may retrieve the telephone numbers of the user's acquaintances. In various examples, content may be delivered to the mobile computing device 510 based on social network distances and connection relationships from the user to other members in the member's social network graph. For example, advertisement and news article content may be selected for a user based on the level of interaction with such content by members that are "close" to the user (e.g., members that are "friends" or "friends of friends").
The mobile computing device 510 may access the personal set of contacts 576 over the network 650. Each contact may identify an individual and include information about the individual (e.g., a phone number, an email address, and a birthday). Because the set of contacts is hosted remotely to the mobile computing device 510, the user may access and maintain the contacts 576 as a common set of contacts across several devices.
The mobile computing device 510 may access the cloud-based application 578. Cloud computing provides applications (e.g., word processor or email programs) that are hosted remotely from the mobile computing device 510 and can be accessed by the device 510 using a web browser or a dedicated program.
The mapping service 580 can provide street maps, route planning information, and satellite images to the mobile computing device 510. The mapping service 580 may also receive queries and return location-specific results. For example, the mobile computing device 510 may send the estimated location of the mobile computing device and a user-entered query for "pizza places" to the mapping service 580. The mapping service 580 may return a street map with "tags" superimposed on a map identifying the geographic location of "pizza places" in the vicinity.
A turn-by-turn service 582 may provide turn-by-turn directions to the mobile computing device 510 for the user-supplied destination. For example, the turn-by-turn service 582 may cause a street level view of the estimated location of the device to be transmitted to the device 510 along with a data stream that provides audio commands and overlays arrows that guide the user of the device 510 to a destination.
Various forms of streaming media 584 may be requested by the mobile computing device 510. For example, the computing device 510 may request a stream for a pre-recorded video file, a live television program, or a live radio program.
The search engine 588 may receive a user-entered textual or spoken query from the mobile computing device 510, determine a set of internet-accessible documents that are responsive to the query, and provide the device 510 with information that displays a list of search results for responsive files. In examples where a spoken query is received, the speech recognition service 572 may translate the received audio into a text query that is sent to a search engine.
These and other services may be implemented in service system 590. The server system may be a combination of hardware and software that provides a service or set of services. For example, a collection of physically separate and networked computerized devices may operate together as a logical server system unit to handle the operations necessary to provide services to hundreds of computing devices. A server system is also referred to herein as a computing system.
In various implementations, an operation that is performed "in response to" or "as a result of" another operation (e.g., a determination or identification) is not performed if the a priori operation is unsuccessful (e.g., if the determination is not performed). An operation performed "automatically" is an operation that is performed without user intervention (e.g., intervening user input). Features in this document that are described using a conditional language may describe alternative embodiments. In some examples, "transmitting" from the first device to the second device includes the first device placing data into the network for receipt by the second device, but may not include the second device receiving the data. Conversely, "receiving" from the first device may include receiving data from the network, but may not include the first device transmitting data.
"determining" by the computing system can include the computing system requesting another device to perform the determination and supplying the results to the computing system. Moreover, "displaying" or "presenting" by the computing system can include the computing system sending data for causing another device to display or present the reference information.
Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs (i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus). Alternatively or additionally, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by the data processing apparatus. The computer storage media can be or be embodied in a computer-readable storage device, computer-readable storage substrate, random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, although a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be or be included in one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
The term "data processing apparatus" encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or a combination of the foregoing. An apparatus can comprise special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment are capable of implementing a variety of different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures.
A computer program (also known as a program, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer that is located at one site or on multiple computers that are distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with the instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device, e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive, to name a few. Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can also be used to provide for interaction with the user; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, such as visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, the computer may interact with the user by sending and receiving documents to and from the device used by the user; for example, by sending a web page to a web browser on the user's client device in response to a request received from the web browser.
Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described is this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), the internet (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
The computing system can include a user and a server. A user and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of user and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, the server transmits data (e.g., HTML pages) to the user device (e.g., for the purpose of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the user device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from a client device at the server.
