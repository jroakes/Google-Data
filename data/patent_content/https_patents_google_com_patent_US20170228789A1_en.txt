Abstract
A computer-implemented method of processing content at a mobile communications device may include transmitting from a mobile communication device to a first content provider a request for content, the request for content including at least one of a search query and a request for a specific network-accessible element; receiving in response to the request, responsive content and a substitute electronic promotional item from the first content provider; and transmitting a response to the received substitute electronic promotional item. The first content provider may, in response to the request (a) obtain from a second content provider content that is responsive to the request and an electronic promotional item; (b) identify the electronic promotional item; and (c) replace the identified electronic promotional item with the substitute electronic promotional item.
Description
- This application claims the benefit of prior U.S. provisional application 60/817,601, filed Jun. 28, 2006, by Alexander Macgillivray and entitled “Formatting Electronic Promotional Material for Mobile Devices.”
- Formatting electronic promotional material for mobile devices is generally described. In particular, formatting electronic promotional material for efficient presentation in mobile handheld communication and computing devices is described.
- The number of Internet and web users has grown significantly, and advertisers have increasingly tapped this market. Advertisers may direct advertising to users who are, for example, searching for online information, reading news online or researching product information online. The proliferation of high-speed, high-capacity broadband connections has fueled media-rich, interactive online advertising. Online users may be presented with video or animated advertising that surrounds the information they are consuming, or that “pops up” or “floats over” the web pages they are browsing.
- The number of mobile device users has also grown significantly. People are accessing the Internet from cell phones, smartphones, wireless-enabled personal digital assistants (PDAs) and various other portable communication and computing devices. Many of these devices have smaller screens than, for example, desktop computing devices, from which a large number of online users connect to the Internet. In addition, although data transfer bandwidth of portable communication and computing devices is increasing, it may be lower than, for example, a desktop computing device that is physically connected to a broadband connection.
- A method of delivering web content to a mobile device may include identifying advertising material included within the web content and optionally replacing it with substitute advertising content.
- In some implementations, a computer-implemented method of providing content to a mobile device includes receiving a request for content from a mobile device; retrieving the requested content and an electronic promotional item for presentation with the requested content; replacing the electronic promotional item with a substitute electronic promotional item; and providing the requested content and the substitute electronic promotional item to the mobile device.
- The request for content may include at least one of a search query and a request for a specific network-accessible element. The electronic promotional item may be electronic advertising material associated with subject matter of the requested content. The electronic promotional item may be electronic advertising material associated with a keyword included in the request. The substitute electronic promotional item may be formatted for presentation by a mobile device selected from the group consisting of a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant, and a handheld communication and computing device. The replaced electronic promotional item may not be formatted for presentation by the mobile device.
- In some implementations, the computer-implemented method further includes transcoding the requested content from a first format to a second format; and providing the requested content may include providing content that has been transcoded to the second format.
- In some implementations, the computer-implemented method further includes identifying the electronic promotional item by searching the requested content for a reference to a known ad server and, upon finding the reference, identifying portions of the requested content that are contiguous with and that include the reference as the electronic promotional item. In some implementations, the computer-implemented method further includes identifying the electronic promotional item by searching the requested content for a link to a domain that is unrelated to a domain associated with the requested content and, upon finding the link, identifying portions of the requested content that are contiguous with and include the link as the electronic promotional item. In some implementations, the computer-implemented method further includes receiving a response to the substitute electronic promotional item from the mobile device.
- In some implementations, the computer-implemented method further includes selecting the substitute electronic promotional item by selecting the substitute electronic promotional item from a plurality of candidate substitute electronic promotional items. At least one of the plurality of candidate substitute electronic promotional items may be related to the electronic promotional item by either being directed to a similar product or by being sponsored by the same entity. Selecting the substitute electronic promotional item from the plurality of candidate substitute electronic promotional items may include dynamically bidding candidate substitute electronic promotional items against each other based on parameters selected by respective sponsors of the candidate substitute electronic promotional items.
- In some implementations, a system that provides electronic content to a mobile device includes an interface that receives a request for content from a mobile device; a content retrieval module operable to retrieve content responsive to the received request and electronic promotional material for presentation with the retrieved content; and a replacement module for identifying the electronic promotional material and replacing it with substitute electronic promotional material. The system may further include a transcoding module that transcodes the retrieved content from a first format to a second format.
- The interface may also transmit to the mobile device the content that is responsive to the received request and the substitute electronic promotional material. The content retrieval module may include a network search engine. The content retrieval module may include a proxy system that couples to a network search engine or content provider on behalf of the mobile device. The request for content may include at least one of a search query and a request for a specific network-accessible element.
- In some implementations, a system that transcodes electronic content includes an interface that receives a request for content from a mobile device, wherein the request for content includes at least one of a search query and a request for a specific network-accessible element; a content retrieval module that retrieves content responsive to the received request and electronic promotional material for presentation with the retrieved content; and a means for identifying the electronic promotional material and replacing it with substitute electronic promotional material. The interface may also transmit to the mobile device the content and the substitute electronic promotional material in response to the received request.
- In some implementations, a computer-implemented method of processing content at a mobile communications device includes transmitting from a mobile communication device to a first content provider a request for content, where the request for content includes at least one of a search query and a request for a specific network-accessible document; receiving in response to the request, responsive content and a substitute electronic promotional item from the first content provider; and transmitting a response to the received substitute electronic promotional item.
- In some implementations, the first content provider may, in response to the request, (a) obtain from a second content provider content that is responsive to the request and an electronic promotional item; (b) identify the electronic promotional item; and (c) replace the identified electronic promotional item with the substitute electronic promotional item.
- Transmitting a response to the received substitute electronic promotional item may include transmitting information solicited by the substitute electronic promotional item to the first content provider. In some implementations, the first content provider and the second content provider are the same.
- Advantages may include one or more of the following. The substitute advertising content may be suitable for presentation by a mobile device. The substitute advertising content may solicit an appropriate response for a mobile device user. The substitute advertising content may consume a reasonable amount of bandwidth and processing power of a mobile device that receives the advertising content. A user of a mobile device may benefit by receiving advertising content that is appropriate for presentation by the mobile device. A provider may benefit by collecting additional revenue for delivering appropriate content to mobile devices.
- The general and specific aspects may be implemented using a system, a method, or a computer program, or any combination of systems, methods, and computer programs. The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.
- These and another aspects will now be described in detail with reference to the following drawings.

Although the voice and data services may be available from both mobile and nonmobile devices, certain services or material may be specifically tailored for either a mobile device or a nonmobile device. (For purposes of illustration, a desktop computing device is used herein as a non-limiting example of a nonmobile device; a wireless PDA and a smartphone are used herein as non-limiting examples of mobile devices.) Components of theexample environment 100 may identify electronic promotional material that is tailored for a nonmobile device, and replace it with substitute electronic promotional material that is tailored for a mobile device, before delivery of the electronic promotional material to a mobile device. - In some implementations, graphic-intensive, media-rich data services may be tailored for nonmobile devices, which, on average, may be generally associated with larger display screens, more memory, faster processors and a higher bandwidth connection to the service provider. Content that is tailored for presentation along with media-rich data services may be designed to take full advantage of the large display screens, more memory, faster processor speed and higher bandwidth connections by engaging the user with sound and visual effects. The content may be formatted, for example, as Flash files, or QuickTime movies. The content may be coded with dynamic hypertext mark up language (DHTML) code, JAVA script or Jscript for execution primarily on a nonmobile client machine or the content may be coded to cooperate with the service, such as with active server page protocol.
- In some implementations, text or short message based services, or voice services, may be tailored to mobile devices, which, on average, may be generally associated with smaller display screens, less memory, slower processors and a lower bandwidth connection to the service provider. Content that is tailored for presentation by lower bandwidth mobile devices may be optimized for the smaller display screens and lower bandwidth connections, and may engage users less or in different ways.
- Along with various services, the devices may receive and respond to electronic promotional items, such as, for example, electronic advertisements (“ads”). In some implementations, sponsors of the ads may be charged for delivery of the ads based on a number of instances of the ad actually being delivered (e.g., a number of “impressions”), or based on a “click-through rate,” or rate at which users “respond” to the ad. Different ads may support different kinds of user “responses” to the ad. For example, a desktop computer user may be able to respond to a media-rich browser-based ad by clicking on the ad to activate an embedded link, playing a optional video, filling out a form (possibly after clicking on a link associated with the ad) or making a purchase. As another example, a wireless PDA user may respond to an ad by clicking on a link, sending an email or text message, or initiating a mobile voice call.
- Ads may be formatted differently, based on whether they are primarily directed to mobile or nonmobile devices. For example, ads primarily directed to nonmobile devices may be formatted for display in rectangular frames within a browser page, in “skyscraper” frames along the edge of a browser page, in horizontal “banners” across a page, or as “pop-up” or “pop-under” windows that are separate from the browser window from which they were “activated.” As other examples, ads directed primarily to mobile devices may be formatted as a single line or a small number of lines of text for presentation on a small display screen, as a graphic or short animation file, or as a link to a telephone number that the mobile device can dial upon selection of the link by a user of the mobile device.
- In some implementations, a mobile device may access content that was primarily designed to be accessed by nonmobile devices. The content may include one or more electronic promotional items or ads that may also have been primarily designed for access by nonmobile devices. In such implementations, it may be advantageous to replace certain ads or ads. Various components of a system that may perform such a replacement are now described in detail with reference to the
example environment 100 that is shown inFIG. 1 . - As shown,
FIG. 1 includes anonmobile device 104, such as a desktop computer that can access, via anetwork 107, various content from one or more content providers, such as acontent provider 110. In some implementations, the content may be web content, delivered by hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and thecontent provider 110 may include a web server. For example, the content may include network-accessible elements (e.g., text, graphics, video, programs and other electronic media) from a news service provider, such as www.cnn.com or espn.go.com; the content may include results of a query for information to a search engine such as Google; or the content may include internal company information delivered via the company's intranet. - Along with the content, the
content provider 110 may provide advertising material. In some implementations, the advertising material may be related to the content. For example, the advertising material may be matched to a query for information based on specific words in the query by an application such as Google's AdWords. As another example, the advertising material may be matched to content based on subject matter of the content itself by an application such as Google's AdSense. In either example, advertising material may be selected from an advertising database, such as theadvertising database 113. Several candidate ads may be matched to particular content, and one or more ads may be ultimately selected based on other parameters, such as parameters selected by the ad sponsor (e.g., a desired maximum ad cost or ad frequency). In some implementations, ads may be “bid” against each other based on the other parameters. - The
network 107 may be a private network, internal to a company or organization; thenetwork 107 may be a public network, such as the Internet; or thenetwork 107 may include a combination of public and private networks. Portions of thenetwork 107 may be wired, and other portions may be wireless. - The
example environment 100 also includes amobile device 116, such as a smartphone. Themobile device 116 may also access various voice and data services. Voice services may be provided through a separatemobile device network 119 that, as shown, connects to thenetwork 107. Through thenetworks mobile device 116 may access various data or data services, for example, content from thecontent provider 110 or content available from a separatemobile content provider 122. - The separate
mobile content provider 122 may deliver content specifically to mobile devices. In some implementations, themobile content provider 122 may act as a proxy or a “transcoder” to access and convert or reformat content from thecontent provider 110 for presentation by themobile device 116. For example, thecontent provider 122 may convert or reformat content in a hypertext markup language (HTML) format from or accessible by thecontent provider 110 and structured for delivery by HTTP, to content in a wireless mark up language (WML) format, structured for delivery by a wireless access protocol, (WAP). - In some implementations, the
mobile content provider 122 may deliver mobile ads along with mobile content, for presentation by mobile devices. The mobile ads may be selected from amobile ads database 125. Although thedatabase 125 is shown inFIG. 1 as separate from thedatabase 113, in some implementations,database 125 anddatabase 113 may be part of the same database. The mobile ads may be identified based on the content provided by themobile content provider 122. In some implementations, such as those in which themobile device 116 accesses content and ads from thecontent provider 110, themobile content provider 122 may replace ads with substitute ads. For example, themobile content provider 122 may identify the ads provided by the content provider 110 (possibly in conjunction with the ad database 113) and replace them with substitute ads (possibly from the mobile ads database 125). The substitute ads may be formatted for presentation by a mobile device, whereas the replaced ads may be formatted for presentation by a nonmobile device. The process of identifying ads and optionally replacing them with substitute ads is now described with reference toFIG. 2 . - In operation, a user of the
mobile device 116 may request content from acontent provider 110. The request may be routed via themobile device network 119 and thenetwork 107 to themobile content provider 122. Themobile content provider 122 may route the request to thecontent provider 110, which may retrieve the requested content and may also retrieve an ad or item from theads database 113. At thecontent provider 110, the retrieved content and ad may have a format that is appropriate for presentation by thenonmobile device 104, and this content and ad may be routed back to themobile content provider 122. Themobile content provider 122 may reformat the content for presentation by themobile device 116 and may further identify the ad and replace it with a substitute ad or promotional item from theads database 125 The substitute ad may be formatted for presentation by themobile device 116. Themobile content provider 122 may then transmit the (possibly reformatted) content and the substitute ad to themobile device 116 via thenetwork 107 and themobile device network 119. -
FIG. 2 provides screenshots of example content and advertising material on a nonmobile device and similar content and substitute advertising material on a mobile device, illustrating how advertising material may be identified and replaced for presentation by a mobile device. As shown, thefirst example screenshot 201 corresponds to a nonmobile device, such as thenonmobile device 104 that is shown inFIG. 1 ; thesecond screenshot 204 corresponds to a mobile device, such as themobile device 116. As described above, thenonmobile device 104 may be associated with a larger screen, more processing power and a greater-bandwidth network connection; themobile device 116 may be associated with a smaller screen, less processing power, and a lower-bandwidth network connection. - As shown, the
example content 201 is responsive to a query for information (e.g., a query for the location of Italian restaurants near Minneapolis). The content includes theoriginal search query 207, a list ofresults 210 that meet theoriginal search query 207, amap 213, and various markers (e.g., marker 216) on themap 213 corresponding to the list ofresults 210. Various controls (e.g., controls 219 or 222) allow a user of thenonmobile device 104 to manipulate the content, such as, for example, by navigating through the list ofresults 210, selecting individual markers, panning or zooming in on detail on themap 213, etc. - As shown, the
content 201 also includesadvertising material 225. In some implementations, theadvertising material 225 may include a link that, upon selection, takes a user to another site. In some implementations, theadvertising material 225 may be graphic-intensive, media-rich advertising, such as, for example, flash-based advertising that presents video and sound media. - In some implementations, the
example content 201 may also be substantially available ascontent 228 from a mobile device. Thescreenshot 204 illustrates aportion 231 of thecontent 228 as it may appear on a mobile device, such as, themobile device 116. The content may be “scrollable” within discrete “pages.” As shown, thecontent 204 represents aportion 231 of thescrollable content 228 that may be displayed on the mobile device at one time. As shown, thecontent 228 is also responsive to the example query for information described above (a query for location of Italian restaurants near Minneapolis). Thecontent 228 includes theoriginal search query 234 itself, a list ofresults 235 that meet theoriginal search query 234, amap 237, and various markers (e.g., marker 240) on themap 237 corresponding to the list ofresults 235. The user of themobile device 116 may use various controls, such as hyperlinks (e.g., hyperlink 243) or control boxes (e.g., control box 246), to navigate through the list ofsearch results 235, pan or zoom within themap 237, etc. To activate the various controls (e.g., controls 243 or 246), the user may employ various keys (e.g., key 249), buttons or other means of input (e.g., voice activation; motion sensors; position sensors that sense, e.g., roll, pitch or yaw). For example, the user may employ adirectional navigation button 252 to select one of the various map control links (e.g., link 243), or abutton 249 to select a “soft command” 246 displayed on the screen. - The
content 228 may also include an electronicpromotional item 255, such as an ad, that solicits a response form the mobile device user. As shown, the ad is associated with a particular entry from the list of results 235 (e.g., “Vescio's Italian Restaurant”). Thead 255 may include text, graphics or sound to attract the user's attention. For example, the ad may include scrolling or flashing text or graphics that appear in a different color from the color of other displayed text, or that change color. The text or graphic may be associated with asound 258 that is played when the ad is “in focus,” or displayed in theviewable portion 231 of thepage 228. Thead 255 may solicit action that is appropriate for a mobile device user. For example, thead 255 may provide the user with asoft command 246 that, upon activation by a user of acorresponding key 249 or other input, causes the mobile device to dial a number associated with thead 255. Dialing the number may allow the mobile device user to call a restaurant (e.g., “Vescio's Italian Restaurant”) to make a reservation. As another example, an ad may solicit a vote from a user, possibly in response to a survey that may be related to other content presented by the mobile device. Other responses that are appropriate for mobile device users may also be solicited. - In some implementations, the ad may be a substitute ad that is presented to replace an ad corresponding to content for a nonmobile device. That is, a content provider, such as the
mobile content provider 122 that is shown inFIG. 1 , may identify ads associated with content from thecontent provider 110 and replace them with substitute ads that may be more appropriate of presentation by a mobile device. The process by which an ad may be identified and replaced with a substitute ad is now described in greater detail with reference toFIG. 3 . - To summarize the example shown in
FIG. 2 , a mobile device may transmit to a content provider a request for information (e.g., a request for Italian restaurants in Minneapolis) (request not shown inFIG. 2 ). The content provider may respond to the request (e.g., with a listing of Italian restaurants in Minneapolis) and may also identify an ad that corresponds to the requested information. Had the request been received from a nonmobile device, the responsive information and ad may appear as shown in thescreenshot 201. A mobile content provider (shown inFIG. 2 ) may reformat for presentation by a mobile device the content, and identify and replace the ad with a substitute ad. The reformatted content and substitute ad may appear as shown in thescreenshot 228, of whichportion 204 is a part. As shown, thead 225 that would have been displayed on a nonmobile device has been replaced by thead 255, which is suitable for presentation by a mobile device. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating example actions that may be taken to identify electronic promotional material within other content, replace the electronic promotional material with substitute electronic promotional material, and deliver the content and substitute electronic promotional material to a mobile device. For purposes of illustration, the actions are indicating as occurring at a mobile device, mobile content provider and a content provider. However, the actions or similar actions could also be carried out by fewer devices or sites or with a different arrangement of devices or sites. - As shown, a user of a mobile device may transmit (301) to a mobile content provider a request for content. For example, a user of the
mobile device 116 may transmit (301) a query for information about Italian restaurants in the Minneapolis area to amobile content provider 122. In some implementations, the user-entered query may include location information corresponding to the query; in some implementations, location-pinpointing technology within themobile device 116 or correspondingmobile device network 119 may provide such location information to themobile device 116. - A mobile content provider receives (304) the request. For example, the
mobile content provider 122 may receive a request for content from themobile device 116 via thenetwork 107 andmobile device network 119. In some implementations (as illustrated inFIG. 3 ), themobile content provider 122 may provide proxy and transcoding functionality to allow mobile devices to access content that may not be specifically formatted for presentation by mobile devices. For example, the mobile content provider may retrieve content from anothercontent provider 110 in one format (e.g., HTML format for delivery via HTTP), transcode the content into another format (e.g., WML format for delivery via WAP), and deliver the transcoded content to a mobile device. In some implementations (not shown inFIG. 3 ), themobile content provider 122 may maintain or access its own body of content that is specifically formatted for presentation via a mobile device. For example, themobile content provider 122 may provide data services tailored specifically for mobile devices, such as, for example, data services for a traffic congestion application, such as Zipdash. As another example, themobile content provider 122 may provide a substantial “mirror” of data content available from thecontent provider 110. More particularly, a news provider may provide multi media-rich content for nonmobile devices fromcontent provider 110, and the same news provider may maintain separate but substantively similar content consisting of primarily text and small images for mobile devices frommobile content provider 122. - In the proxy and transcoding implementations described above, the mobile content provider transmits (307) the request to another content provider. For example, the
mobile content provider 122 transmits (307) the request (e.g., a query for Italian restaurants in Minneapolis) to thecontent provider 110. Themobile content provider 122 may transmit (307) the request to thecontent provider 110 via thenetwork 107, for example, using standard protocols; or themobile content provider 122 may transmit (307) the request to thecontent provider 110 via a substantially direct or private connection. - The content provider receives (310) the request. For example, the
content provider 110 receives (310) the request from themobile content provider 122. In response to receiving (310) the request, the content provider obtains (313) the requested content. Referring toFIG. 2 , thecontent provider 110 may obtain content that, if displayed on a nonmobile device such as thedevice 104, would appear as the list ofresults 210 and themap 213. - In some implementations, the
content provider 110 maintains a database of content (not shown) and obtains the requested content from the database. In some implementations, the content includes a search engine that maintains an index (not shown) of content inside and outside acontent provider 110, and thecontent provider 110 retrieves (313) the requested content from inside or outside thecontent provider 110 based on contents of the index. The index may be regularly updated, for example, by automated web crawlers or spiders, and if the requested content is not currently indexed, thecontent provider 110 may dynamically locate it. - Upon obtaining (313) the requested content, the content provider obtains (316) one or more electronic promotional items to provide with the content. For example, the
content provider 110 may obtain (316) one or more ads from thead database 113. More particularly, as described above, thecontent provider 110, or a separate ad provider (not shown), may identify various “candidate ads.” The candidate ads may correspond to the requested content, to a query associated with the requested content, or to some other parameter associated with a user or device requesting the content. For example, candidate ads may be selected by certain words associated with the initial query (e.g., “Italian restaurants”); by certain words associated with one or more results (“Olive Garden” or “Vescios”); by some parameter associated with the requesting device (e.g., mobile device model, mobile network, location, current user account associated with the request, etc.); or by some other parameter (e.g., based on random selection of ads; rotating selection; selection based on time of day or day of week). From the candidate ads, thecontent provider 110 or ad provider may select one or more ads to deliver with the requested content. The selection may further be based on parameters set by an ad sponsor, such as maximum ad cost or frequency. In some implementations, the final selection may result from an effective dynamic electronic “auction” where two or more ads are “bid” against each other. Referring toFIG. 2 , thecontent provider 110 may obtain thead 225. - Once the content provider finally selects and obtains (316) one or more electronic promotional items, it transmits (319) both the requested content and the one or more electronic promotional items to the mobile content provider. For example, the
content provider 110 may transmit (319) the requested content and the obtained ad(s) to themobile content provider 122, via thenetwork 107 or via a direct connection. - The mobile content provider receives (322) the requested content and one or more electronic promotional items. For example, the
mobile content provider 122 receives the requested content and the one or more corresponding ads. Referring toFIG. 2 , the requested content and one or more corresponding ads may include the list ofresults 210, themap 213 and thead 225. - The mobile content provider identifies (325) the one or more electronic promotional items. For example, referring to
FIG. 2 , themobile content provider 122 may identify (325) thead 225. Themobile content provider 110 may identify thead 225 in numerous ways. In some implementations, portions of the content and thead 225 may be coded in various formats common to networks, such as, for example, HTML, extensible HTML (XHTML), extensible markup language (XML), JAVA script, or other appropriate formats; identifying thead 225 may include parsing the code and/or searching the code for particular elements. For example, themobile content provider 122 may search for references to known ad servers (e.g., “doubleclick” or “googlesyndication”) and may identify parsed sections that contain the references to the known ad servers as ads. As another example, themobile content provider 122 may search for links that, if selected, would redirect a user to a different domain, unrelated to a domain corresponding to the content; upon finding such a link, themobile content provider 122 may identify a section of code that contains the link as an ad. As another example, themobile content provider 122 may search for keywords, such as, for example, “advertising” or “ad”; upon finding such a keyword, themobile content provider 122 may identify a section of code that contains the keyword as an ad. - Upon identifying (325) the one or more electronic promotional items, the mobile content provider replaces (328) the one or more electronic promotional items with one or more substitute electronic promotional items. For example, the
mobile content provider 122 may replace ads originally selected from theads database 113 by thecontent provider 110 with substitute ads from theads database 125. In some implementations, a substitute ad may be related to the replaced ad. That is, the substitute ad may be provided by the same ad sponsor as the replaced ad, and the substitute ad may be for the same product or service as the replaced ad; however, the substitute ads may be formatted for presentation by a mobile device, whereas the replaced ads may be formatted for presentation by a nonmobile device. In some implementations, a substitute ad may be unrelated to the replaced ad. For example, the substitute ad may be provided by a different ad sponsor than the replaced ad, or the substitute ad may be for a different product or service than the replaced ad. The substitute ad may be selected in a separate “auction” of mobile device ads, similar to that described above. Referring toFIG. 2 , thead 225 displayed on the nonmobile device has been replaced with thesubstitute ad 255 for presentation by the mobile device. - In addition to replacing (328) one or more electronic promotional items with one or more substitute electronic promotional items, the mobile content provider may reformat (331) the requested content. As an example, the requested content may be in a format such as HTML, and the mobile content provider may transcode it to have a format such as WML. Transcoding or reformatting (331) may involve conversions or translations from or to other formats. In general, if necessary, the
mobile content provider 122 may convert content from a format appropriate for presentation by a nonmobile device to a format appropriate for presentation by a mobile device. Referring toFIG. 2 , thecontent 201 has a first format for presentation by a nonmobile device, such as thenonmobile device 104, and thiscontent 201 is transcoded to have asecond format 228 for presentation by a mobile device such at themobile device 116. - Upon replacing (328) electronic promotional item(s) with substitute electronic promotional item(s), and optionally reformatting (331) requested content, the mobile content provider transmits (334) the (reformatted) requested content and the substitute electronic promotional item(s) to the mobile device. For example, the
mobile content provider 122 may transmit the (reformatted) requested content and substitute ad to themobile device 116 via thenetwork 107 andmobile device network 119. - The mobile device receives (337) the requested content and one or more substitute electronic promotional items, and subsequently presents them in the mobile device. For example, referring to
FIG. 2 , the mobile device (e.g., mobile device 116) receives thecontent 228, including thead 255, and presents it (displays images and text, plays video, outputs sounds, etc.) on the mobile device. - The transmission (334)/reception (337) process may involve a single, continuous transfer of data; or the transmission (334)/reception (337) process may involve a series of discrete transfers of data. For example, in the case of a single continuous transfer, all of the
content 228, including theoriginal query 234, theinitial map 237, thecontrols 243, the list ofresults 235 and thead 255 may be transferred to the mobile device, stored in memory on the mobile device, and presented from memory as appropriate. As another example, only portions of thecontent 228 may be transferred to the mobile device at any given time. The size of the portions transferred may depend on an amount of content that can be displayed at a given time on the mobile device, or an amount of memory included in the mobile device or on some other parameter. More particularly, referring again toFIG. 2 , theoriginal query 234, theinitial map 237 and the map controls 243 may be transferred in one discrete transfer. Subsequently, a portion of the list ofresults 235 may be transferred. Subsequently, theportion 231, including thead 255, may be transferred. Which content is transferred may depend on user input, such as, for example, user input from thenavigation button 252 orselection key 249 as the user scrolls through thecontent 228. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of asystem 400 that may be used to receive a request for content from a mobile device; obtain content responsive to the received request and electronic promotional material that is associated with the retrieved content; identify the electronic promotional material and replace it with substitute electronic promotional material; and transmit the responsive content and the substitute electronic promotional material to the mobile device. In some implementations, portions of thesystem 400 may be included in a mobile content provider, such as themobile content provider 122. In some implementations, thesystem 400 may perform one or more of the example actions described with reference toFIG. 3 . - The
system 400 may store or index content that users of mobile or nonmobile devices may access. For example, the system may internally store content in asystem storage device 405. Thesystem 400 may also index content in anindex database 408. The indexed content may be content that is stored in thesystem storage device 405 or that is stored outside of thesystem 400. As shown, thesystem 400 includes a content retrieval module 411 (e.g., a search engine) that accepts requests for content from users of mobile or nonmobile devices and retrieves responsive content, for example from the system storage or from sources external to thesystem 400, based on entries in theindex database 408. - Users may access the
content retrieval module 411 via aninterface 414, which is shown as connected to thenetwork 107. A user of a nonmobile device, such as, for example, the computing device 104 (seeFIG. 1 ), may access thecontent retrieval module 411 to retrieve particular content by sending a request to thecontent retrieval module 411 via thenetwork 107 and theinterface 414. Similarly, a user of a mobile device, such as, for example, themobile device 116, may access thecontent retrieval module 411 to retrieve particular content by sending a request to thecontent retrieval module 411 via thenetworks interface 414. In some implementations, themobile device network 119 may directly connect to the system 400 (direct connection not shown inFIG. 4 ). - As shown, the
interface 414 includes arequest processor 417 and aresponse formatter 420. The interface may employ therequest processor 417 to format for internal use requests received from mobile or nonmobile devices. For example, therequest processor 417 may parse requests and reformat them from HTML, WML or text format, to search terms or strings that are compatible with thecontent retrieval module 411. Theinterface 414 may employ theresponse formatter 420 to format content that is responsive to received requests. Theresponse formatter 420 may, for example, format responsive content and ads in a format like HTML, XML, WML, or some other suitable format, depending on the requesting device. Theresponse formatter 420 may work in conjunction with theinterface 414, or it may be part of theinterface 414, as shown. - Information in the
index database 408 may be gathered by an automated information gatherer, such as, for example, aweb crawler 423 or a spider. Theweb crawler 423 may, for example, continuously or almost continuously index new information from sources connected to thenetwork 107. Theweb crawler 423 may also retrieve content in response to a search query (e.g., content external to the system). Some information that is indexed may also be stored (cached) in thesystem storage 405. - In addition to being indexed in the
index database 408 or added to thesystem storage 405, information may be manually loaded in (or retrieved from) theindex database 408 orsystem storage 405 through amaintenance interface 426. For example, themaintenance interface 426 may allow an administrator of thesystem 400 to manually add bulk data to theindex database 408 or to thesystem storage 405. - The
system 400 further includes anad delivery system 429 along with anad database 432 and anad log 435. Thead delivery system 429 may receive query requests and other input from theinterface 414, via thecontent retrieval module 411 or directly (direct connection not shown). In some implementations, thead delivery system 429 may select an ad from thead database 432 to deliver in conjunction with other content, such as, for example, a response to a query. Referring toFIG. 2 , thesystem 400 may select thead 225 to deliver to a nonmobile device along with thecontent 201. Thead delivery system 429 may select one or more ads in the manner described above with reference toFIGS. 1 and 3 . Delivery of particular ads may be logged in thead log 435. In addition, some ads may solicit a response from the user of a device to which the ad is delivered, and any such responses to ads may be directed back to thesystem 400 and logged in thead log 435. The contents of thead log 435 may be subsequently used to bill sponsors of such ads or log various statistics related to ads or to their determined effectiveness. - The
system 400 also includes a mobilecontent retrieval module 438. In some implementations, the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 functions in a manner similar to thecontent retrieval module 411 but primarily processes content that may be formatted for presentation by mobile devices. For example, the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may receive requests for mobile content from mobile devices, via thenetworks interface 414; obtain content that is responsive to the requests; and transmit the responsive content back to the requesting device. The mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may be coupled to a separate index, storage device, web crawler and maintenance interface (not shown inFIG. 4 ). In some implementations, as shown inFIG. 4 , the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 functions as a proxy or transcoder for accessing content that is accessible by, and possibly formatted for, nonmobile devices. For example, as shown, the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 is coupled to thecontent retrieval module 411 and may transcode for delivery to a mobile device content that is retrieved by thecontent retrieval module 411. More particularly, the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may receive a request from a mobile device, via themobile device network 119,network 107 andinterface 414 and transmit the request to thecontent retrieval module 411. Thecontent retrieval module 411 may obtain content that is responsive to the request (e.g., in HTML format) and transmit the content to the mobilecontent retrieval module 438. The mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may transcode the content to a format suitable for presentation by the mobile device (e.g., WML). - As described above, the content retrieved by the
content retrieval module 411 may be delivered with one or more ads provided by thead delivery system 429. The mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may optionally replace these ads. More particularly, the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may employ areplacement module 441 and a mobilead delivery system 444 to identify an ad and replace it with a substitute ad. - The mobile
ad delivery system 444 may be arranged in a structure and function that is similar to thead delivery system 429. That is, the mobilead delivery system 444 may select ads from thead database 447 in the manner described above, and log various parameters associated with the ad in anad log 450. Referring toFIG. 2 , thesystem 400 may select thead 255 as a substitute ad for the originally identifiedad 225. - The
system 400 shown inFIG. 4 is merely an example, and a system that identifies electronic promotional items and replaces them with substitute electronic promotional items may take other forms. In particular, thesystem 400 may be divided into separate systems to allow for scalability, data integrity or data security; or thesystem 400 may be divided into separate subsystems, each of which is provided by a different company or physical system. For example,content retrieval module 411,web crawler 423,maintenance interface 426,index 408 andsystem storage 405 may comprise astandalone system 453 that, in conjunction with theinterface 414, provides search engine functionality (e.g., Google systems). Similarly, thead delivery system 429,ad database 432 andad log 435 may comprise a standalone ad delivery system 456 (e.g., Google AdWords, or AdSense ad servers), which may provide ads to a search engine or other content provider. Likewise, the mobilecontent retrieval module 438 may be part of astandalone transcoder 459 that may also include thereplacement module 441 for replacing ads with substitute ads. The substitute ads may be provided by a second,standalone ad provider 462. In some implementations, thead providers - The
system 400 may be connected to other networks (not shown), such as, for example, an internal company network or a local wireless communication network. The interface may be distributed and may include other interfaces (not shown) that allow various components to exchange, transmit or receive data. The index and/or storage may be local to thesystem 400 or external to the system and may also be distributed across various physical devices. -
