Definitions
- the field of the invention is telecommunications, and more specifically, the use of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to transport cell based information over a physical medium (layer) in which a single network point connects to one or more devices over a bi-directional communications network.
- ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode
- the invention specifically relates to when devices on the ATM network are allowed to transmit data, so that best utilization of the communications resources (bandwidth) is made.
- the physical layer is defined as a functional group comprised of hardware, software and transmission media which converts an ATM cell stream into bits to be transported over the transmission media.
- the physical layer supports the transmission and reception of these bits. Examples of transmission media are optical fiber, coaxial cable, free space, and twisted copper pairs.
- the network is configured in a point-to-multipoint or bus configuration on a shared media, where several devices receive from and transmit to a single station.
- a shared media include free space propagation such as in radio systems, where a base station communicates with a number of remote stations, or a computing network in a small business in which all of the terminals are connected to a central server by a single pair of wires running throughout the building.
- ATM networks transfer information in the form of cells. These cells contain both a data field and a header field. The data field contains user data, while the header field contains routing/identification and error control fields. Packet based networks transmit information in the form of packets which have similar structures to the cells in ATM networks.
- the term cell refers to any type of cell or packet in a communications network.
- devices are granted permission to transmit one or more cells from a buffer which contains cells awaiting transmission.
- the permission can be in the form of a grant, which allows the device to transmit a cell in an upcoming opportunity.
- cell opportunity when used herein, refers to an allocation of time or frequency which can be used to transmit a cell.
- a grant can be received in a frame which indicates that a cell opportunity in a subsequent frame can be used.
- Vs Virtual Circuits
- ABR Available Bit Rate
- FTTC Fiber-to-the-Curb
- ONUs Optical Network Units
- signals can be routed to the residence via a single coaxial cable connecting the residence to the ONU, but the passive network in the home results in a shared media, with all of the devices in the residence needing to transmit over a single coaxial cable.
- One of the goals of the present invention is to provide one or more embodiments which permit the transport of ATM cells over a point-to-point and point-to-multipoint networks in a manner such that devices on that network are issued grants to transmit cells to the ONU, and that these grants are allocated in a manner that guarantees that the virtual circuits that have been established between the central station and the devices have the Constant Bit Rate (CBR), Variable Bit Rate (VBR) or Available Bit Rate (ABR) services that they have contracted for in the system, according to the parameters specified in the Quality of Service (QoS) associated with each of the virtual circuits.
- CBR Constant Bit Rate
- VBR Variable Bit Rate
- ABR Available Bit Rate
- QoS Quality of Service
- the QoS defines the basic parameters of the VC including the cell loss rate and average delay.
- Another goal of the invention is to provide a method for issuing grants such that cells associated with CBR services have a minimum variation between cells, resulting in a low Cell Delay Variation (CDV).
- CDV Cell Delay Variation
- a method for allocating bandwidth in a cell based communications system is presented in which a grant table is constructed which contains grants to allow one or more remote devices connected to a central device to transmit cells. The number of grants required for a particular device and VC is calculated and the optimum locations for those grants in the grant table are calculated. The optimum locations are those locations which space the grants evenly and minimize cell delay variation.
- Devices that have information which can be transmitted on an ABR virtual circuit transmit the number of cells they have awaiting transmission to the central location which maintains that information in a queue table.
- the central device has one or more locations in the grant table which are unused, remote devices having cells awaiting transmission are issued grants. This is accomplished by examining the queue table and determining that a device has one or more cells awaiting transmission and issuing that device one or more grants.
- the queue tables for each device are examined sequentially to determine if there are cells awaiting transmission and to issue grants to those devices.
- the central device can also be connected to a master device which may not have the bandwidth to accommodate all of the cells being transmitted from the devices to the central device and which will be subsequently transmitted to the master device.
- a signal can be issued from the master device to the central device which prohibits the further issuance of ABR grants to the devices connected to the central device and which therefore prevents the overflow of memories or First-In-First-Out registers in the master device.
- FIG. 1 shows a Fiber-to-the-Curb network with a point-to-multipoint coaxial network connecting the Optical Network Unit (ONU) with devices in the residence.

- FIG. 2 shows a grant table
- FIG. 3 illustrates a method of allocating grants for constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) services
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method of allocating grants for constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) services using an offset in the cell requests.
- CBR constant bit rate
- VBR variable bit rate
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method of generating grants for available bit rate (ABR) services.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an algorithm for grant location optimization.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an algorithm for the allocation of ABR grants.
- One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of allocating bandwidth to devices on a point-to-multipoint or shared media, such that different types of services including CBR, VBR and ABR can be provided, and that CBR and VBR services have a minimum of CDV.
- a grant table is utilized in the central receiving point (ONU).
- the grant table issues grants to the devices so that they can transmit their upstream cells.
- the grant table is composed of memory which contains the identification (ID) number of the device which is being granted permission to transmit a cell during any given transmission opportunity.
- the grant table is read continuously, and the device IDs form grants which are transmitted in the downstream (ONU to device) direction. The devices, upon observing grants containing their IDs, will transmit a cell to the central receiving point (ONU).
- the grant table can be constructed by utilizing the peak cell rate (PCR) value for the CBR and VBR virtual circuits associated with a device, and the minimum cell rate (MCR) for ABR virtual circuits associated with that device.
- PCR peak cell rate
- MCR minimum cell rate
- the grant table can be programmed such that devices which need CBR and VBR services periodically receive grants to maintain the PCR, and that variation between the grants is minimized. This results in CBR and VBR services with a minimum of CDV.
- the grants that are available after PCR and MCR requirements have been met can be used for ABR virtual circuits by issuing these grants to devices which have indicated that they have cells stored and ready to be transmitted.
- the mechanism in which available grants are allocated consists of monitoring the number of cells each device has stored for transmission, and keeping this information in a queue table at the central receiving point (ONU). If there are cells ready for transmission from the devices, the grant table will indicate so, and an ABR grant generator uses this information to determine which device should be issued a grant. In this way grants not needed for CBR and VBR services are used for ABR services, and the capacity of the channel is used to the fullest extent possible.
- One embodiment of the invention is its use on a FTTC network in which the coaxial drop cable from a central receiving unit is connected to a number of devices in a residence.
- the grant table is located in the central receiving unit, and grants are issued to the devices in the residence such that the QoS for Virtual circuits from the device to the central receiving unit are maintained.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a Fiber-to-the-Curb (FTTC) network which delivers telecommunications services to a residence 250.
- Services are provided in the FTTC network shown in FIG. 1 via a Host Digital Terminal 100 which is connected to an Optical Network Unit 110 via an optical fiber 200.
- the connection to the residence 250 is made by a ONU physical layer transceiver 120 which is connected by a coaxial drop cable 210 to a splitter 220 which is connected to one or more devices 140 via in-home coaxial cable 230.
- One or more residences can be served by ONU 110. In a preferred embodiment eight residences 250 are served by ONU 110.
- the preferred embodiment utilizes a coaxial drop cable 210
- a number of alternate media can be used to connect ONU 110 with residence 250. This includes wireless transmission and transmission over twisted pair. Transmission media and techniques for this connection are well understood by those skilled in the art. Similarly, the transmission media in the residence 250 is not limited to coaxial cable.
- Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocols and formats can be used to carry the signals.
- ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode
- the system requires bi-directional communications between the devices in the residence 250 and the ONU 110. Information is transmitted in the upstream direction, for example, from the devices 140 to the ONU 240.
- UUTOPIA Universal Test & Operations PHY Interface for ATM
- the devices 140 can be connected to a number of types of terminal equipment including televisions, telephones, and computers.
- the system provides for the transport of ATM cells in the upstream direction as well as the downstream (ONU to devices) direction.
- the relevant interfaces for this network are illustrated in FIG. 1 and are the User Network Interface (UNI) interface 300 on the coaxial cable and the UTOPIA interface 310 at the output of the device.
- UNI User Network Interface
- the devices in the residence 250 are connected to ONU physical layer transceiver 120 via a subscriber coaxial cable network, which when used herein, is defined as a network comprised of a coaxial drop cable 210, splitter 220, and in-home coaxial wiring 230, which connects an individual residence 250 to the ONU physical layer transceiver 120.
- subscriber coaxial cable network forms a shared media since it allows all devices 140 connected to it to access the ONU physical layer transceiver 120 with no active switching.
- a multiple access protocol is required to permit the devices 140 connected to the subscriber coaxial network access the ONU physical layer transceiver 120.
- a number of multiple access protocols can be used including Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA).
- FDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access
- CDMA Code Division Multiple Access
- TDMA Time Division Multiple Access
- the devices will be assigned opportunities for the transmissions to the ONU physical layer transceiver 120, and, when ATM protocols are used, will transmit one or more cells in the opportunities.
- the TDMA protocol requires that the devices 140 transmit cells in a manner such that the data arriving at the ONU physical layer transceiver 120 from the devices 140 does not overlap in time.
- the TDMA technique is well understood by those skilled in the art.
- a mechanism used to allow devices 140 to communicate with the ONU 110 by utilizing opportunities is a grant table 700 which is illustrated in FIG. 2.
- the grant table 700 is located in ONU 110.
- the grant table 700 is composed of a grant table memory 510 and an address decoder 500.
- the address inputs 505 are stepped through such that the contents of the grant table memory 510 are read sequentially from the memory and appears at data outputs 515.
- Grants for each device must be made at a rate which corresponds to the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS) for each virtual circuit connected to that device.
- QoS Quality of Service
- PCRs peak cell rates
- SCRs sustained cell rates
- Virtual circuits established for ABR (available bit rate) services may also include a minimum cell rate (MCR). Grants must be provided to each device at a rate high enough to accommodate the aggregate QoS requirements for all of the upstream virtual circuits from a given device.
- VBR virtual circuit Even though a given VBR virtual circuit will only output cells at its SCR over the long term, it is capable of outputting cells at its PCR over the short term. Since the ONU 110 cannot anticipate when this will occur, it must allocate grants for each VBR virtual circuit at the PCR--otherwise the virtual circuit would not be provided the negotiated QoS. Given that grants for each VBR virtual circuit must be generated at the PCR, the aggregate PCR for a device can be calculated by summing the PCRs for all of the CBR and VBR virtual circuits.
- Each device will have a signaling virtual circuit that allows for the connection and disconnection of other virtual circuits.
- the signaling virtual circuit is an ABR circuit.
- the signaling channel has a constant data rate established by a CBR virtual circuit, or has a variable date rate established by using a VBR virtual circuit.
- the MCR (or PCR) of this signaling virtual circuit will ensure that PCR device never falls to zero, even when no other virtual circuits are connected. This results in the issuance of periodic grants which form the signaling virtual circuit.
- the exact data rate of the signaling virtual circuit will depend on the application, and extremely low data rates (e.g. b/s) with long times between grants (e.g. seconds) will be adequate for some applications, while for other applications high data rates (e.g. 100s of kb/s) with short times (e.g. ⁇ s) between grants will be required.
- one grant table 700 exists per coaxial drop cable 210, and its contents simply indicate a sequence of device IDs which should, in order, be given grants.
- the ONU (110) continually progresses through the grant table from beginning to end, generating grants as it does.
- Downstream and upstream frame structures can be used in a multiple access system such as that illustrated in FIG. 1, with grants being allocated in a downstream frame, and cells being transmitted in an upstream frame.
- a superframe can be defined as an integer number of frames.
- the upstream superframe length can be defined as T sf .sbsb.-- up
- the downstream superframe length as T sf .sbsb.-- down .
- four upstream cells are transmitted every downstream superframe, with each cell corresponding to an upstream frame.
- the downstream superframe is composed of a single frame.
- Four grants are transported downstream in a downstream frame and allow specific devices 140 to transmit upstream in the following frame.
- the number of entries q in the grant table can be calculated as
- k is an arbitrary constant which defines the granularity of the bandwidth which can be allocated to a particular device 140
- p is the number of upstream cells transmitted during a downstream superframe.
- PCR min which can be calculated as ##EQU2##
- the minimum transport rate which results from the minimum peak cell rate can then be calculated as
- variable r can be used to represent the number of entries in the grant table allocated for a specific device, and can be determined as ##EQU3## where Int represents the integer function which results in the rounding up the value in brackets to the next highest integer value.
- upstream cells are transmitted every 125 ⁇ s downstream superframe.
- the device ID in each grant able entry can have 16 possible values:
- the number of grant table entries, r required for that device can be calculated.
- Each of these r entries should have the device ID (1 to 14) of the corresponding device.
- the PCR dev value for that device may increase.
- r may also increase, and new grant table entries with the corresponding device ID should be added accordingly (replacing existing entries having a value of ⁇ 15 ⁇ with new entries corresponding to the device ID).
- these new entries are determined and are recognized as the desired grant table locations 605.
- the ideal locations will be based upon fixed locations (at regular intervals) in the grant table memory 510, since the fixed locations at regular intervals result in minimized CDV.
- FIG. 4 illustrates how further improvement can be obtained by utilizing an offset 630 which results in better placement of the final grant allocations 610 based on the existing grant allocations 600 and the desired grant allocations 605 utilizing the first level search space 620.
- the C++ algorithm shown in FIG. 6 implements the grant allocation process illustrated in FIG. 3.
- the PCR dev value for that device is likely to decrease.
- r may also decrease, and an appropriate number of grant table entries with the corresponding device ID should be removed by changing those entries to a value of ⁇ 15 ⁇ .
- the ONU may be able to provide additional grants in order to better support ABR virtual circuits. Specifically, for each unused grant table entry (indicated by a value of ⁇ 15 ⁇ ), the ONU can allocate a grant to a device which has ABR cells waiting for transmission.
- the grants generated for ABR cells must be dynamically changeable.
- a means is required of altering the generated grants rapidly in response to knowledge of the ABR cell queue depths in the devices 140. Grants related to CBR and VBR virtual circuits, and to the ABR MCR requirement are not altered and remain static in the grant table to provide the negotiated QoS for each virtual circuit.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method and apparatus for generating ABR grants based on available grant table entries, and the requirement of a device 140 to transmit ABR cells.
- the grant table 700 and queue tables 730 are located in ONU 110.
- the method consists of a having a counter 710 which cycles through the grant table 700 illustrated in FIG. 2.
- the counter produces the grant table address GTADDR 701 which results in grant table data GTDATA 703 being read out.
- the GTDATA data 703 of FIG. 5 corresponds to the memory data outputs 515 of grant table 700 illustrated in FIG. 2. This data goes to a multiplexor 725, and a ABR grant generator 720.
- each device 140 reports on the number of ABR cells it has for transmission, this information being stored in a queue table 730.
- the ABR grant generator 720 receives a grant which indicates that no device will transmit cells (corresponding to value ⁇ 15 ⁇ ), it inspects the queue table 730 by sending a device ID on the queue table address, QTADDR line 707and receiving a number on the queue table data, QTDATA line 709 which corresponds to the number of ABR cells that device 140 has in its ABR queue to transmit. If the device has ABR cells in this queue, the ABR grant generator 720 asserts the OKAY signal 705 which causes the multiplexer 725 to transmit the device ID on its output as a GRANT VALUE 711. In the event that the queue table 730 indicates that that particular device 140 does not have ABR cells in its ABR queue, it goes to the next device address to determine if that device has cells in its queue.
- FIG. 7 A method which describes this process, and which is equivalent in function to the circuit shown in FIG. 5, is shown in FIG. 7. It makes use of queue depth information from a single ABR queue in each device.
- Each device 140 reports on the status of an ABR queue, with the queue number of that queue constant throughout all devices 140.
- the ABR queue information carried in every upstream cell is used to update queue table 730 in the ONU.
- This table has an entry for each device ID which indicates the number of ABR cells awaiting transport from that device.
- the queue table 730 has a width of 4 bits and a depth of 14.
- multiple queues can exist in each device with corresponding queue tables for each device
- variable Xon in the method shown in Table II of FIG. 7 refers to a signal generated at a higher level which indicates whether or not ABR grants should be generated. Setting Xon equal to ⁇ false ⁇ will prevent any ABR grants from being issued.
- the utility of having an Xon variable with ⁇ true ⁇ and ⁇ false ⁇ settings is that if there is not sufficient bandwidth in another part of the access system for ABR cells, setting Xon equal to ⁇ false ⁇ will prevent devices 140 from transmitting ABR cells and prevent overflow of memories or First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structures in the system.
- FIFO First-In-First-Out
- an ABR queue is present in HDT 100, which receives cells transmitted from ONU 110 over optical fiber 200.
- HDT 100 can set the Xon variable to ⁇ false ⁇ which will prevent ABR grants from being issued to devices 140, as illustrated in FIG. 7.
- the delay can be accommodated by dimensioning the ABR queue size Q HDT in HDT 100 to be equal to
- C transit is the maximum number of cells which can simultaneously exist in transit on the longest link between HDT 100 and ONU 110
- SMR is the statistical multiplexing region.
- the statistical multiplexing region should be large enough to account for the normal variations in the number of queued cells. If the statistical multiplexing region is too small, the ABR upstream flow from the ONU 110 will constantly be turned on and off, even during normal traffic conditions.
- An application of the invention is the transmission of data from a device such as a computer located in residence 250 and connected to device 140 to ONU physical layer transceiver 120 located in ONU 110.
- the computer may be allocated bandwidth using an ABR mechanism in order to allow it to transmit a file to ONU 110 and on to HDT 100 for transmission to another computer which is connected to HDT 100 via a Public Switched Telecommunications Network (PSTN) or a private telecommunications network.
- PSTN Public Switched Telecommunications Network
- the device 140 connected to the computer can be allocated grants using one of the embodiments of the present invention, such that the bandwidth on the subscriber coaxial network is effectively used.
- the effective use of the bandwidth becomes more important if there are other devices 140 in the same residence 250 which are utilizing CBR or VBR virtual circuits for applications such as telephony or video.
- allowing the computer to utilize upstream cells not required for CBR or VBR services permits all devices in the home to be used simultaneously and does not waste cells by establishing a CBR or VBR virtual circuit for the computer file transfer when an ABR virtual circuit is adequate.
