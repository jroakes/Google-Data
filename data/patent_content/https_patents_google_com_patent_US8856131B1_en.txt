- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a general architecture for a computer system that may be employed to implement various elements of the systems and methods described and illustrated herein, according to an illustrative implementation.
- the systems and methods can detect, infer, or identify computer network based activity of computing devices that a user is manipulating to access information on the computer network.
- the activity of users on the content network can be maintained in an anonymous fashion so that individuals cannot be identified from the user activity.
- the user activity information can be collected on an opt-in basis, and users can opt out of the collection of their user activity information.
- the users can be represented by identifiers associated with a computing device, for example using a cookie or user profile information without regard to the actual identity of the individual person using the computing device.
- a user list can be obtained.
- the user list can indicate, for example, a list of users determined to have an interest in a product or service, such as “cars.”
- the user list can include a group of users and indicate their corresponding features.
- the features relate, for example, to Internet activity of the users such as URL or web page visits, link activity and conversions.
- a subgroup of the features can be selected and associated with a cluster of users.
- the cluster of users can have a more specific interest relative to the interest of the user list in general (e.g., “cars”), such as a determined interest of a cluster of users in “convertible cars.”
- the features of the subgroup of features generally have similarities or common characteristics.
- a particular feature of the subgroup can indicate link activity associated with a particular product, such as users clicking on a link to advertisements in a particular category.
- some users on the user list of users interested in “sports” can have a feature that indicates an interest in identified content, such as a particular sports team.
- This group of users can be identified based on their Internet activity as a cluster of users within the user list that share a subfeature of Internet activity related to a particular sports team, for example.
- the user lists can be expanded to include additional users who are determined to have similar features to at least some of the users on the user list. For example, a data processing system can determine that a supplemental user not on the user list also has an interest on one of the clusters of the user list, e.g. the same particular sports team. If this supplemental user's interest is determined to be sufficiently strong based for example on Internet activity of the supplemental user, the data processing system can add the supplemental user to the user list as well as to any relevant cluster of users. This enhances the user list by adding new users having similar features, such as similar Internet activity, habits or preferences.
- a user list for example received from an advertiser, can be expanded by adding new users having sufficiently similar characteristics or features to the features of those already on the list.
- the users on the user list can also be organized into clusters that include users who share a common subfeature of the user list.
- the expanded list can more effective for online advertising purposes because it includes more users determined to have an interest in identified subject matter that may be exposed to an ad campaign, for example.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 to identify users that may receive content via a computer network 105 .
- the network 105 can include computer networks such as the Internet, local, wide, or metro area networks, intranets, and other computer networks such as mobile phone voice or data communication networks.
- the system 100 can include at least one data processing system 110 .
- the data processing system 110 can include at least one logic device such as a computing device having a processor to communicate via the network 105 with at least one content provider 115 , at least one web page operator 120 , or at least one user device 125 .
- the data processing system 110 can also include at least one feature selection circuit 130 , at least one user list modification circuit 135 , and at least one database 140 .
- the content provider 115 can include a computing device to aggregate information about user activity on the network 105 (e.g., Internet activity) from a plurality of user devices 125 .
- the content provider 115 can include an advertiser or data aggregation service that uses a computing device (e.g., a server) to obtain information about user activity on the network 105 . From this collected information, the content provider 115 can generate a user list.
- the user lists indicates a group of user devices 125 (which may be attributed to their associated users) that share common features related for example to Internet activity.
- a server of the content provider 115 can determine that a group of user devices 125 share a common interest in this year's football championship game based on a determination that the group of user devices 125 have each separately accessed a web page of the web page operator 120 having content about one of the teams playing in the championship.
- the features can be based on short term Internet activity of the user (e.g., within a previous 24 hours) or long term Internet activity of the user, (e.g., within the previous 30 days).
- the data processing system 110 obtains the user list.
- the data processing system can receive a user list from the content provider 115 .
- the content provider 115 can generate the list of users based on user activity and identified generically by a cookie or by an IP address of the user device 125 , for example.
- the data processing system 110 can access the user list from a memory unit associated with the content provider 115 , or the data processing system 110 can receive the user list from the content provider 115 via the network 105 and store the user list, for example in the database 140 .
- the data processing system 110 generates the user list based on information the data processing system 110 receives about network activity of a plurality of user devices 125 , and does not, in this example, receive the user list from the content provider 115 .
- the users identified on the user list generally have some level of activity on the network 105 .
- the user devices 125 access the network 105 to browse or interact with content on the Internet, and the web page operator 120 can operate a web page that is accessed by the user of the user device 125 .
- the user device 125 can access a web server of the web page operator 120 to request a rendering or impression of the web page on a web browser of the user device 125 .
- the content provider 115 or the data processing system 110 can receive indications of user device 125 activity (e.g., cookies) via the network 105 from the web page operator 120 or from the user device 125 .
- Features associated with users on the user list can indicate information derived from this Internet activity, such as a user interest in a product, service, or category of information.
- the content provider 115 and the web page operator 120 can be the same entity, operated by the same entity, or can share the same servers or other computing devices.
- the web page operator 120 can aggregate information about user devices 125 that access a web page server and can use this information to generate user lists that can be provided to and received by the data processing system 110 .
- the user lists received at or generated by the data processing system 110 can include information about activity of a group of user devices 125 on the network 105 .
- This information may be referred to as features corresponding to Internet activity of the users on the user list.
- These features can include, for example, information about the names or content of web pages that were accessed by the user via their corresponding user device 125 .
- the features can also include conversion information (e.g., whether or not the user who accessed an online advertisement converted the advertisement by purchasing a product or taking other action requested by the advertisement).
- the features can also include URL or web page visits, information about access to domain names, the content of accessed web pages, Internet browsing activity, or link activity (e.g., the particular links or type of links a user clicked on) for example.
- the data processing system 110 receives the user list including information about features corresponding to Internet activity of a plurality of users via corresponding user devices 125 . From this information, the data processing system 110 can identify a subset of the group of features included in the user list. For example, the feature selection circuit can select a subgroup of features from the plurality of features associated with the user list.
- the user list obtained by the data processing system 110 can include a large number (e.g., thousands) of users of the network 105 . Due to network 105 activity, individual users can have many features, and some features may be less relevant to a user list.
- the data processing system 110 can organize the features in a hierarchical fashion based on their relevance to the user lists. For example, the content provider 115 may provide user lists directed toward users having an interest in purchasing a late model sedan in the last 30 days. In this example the content provider 115 or the data processing system 110 determine that the users, via their user devices 125 , partook in activity on the network 105 related to cars, or indicated an interest via the network 105 to purchase a sedan.
- the users on this user list may also have features that are less related or unrelated to cars. For example, some users may have expressed an interest in child car safety seats (e.g., determined by the data processing system 110 to be minimally related to purchasing a late model sedan) or content determined by the data processing system 110 unrelated to a car purchase, such as instructions for grilling cheeseburgers, for example.
- child car safety seats e.g., determined by the data processing system 110 to be minimally related to purchasing a late model sedan
- content determined by the data processing system 110 unrelated to a car purchase such as instructions for grilling cheeseburgers, for example.
- the data processing system 110 selects a subgroup of features from the features of the user list.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can select features determined to be most relevant to the user list.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can evaluate the features associated with users on the list to identify a set of relevant features.
- the feature selection circuit 130 or other data processing system 110 component having a logic device such as a processor can identify a predetermined number (e.g., five or another number) of features determined to be most relevant.
- the frequency selection circuit 130 can measure the similarity between features and compare the resulting score (e.g., a similarity metric) to a threshold value to identify the relevancy of features. For example, the feature selection circuit 130 can evaluate features of the user list and determine that the feature of child car safety seats and a feature of car booster seats have a high degree of relevance that is above a threshold value. In this example, the feature selection circuit 130 (or other data processing system 110 component) can identify the car booster seat feature and the child car seat feature as having related content, and can classify these features as a subgroup of the features of a user list that generally indicates users with an interest in car accessories.
- a similarity metric e.g., a similarity metric
- the data processing system 110 can, for example, evaluate the content of a plurality of web pages available via the network 105 to determine that content about child car seats, or the term “child car seat” and content about car booster seats, or the term “car booster seats” appear together on a threshold number of percentage of web pages about car accessories.
- the data processing system 110 disregards features from the user lists that are not sufficiently similar to other features. For example, the data processing system 110 obtains a user list directed toward users having an interest in cars. Some users on this list may be associated with features unrelated to cars (e.g., a feature about do it yourself home roof repair) based on Internet activity of the users that is unrelated to cars.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can identify the unrelated features, for example by determining that web pages having content about cars make little or no mention of how to repair your roof. From the determination, the feature selection circuit 130 can disregard or remove the unrelated feature from the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can also supplement the user list by adding additional features to the user lists that are not part of the user lists obtained by the data processing system 110 .
- the user lists can identify some users having the child car seat feature, but the car booster seat feature may be absent from the user list.
- the data processing system 110 identifies the feature car booster seat as being sufficiently similar to child car seat and adds this feature to the user list.
- the data processing system 110 identifies content of a plurality of web pages available via the network 105 and web page servers of web page operators 120 to identify a correlation between these two features based on a determination that they appear together on the same or similar web pages.
- the data processing system 110 can assign a score to or otherwise rank these additional features based on their similarity to a given feature.
- the score may be used to place the features of the user list, including additional features added by the data processing system 110 , in a hierarchical taxonomy such as a vertical listing or hierarchical tree structure. In one example, a higher score indicates a closer similarity between two or more features than a lower score.
- the score can indicate a semantic closeness of different terms that may be synonyms. For example, given two terms the data processing system 110 can determine a number of documents having both terms, and divide this number by the number of documents containing either of the two terms. The resulting score indicates the level of similarity of different terms or features, for example from zero indicating no similarity to one indicating a high level of similarity. A synonym term sufficiently similar (e.g., above a threshold similarity value) to a term on a user list can be added to that user list. In another example, the data processing system 110 can identify a predetermined score for a term from the database 140 , and can assign this score to other terms that are synonyms of that term.
- the data processing system 110 can adjust this score based on metrics such as a click through rate of web pages that include the synonyms. For example, the score may be adjusted upwards based on a high click through rate of a synonym term, where the click through rate is the number of clicks on an advertisement containing a term divided by the number of impressions of that advertisement, for example. Based on an upward adjustment to the score of the synonym term, the data processing system 110 may add that term to a user list. In another example, the data processing system 110 determines the score based on a frequency of occurrence of a term in a set of web pages or other documents.
- the data processing system 110 identifies a cluster of users from the users of the user list.
- the cluster of users can include a subgroup of users from the user list that share one or more features from the features of the user list.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can select a subgroup of features of the user list, and the data processing system 110 can identify the users from the user list that are associated with one of the subgroup of features due to Internet activity of those users via the user device 125 .
- the data processing system 110 can create multiple clusters of users for a user list, each cluster having a subgroup of features and including the users associated with those subgroups of features.
- a user identified on a user list can belong to more than one cluster of that user list.
- the data processing system 110 scores the features of the users to determine the nearest neighbors to the users of the users list, e.g., to identify subgroups of users of the user list with the closest matching features.
- the data processing system 110 creates one cluster from the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can have a user list for users interested in purchasing a car.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can identify a subgroup of features as being relevant to car purchases.
- the data processing system 110 can identify a cluster corresponding to this subgroup, and one feature of the subgroup can be identified as a centroid of the cluster, e.g., the feature most determined by the data processing system to be most relevant to the cluster.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can assign scores to other features to determine the similarity of the other features to the centroid of the cluster.
- Features that are sufficiently similar e.g., within a tolerance range of the centroid
- These features can include other features of the user list or supplemental features not included on the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can identify centroids of more than one cluster when the use list includes a plurality of clusters.
- the data processing system 110 identifies at least one supplemental user.
- the supplemental user can be a user of at least one user device 125 that accesses web pages from at least one web page operator 120 via the network 105 .
- the data processing system 110 can identify a supplemental user that is browsing the Internet.
- the supplemental user is absent from the user list obtained by the data processing system. From network 105 activity of the supplemental user, the data processing system 110 can obtain or determine at least one supplemental feature of the supplemental user.
- the supplemental feature of the supplemental user can include information about web page or URL visits, Internet browsing activity, link activity (e.g., an identification of the links on a web page that the supplemental user clicked on as well as the content of the web pages associated with those links,) or conversion information of the supplemental user.
- link activity e.g., an identification of the links on a web page that the supplemental user clicked on as well as the content of the web pages associated with those links, or conversion information of the supplemental user.
- the data processing system 110 or its components such as the user list modification circuit 135 can determine a correlation between supplemental features of the supplemental user and at least one of the features of the user list. For example, the data processing system 110 can determine that the supplemental feature is the same as or a synonym of a feature associated with users on the user list. The supplemental feature can also be different than features of the user lists, and the user list modification circuit 135 can identify a correlation between the supplemental feature and one or more of the features that form the subgroup of features based on a similarity between the features.
- a feature of a supplemental user can indicate a user interest in “vehicular child restraints.” This supplemental feature is different than both the “child car seat” and “car booster seats” of the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can determine that the supplemental feature is similar to either or both of the user list features.
- the data processing system 110 assigns a score or weight to the supplemental feature that indicates its level of similarity to one or more features of the user list.
- the data processing system can evaluate or receive an evaluation of content (e.g., web pages) available via the network 105 that indicates how often the feature and the supplemental feature appear together on various web pages, and can determine a score indicative of this correlation.
- the user list modification circuit 135 can expand the user list to generate an expanded user list that includes at least one supplemental user not originally present on the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can identify a supplemental feature associated with a supplemental user and determine that the supplemental feature is related to (e.g., a synonym of) a feature of users on the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can expand the user list to include the supplemental user or to indicate the supplemental feature.
- the data processing system 110 includes the supplemental user in one or more of the clusters of users, when for example the supplemental feature is the same as or similar to one of the features of the subgroup of features of a cluster.
- the user list modification circuit 135 adds a supplemental user to the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can determine a score of supplemental feature of the supplemental user and compare it with the centroid feature of the user list (or cluster thereof). When the score of the supplemental feature is within a tolerance range of the centroid of the user list or cluster, the user list modification circuit 135 can add the supplemental user to the user list as well as one or more clusters of the user list.
- the user list modification circuit 135 adjusts the number of users on the user list. Users can be added to or eliminated from the user list. For example, the data processing system 110 can determine that some features associated with users on the user list are insufficiently relevant to belong in any subgroup of features. The user list modification circuit 135 can identify users associated with less relevant features and remove those uses from the user list. The user list modification circuit 135 can adjust membership of the user list by adding users to or removing users from the user lists before or after the user list has been expanded to include supplemental users.
- the data processing system 110 obtains a user list and manipulates the user list to create clusters of related users based on commonalities between features of those users.
- the clusters can identify users having a more particular interest than the more general interest indicated by the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can obtain a user list identifying users interested in “cars” based on Internet activity (e.g., features) of those users.
- the feature selection circuit 130 can identify and aggregate subgroups of features to create clusters of users. In this example, one cluster might indicate users interested in purchasing a late model sedan. Other clusters might indicate users interested in sports cars, or selling cars, car races, or car shows.
- the data processing system 110 can also expand the obtained user list by adding supplemental users determined by the data processing system 110 to be interested in, for example, cars based on an evaluation of the features of the supplemental users.
- the user list modification circuit 135 can add the supplemental users and their supplemental features to the user list in general, or to one or more clusters of the user list.
- the data processing system 110 can also identify supplemental features similar to the features of the users on the user list, and use the supplemental features to identify a supplemental user, who can then be added to the user list together with the supplemental feature.
- the user list is used by the data processing system 110 to provide content such as advertisements to users who view a web page.
- a user of the user device 125 can communicate via the network 105 with a web page server of the web page operator 120 to request access to a web page.
- the data processing system 100 can receive a request from the web page operator 120 to provide an advertisement for display in an ad slot of the web page.
- the data processing system 110 can determine that the user is on the user list indicating an interest in cars (or one of the more specific interests associated with a cluster of users of the user list) and can provide an advertisement about cars to the web page operator 120 for display with the web page at user device 125 .
- the advertisement can be content originating from the content provider 115 or other content provider, such as an advertiser.
- the user requesting access to the web page is identified as a supplemental user based on Internet activity and added to the user list.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram depicting a method 200 of selecting consumers to receive content on a computer network.
- the method 200 can obtain a user list (BLOCK 205 ).
- a user list can by obtained by a data processing system from a database or from a content provider via a network such as the Internet.
- the method 200 obtains at least one user list (BLOCK 205 ) that indicates a list of users having features corresponding to their Internet activity.
- the features can include information about Internet browsing activity, web page visits, activity taken on web pages, or the content of visited web pages for example.
- the features can indicate a user interest.
- the method 200 can also select a subgroup of features from the features associated with users on the user list (BLOCK 210 ). For example, features having a threshold level of similarity with each other can be identified as part of a subgroup of features.
- the selected subgroup of features (BLOCK 210 ) can be different features related to common subject matter.
- the method 200 can be implemented on a computing device to determine that a feature that expresses a user interest in child safety seats and another feature that expresses a user interest in child booster seats are related to each other. In this example, these different features can be included as part of a selected subgroup of features.
- the method 200 identifies from the user list a cluster of users.
- the identified cluster of users can include the users from the user lists having one of the selected subgroup of features (BLOCK 210 ).
- the cluster of users is the users from the user list having at least one of these two features.
- the method 200 can also identify a supplemental user (BLOCK 220 ).
- the supplemental user can be a user with at least one feature related for example to Internet activity but that is not on the user list.
- the method 200 can determine a correlation between features of the supplemental user and features of the users who are on the user list (BLOCK 225 ). In one implementation, the method 200 determines a correlation (BLOCK 225 ) between a supplemental feature and a feature selected as one of the subgroup of features (BLOCK 210 ).
- the method can be implemented at least in part by a data processing system that evaluates content of web pages to determine that the supplemental feature and at least one feature of the user list relate to the same or similar content.
- the method 200 can also generate an expanded user list (BLOCK 230 ).
- the method 200 can be implemented in part by a user list modification circuit that can expand the user list by adding at least one supplemental user or associated supplemental feature to the user list.
- the method 200 can also adjust the user list (BLOCK 235 ), for example by removing users from the user list before or after any expansions to the user list.
- the method 200 can determine that activity of a user on the user list (e.g., that user's features) is insufficiently relevant to the user list for that user to remain on the list and the method can adjust the user list to remove one or more users from the list.
- FIG. 3 shows the general architecture of an illustrative computer system 300 that may be employed to implement any of the computer systems discussed herein (including the system 100 and its components such as the data processing system 110 , the feature selection circuit 130 , or the user list modification circuit 135 ) in accordance with some embodiments.
