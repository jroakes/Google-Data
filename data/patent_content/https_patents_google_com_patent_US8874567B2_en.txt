Definitions
- This invention relates in general to online search engines, and in particular to personalization of search results.
- the present invention provides allows a user to variably adjust the degree to which his or her personal interests influence the presentation of results of a given search query.
- the present invention has multiple embodiments, including a system for providing a search engine, a methodology for processing a search query, and a user interface for the user to variably adjust the degree of influence.
- the present invention provides a mechanism for personalizing search results.
- the user defines a set of interests, for example as a set of topics or categories of interest to the user, as an interests profile.
- the user submits a search query to a search engine.
- the search engine retrieves documents that are relevant to the query and presents these as search results.
- the search results are ranked without regard to the user's interests. This enables the user to see the relevance of the documents without influence by his personal interests.
- the user can variably control ranking of the documents in the search result set. In a preferred embodiment, this is done by direct manipulation of graphical control element, a personalization control.
- This graphical element can have various graphical representations, and in one embodiment it is represented as a slider.
- Adjusting the control element adjusts the degree to which the results are ranked according to the user's interests, as expressed in his interest profile. In response to changes in the position of the control element, the search results are reranked, thereby allowing the user to see how his interests affect the ordering of the results.
- the ranking of search results operates to increase the relevance score of documents that are associated with the directory of topics.
- Each topic in the directory is associated with a group of documents (e.g., websites) which are deemed relevant to the topic.
- a boost value is provided which indicates the degree of relevance of the site to the topic. All pages within a given site get that site's boost value.
- the boost value may be understood as a scaling factor that represents the relevance of the site to the topic.
- a separate score for each document is determined in which the document's underlying relevance score is adjusted by its associated boost value if any, for example by multiplying the relevance score by the boost value, thereby scaling the relevance of the document to the query.
- boost value for example by multiplying the relevance score by the boost value, thereby scaling the relevance of the document to the query.
- boost value for each document is applied 100% to the relevance score, and any number of intermediate levels of application. The user can thus immediately rerank the documents in the search results by adjusting the position of the control.
- a system embodiment includes a topic directory for providing topics (categories) to a user, a search engine and index for searching indexed websites in response to a user's query, and a personalization component for determining for the search results at least one (and preferably a set) of rankings of the search results in accordance with the user's interests.
- a user interface embodiment includes a topical directory, with various topics, and graphical controls (e.g., checkboxes) in which the user can select topics of interests, and a graphical control that allows the user to adjust the search result ranking in accordance with his interest profile.
- FIG. 1 is an entry web page for a search engine.
- FIG. 2 is web page for editing a user's personal profile of topics.
- FIG. 3 is another web page of topics, and subtopics.
- FIG. 4 is another web page of subtopics.
- FIG. 5 shows the entry web page for the search engine with the query “stanford”.
- FIG. 6 shows the initial results of the search on query “stanford”, along with a control 608 for controlling a degree of influence of the user's interest profile in ranking the search results.
- FIG. 7 shows the ranking of the search results of FIG. 6 after the user has adjusted the control 608 to an intermediate position.
- FIG. 8 shows the ranking of the search results of FIG. 6 after the user has adjusted the control 608 to a maximum position.
- FIG. 9 shows a web page of topics after deletion of a “Computer” topic and selection of a “Music” topic by the user.
- FIG. 10 shows the ranking of the search results of FIG. 6 following the change in topic interests in FIG. 9 .
- the search engine includes a query entry field 102 in which a user enters the terms of a search query.
- a search button 106 submits the query to the search engine for processing. The first time the user accesses the search engine, he will not have defined a user profile for personalizing the search results, and a message is displayed to that effect. The user can access the Edit Profile link 104 in order to establish their personal interests.
- This page shows the top level topics 204 of a topical directory 202 .
- the topics in the directory can be, for example, the topics defined in the Open Directory Project, found at http://dmoz.org/ or can be some other topical directory. (In this disclosure the term “topic” and “category” are interchangeable, as are “subtopic” and “subcategory”.)
- the top level topic links may have a set of subtopics, as indicated by the arrows 206 .
- the user can begin a search by clicking on the Start Searching button 208 . Clicking on a particular top level topic takes the user to a page associated with that topic's subtopics.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the result of this step, where the user has clicked on the topic “Computers” on page 200 .
- the subtopics 302 of the topic “Computers” have been displayed in the right hand column.
- a checkbox 314 Next to each subtopic 302 is a checkbox 314 .
- the user can select the checkbox 314 to indicate his interest in a specific subtopic.
- the user can select the checkbox 316 for the entire subtopic itself, “Computers (General)”. This indicates that the user is interested in all of the subtopics of the topic “Computers”.
- the set of topics selected by the user may be called a user profile, a personalization profile, or an interest profile.
- each topic name is a delete link 308 that allows the user to delete individual topics.
- the user can also delete all topics by selecting the “Delete all preferences” link 310 .
- the subtopics themselves can have any number of additional levels of subtopics.
- FIG. 4 illustrates that the subtopic “Games” has further subtopics 402 , “Board Games,” “Card Games,” etc. These were presented to the user in response to the user clicking on the subtopic arrow 206 next to the “Games” topic label. Again, the user can select either the entire subcategory by selecting checkbox 404 , or any of the individual subtopic checkboxes 406 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates the initial search results page 600 .
- the search results 602 comprise a set of documents 604 , each document indicated by a URL 617 , along with a link 615 to the page, and a snippet 619 of the page text to show a portion of the context to the document to the user.
- the personalization control 608 Near the top of the page is the personalization control 608 .
- “documents” are understood to be any type of media that can be indexed and retrieved by a search engine, including web pages, images, multimedia files, text documents, PDFs, and so forth. No limitation as to the scope of the invention is implied by the use of the generic term “documents.”
- the personalization control 608 allows the user to adjust the ranking of the individual documents/pages of the search results with respect to his interests, preferably as expressed in the personalization profile.
- the personalization control may be explained as controlling a degree of influence or contribution of the user's interest profile to the ranking of the search results.
- FIG. 6 illustrates the control 608 in an embodiment where it is a slider type control that includes a control handle 610 that is moved along a linear dimension between a minimum value 612 to a maximum value 614 . This type of control 608 is generally very intuitive and easy for users to understand how it operates.
- dial type controls similarly providing a variable adjustment between a minimum and maximum value
- radio buttons each with an associated predetermined adjustment amount (e.g., five radio buttons, associated respectively with 0%, 20%, 40%, 80%, and 100%).
- predetermined adjustment amount e.g., five radio buttons, associated respectively with 0%, 20%, 40%, 80%, and 100%.
- the personalization control 608 is set all the way to its minimum value 612 .
- the search results accordingly are ranked on their relevance to the query and query independent information such as PageRank, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, “Method for node ranking in a linked database”, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all of its teachings. Notice that the search results are generally related to Stanford University.
- FIG. 7 there is shown the ranking of the search results 602 after the user has adjusted the slider 610 to an intermediate position about halfway between the minimum and maximum values.
- the individual documents 604 are reranked, and those that are more related to the user's interest (previously identified as “Computers (General)” are more highly ranked.
- those documents are indicated by a personalization icon 618 next to the link text 615 .
- the snippet 619 text has text that relates to computers (e.g., “hacking”) even though that term was not included in the original search query.
- all of the documents 604 in the search results 602 reflect the user's personalization profile, and are annotated with the personalization icon 618 .
- the documents in the search results relate to computers and Stanford University, thereby reflecting the user's interests in computers, as it relates to the query “stanford”.
- the first two results are related to “hacking” at Stanford; the next three documents relate specifically to various computer science projects at Stanford.
- the third document is for Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
- the fourth document is for Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information
- the fifth document is for Stanford's Database Group.
- the user can dynamically adjust the ranking of the documents in real time, without the search engine having to recompute the search results. This further aids the user's ability to explore the search results.
- an Edit Profile link 616 allows the user to edit the interests in his user profile at any time.
- FIG. 9 illustrates where the user has returned to the topic directory page 200 as illustrated in FIG. 2 , and deleted his existing topic interest in Computers, and created a different interest in “Music”. The user then again selects the Start Searching button 208 .
- the search engine provides an updated set of search results, which documents will be the same as before, since the query term has not changed. However, as of the last search, the user has positioned the control 610 for full personalization, and hence the search engine applies this setting and ranks the documents according the existing (and new) personalization profile, this time for “Music.”
- FIG. 10 illustrates the dramatic difference this makes in the search results.
- the top six results are all related to music and arts, and none of the previous results relating to computers make the top of the search result list. This shows how the user's personalization profile can significantly alter the ranking of a given set of documents.
- the personalization of search results is provided by the following methodology.
- Those of skill in the art of search engine design can readily understanding the basic structure of a search engine and its operation in which this methodology can be implemented.
- Topics categories
- interests can be expressed as either text tokens (e.g. “computers”), or as indices into a directory, where each topic/subtopic has an index number.
- the site can provide a user registration page, in which the user registers with a user name and password, and the user's interests are stored at the search engine site in a database, and retrieved in response to the user login.
- the frontend web server issues two requests to a backend search engine (Q, null) and (Q, IN), which returns to the frontend web server two results sets, R_base (normal) and R_in (personalized), respectively.
- the base query (Q null) is the same as searching for Q on the search engine without any personalization, so R_base is the result set that the search engine would normally return in response to the query.
- the search results accordingly are ranked on their relevance to the query and any other factors, such as PageRank, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, “Method for node ranking in a linked database”, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all of its teachings.
- the personalized query contains the user's interest list.
- the search engine follows a similar processing control flow as a normal query, but it activates a personalization component during the scoring function, which “boosts” documents that are relevant to the set of interests IN.
- these boosts are implemented using a set of maps (one map for each topic/subtopic in the directory), of the form:
- the category “Health” has a map of the form
- nih.gov, cdc.gov, and med.Stanford.edu are various sites that have been determined (either manually or automatically) to be related to the topic “Health”.
- nih.gov, cdc.gov, and med.Stanford.edu are various sites that have been determined (either manually or automatically) to be related to the topic “Health”.
- a boost value is defined for each topic in the directory.
- the boost for the sites listed in the topical directory is generally determined as follows:
- a “site graph” is generated where nodes of the graph are sites (basically, pages on the same host) and edges between nodes are weighted based on the number of pages from one site that link to pages on another. This same type of graph can be used to compute all topic boost maps.
- start sites For each topic in the directory, say “Health”, a number of sites are selected as “start sites” S 0 whose home page is listed in the Open Directory. For example, for a university like Stanford, start sites may be selected as any site ending in .stanford.edu.
- a personalized query comes in with an interest set (e.g., ⁇ Health, Music ⁇ )
- the personalization component consults the respective maps, and then for query results (i.e. documents) that are in these maps, the personalization components boosts the IR score for them, so that they would get ranked higher.
- the IR score is the information retrieval score that the search engine provides for each document, and can be a function of document relevance and other factors, such as PageRank.
- the frontend web server receives R_base and R_in.
- R_base represents the results 602 the user sees when the personalization control 608 is set at 0 (or its minimum position 612 ).
- R_in represents the results 602 the user sees when the slider is at its maximum position 614 , e.g. 10. In one embodiment, the control has 11 positions, but any number of positions may be used.
- the rankings that are shown to the user between 0 and 10 are interpolated; this means using R_base and R_in, the personalization component constructs intermediate rankings (R 1 . . . R — 9) by moving each individual result along a virtual path from its position when the control 608 is at its minimum position to when the control 608 is at its maximum position.
- the frontend web server appends the results in R_in that are not in R_base to R_base to get a list of all unique results (either in R_base or R_in) called R_all.
- the frontend web server then assigns consecutive identification numbers to the results in R_all that serve as identifiers.
- the frontend then sends to the user's browser two items:
- N the number of positions of the slider, and each vector represents the ordering of the results based on the degree of personalization.
- Vector 0 is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], reflecting the un-personalized ranking of the results, assigned with the local IDs starting with R 0 .
- Vector 10 is the ordering in the fully personalized results R_in; for instance, it might be [15, 17, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10], where documents 15 and 17 , for example, are documents in the relevant map of the topic directory whose IR score was boosted according to the boost values in the map, and the value associated with the control 608 's position. Transmitting the N ranking vectors to the client allows the client browser to quickly recompute the rankings, rather than imposing that calculation on the server.
- Javascript code in the result page causes the user's browser to reorder the search results using the appropriate one of the 11 positional ranking vectors in response to the user changing the position of the control 608 . Further details of one embodiment of steps 6-8, above, are described in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/641,489, incorporated by reference herein.
- Certain aspects of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of an algorithm. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention could be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, could be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by real time network operating systems.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored on a computer readable medium that can be accessed by the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
