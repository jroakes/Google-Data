- This disclosure generally relates to unified automated billing for offline advertising (e.g., television, radio, newspaper advertising, and the like) spots that spans across different time zones.
- offline advertising e.g., television, radio, newspaper advertising, and the like
- Advertisements can be included in various forms of broadcast media. For example, offline advertisements such as radio can be a powerful broadcast medium for advertisers to achieve their goals for a given advertising campaign. Additionally, radio advertising can increase online brand awareness, and be a cost effective way to reach a targeted audience. For example, an advertiser can target consumers with a specific lifestyle and demographics by selecting the station types, locations, and dayparts. Advertisers can book advertising campaigns with multiple broadcasters through an ad intermediary. Advertisers can specify criteria that the intermediary can use to book advertising spots for the advertising campaigns.
- This specification describes various aspects relating to providing a unified automated billing system for offline media (e.g., radio, television, newspaper, and the like) advertising that spans across different time zones based on the concept of a station local time (e.g., the local time where the broadcast station is located) for the broadcast advertising spots.
- a radio advertising campaign can have advertising spots scheduled to be played in different markets that span many different time zones, which can create challenges when billing for the advertising spots.
- the automated billing system disclosed herein can account for the time zones where the advertising spots are broadcast or played.
- one aspect can be a method that includes recording a local time for an allocated advertising spot when the ad played during the allocated advertising spot, such that the allocated advertising spot is in a broadcast time zone different from a billing time zone of the advertiser.
- the method also includes generating a station local time for the allocated advertising spot.
- the method further includes generating a billing event based on the station local time.
- Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another general aspect can be a system that includes a billing module configured to generating billing information for an advertising campaign.
- the system also includes means for generating a station local time for an allocated advertising spot, such that the allocated advertising spot is in a broadcast time zone different from a billing time zone of the advertiser.
- the system further includes means for generating a billing event, based in part, on the station local time.
- the system can include an advertiser-facing module configured to interface with an advertiser and to obtain campaign criteria for the advertising campaign.
- the system can also include an ad booking module configured to allocate the advertising spot based on the campaign criteria.
- the system can further include a broadcaster-facing module configured to interface with a broadcaster that broadcasts an ad.
- the method can include obtaining an ad for an advertising campaign, and receiving campaign criteria for the advertising campaign.
- the method can also include allocating an advertising spot based on the campaign criteria, and monitoring the allocated advertising spot.
- the method can further include obtaining available advertising spots from broadcasters that meet the campaign criteria.
- the local time for the allocated advertising spot can in the broadcast time zone.
- the step of generating the station local time can include removing the time zone information from the recorded local time.
- the step of generating the billing event can include generating billing information and payment or credit terms.
- the advertising campaign can be based on offline media that includes radio advertising, television advertising, or newspaper advertising.
- the automated billing system disclosed herein can better align charges for the advertising spots with an advertiser's campaign. For example, when an advertiser budgets an advertising campaign for a given month, the advertiser can be billed based on the advertising spots played during the projected campaign month. Additionally, a nationwide campaign that spans across different time zones can easily be accommodated and the advertiser's objectives can be better fulfilled.
- FIG. 1 shows relationships between various advertising components.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a system for booking and billing an advertising campaign.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an automated unified billing process for an advertising campaign based on the station local time concept.

- FIG. 1 shows relationships between various ad components.
- the diagram shows a broadcaster 110 , which can include, e.g., a terrestrial radio station, a satellite radio station, a television station, a podcaster, a cellular broadcaster, or an Internet broadcaster.
- the broadcaster 110 can deliver broadcast content to the audience via broadcast medium 112 , which can include, e.g., radio, television, or the Internet, or any digital broadcast medium.
- various advertising spots such as advertising spot 114 , can be included as part of the broadcast content.
- the advertising spots are time slots when ads can play during a broadcast.
- advertising spot 114 can be a 30-second time slot of the broadcast content.
- the conceptual diagram of FIG. 1 also shows an advertising intermediary 120 , which can include, e.g., Google Adwords for Audio.
- the advertising intermediary 120 can interface with and communicatively couple to the broadcaster 110 to manage available advertising spots for advertising campaigns.
- the advertising intermediary 120 can provide a price rate (i.e., spot price or rate card price) associated with advertising spot 114 .
- the rate card price can be a function of the number of estimated audience, which can vary based on the type of broadcaster, broadcasting market (e.g., Los Angeles vs. San Diego), and broadcasting daypart (e.g., morning commute vs. evening commute).
- the advertising intermediary 120 can provide payment to the broadcaster 110 for playing the advertising spot 114 .
- AQH average quarter hour
- the gross AQH can be defined as the average number of persons (ages 12 and above) listening to a broadcast for at least five minutes of a given 15-minute period. This information on gross AQH can be provided by third-party ratings companies, such as Arbitron.
- Campaign metrics 122 can be calculated by the advertising intermediary 120 .
- Campaign metrics 122 can include, for example, a campaign reach and frequency, a spot efficiency, and a cost per mille (CPM) metric, or cost per thousand impressions.
- An impression can be defined as when an ad is played (e.g., audibly or visually) so that an audience can experience or perceive (e.g., hear or see) the ad.
- Reach and frequency are campaign metrics that can be used to measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
- “reach” estimates the number of unique listeners who hear the ad at least once during a given schedule; and “frequency” can estimate the average number of times each listener hears the ad during a given time period.
- the product of reach and frequency is approximately equal to the number of impressions; i.e., impressions ⁇ reach*frequency.
- a gross reach per advertising spot can be associated with the gross AQH, which is described above. Since an advertising spot has a frequency of 1 (because it is presumed that the ad can be played once per advertising spot), for an advertising spot, gross reach can approximately equal gross AQH or impressions.
- reach and frequency information can be important for an effective advertising campaign because it answers the questions of “How many potential customers are you talking to?” and “How often do you ask them for their business?”
- reach and frequency information can be important for an effective advertising campaign because it answers the questions of “How many potential customers are you talking to?” and “How often do you ask them for their business?”

- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an automated unified billing process 300 for an advertising campaign based on the station local time concept.
- the illustrated process provides unified automated billing for offline media advertising (e.g., radio, television, newspaper advertising, and the like) that spans across different time zones based on the concept of a station local time (e.g., the local time where the broadcast station is located) for the broadcast advertising spots.
- a station local time e.g., the local time where the broadcast station is located
- the illustrated process involves recording the local time of played advertising spots and removing time zone information of the recorded local time to generate a station local time.
- the illustrated process automatically generates a billing event based on the station local time of the played advertising spots.
- process 300 obtains one or more ads for an advertising campaign.
- the advertiser may want to broadcast more than one ad during the campaign.
- the ads can be produced by the advertiser directly or can be produced by a radio production professional.
- process 300 receives advertising campaign information/criteria from, e.g., the advertiser or a customer service representative of the advertising intermediary.
- the advertiser can specify a target audience, a target daypart, target reach and frequency, a cap for number of impressions, daily budget, weekly budget, or total budget for the advertising campaign.
- the morning drive daypart which is between 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., as the target daypart for its advertising campaign.
- the advertising campaign criteria can include target broadcast markets to play the advertising spots. For example, for a nationwide campaign the advertiser can specify that the advertising spots be played in all major markets, including, e.g., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. As noted above, having advertising spots scheduled to be played in different markets that span many different time zones can create challenges when billing for the advertising spots. However, as will be discussed in further detail below, the unified automated billing process 300 can account for different time zones based on a station local time concept.
- Process 300 allocates advertising spots to be played by broadcasters based on the specified campaign criteria.
- process 300 can select available broadcasters based on campaign criteria, e.g., target broadcast markets, target demographics or target dayparts. For example, suppose that the advertiser specified a target demographics of male between 25 to 55 years old for the advertising spots, the selected broadcasters can be those broadcasters that have available advertising spots with gross AQH satisfying the target demographics. Once the broadcasters with available advertising spots have been selected, process 300 can schedule the advertising spots to be played by the selected broadcasters based on, e.g., target dayparts.
- process 300 monitors ads that have been played by the broadcasters.
- an off air recorder can be used to monitor and record audio streams from the broadcasters.
- a verifier can be used to determine whether the ad was played by the selected broadcaster in a specified market. Furthermore, the verifier can search through the recorded audio stream to determine whether a scheduled ad has been played in the correct daypart.
- process 300 When the ad is successfully played, at 350 , process 300 records the local time of the played advertising spots. For example, suppose that an ad is scheduled to be played in an advertising spot at 6 p.m. Pacific Time. When the ad is played at 6 p.m. Pacific Time, process 300 can record the local time, which is 6 p.m. Pacific Time, of the played advertising spot. In this manner, the local time where the ad is played can be recorded, even though the advertiser or the advertising intermediary is located in a different time zone.
- process 300 generates a station local time by removing the time zone information of the recorded local time associated with the played advertising spots. For example, suppose that process 300 records the local time of a played advertising spot as 6 p.m. Pacific Time. Process 300 can then remove the time zone information, i.e., “Pacific Time,” from the recorded local time to generate a station local time, which is just 6 p.m. In this manner, the station local time is not associated with a particular time zone, and the station local time can be used for billing advertising spots across different time zones.
- time zone information i.e., “Pacific Time”
- process 300 generates a billing event for the successfully played ad based on the station local time.
- the billing event can include billing information (e.g., the station local time that the advertising spot played and the cost for the advertising spot) and billing rules (e.g., credit or payment terms) for the advertiser and the broadcaster.
- billing information e.g., the station local time that the advertising spot played and the cost for the advertising spot
- billing rules e.g., credit or payment terms
- process 300 can provide a flexible, end-to-end billing solution for offline media, such as radio, video, television, print, and the like.
- process 300 can automatically generate a billing event that is put on the queue of the billing module (e.g., billing module 215 of FIG. 2 ).
- billing information to the advertiser can be generated, and based on the cost to the advertiser, as well as the billing rules, payment information to the radio station can also be generated.
- process 300 can accommodate flexible billing rules that can be changed easily to accommodate the individual contractual agreement with each station.
- the process of unified billing based on the station local time can further be described using a couple of illustrative examples.
- an advertiser has chosen to run its advertising campaign during the month of January from January 1 to January 31 and has selected the night time daypart (7 p.m. to midnight) to play its advertising spots.
- the advertiser's local time zone is Eastern time zone, and the advertiser has selected a national campaign that covers different markets across the nation with different time zones.
- an advertising spot is played on January 31 at 11 p.m. in the Pacific time zone, which is 2 a.m. on February 1 in the Eastern time zone, it can be difficult to determine whether to bill the advertiser for the played ad spot for the month of January or February.
- an advertiser has chosen to run its national advertising campaign during the month of May from May 1 to May 31 and has selected the overnight daypart (midnight to 6 a.m.) to play its advertising spots.
- the advertiser's local time zone is Pacific time zone and the first advertising spot is scheduled to be played at midnight on May 1.
- an advertising spot is played on May 1 at 12 a.m. in the Central time zone, which is 10 p.m. on April 30 in the Pacific time zone, it can be difficult to determine whether to bill the advertiser for the played ad spot for the month of April or May.
- the unified billing process (e.g., process 300 ) can record the station local time as 11 p.m. on January 31, which is the local time where the broadcast station is located. In addition, because the station local time is 11 p.m. on January 31, the unified billing process can bill the advertiser for the month of January and pay the broadcast station for the month of January.
- the unified billing process can record the station local time as 12 a.m. on May 1, which is the local time where the broadcast station is located. In addition, because the station local time is 12 a.m. on May 1, the unified billing process can bill the advertiser for the month of May and pay the broadcast station for the month of May.
- a station local time concept can be used to represent a sliding window time zone, where the decision on what time an advertising spot plays on can be based on the local time where the broadcast station is located. Additionally, the advertiser can be billed based on the station local time, regardless of the difference in time zone between the advertiser and the target broadcast markets.
- the system and techniques relate to providing unified automated billing for radio advertising campaigns. As noted above, however, the unified automated billing system and techniques described herein can also be applicable to other offline media advertising, such as newspaper advertising, television advertising, and the like.
