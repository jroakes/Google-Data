Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to search engines and, more particularly, to systems and methods that use text surrounding hypertext links to improve search results.
- the World Wide Web (“Web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return links to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to identify links to high quality relevant results for the user based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are considered “hits” and are returned to the user.
- Search engines generally organize their corpus of pre-stored web page documents as an inverted index of terms found in the web pages. Terms in a search query can be quickly referenced against the index to determine the set of documents that contain some or all of the terms.
- additional terms found near hyperlinks in documents are used to enhance the description of the linked document.
- the premise of this technique is that web authors tend to describe or comment about the content of other web pages in descriptive text located near the link to the other web page. This descriptive text may be used when indexing the linked document to enhance the quality of the index.
- this technique consider a first web page that includes a hyperlink to a target web page dealing with data compression techniques.
- the first web page may describe the target web page with the descriptive text “basic facts, algorithms, hardware links, and a glossary.”
- the search engine can generate a more comprehensive document index.
- the descriptive text may be used when returning search results to a user.
- the idea here is that the descriptive text, in many situations, accurately summarizes the linked web page. Accordingly, in response to a search query, the search engine may return the list of relevant web pages along with corresponding descriptive text that was gathered from pages that link to the web page.
- the overriding goal of a search engine is to return the most desirable set of links, with a succinct and accurate description of each link, for any particular search query. To this end, it is desirable to improve the quality of any external descriptive text associated with a particular web page.
- One aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for generating descriptive text for a target document.
- the method comprises a number of acts, including identifying documents that contain hyperlinks to the target document and selecting text from the documents in the set at locations determined by blocks that contain the hyperlinks. Additionally, the method adds text to the selected text for the identified documents based on information external to the blocks that contain the hyperlinks, and stores, for each of the identified documents, the selected text and the added text as descriptive text associated with the target document.
- a second method consistent with the present invention is a method for searching an index.
- the method comprises matching terms in a search query to the index and generating a list of documents relevant to the search query based on the matching of the terms of the index. Further, the method includes retrieving descriptive text for the documents in the generated list, the descriptive text for a particular one of the documents in the generated list being based on a ranking of text derived from portions of documents that contain hyperlinks to the particular one of the documents. Still further, the method outputs the documents in the list and the descriptive text associated with the documents in the list.
- Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of adding a document to an index.
- the method includes examining documents that contain at least one hyperlink to the document, generating web quotes for the document from the examined documents, each of the web quotes corresponding to one of the examined documents, and ranking the web quotes based on a quality metric associated with the web quotes of the examined documents. Further, the document is included in the index along with at least one of the web quotes based on the ranking of the web quotes.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which concepts consistent with the present invention may be implemented
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating relations between an exemplary set of web pages
- FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary document rendered from an HTML page
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for gathering web pages and web quotes relating to the gathered web pages
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for performing a search based on the gathered web quotes.
- descriptive text is gathered from web pages that link to a web page of interest.
- the web quote may include text from the paragraphs that contain the hypertext links to the page of interest as well as text from other portions of the linking web page, such as text from a nearby header.
- the obtained web quotes may be ranked based on quality or relevance and may then be incorporated into the search engines'document index or into summary information returned to users in response to a search query.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which concepts consistent with the present invention may be implemented.
- the system includes multiple client devices 102 , a server device 110 , and a network 101 , which may be, for example, the Internet.
- Each of the client devices 102 may include a computer-readable medium 109 , such as random access memory, coupled to a processor 108 .
- Processor 108 executes program instructions stored in memory 109 .
- Client devices 102 may also include a number of additional external or internal devices, such as, without limitation, a mouse, a CD-ROM, a keyboard, and a display.
- users 105 can communicate over network 101 with each other and with other systems and devices coupled to network 101 , such as server device 110 .
- server device 110 may include a processor 111 coupled to a computer-readable medium 112 .
- Server device 110 may additionally include a secondary storage element, such as database 130 .
- Client processors 108 and server processor 111 can be any conventional computer processor, such as processors from Intel Corporation, of Santa Clara, Calif.
- client device 102 may be any type of computing platform connected to a network that interacts with application programs, such as a personal computer, a digital assistant, or a “smart” Cellular telephone or pager.
- Server 110 although depicted as a single computer system, may be implemented as a network of computer processors.
- Memory 112 may contain a number of programs, such as search engine program 120 , spider program 122 , and web quote generator program 124 .
- Search engine program 120 locates relevant information in response to search queries from users 105 .
- users 105 send search queries to server device 110 , which responds by returning a list of relevant information to the user 105 .
- server device 110 typically, users 105 ask server device 110 to locate web pages relating to a particular topic and stored at other devices or systems connected to network 101 or another network.
- Search engine program 120 may access database 130 to obtain results from a document corpus 135 , stored in database 130 , by comparing the terms in the user's search query to the documents in the corpus.
- the information in document corpus 135 may be gathered by spider program 122 , which “crawls” web documents on network 101 based on their hyperlinks. As a result, spider program 122 generates a tree of linked web documents.
- the crawled documents may be stored in database 130 as an inverted index in which each term in the corpus is associated with all the crawled documents that contain that term.
- the inverted index associates, for any particular document, the explicit words of that document as well as terms from other documents that link to the particular document.
- the terms from the other documents are referred to as web quotes, which may be generated by web quote generator 124 .
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating relations between an exemplary set of web pages gathered by spider program 122 .
- Document 201 is the active web document under consideration for indexing. This document may be accessed by web quote generator 124 .
- Documents 205 - 207 contain links to document 201 .
- HTML hyper-text markup language
- An anchor specifies the URL (uniform resource locator) of the site being linked.
- browsers display anchors as text distinct from the main text (such as via underlying or displaying in a different color).
- a user by selecting the anchor, causes the browser to retrieve the web page specified by the URL.
- documents 205 - 207 each contain an anchor that links to document 201 .
- FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary rendered HTML page 300 .
- the page may, for example, be from one of linking documents 205 - 207 , such as linking document 205 .
- the illustrated page is a directory that includes header information 301 and anchors 302 - 305 (shown as underlined text). Following anchors 302 - 305 is descriptive text 310 - 313 that describes the linked page. If, for example, anchor 302 is a link from document 205 to document 201 , text 310 describes document 201 . Header 301 also describes document 201 .
- the aggregate of the terms in the HTML code of HTML page 300 that relates to document 201 is referred to as a web quote for document 201 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for the operation of web quote generator 124 in gathering web quotes relating to the gathered web pages.
- Web quote generator 124 begins by retrieving a web page from database 130 or from network 101 . (Act 401 ). The web quote generator 124 then queries database 130 for a list of web pages that contain a link to the retrieved web page. (Act 402 ).
- web quote generator 124 For the web page in the list, web quote generator 124 generates a web quote based on text surrounding the anchors that link to the retrieved page. (Act 403 ). In one implementation, web quote generator 124 generates the web quote by examining a block of text, such as a paragraph, containing each anchor (paragraphs are generally delineated in HTML by the pair of control characters “ ⁇ p>” and “ ⁇ /p>”). In one embodiment, paragraphs that begin with an anchor followed by text, and that have no other anchor until the end of the paragraph, are considered to be likely candidates to contain useful descriptive text. Other HTML separators, such as line separators, may alternatively be used instead of paragraphs.
- web quote generator 124 may augment the web quotes obtained in Act 403 based on text in the web page located outside of the paragraph that contains the anchor. (Act 404 ).
- One example of this type of information is web page header information.
- the text “Computers>Algorithms>Compression” is denoted by HTML control characters as being a header in the HTML document.
- Web quote generator 124 may incorporate header text in its generated web quotes.
- Gathered web quotes may be additionally filtered by web quote generator 124 to remove web quotes that do not adequately describe a given web page.
- a filter may be constructed based on an empirical observation of features present in good web quotes.
- the features used may include, for example, the web quote's length, punctuation, use of verbs, positions of verbs, use of adjectives, etc.
- Other filtering techniques are possible. For example, a number of similar or identical web quotes may point to a single web page.
- the set of similar or identical web quotes may be pruned to just one web quote. Alternately, a set of similar or identical web quotes may point to different web pages. This set of web quotes may be filtered based on a quality metric applied to the pointed-to web pages.
- Page Rank One useable quality metric is Page Rank.
- the Page Rank technique is described in the article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page.
- web quote generator 124 can generate useful web quotes for a web page. Although described in the context of downloading web pages from network 101 , web quotes could alternately be generated for web pages that are pre-stored in database 130 .
- Web quotes generated by web quote generator 124 for a particular document may be initially assigned a value based on their quality.
- the value can be assigned based on a quality metric applied to the source page of the web quote.
- the quality metric can be, for example, the Page Rank technique.
- Page Rank assigns an importance value to a web page based on its content and also based on the link structure of the web page. In contrast to prior techniques for quantifying the importance of a web page based solely on the contents of the web page, the Page Rank technique attempts to quantify the importance of a web page based on more than just the content of the web page.
- the web quotes may be sorted, (Act 502 ), and one or more of the web quotes, for example, the highest ranking web quote, may be used by search engine 120 . (Act 503 ).
- the search engine 120 may use the web quotes by returning the web quotes to the user in response to a search query as a “snippet” of text summarizing the web page. Alternately, search engine 120 may integrate the highest ranking web quote, or a predetermined number of the highest ranking web quotes, into the index of the document corpus 135 , such that the web quotes are associated in the index with the document to which they link, in addition to or in place of a text snippet otherwise returned.
- Web quotes gathered by web quote generator 124 may later be used by search program 120 in identifying relevant documents in response to search queries from users 105 .
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating methods consistent with the present invention for responding to a search query.
- search engine 120 may integrate the highest ranking web quote, or a predetermined number of the highest ranking web quotes, into the index of the document corpus 135 , such that the web quotes are associated in the index with the document to which they link.
- an alternate method consistent with the present invention for assigning values to web quotes may be based on a match of the user's search terms to the web quotes. Web quotes more closely related to the user's search terms may be given higher values.
- web quotes based on documents that link to documents of interest are used to enhance a search engine.
- the web quotes may be generated based on text in the same paragraph as an anchor, as well as on additional text, such as header information.
- the particular web quotes to use may be determined based on, for example, a ranking of the web quotes.
- the web quotes may be ranked based on the quality of the underlying linking page or the quality of the web quote relative to a user's search query.
