In Fig. 2, shown in the association that comprised between the archives of limit 218,220,222,224,226,228,230,232 and 234.According to embodiment shown in Fig. 2, member network 200 comprises a plurality of dissimilar related by limit 218,220,222,224,226,228,230,232 and 234 expressions.The type that is used for the association of illustration purpose shown in Fig. 2 is business association, friendship association, corporations' association and common characteristic association.Common characteristic association can comprise the association based on some features, for example adds identical senior middle school or from identical local, and represented importance can be lower than the association (as friendship association) of other type.
With reference to figure 2, the association between the archives A on limit 220 and 222 each self-contained summit 202, limit and the archives D on summit 208.Limit 220 expression business association, limit 222 expression friendship association.Archives A is also related with archives E by the common characteristic association that comprises limit 218.Association between archives A and the archives E can be weaker than the association between archives A and the D, but should association still can be represented by member network shown in Fig. 2.
For purposes of illustration, each member who is represented by archives A, the B, C, D, E, F and the G that comprise summit 202,204,206,208,210,212 and 214 respectively comprises a people respectively.The member that other type also can be arranged in the member network 200.For example, corporations, particular interest group, tissue, political party, university, legal person (for example company) and business partner relation also can be the members of member network 200.Related 218,220,222,224,226,228,230,232 and 234 comprise bi-directional association shown in Fig. 2.When two sides of association were interrelated, the association between these two archives can comprise a bi-directional association.For example, in Fig. 2, archives A is associated with archives D, and archives D also is associated with archives A.In one embodiment, archives A and D will be when they agree bi-directional association bi-directional association each other.For example, archives A is can invite profile D associated, and bi-directional association has just taken place when archives D accepts this invitation.Invitation can comprise that sending expression archives A has asked the Email that is associated with archives D or other message to archives D.
Other embodiments of the invention can include the association to related or other type.Oriented association can not require first profile associated to the second archives that second profile associated is to first archives.For example, archives A can be associated with archives B by friendship association, and archives B can not be associated with archives A, and perhaps archives B can be associated with archives A by dissimilar associations, for example business association.Thereby the friend of archives A comprises archives B, and the friend of archives B does not comprise archives A.
In member network, can determine degree of separation for the archives that are associated.In one embodiment, the minimum number on the limit of the archives that can be confirmed as to be associated of the degree of separation between two archives particular type of separating.In another embodiment, can determine the degree of separation that type is relevant.The degree of separation that type is relevant comprises the degree of separation of determining according to a kind of association of particular type.For example, the friendship association degree of separation from archives E to archives A is 2.The minimum number of the friendship association between archives A and the archives E is to comprise the friendship association that comprises limit 234 between the friendship association on limit 222 and archives D and the E between 2 one archives A and the D.Thereby for the archives A and the E that are associated, the friendship degree of separation that an aspect according to an embodiment of the invention is determined is 2.
Can also determine the degree of separation that another type is relevant for archives A and E.For example, can determine the public characteristic degree of separation by definite minimum number that separates the common characteristic association of archives A and E.According to embodiment shown in Fig. 2, separate the common characteristic association that comprises limit 218 that has of archives A and E.Thereby according to embodiment shown in Fig. 2, its common characteristic association degree of separation is 1.Public characteristic in this example can be that archives A has added the senior middle school identical with archives E.Common characteristic association can be selected to represent that they are associated in the same manner together but can produce tight association as friendship association by archives A and E.
Others according to a particular embodiment of the invention can be by determining degree of separation to being assigned to each related factor weighting.For example, can give the weight higher for intimate friendship than the friendship of more becoming estranged.According to the particular aspects of the embodiment that uses weighting factor, related higher weighting factor can reduce degree of separation between the archives and lower weighting factor can increase degree of separation.This can realize by set up an opposite relation between each association and corresponding weighting factor before association is sued for peace.Thereby high weighted associations is lower than low weighted associations for the contribution of summation.
Process
Can analyze according to the whole bag of tricks of the present invention and process.For example, in one embodiment, method archives of user from receive member network begin, and wherein these archives have comprised the endorsement information of local article and/or advertisement.Endorsement information can comprise a look-up table, and this look-up table has been listed local article or the article identifier of advertisement and the annotations and comments of annotating and commenting in the classification of sorting out local search query, the classification that are associated with this article identifier.Annotations and comments are from the member of member network, they can be the binary endorsement of local article and/or advertisement, local article and/or advertisement grade and/or with local article and/or the relevant note of advertisement.Can provide economic incentives for the user of annotations and comments.This method comprises also that from member network inner or outside user receives local search query and the local article relevant with this local search query is provided, and wherein one of local article may be by according to these endorsement information annotations and comments.When the local search query that receives was classified in the identical category that finds in endorsement information, the local article that provides for the local search query that receives was exactly the local article that the annotations and comments listed in this endorsement information are crossed.Local article of annotating and commenting on and/or advertisement are from the member who is associated with the user who has submitted the local search query that receives to.Association can be based on indicated profile associated in files on each of customers and/or the local search query that receives.
Fig. 3 A-B shows the demonstration methods that local-search endorsement is provided, whereby the member can create they personalized local article and/advertising listing and share with other member and/or other user of search engine in the member network.Provide this demonstration methods by example, because number of ways is arranged according to these methods of the invention process.Method shown in Fig. 3 A-B can be made up by one of different system or its and carry out.Below according to carrying out the method that illustrates among Fig. 3 A-B by system shown in Fig. 1 100.By example, each parts of system 100 when the demonstration methods of key diagram 3A-B, have been quoted.
This method is since 310, and user (for example user 112a) adds member network by creating foregoing member profile, and for example member network 200 is (as Orkut
TM).
320, user 112a submits local search query to the search engine that is connected to member network site 160 (for example being positioned at the search engine 158 of search site 152).This local search query comprises the one or more clauses and subclauses (for example sushi restaurant) that will search for and the specific region (as San Francisco) that will search for.User 112a submits this local search request to by having comprised the request signal of local search request and by network 106 this request signal has been sent to server apparatus 152 in client device 102a generation.
330, along with the request signal that receives from client device 102a, search engine 158 is located the local information wanted in mode as known in the art and is concentrated the article identifier of returning the local information that representative wants at local search results.Search engine 158 is also classified to local search query.For example, reference is to the example of the local search query in the sushi restaurant of San Francisco, and above-mentioned request can be classified as " Japanese or Sushi restaurant ", and is listed under the location subclass of " SanFrancisco ".Perhaps, above-mentioned request can be classified as under the San Franscisco position and be placed under the subclass in " Japanese or Sushi restaurant ".Thereby the type that is used for the classification of local search query only depends on the expectation of search site 150.
Each article identifier that the local search results that search engine 158 returns is concentrated has been provided the one or more user of making 112a and can or have recommended for the specific searching request of being sent annotations and comments to be linked by " annotations and comments " of the local article on the basis of article identifier representative.Annotations and comments/recommendation can be to local article simple binary endorsement (as front or negative endorsement), to the deciding grade and level system of local article ordering (as 1 to 5 or A represent preferably to arrive to F the poorest) and/or the additional annotations relevant with local article.
340, user 112a can be by local article of visit corresponding " annotations and comments " link annotations and comments.For example, user 112a can chain at " annotations and comments " and click and be transferred to a navigation page or window, and user 112a faces the selection of positive annotations and comments (as " recommendation ") or this this locality article of negative endorsement (as " not recommending ") in the navigation page.In another example, user 112a can chain at " annotations and comments " and click and be transferred to a navigation page or window, and the user is faced with a scale there, for example from 1 to 5 should this locality article from preferably to the poorest grading, perhaps opposite scale.In another example, separate with above-mentioned two examples or combine, user 112a can chain at " annotations and comments " and click and be transferred to a navigation page or window, and user 112a can select to add the note relevant to the viewpoint of this this locality article with him there.
Perhaps, user 112a can annotate and comment on a local article and needn't obtain it from searching request earlier.For example, user 112a can create a search endorsement entry in his or her member profile, wherein user 112a can import in the one or more article identifier of local article of the expectation searching request of these annotations and comments, searching request that user 112a can be chosen as this expectation annotations and comments and the local article identifier of annotating and commenting on annotations and comments type separately.
In another example, user 112a does not click available " annotations and comments " link, but clicks to navigate to the local article of this reality on the local article identifier of reality.Search engine 158 notice above-mentioned visit then and with this information transmission to member's website 160 with in the archives that are stored in user 112a in the member-network database 170.In the future sometime, when user 112a access search engine 158 carries out another time search, search engine 158 with member network 168 communication is linked at user 112a and his member profile in member-network database 170, and search engine 158 can be pointed out user 112a to annotate and comment on it and before visited but the specific local article of annotations and comments not.User 112a is at his next access search engine 158 or can receive above-mentioned prompting after access search engine 158 pre-determined numbers.In addition, can point out user 112a one or many as required.If user 112a selects to ignore this prompting, search engine 158 can stop to point out user 112a to annotate and comment on above-mentioned local article after the prompting of pre-determined number.Then, search engine 158 can bring user 112a before to visit but not have the one other identification symbol of the local article of annotations and comments also to repeat above-mentioned prompting process once more.
345, it is the advertisement that specific local search query is annotated and commented on any amount that user 112a can also or replace local article outside local article.As involved here, advertisement can be online advertisement, and a plurality of product/service suppliers and contact details are perhaps just listed in for example headline advertisement, pop-up window advertisement simply.Advertisement can be any form of expecting at present known or this area, and can searched engine 158 and member network engine 168 by its article identifier visit.According to one embodiment of present invention, the action of annotations and comments advertisement separates with the action of carrying out above-mentioned search with the access search engine.The advertisement of annotating and commenting in addition, can comprise or not comprise one of the local article that finds for specific local search query with search engine 158 identical information.For example, be that user 112a may annotate and comment on this advertisement by the website of being responsible for an advertisement before or after search engine 158 had been visited in a search.The information relevant with the advertisement of annotating and commenting on can be transmitted immediately so that member network engine 168 can be stored in the advertisement of being signed in the member-network database 170 together with the suitable local classification to this advertisement in the archives of user 112a in this advertisement website.The classification of the advertisement of being signed and the classification of local article noted earlier are similar.
350, in case user 112a has has annotated and commented on one or more by separately the local article of article identifier representative in the local search results, and/or user 112a annotated and commented on one or morely also by their advertisements of article identifier representative, and search engine 158 can be communicated by letter with member network engine 168 annotations and comments are stored in the member profile in the member-network database 170.Sign by category classification under the local search query of submitting to according to user 112a.
Therefore, the member profile of user 112a can comprise following message at least: the 1) identifier of user 112a (can be anonymous); 2) as previously mentioned in the member network 200 with related other user's of user 112a tabulation; 3) list of categories of the local search query of local-search endorsement is arranged; 4) tabulation of local article of annotate and comment in previous each classification submitted to of user 112a (as product/service supplier's name and their contact details) and/or advertisement; And/or 5) user 112a is to each the local article annotated and commented on and/or the annotations and comments of advertisement.Perhaps, annotations and comments can comprise aforementioned information, but are stored in the file that is different from member profile and still are associated with the member.
With reference now to Fig. 3 B,, 360, another user (as user 112b) has submitted a local search query to identical search site 150.According to as described in 320, user 112b has comprised the request signal of local search request and by network 106 this request signal has been sent to server apparatus 152 and submitted this local search request to by generating at client device 102b as preceding.
Along with the request signal that receives from client device 102b, 370, search engine 158 carries out two search: 1) 371, carry out with Fig. 3 A in 330 similar common local searchs, search engine 158 is located the local information of expectation in mode as known in the art and is concentrated at first local search results and returns the article identifier that is associated with local information thus; 2) 372, search member-network database 170 is located local article and/or advertisement that before annotated and commented on and local search query identical category member 112b submission thus in the relevant member profile of search engine 158 in member network.Search engine 158 is searched for the member of member-network database 170 to be associated and/or to be associated with the local search query of user 112b submission with user 112b in the identification member network 200 by at first communicating by letter with server apparatus 162 and its member network engine 168.Then, by member network engine 168, the member profile that search engine 158 can be visited those relevant members is to search for any annotations and comments are crossed in above-mentioned suitable one or more classifications the local article and/or the freelist of advertisement (by their article identifier).
Thereby user 112b can add last layer and trust on common local search results collection.The form of this trust can be the local-search endorsement from those members that are associated with user 112b because of the explicit profile associated of they and user 112b in the member network 200, and is described as earlier in respect of figures 3.The form of this trust can also be in member's network 200 because those members' that they are associated with user 112b with the profile associated of the local search query implicit expression of user 112b and/or user 112b submission local-search endorsement.In an implicit profile association, search engine 158 and member network engine 168 can be according to the comparisons between the archives of other member in comparison between the archives of other member in the archives of user 112b and the member network 200 and the member network 200 and the local search query that member 112b submits to, and the member profile of storing from member-network database identifies those members that same or similar interest is arranged with user 112b.Search engine 158 can provide any local article and/or advertisement the local search query identical category that is sorted in user 112b submission to annotate and comment on to user 112b from the related member of above-mentioned implicit expression with member network engine 168 subsequently.For example, if user 112b is searching for the sushi restaurant of San Francisco, user 112b can be from being positioned at San Francisco and liking Japanese or those members in sushi restaurant or be that the cuisines critic's in San Francisco area member receives annotations and comments from those.And for example, if user 112a and 112b are the members of " photography " corporations in the member network 200, and user 112b is searching for digital camera, user 112b can receive from other member of user 112a and " photography " corporations about the digital camera kind that will buy and/or the annotations and comments of where buying digital camera.Those skilled in the art can see having numerous materials can be used for discerning those users that can be associated with user 112b recessiveness from the disclosure.Those standards only depend on the local search query that the degree of the information that comprises in the member profile of member network 200 and user 112b import for the local article that obtains to annotate and comment on and/or advertisement.
380, search engine 158 is with the set of first and second local search results and to generate final local search results collection.According to one embodiment of present invention, the local article that can cross any annotations and comments that final Search Results is concentrated and/or advertisement is sorted in the mode that is different from other local article in this set and in addition note to show annotations and comments.Can be to the ordering of each the local article annotated and commented on and/or advertisement based on (implicit expression or show) related type and/or the degree between the member who has has annotated and commented on above-mentioned local article and/or advertisement in user 112b and the member network 200.For example, the final search result collection is that the first local search results collection of routine is resequenced and resequenced, and the article identifier of (finding from the second local search results collection) and note is placed on the foremost that the local article annotated and commented on the foremost and/or advertisement be placed on this tabulation obtains.User 112b can visit local article and/or all annotations and comments of advertisement and the user that identification did annotations and comments of those notes to check that each was annotated and commented on subsequently.This makes user 112b can be suitably believe these annotations and comments according to he is related with those annotations and comments person (implicit expression or explicit).Note (for example, " John Doe annotations and comments " and/or " from John Doe: buy gadgety good local ") can be accompanied by the local article annotated and commented on or the article identifier of advertisement, also can be placed near the article identifier.Perhaps, note can be the link to the pop-up window that comprises endorsement language or other sites/pages.According to another embodiment of the present invention, user 112b can be by according to ordering or reset and to be automatically brought to the article annotated and commented on or the navigation website of advertisement.
Although previous embodiment of the present invention has been described, the annotations and comments that can also provide and ask to have nothing to do has been provided about annotations and comments (promptly the searching request of submitting to according to the user provides the Search Results of annotating and commenting on) by the request decision.A kind of providing and the demonstration methods of the article annotations and comments that request is irrelevant is provided Fig. 6 A-B, thus the member can create they personalized lists of articles and with member network in other member and/or other user of search engine share.This demonstration methods provides by example, because there is number of ways to realize according to method of the present invention.Method shown in Fig. 6 A-B can or be finished by one of multiple systems or its combined running.Below according to finish the method that illustrates among Fig. 6 A-B by system shown in Fig. 1 100.For example, the demonstration methods at key diagram 6A-B is each element of having quoted system 100.
Method is that 310,320 and 330 described similar modes among Fig. 3 A proceed to 620 and 630 then since 610 with the front.
640,340 similar with among Fig. 3 A, user 112a links by visit corresponding " annotations and comments " can annotate and comment on a local article.For example, user 112a can chain click at " annotations and comments " and be transferred to a navigation page or window then, and user 112a faces the selection of positive annotations and comments (as " recommendation ") or this this locality article of negative endorsement (as " not recommending ") in the navigation page.In another example, user 112a can chain at " annotations and comments " and click and be transferred to a navigation page or window, and the user is faced with a scale there, for example from 1 to 5 should this locality article from preferably to the poorest grading, perhaps opposite.In another example, separate with above-mentioned two examples or combine, user 112a can chain at " annotations and comments " and click and be transferred to a navigation page or window, and user 112a can select to add the note relevant to the viewpoint of this this locality article with him there.
Perhaps, user 112a can annotate and comment on a local article and needn't obtain it from searching request earlier.For example, user 112a can create a search endorsement entry in his or her member profile, wherein, 340 different with among Fig. 3 A, user 112a needn't import the expectation searching request (in any case because the search result set of annotating and commenting on all will be irrelevant with request, although user 112a still can import the searching request of expectation) of these annotations and comments.Here, user 112a can also import one or more article identifier of the local article that its selection will annotate and comment on and the local article identifier of annotating and commenting in separately annotations and comments type.
In another example, user 112a does not click available " annotations and comments " link, but clicks to navigate to the local article of this reality on the local article identifier of reality.Search engine 158 notice above-mentioned visit then and with this information transmission to member's website 160 with in the archives that are stored in user 112a in the member-network database 170.In the future sometime, when user 112a access search engine 158 carries out another time search, search engine 158 with member network 168 communication is linked at user 112a and his member profile in member-network database 170, and search engine 158 can be pointed out user 112a to annotate and comment on it and before visited but the specific local article of annotations and comments not.User 112a is at his next access search engine 158 or can receive above-mentioned prompting after access search engine 158 pre-determined numbers.In addition, can point out user 112a one or many as required.If user 112a selects to ignore this prompting, search engine 158 can stop to point out user 112a to annotate and comment on above-mentioned local article after the prompting of pre-determined number.Therefore, search engine 158 can bring user 112a before to visit but not have the one other identification symbol of the local article of annotations and comments also to repeat above-mentioned prompting process once more.
645,345 similar with among Fig. 3, user 112a can also be outside local article or be replaced local article is the advertisement of specific local search query annotations and comments any amount.As involved here, advertisement can be online advertisement, and a plurality of product/service suppliers and contact details are perhaps just listed in for example headline advertisement, pop-up window advertisement simply.Advertisement can be any form of expecting at present known or this area, and can searched engine 158 and member network engine 168 by its article identifier visit.According to one embodiment of present invention, the action of annotations and comments advertisement separates with the action of carrying out above-mentioned search with the access search engine.The advertisement of annotating and commenting in addition, can comprise or not comprise one of the local article that finds for specific local search query with search engine 158 identical information.For example, be a search and before or after the access search engine 158, user 112a may be annotate and comment on this advertisement by the website of being responsible for an advertisement.The information relevant with the advertisement of annotating and commenting on can be transmitted immediately so that member network engine 168 can be stored in the advertisement of being signed in the member-network database 170 together with the suitable local classification to this advertisement in the archives of user 112a in this advertisement website.The classification of the advertisement of being signed and the classification of local article noted earlier are similar.
650,350 similar with among Fig. 3, in case user 112a has has annotated and commented on one or more by separately the local article of article identifier representative in the local search results, and/or user 112a annotated and commented on one or morely also by their advertisements of article identifier representative, and search engine 158 can be communicated by letter with member network engine 168 annotations and comments are stored in the member profile in the member-network database 170.Annotations and comments are by category classification under the local search query of submitting to according to user 112a.
Therefore, the member profile of user 112a can comprise following message at least: the 1) identifier of user 112a (can be anonymous); 2) as previously mentioned in the member network 200 with related other user's of user 112a tabulation; 3) list of categories of the local search query of local-search endorsement is arranged; 4) tabulation of local article of annotate and comment in previous each classification submitted to of user 112a (as product/service supplier's name and their contact details) and/or advertisement; And/or 5) user 112a is to each the local article annotated and commented on and/or the annotations and comments of advertisement.Perhaps, annotations and comments can comprise aforementioned information, but are stored in the file that is different from member profile and still are associated with the member.
With reference now to Fig. 6 B,, this method proceeds to 660,360 among it and Fig. 3 and aforementioned similar.Then, along with at 670 request signals that receive from client device 102b, search engine 158 carries out two search: 1) 671, carry out with Fig. 3 A in 330 similar common local searchs, search engine 158 is located the local information of expectation in mode as known in the art and is concentrated at first local search results and returns the article identifier that is associated with local information thus; 2) 672, search member-network database 170 is located local article and/or advertisement that before annotated and commented on and local search query identical category member 112b submission thus in the relevant member profile of search engine 158 in member network.Search engine 158 is searched for the member of member-network database 170 to be associated and/or to be associated with the local search query of user 112b submission with user 112b in the identification member network 200 by at first communicating by letter with server apparatus 162 and its member network engine 168.Then, by member network engine 168, the member profile that search engine 158 can be visited those relevant members is to search for any annotations and comments are crossed in above-mentioned suitable one or more classifications the local article and/or the freelist of advertisement (by their article identifier).
Thereby user 112b can add last layer and trust on common local search results collection.The form of this trust can be the local-search endorsement from those members that are associated with user 112b because of the explicit profile associated of they and user 112b in the member network 200.The form of this trust can also be from the member network 200 because those members' that they are associated with user 112b with the profile associated of the local search query implicit expression of user 112b and/or user 112b submission local-search endorsement.In the profile associated of an implicit expression, search engine 158 and member network engine 168 can be according to the comparisons between the archives of other member in comparison between the archives of other member in the archives of user 112b and the member network 200 and the member network 200 and the local search query that member 112b submits to, and the member profile of storing from member-network database identifies those members that same or similar interest is arranged with user 112b.Search engine 158 can provide any local article and/or advertisement the local search query identical category that is sorted in user 112b submission to annotate and comment on to user 112b from the related member of above-mentioned implicit expression with member network engine 168 subsequently.
For example, if user 112b is searching for the sushi restaurant of San Francisco, user 112b can be from being positioned at San Francisco and liking Japanese or those members in sushi restaurant or be that the cuisines critic's in San Francisco area member receives annotations and comments from those.And for example, if user 112a and 112b are the members of " photography " corporations in the member network 200, and user 112b is searching for digital camera, user 112b can receive from other member of user 112a and " photography " corporations about the digital camera kind that will buy and/or the annotations and comments of where buying digital camera.Those skilled in the art can see having numerous materials can be used for discerning those users that can be associated with user 112b recessiveness from the disclosure.Those standards only depend on the local search query that the degree of the information that comprises in the member profile of member network 200 and user 112b import for the local article that obtains to annotate and comment on and/or advertisement.
680, this method as the front for Fig. 3 380 as described in continue.
Fig. 3 A and 6A have been described, and Fig. 3 B and 6B have been described about another user (being user 112b) about a user (being user 112a).But, should notice comprising that a plurality of users of user 112a or a plurality of users except that user 112a may annotate and comment on a large amount of local article and/or the advertisement of the identical category of the local search query of submitting to afterwards with user 112b.In addition, user 112a and 112b can be same users.Therefore, according to one embodiment of present invention, can provide the one or more user of making 112b also can to link for each article identifier that final Search Results described in Fig. 3 B and the 6B is concentrated for " annotations and comments " of the searching request annotations and comments of submitting to and/or the local article of recommending the basis and/or advertisement (just as user 112a is done), and let it be " annotations and comments " and " annotations and comments " state how.In addition, even as user 112b during not in member network 200, it also still can benefit from member 200 member's local-search endorsement.This is because as previously mentioned, extract annotations and comments in the member profile that the local search query that search engine 158 and member network engine 168 can only be submitted to according to member 112b is associated with user 112b from member-network database 170.
Therefore, local-search endorsement can be used for by be provided as the ordering of the article identifier that those members of being associated with them in themselves and the member network 200 concentrate Search Results the approach individual searching engine of article identifier rearrangement for the user.
According to one embodiment of present invention, local-search endorsement can and realize that the search site of local-search endorsement provides commercial opportunity to the user who has annotated and commented on local article and/or advertisement.For example, be specific specific article or the advertisement of classification annotations and comments in order to encourage the user, certain income (for example certain expense being paid in each click of process) can be paid to the user of each annotations and comments for annotations and comments in above-mentioned website.Search site can also keep a part of above-mentioned income.
Example
With reference to snapshot shown in the figure 4,, provided a example now according to one embodiment of the present of invention with reference to Fig. 1 and 2.When the user A on the summit 202 (it can be among the user 112a-n any one) with archives A when the search engine 158 that is positioned at search site 150 is submitted the searching request of the gadgets at Chicago (widget) to, search engine returns search result set shown in Fig. 4 to user A.As shown in the figure, article identifier 410 expression has the annotations and comments of basic article of the note of user D (be arranged in the summit 208 of Fig. 2, have archives D).The negative endorsement of article identifier 520 expression user E (be arranged in the summit 410 of Fig. 3, have archives E) does not have note.The annotations and comments of article identifier 430 expression user B (be arranged in the summit 204 of Fig. 2, have archives B) and user C (be arranged in the summit 206 of Fig. 2, have archives C), but only from the note of C.The annotations and comments of article identifier 440 expression user F (be arranged in the summit 212 of Fig. 2, have archives F) do not have note.Article identifier 450 expressions are annotations and comments or note not.
By checking Search Results, user A can determine: 1) believe the article of article identifier 410 and 430 representatives, because they are by his/her friend, user B, C and D (respectively by shown in friendship association 226,32 and 222) signature; 2) believe the article of article identifier 420 representatives, but the degree outline is weaker, because it is the friend by his/her friend, user E, annotations and comments; And/or 3) do not believe the article of article identifier 440 or 450 representatives, because article identifier 440 is to be annotated and commented on by the user F (the friend F of the friend G of friend C) that user A effort is associated with, and article identifier 450 is not by anyone annotations and comments.Perhaps, if user F implicitly (for example is associated with user A, archives according to user F, he be the Chicago area be gadget expert or gadget fan, perhaps user A and F are gadget corporations in the member network 200 or the member of association), user A can select to believe the article by article identifier 440 representatives.The article that user A can also believe article identifier 430 representative is than believing that the article that article identifier 410 is represented is more because the user A approach related with user B more than with the related approach of user D (as can see from Figure 2: three related 224,226,228VS two related 220 and 222).
As previously mentioned, user A also has an opportunity to follow the link 401 of each article identifier to provide annotations and comments and/or note to the article of article identifier 410,420,430,440 and 450 representatives by visit.
The demonstration snapshot 500 of the endorsement page that is provided when user A visits the link 401 of article identifier 410 according to one embodiment of the present of invention is provided Fig. 5.As shown in the figure, user A can perhaps be somebody's turn to do link by button click 520 negative endorsement, and/or add note in input frame 530 by button click 510 these links of positive annotations and comments.In case finish, user A can button click 540 to finish this endorsement process, be stored in annotations and comments in his files on each of customers in member-network database 170 and return result of page searching shown in Fig. 4.The annotations and comments of user A are added to result of page searching in mode identical shown in Fig. 4 subsequently.
