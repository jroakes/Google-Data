Embodiment
Fig. 1 figures show the exemplary architecture 100 of the system of the time of the network for synchronization node.Meshed network causes
User can access wireless high-speed internet on the not universal big region in internet.For example, meshed network can be in pole
Realized in the remote village of the rare infrastructure for being connected to internet.
The system includes being responsible for the cloud controller 102 of the time synchronized of cross-node network.In some embodiments,
Meshed network is organized as mesh network.
Meshed network includes hub node 106,120 and regular node 108-118.Regular node can be via node or
End points is accessed, such as is accessed for Wi-Fi.Data can be relayed to other nodes in network by via node.Access end points
Allow user to be connected to external network, such as internet by accessing end points, and data can also be relayed in network
Other nodes.Hub node can be via node or access end points, and directly can also be communicated with cloud controller 102.
That is although non-hub node can access cloud controller 102 by any hub node, hub node can be without
Cloud controller 102 is connected in the case of any other node.For example, with cloud control can be connected to by hub node 106
The node 110 of device 102 processed is on the contrary, hub node 106,120 has is directly connected to cloud controller 102.In some embodiment party
In formula, hub node 106,120 is routed to external network, and other nodes are wireless.
Each node has the one or more directional aerials for being used to communicate with adjacent node.For example, each node can
So that there is directional aerial including multiple millimeter wqve radio equipment, each millimeter wqve radio equipment.
Generally, the node with highly directional antenna provides higher bandwidth, but with once can only be with another node
Another radio communication is cost.Specifically, communicated for node, the directional aerial for giving wireless device can be with
The directional aerial for another wireless device being diverted in another node.Moreover, if given node includes two orientations
Antenna, each directional aerial are diverted into corresponding adjacent node, then giving node can communicate with two adjacent nodes simultaneously.
When two nodes are in communication with each other in specific time interval, node can be formed in specific time interval
Transmitting and receiving node pair.For example, when hub node 106 and node 108 communicate, hub node 106 may be at sending out
Emission mode, and node 108 may be at reception pattern.Specifically, the directional aerial of hub node 106 is diverted into node
108 directional aerial, so that hub node 106 can send data to node 108.In some embodiments, node is worked as
108 send response to hub node 106, and hub node 106 is transformed into reception pattern, and node 108 is transformed into emission mode.
Meshed network in framework 100 is depicted in particular point in time, there is flexible connection to be connected with alternative exemplary
Topology.Flexible connection indicated by the solid line, such as 124 are flexibly connected, alternative connection, such as alternative connection 122 is represented by dashed line.Section
Flexible connection between point is the connection that data actively shift among the nodes.Alternative connection between node is that data are saving
May but not be the connection shifted at present between point.To make the alternative between two nodes be connected to become flexible connection, two sections
The directional aerial of point can turn to each other as described above.
It is flexibly connected for example, hub node 106 has with node 108, this shows the directional aerial of hub node 106
The directional aerial of node 108 is diverted into particular point in time.
With node 112,106 with being flexibly connected and being connected 122 with alternative with node 116, this shows to save node 108
Point 108 is communicating with hub node 106 and node 112, but in the particular point in time, is not communicated with node 116.
For internetwork communication, cloud controller 102 flexible connection can be converted to alternative connection, or vice versa it is as the same.
In some embodiments, cloud controller 102 determines the scheduling of the conversion for the connection across each node, and this will be retouched with reference to figure 3
State.For example, at the time point in future, the directional aerial that node 108 can direct it antenna from node 112 redirect to node
116 directional aerial, thus created between node 108 and node 116 be flexibly connected and node 108 and node 112 it
Between create alternative connection.
Cloud controller 102 also communicates with topological database 122.Topological database 122 can include representing meshed network
Information topological, on each node in network.Information for specific node can include multiple wireless in node
The role of electric equipment, node, such as hub, repeater or access point, the node adjacent with node and the node whether by
It is added to, i.e. be connected to network.In some embodiments, topological database 122 also to any given node specify and network
In any other given node communication optimal path.Specifically, optimal path can specify relaying data to minimize
A series of via nodes of stand-by period.
Cloud controller 102 can be communicated with topological database 122 to add or reconnect to network by node.Below
In, with reference to figure 3, topological database 122 is more fully described.
In this manual, term " database " will be widely used for referring to any of the relation between data element safeguarded
Appropriate data acquisition system.Data need not be stored as table, in any particular manner structuring, or complete lattice, and
And the data in database can be stored in the storage device of one or more positions.Thus, for example, topological database 122
Multiple data acquisition systems can be included, each data acquisition system can be organized differently and access.
Fig. 2 figures show the exemplary architecture 200 of the specific node in the network with multiple wireless device 204-208.
Each wireless device 204-208 can have the corresponding directional aerial towards another different nodes in network.The node
There can be the network processing unit 202 to be communicated with each wireless device 204-208.In some embodiments, network processes
Device 202 is synchronously saved by the synchronization hardware timestamp in each wireless device, such as media access control (MAC) timestamp
Time in point.This will be further described with reference to figure 4.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart for the instantiation procedure by cloud controller lock in time.Generally, system can use example
The node that process is come in synchronizing network.Synchronization node generally also requires to find node.But the system can perform only as an alternative
For finding the instantiation procedure of the node in network.For convenience, the process will be described as by one or more computers
Properly programmed system performs, for example, Fig. 1 cloud controller 102.
System maintenance represents the topological data (step 302) of meshed network.Data can be stored in topological database,
Such as Fig. 1 topological database 122.Data can specify the first group node being connected in the network of the system.First group of section
Point can be directly to the hub node of the system, i.e. the node of system can be connected to without other nodes.
System receives one or more request (steps 304) for being connected to network from the first group node.In some realities
Apply in mode, each node can attempt to connect to system, i.e., by system discovery.Trial to connection can occur to open in node
When dynamic.
Each node can carry out its synchronous timestamp in response to being connected to the system.That is, the mistake of network is connected the node to
Journey includes node, and its timestamp is synchronous with other nodes in network.This is further described below with regard to Fig. 5.
System is alternatively coupled to the specific node (step 306) of system from the first group node.In some embodiments,
The node that Systematic selection responds to request first.In some other embodiments, system randomly chooses from first group
Node.In other other embodiment, Systematic selection has the node of the adjacent node of maximum quantity.Generally, such as net
First group node of the hub node of network can be directly wired to external network, such as internet, thus can be in network most
The node reliably to be communicated with system.
System life is configured as the request for each adjacent node for making selected node transmit for the synchronous selected node
Instruction (step 308), and the instruction is sent to selected node (step 310).
After receiving instruction, the selected node can scan adjacent node.In some embodiments, system is wrapped in instruction
Coordinate that the directional aerial of the selected node can be diverted, from topological database is included to position adjacent node.These refer to
The timestamp of their corresponding timestamps and the selected node is same can to make selected node be propagated to each of which adjacent node for order
The request of step.Such as the request of synchronization frame can also include the timestamp of the selected node.This will be described with reference to figure 4A-B.
If system only performs discovery without performing synchronization, system can be propagated to each adjacent node to be found
Request, this can be referred to as finding frame.The request can cause adjacent node to continuously attempt to be connected to system, such as pass through connection
To cloud controller.Hub node can be directly connected to system, and regular node can pass through the wireless connection with hub node
To be connected to system.In some embodiments, the request makes node be found and they synchronous timestamp of node.
In some embodiments, request also includes topology identifier.Each node can preload topology identifier.
Then, each node can be by the topology identifier of preloading compared with the topology identifier in instruction.If topology identifier
Match, then node can continue its timestamp is synchronous with the timestamp in instruction.When this ensures that the node is synchronized to expected
Between stab.
Each request that node receives can cause the node that the request is traveled to the adjacent node of the node.This can
To continue, until each node in network has been synchronized to the timestamp of selected node.In order to by the time of given node
Stamp is synchronous with the timestamp of selected node, and node can store the timestamp of selected node into the memory of given node.
When request is used for synchronization node, each node can regularly send request with lock in time to adjacent segments
Point.Gentle drift this takes into account the internal clocking of each node with the time, for example, it can be in the rank of several microseconds.This
Time synchronized can also be abstracted from system, i.e. cloud controller.That is, the system can be assumed each node tool in network
There is the synchronized timestamp of across a network.Therefore, the system can push scheduling based on the synchronous timestamp, and this will enter below
One step describes.
In some embodiments, when sending the request for lock in time, specific node starts timer.To timing
Untill device expires, node can prevent oneself to enter reception pattern, i.e. node will not receive any synchronization request.Regularly
Device can be slightly less than regular (periodicity) for sending the request for lock in time.This can be prevented due to synchronization request
And overloaded network.
In some other embodiments, once given node by synchronization, then the given node is for example by being connected to this
Other nodes of system, which to send to system, to be simultaneously indicated, and it can store the instruction of synchronization in topological database.It is once every
Individual node is all synchronous with timestamp, then the system can is based on timestamp push scheduling.
In some embodiments, node has multiple wireless devices, above with reference to described in Fig. 2.Node can receive
For the instruction synchronous with the timestamp of the node of selection at the network processing unit of the node.Network processing unit can be connected
Connect, such as be routed to each wireless device, and can make each wireless device by its timestamp and selected node when
Between stab it is synchronous.
In some embodiments, if the instruction of topological data library storage synchronization, system determine second in network
Group node is not yet synchronized to the timestamp of the selected node from topological database, and the topological data library storage is as described above
Synchronizing indication.When the node in second group can not communicate with remaining node in network, this can occur.For example, second group
In node its antenna can be made to redirect to adjacent node, but sight can be blocked by physical object.
The system can identify the adjacent node of each node of the second group node using topological database, described adjacent
Node has been chosen the timestamp lock in time of node with this.
The system can generate extra-instruction and extra-instruction is sent to identified adjacent node, the extra-instruction
It is configured as making identified adjacent node continue to send synchronization request to the node in second group, until the system is from second group
In each node receive synchronizing indication untill.By using topological database by network trunk extra-instruction, can incite somebody to action
Instruction is sent to identified adjacent node.In some embodiments, the system is for example repeated using exponential backoff algorithm
Attempt to send the synchronization request for the timestamp for including selected node in ground.
After each node in a network is synchronous with the timestamp of selected node, scheduling can be pushed to coordination by system
The selected node of the communication of across a network.Scheduling can specify each node in each pair adjacent node when in emission mode or
Reception pattern.By lock in time, node can direct it antenna while turn to appropriate position.For example, scheduling can refer to
Its antenna is redirect to the first adjacent node by surely selected node from timestamp X to timestamp Y, wherein, X and Y are from selected section
The following increment of the current time stamp of point.Then, scheduling can specify selected node from timestamp Y to timestamp Z, by its antenna
The second adjacent node is redirect to, wherein, selected node is in emission mode, while the second neighboring modes are in a receive mode.
Fig. 4 A be illustrate received at the hub node 406 of network for synchronization instruction after, how lock in time
Figure 40 0.Hub node 406 can be received from cloud controller 402 and instructed.Hub node 406 can have time stamp T ime_A.
Hub node 406 has to be flexibly connected with node 408,410, and this instruction hub node 406 has multiple directional aerials, each
Directional aerial is diverted into corresponding node 408,410.Hub node 406 can be by synchronization request and hub node 406
Timestamp, i.e. Time_A are sent to node 408,410.
Fig. 4 B are shown in node 408,410 after hub node 406 receives synchronization request, how lock in time
Figure 42 2.When receiving synchronization request, their corresponding timestamps can be synchronized to Time_A by node 408,410.
Node 408 is connected with the flexible connection with node 412 and with the alternative with node 416.Therefore, node
408 send the synchronization request to time stamp T ime_A to node 412.Because the directional aerial of node 408 is not diverted into section
The directional aerial of point 416, node 408 can not send synchronization request in current point in time to node 416.
In some embodiments, after the request including Time_A is sent to node 412 by node 408, node 408
Scan pattern can be entered.Scan pattern can make node 408 search for other adjacent nodes.For example, scan pattern can make to determine
Turned into antenna full motion scope, untill node 408 positions the directional aerial of another node.Node 408 can determine
Whether another node is not synchronized to Time_A by its timestamp.In some embodiments, system is to hub node 406,420
The snapshot of synchronizing indication is sent for distribution.In some other embodiments, node 408 waits the instruction from another node
Other nodes are by the response of synchronization.In other other embodiment, synchronization request is sent to another section by node 408
Point, and it is unrelated whether its timestamp to be synchronized into Time_A with other nodes.
In some embodiments, after the request including Time_A is sent to node 412 by node 408, node etc.
Treat the instruction from cloud controller 402.Cloud controller 402 can determine that its timestamp is not synchronized to Time_A, example by node 416
Such as, because node 416 is not attached to cloud controller 402, and generating makes node 408 form the finger being flexibly connected with node 416
Order, and request is sent so that the timestamp of node 416 is synchronized into Time_A, as referring to Figure 3 as described above.
Similarly, when receiving synchronization request from hub node 406, its timestamp is arranged to Time_A by node 410,
And the synchronization request for including Time_A is sent to node 412 by being flexibly connected.In some embodiments, if node
412 are synchronized its timestamp due to the synchronization request from node 408, then node 412 ignores the request.
Fig. 5 is for making the flow chart for being not added with the example process that node is found by adjacent node in network.In order to
Convenient, the process will be described as the properly programmed system of one or more computers by such as Fig. 1 cloud controller 102
Perform.In some embodiments, before the time in synchronizing network, system is attempted to find such as to identify in topological database
Each undiscovered node.
System maintenance represents the data (step 502) of network topology.Data can be stored in topological database, as above
It is described in reference diagram 3.
System is not yet added to the specific node (step 504) of network according to data selection.It is special that system can analyze storage
Determine whether node is added to the topological database of network to select specific node.In some cases, being chosen node may be first
Before have been attempt to be added to network, but for example may fail due to physical obstacle.
When selected node attempts to be added in network, the selected node can enter reception pattern.The selected node
Can also in its gamut scan orientation antenna to attempt to be connected with adjacent node.The gamut can be by wireless device
Predefine.
System determines the adjacent node (step 506) around selected node using data.In some embodiments, it is
System inquires about topological database to determine the coordinate of adjacent node.Especially, topological database can include the orientation of adjacent node
The coordinate of the directional aerial for the selected node that antenna should be redirect to.
System generation is configured to find the instruction (step 508) of selected node, and the instruction is sent into adjacent segments
Point, so that adjacent node finds the selected node (step 510).These instructions can make adjacent node by its corresponding orientation
Antenna redirect to the coordinate of the directional aerial of selected node.In some embodiments, these instruct the phase for causing adjacent node
The directional aerial answered turns in gamut, to search for the stronger connection with selected node.Adjacent node can be each in
Emission mode.System an adjacent node in adjacent node can be determined the directional aerial of selected node be diverted into this one
The corresponding directional aerial of individual adjacent node.In some embodiments, it is only necessary to which a node in adjacent node is realized
The connection of selected node to be added to network.When selected node is connected to an adjacent node, selected node can be with
Send the instruction realized and be connected with system.Then, selected node can be with an adjacent node radio communication.
In some embodiments, above with reference to described in Fig. 5, it is adjacent that instruction make it that its timestamp is synchronized to by selected node
The timestamp of node.
