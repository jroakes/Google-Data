Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to providing online content.
- the present disclosure more specifically relates to dynamically providing content based on its potential relevance to a user.
- Online content may be available regarding any number of disparate topics.
- a first website on the Internet may be devoted to the migratory habits of barn swallows and a second website may be devoted to automotive repair.
- a user must proactively seek out online content of interest to the user.
- an Internet user may utilize a search engine to search for webpages devoted to automotive repair. The user may then navigate between the webpages in the search results until the user finds the webpage that most closely matches the user's interests.
- many web browsers now include the ability to bookmark webpages. For example, a user may bookmark a webpage devoted to replacing a valve cover gasket in an engine for later review. The user can then select the bookmark to go directly to the webpage, instead of having to repeat the search for the corresponding webpage of interest.
- One implementation is a computerized method for providing online content.
- the method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, history data associated with a client identifier, the history data being indicative of one or more online events.
- the method also includes analyzing the history data to determine a number of times content regarding a category of subject matter was presented at a computing device corresponding to the client identifier.
- the method further includes analyzing the history data to determine a number of times the content regarding the category of subject matter was clicked at the computing device.

- the operations yet further include providing the advertisement for display at the computing device based in part on the likelihood value.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an electronic display showing an example webpage
- FIG. 3 is an example illustration of content being included with a webpage by a content selection server.
- FIG. 4 is an example flow diagram of a process for providing online content.
- online content may be dynamically selected for a user based the user's potential interest in the content.
- a user may be provided content of interest without the user having to proactively locate the content.
- a user may opt in to allowing a content selection service to analyze history data indicative of online actions performed by the user.
- Such a service may be configured to select content of relevance to the user by identifying online actions performed by the user. For example, which types of content were requested by the user and how the user interacted with the content may be analyzed to determine potential interests of the user.
- the user's interactions with content selected by the content selection service may be analyzed to predict whether the user will be interested in other content. In other words, the user's reaction to content selected by the service may be used as feedback to adjust how the service selects content for the user.
- a user may opt in or out of allowing a content selection service to store and use data regarding online actions performed by the user.
- the user may be represented in the service as a randomized user identifier (e.g., a cookie, a device serial number, etc.) that contains no personally-identifiable information about the user.
- a randomized user identifier e.g., a cookie, a device serial number, etc.
- information relating to the user's name and/or demographics e.g., the user's education level, profession, age, gender, race, marital status, income, etc.
- a user identifier may be related to, or may itself be, a client identifier that identifies the user's device to the content selection service (e.g., a cookie set on the device, an IP address of the device, etc.).
- a user identifier may be associated with multiple client identifiers. For example, a user identifier may be associated with a client identifier for the user's mobile telephone and a second client identifier for the user's home computer.
- a content selection service may provide selected content in conjunction with other online content requested by a user.
- a content selection service may relate a user identifier with an interest category of golf. Such an interest category may then be used by the content selection service to provide golf-related content to a device associated with the user identifier, when the device requests a webpage.
- content selected by the content selection service may be interactive (e.g., a playable video or audio file, a hotlinked image that redirects the user's browser to another webpage, etc.). In such a case, interactive content may be used to suggest additional content for review by the user.
- a content selection service may select an image of a fisherman that is hotlinked to a webpage devoted to reviews of fishing equipment.
- a topic of content selected by the content selection service may not be related to the topic of the webpage being visited by the user. For example, a user interested in fishing may be presented with a hotlinked image relating to fishing while visiting a webpage devoted to cooking recipes. If the user wishes to see more content related to fishing, he may click on the hotlinked image to be redirected to a fishing-related webpage.
- a content selection service may calculate a value representing the likelihood of an event occurring regarding presented content.
- an online event may correspond to one or more actions performed by the user in response to being presented certain content.
- an online event may correspond to searching for a particular topic, navigating to a webpage having that topic, following a hotlink of content selected by the service (e.g., by clicking or otherwise selecting the content via a user interface, such as a mouse or touch screen display), the user performing an action on a hotlinked webpage (e.g., downloading an application, making a purchase of a good or service, etc.), and the user performing a search for additional information regarding content selected by the service.
- the content selection service may analyze history data indicative of one or more previous online events to calculate a likelihood value.
- a content selection service may use a calculated likelihood value to select and provide content. For example, webpages visited by a user and/or searches conducted by the user may be analyzed by the service to determine one or more interests of the user. In addition, the service may analyze online actions performed regarding content previously selected by the service. For example, assume that a user was identified as being interested in golf, based on a number of visits to golf-related webpages by the user. The content selection service may then select and provide golf-related content to a device of the user. The service may analyze how the user reacts to such content to determine the likelihood that the user will interact with future golf-related content. Thus, the content selection service may receive and analyze feedback after selecting content, to potentially adjust which content is provided to the user by the service.

- the likelihood value may represent the likelihood that the user of client 102 will click on a content selected by content selection server 104 .
- the likelihood value may be a probability of the online event occurring. For example, a likelihood value of 0.30 may represent a 30% chance that a user will click on an image selected by content selection server 104 .
- identified characteristics of the history data may be used with a machine learning model to generate the likelihood value.
- a Bayesian network, neural network, regression model, logistics regression model, or similar form of machine learning model may be used to generate a likelihood value.
- a value indicative of how unlikely an event is to occur may be used instead of a likelihood value (e.g., there may be a 70% chance that a user will not click on an image selected by content selection server 104 ).
- a likelihood value may be generated based in part on one or more identified interest categories for a user identifier (e.g., a theme or topic of received content).
- content selection server 104 may analyze history data for the user identifier to identify one or more interest categories and online events relating to the interest categories. For example, a user interested in philately may perform a number of searches for “stamps,” “stamp collecting,” and “stamp preservation.” In such a case, history data associated with the user's identifier may be analyzed by content selection server 104 to identify philately as a potential interest category. Content selection server 104 may also identify the strength of the interest, in some cases.
- ten visits per day to philately-related webpages may indicate a stronger interest than only two visits per day.
- a user having a strong interest in philately may have a higher likelihood of selecting a hotlinked image of a stamp than a user that has only a weak interest in the hobby.
- a likelihood value may also be generated based in part on one or more online events indicated by the history data.
- content selection server 104 may identify the number of times content was selected by content selection server 104 and provided to a device associated with a particular user identifier. In some cases, the number of times the content was presented may be subdivided by a theme, topic, category, etc., of the content. For example, content selection server 104 may analyze the history data to identify that golf-related content was provided five times to client 102 . Content selection server 104 may also analyze the history data to identify the number of times a particular online event occurred regarding an identified topic (i.e., by analyzing how the user responds to certain topics). In some implementations, content selection server 104 may analyze the history data to identify content interactions.
- content selection server 104 may analyze the history data to determine that the user of client 102 clicked on the golf-related content selected by content selection server 104 twice out of the five times that the content was presented. Such a metric may be used as part of the machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a certain event occurring, should additional golf-related content be selected by content selection server 104 for client 102 .
- content selection server 104 may be configured to allow different content providers to compete for the ability to have content selection server 104 select their content.
- an online retailer may utilize content selection server 104 to place an advertisement on a webpage served by content source 108 .
- a non-profit organization may utilize content selection server 104 to place a public service announcement within an application running on client 102 (e.g., within a running video game).
- Competition may be based, for example, among content providers that provide content having a topic that matches an interest category identified for a user identifier.
- online retailers of tennis rackets may compete for the ability to provide an advertisement based on a user identifier being associated with the interest category of tennis.
- content selection server 104 may be configured to conduct an auction to select from which content provider the content is to be provided. In some cases, content providers wishing to provide content to certain users may place bids in an auction. The auction may be conducted by content selection server 104 in real-time (e.g., in response to receiving a content selection request from client 102 ), or beforehand. In some implementations, content selection server 104 may automatically select the participants for the auction and/or determine bids for the participants. For example, assume that a user identifier is associated with the interest categories of golf, philately, and skydiving.
- content selection server 104 may select auction participants among those content providers that identified golf, philately, or skydiving as a topic of their content.
- Content selection server 104 may also use one or more determined likelihood values to determine a bid for an auction participant. For example, content selection server 104 may generate a bid on behalf of an advertiser of golf clubs based in part on the likelihood that the user receiving the advertisement will click on the advertisement and/or make a purchase on the advertiser's website. Thus, bids may differ for users having equal interests in a topic, based on the likelihood that a user will interact with the selected content.
- Electronic display 116 is in electronic communication with processor 112 which causes visual indicia to be displayed on electronic display 116 .
- processor 112 may execute a web browser 200 stored in memory 114 of client 102 , to display indicia of content received by client 102 via network 106 .
- another application executed by client 102 may incorporate some or all of the functionality described with regard to web browser 200 (e.g., a video game, a chat application, etc.).
- Web browser 200 may operate by receiving input of a universal resource locator (URL) via a field 202 from an input device (e.g., a pointing device, a keyboard, a touch screen, etc.). For example, the URL, http://www.example.org/weather.html, may be entered into field 202 .
- Processor 112 may use the inputted URL to request data from a content source having a network address that corresponds to the entered URL.
- the content source may return webpage data and/or other data to client 102 .
- Web browser 200 may analyze the returned data and cause visual indicia to be displayed by electronic display 116 based on the data.
- webpage data may include text, hyperlinks, layout information, and other data that may be used to provide the framework for the visual layout of webpage 206 .
- webpage data may be one or more files of webpage code written in a markup language, such as the hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible HTML (XHTML), extensible markup language (XML), or any other markup language.
- the webpage data in FIG. 2 may include a file, “weather.html” provided by the website, “www.example.org.”
- the webpage data may include data that specifies where indicia appear on webpage 206 , such as text 208 .
- the webpage data may also include additional URL information used by web browser 200 to retrieve additional indicia displayed on webpage 206 .
- the file, “weather.html,” may also include one or more instructions used by processor 112 to retrieve images 210 - 216 from their respective content sources.
- Web browser 200 may include a number of navigational controls associated with webpage 206 .
- web browser 200 may be configured to navigate forward and backwards between webpages in response to receiving commands via inputs 204 (e.g., a back button, a forward button, etc.).
- Web browser 200 may also include one or more scroll bars 220 , which can be used to display parts of webpage 206 that are currently off-screen.
- webpage 206 may be formatted to be larger than the screen of electronic display 116 . In such a case, the one or more scroll bars 220 may be used to change the vertical and/or horizontal position of webpage 206 on electronic display 116 .
- Webpage 206 may be devoted to one or more topics.
- webpage 206 may be devoted to the local weather forecast for Freeport, Me.
- a content selection server such as content selection server 104
- content selection server 104 may analyze text 208 and/or images 210 - 216 to identify webpage 206 as being devoted to weather forecasts.
- webpage data for webpage 206 may include metadata that identifies a topic.
- content selection server 104 may select some or all of the content presented on webpage 206 .
- content selection server 104 may select advertisement 218 to be included on webpage 206 , based on a user identifier associated with client 102 .
- one or more content tags may be embedded into the code of webpage 206 that defines a content field located at the position of advertisement 218 .
- Another content tag may cause web browser 200 to request additional content from content selection server 104 , when webpage 206 is loaded.
- Such a request may include one or more keywords, a client identifier for client 102 , or other data used by content selection server 104 to select content to be provided to client 102 .
- content selection server 104 may select advertisement 218 .
- Advertisement 218 may be selected based in part on an interest category identified by analyzing history data associated with a client identifier for client 102 . For example, assume that the user of web browser 200 researched various makes and models of automobiles. Data regarding the research may be analyzed by content selection server 104 to identify automobiles as a potential interest category. Advertisers for automobiles may then compete in an auction to determine which advertiser is able to provide an advertisement to client 102 . Thus, advertisement 218 may be provided on webpage 206 based on a potential interest of the user of client 102 (e.g., automobiles), without regard to the actual topic of webpage 206 (e.g., a weather forecast).
- a potential interest of the user of client 102 e.g., automobiles
- the actual topic of webpage 206 e.g., a weather forecast
- advertisement 218 may also be selected based in part on one or more likelihood values generated by analyzing history data. For example, advertisement 218 may be selected based on a likelihood value indicative of the likelihood that the user of client 102 will click on advertisement 218 and/or make a purchase from the advertiser.
- the one or more likelihood values may be used to generate bids on behalf of auction participants. For example, assume that a likelihood value indicates a high likelihood that the user of client 102 will click on advertisement 218 (e.g., to be redirected to the advertiser's website). In such a case, the bid generated on behalf of the advertiser may be generated such that the advertiser is the winner of the auction and advertisement 218 is selected by content selection server 104 .
- content selection server 104 may provide advertisement 218 directly to client 102 .

- event data indicative of events such as webpage visits (e.g., which webpages were visited, whether one webpage referred the client to another webpage, etc.), content interactions (e.g., how long a user reviewed a video or audio file, whether a user clicked on a displayed advertisement, etc.),
- the history data may be received by a client device and/or by one or more content sources.
- a client device may provide history data to a content selection server.
- a content source may provide the history data to the content selection server.
- the history data may be received from a local memory of the content selection server (i.e., the content selection server may retrieve stored history data from memory).
- Process 400 includes analyzing the history data to identify content presentations (block 404 ).
- content presentations refer to events corresponding to a client device presenting online content to a user.
- a content presentation may correspond to a user being presented with a requested webpage devoted to the local webpage.
- content presentations may correspond to content selected by a content selection server.
- the history data may be analyzed to identify the number of times an advertisement was provided to the client and/or the number of times an advertisement regarding a certain topic was presented by the client device.

- Process 400 includes analyzing the history data to identify content interactions (block 406 ).
- content interactions refer to events corresponding to a user reacting to content presentations.
- Content interactions may include, but are not limited to, data indicative of the user performing a search in response to being presented content (e.g., the user is shown an advertisement for a new automobile and uses a search engine to find out more information about the advertised vehicle), clicking on presented content (e.g., playing a video or audio file, clicking on a displayed advertisement, etc.), or performing an action on a hotlinked webpage (e.g., adding a product to a shopping cart on an advertiser's website, making a purchase at the advertiser's website, etc.).
- content interactions may be divided by topical categories, in some implementations.
- the history data may be analyzed to determine how many times a presented advertisement for golf clubs was clicked by the user.
- Process 400 includes determining the likelihood of an event occurring regarding content (block 408 ).
- a behavioral model may be constructed using the identified content presentations and content interactions. Such a behavioral model may be used to generate one or more likelihood values indicative of the likelihood of an event occurring. For example, previous content presentations and content interactions regarding golf-related advertisements may be analyzed to determine the likelihood of the user clicking on a future golf-related advertisement.
- the likelihood value may correspond to a general event, such as the user interacting with any content selected by the content selection server.
- a behavioral model may be trained using history data for a plurality of other user identifiers. For example, how other users having similar interests interact with presented content may be analyzed to train such a model.
- logistic regression may be used to generate a likelihood value.
- a logistic regression function may be defined as follows:
- f(z) represents the probability of an outcome, given a set of factors represented by z.
- the value of z may be determined as follows:
- one or more values of x i may be based on identified content presentations and content interactions for a user identifier.
- x i may correspond to the number of times a user interacted with content regarding a particular topic and ⁇ i may correspond to a determined strength of the user's interest in the topic (e.g., based on the number of visits to webpages regarding the topic, based on a posted comment regarding the topic, based on a rating regarding the topic, etc.).
- Additional characteristics that may affect the probability outcome may include a topic of the content itself (e.g., one or more words in the content, an image in the content, etc.) and/or characteristics of the webpage with which the content is to be provided. For example, there may be a higher likelihood that a user interested in golf will click on a golf-related advertisement. However, the actual likelihood may vary, depending on the webpage with which the advertisement is provided (e.g., the user may be more likely to click on the advertisement if the webpage is also related to golf than if the webpage is unrelated to golf). Thus, some of the x i values used in the logistic regression may relate to the content itself and/or the webpage with which the content is to be presented.
- f(z) may be used as a likelihood value or the likelihood value may be based on f(z).
- the likelihood value may be the probability of a user clicking on a presented advertisement and making a purchase on the advertiser's website.
- other models may be used, such as na ⁇ ve Bayesian, linear regression, etc., to generate a likelihood value indicative of an event occurring regarding content.
- Process 400 includes providing content to a client device based in part on the determined likelihood value (block 410 ).
- Content may be selected according to various degrees of specificity regarding a particular topic and/or event. For example, a golf-related advertisement may be provided based on a user identifier being associated with the interest category of golf and having a high likelihood that the user will click on the advertisement. In another example, the golf-related advertisement may be provided based on the user identifier being associated with the interest category of sports. Similarly, the golf-related advertisement may be provided based on the likelihood that the user will click on any presented advertisement.
- an auction may be conducted to determine which content is to be provided. In such a case, the likelihood value may be used to generate one or more bids in the auction. For example, an advertiser may have a higher bid if the user is more likely to click on an advertisement and make a purchase.

Abstract
Systems and methods for providing online content include determining the likelihood of an online event occurring regarding the content. A likelihood value may be generated by analyzing history data indicative of one or more online events to identify content presentations and content interactions. Content presentations and content interactions may be grouped by topical category, in some implementations.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to providing online content. The present disclosure more specifically relates to dynamically providing content based on its potential relevance to a user.
- Online content may be available regarding any number of disparate topics. For example, a first website on the Internet may be devoted to the migratory habits of barn swallows and a second website may be devoted to automotive repair. In many cases, a user must proactively seek out online content of interest to the user. For example, an Internet user may utilize a search engine to search for webpages devoted to automotive repair. The user may then navigate between the webpages in the search results until the user finds the webpage that most closely matches the user's interests. To help simplify a user's browsing experience regarding a return visit to a webpage of interest, many web browsers now include the ability to bookmark webpages. For example, a user may bookmark a webpage devoted to replacing a valve cover gasket in an engine for later review. The user can then select the bookmark to go directly to the webpage, instead of having to repeat the search for the corresponding webpage of interest.
- Implementations of the systems and methods for providing online content are described herein. One implementation is a computerized method for providing online content. The method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, history data associated with a client identifier, the history data being indicative of one or more online events. The method also includes analyzing the history data to determine a number of times content regarding a category of subject matter was presented at a computing device corresponding to the client identifier. The method further includes analyzing the history data to determine a number of times the content regarding the category of subject matter was clicked at the computing device. The method additionally includes determining, by the processing circuit, a likelihood value that is based in part on the number of times the content was presented and is based in part on the number of times the content was clicked, the likelihood value representing a likelihood of a user of the computing device performing an action in response to being presented with an advertisement related to the category of the subject matter. The method further includes providing the advertisement for display at the computing device based in part on the likelihood value.
- Another implementation is a system for providing online content. The system includes a processing circuit operable to receive history data associated with a client identifier, the history data being indicative of one or more online events. The processing circuit is also operable to analyze the history data to determine a number of times content regarding a category of subject matter was presented at a computing device corresponding to the client identifier. The processing circuit is additionally operable to analyze the history data to determine a number of times the content regarding the category of subject matter was clicked at the computing device. The processing circuit is further operable to determine a likelihood value that is based in part on the number of times the content was presented and is based in part on the number of times the content was clicked, the likelihood value representing a likelihood of a user of the computing device performing an action in response to being presented with an advertisement related to the category of the subject matter. The processing circuit is also operable to provide the advertisement for display at the computing device based in part on the likelihood value.
- A further implementation is computer-readable storage medium having machine instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations. The operations include receiving history data associated with a client identifier, the history data being indicative of one or more online events. The operations also include analyzing the history data to determine a number of times content regarding a category of subject matter was presented at a computing device corresponding to the client identifier. The operations further include analyzing the history data to determine a number of times the content regarding the category of subject matter was clicked at the computing device. The operations additionally include determining a likelihood value that is based in part on the number of times the content was presented and is based in part on the number of times the content was clicked, the likelihood value representing a likelihood of a user of the computing device performing an action in response to being presented with an advertisement related to the category of the subject matter. The operations yet further include providing the advertisement for display at the computing device based in part on the likelihood value.
- These implementations are mentioned not to limit or define the scope of this disclosure, but to provide examples of implementations to aid in understanding thereof.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims, in which:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation; -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of an electronic display showing an example webpage; -
FIG. 3 is an example illustration of content being included with a webpage by a content selection server; and -
FIG. 4 is an example flow diagram of a process for providing online content. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- According to some aspects of the present disclosure, online content may be dynamically selected for a user based the user's potential interest in the content. Thus, a user may be provided content of interest without the user having to proactively locate the content. In some implementations, a user may opt in to allowing a content selection service to analyze history data indicative of online actions performed by the user. Such a service may be configured to select content of relevance to the user by identifying online actions performed by the user. For example, which types of content were requested by the user and how the user interacted with the content may be analyzed to determine potential interests of the user. In some implementations, the user's interactions with content selected by the content selection service may be analyzed to predict whether the user will be interested in other content. In other words, the user's reaction to content selected by the service may be used as feedback to adjust how the service selects content for the user.
- A user may opt in or out of allowing a content selection service to store and use data regarding online actions performed by the user. Moreover, the user may be represented in the service as a randomized user identifier (e.g., a cookie, a device serial number, etc.) that contains no personally-identifiable information about the user. For example, information relating to the user's name and/or demographics (e.g., the user's education level, profession, age, gender, race, marital status, income, etc.), may not be used by the content selection service to select relevant content for the user, unless the user has opted in to allowing the service to use such information. A user identifier may be related to, or may itself be, a client identifier that identifies the user's device to the content selection service (e.g., a cookie set on the device, an IP address of the device, etc.). In some implementations, a user identifier may be associated with multiple client identifiers. For example, a user identifier may be associated with a client identifier for the user's mobile telephone and a second client identifier for the user's home computer.
- A content selection service may provide selected content in conjunction with other online content requested by a user. For example, a content selection service may relate a user identifier with an interest category of golf. Such an interest category may then be used by the content selection service to provide golf-related content to a device associated with the user identifier, when the device requests a webpage. In some implementations, content selected by the content selection service may be interactive (e.g., a playable video or audio file, a hotlinked image that redirects the user's browser to another webpage, etc.). In such a case, interactive content may be used to suggest additional content for review by the user. For example, a content selection service may select an image of a fisherman that is hotlinked to a webpage devoted to reviews of fishing equipment. If the user wishes to receive additional content related to fishing, the user may then click on the image. In some implementations, a topic of content selected by the content selection service may not be related to the topic of the webpage being visited by the user. For example, a user interested in fishing may be presented with a hotlinked image relating to fishing while visiting a webpage devoted to cooking recipes. If the user wishes to see more content related to fishing, he may click on the hotlinked image to be redirected to a fishing-related webpage.
- In various implementations, a content selection service may calculate a value representing the likelihood of an event occurring regarding presented content. In some cases, an online event may correspond to one or more actions performed by the user in response to being presented certain content. For example, an online event may correspond to searching for a particular topic, navigating to a webpage having that topic, following a hotlink of content selected by the service (e.g., by clicking or otherwise selecting the content via a user interface, such as a mouse or touch screen display), the user performing an action on a hotlinked webpage (e.g., downloading an application, making a purchase of a good or service, etc.), and the user performing a search for additional information regarding content selected by the service. The content selection service may analyze history data indicative of one or more previous online events to calculate a likelihood value.
- A content selection service may use a calculated likelihood value to select and provide content. For example, webpages visited by a user and/or searches conducted by the user may be analyzed by the service to determine one or more interests of the user. In addition, the service may analyze online actions performed regarding content previously selected by the service. For example, assume that a user was identified as being interested in golf, based on a number of visits to golf-related webpages by the user. The content selection service may then select and provide golf-related content to a device of the user. The service may analyze how the user reacts to such content to determine the likelihood that the user will interact with future golf-related content. Thus, the content selection service may receive and analyze feedback after selecting content, to potentially adjust which content is provided to the user by the service.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation is shown.System 100 includes aclient 102 which communicates with other computing devices via anetwork 106.Client 102 may execute a web browser or other application (e.g., a video game, a channel guide for streaming content, a media player, etc.) to retrieve content from other devices overnetwork 106.

Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information betweenclient 102,content sources content selection server 104. For example,network 106 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks.Network 106 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data withinnetwork 106.Network 106 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example,client 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices innetwork 106. -
Client 102 may be any number of different types of user electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, combinations thereof, etc.).Client 102 is shown to include aprocessor 112 and amemory 114, i.e., a processing circuit.Memory 114 may store machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112cause processor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, HTML, XML, Python and Visual Basic. -
Client 102 may include one or more user interface devices. A user interface device may be any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a monitor connected toclient 102, a speaker connected toclient 102, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client 102 may include anelectronic display 116, which displays webpages and other data received fromcontent sources content selection server 104. In various implementations,electronic display 116 may be located inside or outside of the same housing as that ofprocessor 112 and/ormemory 114. For example,electronic display 116 may be an external display, such as a computer monitor, television set, or any other stand-alone form of electronic display. In other examples,electronic display 116 may be integrated into the housing of a laptop computer, mobile device, or other form of computing device having an integrated display. -
Content sources client 102. For example,content sources client 102,content sources circuits comprising processors memories processors content source 108 may include instructions such as web server software, FTP serving software, and other types of software that causecontent source 108 to provide content vianetwork 106. - According to various implementations,
content sources client 102 that includes one or more content tags. In general, a content tag may be any piece of webpage code associated with the action of including content with a webpage. According to various implementations, a content tag may define a slot on a webpage for additional content, a slot for out of page content (e.g., an interstitial slot), whether content should be loaded asynchronously or synchronously, whether the loading of content should be disabled on the webpage, whether content that loaded unsuccessfully should be refreshed, the network location of a content source that provides the content (e.g.,content sources content selection server 104, etc.), a network location (e.g., a URL) associated with clicking on the content, how the content is to be rendered on a display, one or more keywords used to retrieve the content, and other functions associated with providing additional content with a webpage. For example,content source 108 may provide webpage data that causesclient 102 to retrieve content fromcontent selection server 104. In another implementation, content may be selected bycontent selection server 104 and provided bycontent source 108 as part of the webpage data sent toclient 102. - Similar to
content sources content selection server 104 may be one or more electronic devices connected to network 106 that selects content to be provided toclient 102 based on a predicted relevancy to the user ofclient 102.Content selection server 104 may be a computer server (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or a combination of servers (e.g., a data center, a cloud computing platform, etc.).Content selection server 104 may include a processing circuit including aprocessor 120 and amemory 122 that stores program instructions executable byprocessor 120. In cases in whichcontent selection server 104 is a combination of computing devices,processor 120 may represent the collective processors of the devices andmemory 122 may represent the collective memories of the devices. The processing circuit ofcontent selection server 104 may be configured to conduct an auction to select content to be provided toclient 102. For example,content selection server 104 may select content, such as an advertisement, to be provided with a webpage served bycontent source - In some implementations,
content selection server 104 may be configured to select content based on a user identifier associated withclient 102. In general, a user identifier refers to any form of data that may be used to represent a user that has opted in to receiving content selected bycontent selection server 104. In some implementations, a user identifier may be associated with a client identifier that identifies a client device tocontent selection server 104 or may itself be the client identifier. In some implementations, a user identifier may be associated with multiple client identifiers (e.g., a client identifier for a mobile device, a client identifier for a home computer, etc.). Client identifiers may include, but are not limited to, cookies, device serial numbers, user profile data, telephone numbers, or network addresses. For example, a cookie set onclient 102 may be used to identifyclient 102 tocontent selection server 104. -
Content selection server 104 may use information associated with a user identifier to select relevant content for the represented user, if the user has opted in to the functionality ofcontent selection server 104. For example,content selection server 104 may analyze history data associated with a user identifier to determine one or more potential interest categories for the user identifier. History data may be any data associated with a user identifier that is indicative of an online event (e.g., visiting a webpage, interacting with presented content, conducting a search, making a purchase, downloading content, etc.).Content selection server 104 may select content to be provided in conjunction with other content by client 102 (e.g., as part of a displayed webpage, as a pop-up, within a video game, within another type of application, etc.). - In various implementations,
content selection server 104 may receive history data indicative of one or more online events associated with a user identifier. In implementations in which a content tag causesclient 102 to request content fromcontent selection server 104, such a request may include a client identifier forclient 102 and/or additional information (e.g., the webpage being loaded, the referring webpage, etc.).Content selection server 104 may store such data to record a history of online events associated with a user identifier. In some cases,client 102 may provide history data tocontent selection server 104 without first executing a content tag. For example,client 102 may periodically send history data tocontent selection server 104 or may do so in response to receiving a command from a user interface device. In some implementations,content selection server 104 may receive history data fromcontent sources content source 108 may store history data regarding web transactions withclient 102 and provide the history data tocontent selection server 104. -
Content selection server 104 may generate a likelihood value by analyzing history data for a user identifier. In various implementations, the likelihood value may represent the likelihood of an online event occurring, should certain content be provided to a device associated with the user identifier. For example, the likelihood value may represent the likelihood that the user ofclient 102 will click on a content selected bycontent selection server 104. In some implementations, the likelihood value may be a probability of the online event occurring. For example, a likelihood value of 0.30 may represent a 30% chance that a user will click on an image selected bycontent selection server 104. In various implementations, identified characteristics of the history data may be used with a machine learning model to generate the likelihood value. For example, a Bayesian network, neural network, regression model, logistics regression model, or similar form of machine learning model may be used to generate a likelihood value. In other implementations, a value indicative of how unlikely an event is to occur may be used instead of a likelihood value (e.g., there may be a 70% chance that a user will not click on an image selected by content selection server 104). - A likelihood value may be generated based in part on one or more identified interest categories for a user identifier (e.g., a theme or topic of received content). In some cases,
content selection server 104 may analyze history data for the user identifier to identify one or more interest categories and online events relating to the interest categories. For example, a user interested in philately may perform a number of searches for “stamps,” “stamp collecting,” and “stamp preservation.” In such a case, history data associated with the user's identifier may be analyzed bycontent selection server 104 to identify philately as a potential interest category.Content selection server 104 may also identify the strength of the interest, in some cases. For example, ten visits per day to philately-related webpages may indicate a stronger interest than only two visits per day. Thus, a user having a strong interest in philately may have a higher likelihood of selecting a hotlinked image of a stamp than a user that has only a weak interest in the hobby. - A likelihood value may also be generated based in part on one or more online events indicated by the history data. For example,
content selection server 104 may identify the number of times content was selected bycontent selection server 104 and provided to a device associated with a particular user identifier. In some cases, the number of times the content was presented may be subdivided by a theme, topic, category, etc., of the content. For example,content selection server 104 may analyze the history data to identify that golf-related content was provided five times toclient 102.Content selection server 104 may also analyze the history data to identify the number of times a particular online event occurred regarding an identified topic (i.e., by analyzing how the user responds to certain topics). In some implementations,content selection server 104 may analyze the history data to identify content interactions. For example,content selection server 104 may analyze the history data to determine that the user ofclient 102 clicked on the golf-related content selected bycontent selection server 104 twice out of the five times that the content was presented. Such a metric may be used as part of the machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a certain event occurring, should additional golf-related content be selected bycontent selection server 104 forclient 102. - In various implementations,
content selection server 104 may be configured to allow different content providers to compete for the ability to havecontent selection server 104 select their content. For example, an online retailer may utilizecontent selection server 104 to place an advertisement on a webpage served bycontent source 108. In another example, a non-profit organization may utilizecontent selection server 104 to place a public service announcement within an application running on client 102 (e.g., within a running video game). Competition may be based, for example, among content providers that provide content having a topic that matches an interest category identified for a user identifier. For example, online retailers of tennis rackets may compete for the ability to provide an advertisement based on a user identifier being associated with the interest category of tennis. - In some implementations,
content selection server 104 may be configured to conduct an auction to select from which content provider the content is to be provided. In some cases, content providers wishing to provide content to certain users may place bids in an auction. The auction may be conducted bycontent selection server 104 in real-time (e.g., in response to receiving a content selection request from client 102), or beforehand. In some implementations,content selection server 104 may automatically select the participants for the auction and/or determine bids for the participants. For example, assume that a user identifier is associated with the interest categories of golf, philately, and skydiving. In response to receiving a content selection request,content selection server 104 may select auction participants among those content providers that identified golf, philately, or skydiving as a topic of their content.Content selection server 104 may also use one or more determined likelihood values to determine a bid for an auction participant. For example,content selection server 104 may generate a bid on behalf of an advertiser of golf clubs based in part on the likelihood that the user receiving the advertisement will click on the advertisement and/or make a purchase on the advertiser's website. Thus, bids may differ for users having equal interests in a topic, based on the likelihood that a user will interact with the selected content. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an illustration is shown ofelectronic display 116 displaying anexample webpage 206.Electronic display 116 is in electronic communication withprocessor 112 which causes visual indicia to be displayed onelectronic display 116. As shown,processor 112 may execute aweb browser 200 stored inmemory 114 ofclient 102, to display indicia of content received byclient 102 vianetwork 106. In other implementations, another application executed byclient 102 may incorporate some or all of the functionality described with regard to web browser 200 (e.g., a video game, a chat application, etc.). -
Web browser 200 may operate by receiving input of a universal resource locator (URL) via afield 202 from an input device (e.g., a pointing device, a keyboard, a touch screen, etc.). For example, the URL, http://www.example.org/weather.html, may be entered intofield 202.Processor 112 may use the inputted URL to request data from a content source having a network address that corresponds to the entered URL. In response to the request, the content source may return webpage data and/or other data toclient 102.Web browser 200 may analyze the returned data and cause visual indicia to be displayed byelectronic display 116 based on the data. - In general, webpage data may include text, hyperlinks, layout information, and other data that may be used to provide the framework for the visual layout of
webpage 206. In some implementations, webpage data may be one or more files of webpage code written in a markup language, such as the hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible HTML (XHTML), extensible markup language (XML), or any other markup language. For example, the webpage data inFIG. 2 may include a file, “weather.html” provided by the website, “www.example.org.” The webpage data may include data that specifies where indicia appear onwebpage 206, such astext 208. In some implementations, the webpage data may also include additional URL information used byweb browser 200 to retrieve additional indicia displayed onwebpage 206. For example, the file, “weather.html,” may also include one or more instructions used byprocessor 112 to retrieve images 210-216 from their respective content sources. -
Web browser 200 may include a number of navigational controls associated withwebpage 206. For example,web browser 200 may be configured to navigate forward and backwards between webpages in response to receiving commands via inputs 204 (e.g., a back button, a forward button, etc.).Web browser 200 may also include one ormore scroll bars 220, which can be used to display parts ofwebpage 206 that are currently off-screen. For example,webpage 206 may be formatted to be larger than the screen ofelectronic display 116. In such a case, the one ormore scroll bars 220 may be used to change the vertical and/or horizontal position ofwebpage 206 onelectronic display 116. -
Webpage 206 may be devoted to one or more topics. For example,webpage 206 may be devoted to the local weather forecast for Freeport, Me. In some implementations, a content selection server, such ascontent selection server 104, may analyze the contents ofwebpage 206 to identify one or more topics. For example,content selection server 104 may analyzetext 208 and/or images 210-216 to identifywebpage 206 as being devoted to weather forecasts. In some implementations, webpage data forwebpage 206 may include metadata that identifies a topic. - In various implementations,
content selection server 104 may select some or all of the content presented onwebpage 206. For example,content selection server 104 may selectadvertisement 218 to be included onwebpage 206, based on a user identifier associated withclient 102. In some implementations, one or more content tags may be embedded into the code ofwebpage 206 that defines a content field located at the position ofadvertisement 218. Another content tag may causeweb browser 200 to request additional content fromcontent selection server 104, whenwebpage 206 is loaded. Such a request may include one or more keywords, a client identifier forclient 102, or other data used bycontent selection server 104 to select content to be provided toclient 102. In response,content selection server 104 may selectadvertisement 218. -
Advertisement 218 may be selected based in part on an interest category identified by analyzing history data associated with a client identifier forclient 102. For example, assume that the user ofweb browser 200 researched various makes and models of automobiles. Data regarding the research may be analyzed bycontent selection server 104 to identify automobiles as a potential interest category. Advertisers for automobiles may then compete in an auction to determine which advertiser is able to provide an advertisement toclient 102. Thus,advertisement 218 may be provided onwebpage 206 based on a potential interest of the user of client 102 (e.g., automobiles), without regard to the actual topic of webpage 206 (e.g., a weather forecast). - In some implementations,
advertisement 218 may also be selected based in part on one or more likelihood values generated by analyzing history data. For example,advertisement 218 may be selected based on a likelihood value indicative of the likelihood that the user ofclient 102 will click onadvertisement 218 and/or make a purchase from the advertiser. In implementations in which an auction is conducted bycontent selection server 104, the one or more likelihood values may be used to generate bids on behalf of auction participants. For example, assume that a likelihood value indicates a high likelihood that the user ofclient 102 will click on advertisement 218 (e.g., to be redirected to the advertiser's website). In such a case, the bid generated on behalf of the advertiser may be generated such that the advertiser is the winner of the auction andadvertisement 218 is selected bycontent selection server 104. - In some implementations,
content selection server 104 may provideadvertisement 218 directly toclient 102. In other implementations,content selection server 104 may send a command toclient 102 that causesclient 102 to retrieveadvertisement 218. For example, the command may causeclient 102 to retrieveadvertisement 218 from a local memory, ifadvertisement 218 is already stored inmemory 114, or from a networked content source. In this way, any number of different pieces of content may be placed in the location ofadvertisement 218 onwebpage 206. In other words, one user that visitswebpage 206 may be presented withadvertisement 218 and a second user that visitswebpage 206 may be presented with different content. Other forms of content (e.g., an image, text, an audio file, a video file, etc.) may be selected bycontent selection server 104 for display withwebpage 206 in a manner similar to that ofadvertisement 218. In further implementations, content selected bycontent selection server 104 may be displayed outside ofwebpage 206. For example, content selected bycontent selection server 104 may be displayed in a separate window or tab ofweb browser 200, may be presented via another software application (e.g., a text editor, a media player, etc.), or may be downloaded toclient 102 for later use. -
FIG. 3 is an example illustration ofcontent 312 being selected bycontent selection server 104. As shown,client 102 may send awebpage request 302 to a content source vianetwork 106, such ascontent source 108. For example,webpage request 302 may be a request that conforms to the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), such as the following: -
GET /weather.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.org - Such a request may include the name of the file to be retrieved, weather.html, as well as the network location of the file, www.example.org. In some cases, a network location may be an IP address or may be a domain name that resolves to an IP address of
content source 108. In some implementations, a client identifier, such as a cookie associated withcontent source 108, may be included withwebpage request 302 to identifyclient 102 tocontent source 108. - In response to receiving
webpage request 302,content source 108 may returnwebpage data 304, such as the requested file, “weather.html.”Webpage data 304 may be configured to causeclient 102 to display a webpage onelectronic display 116 when opened by a web browser application. In some cases,webpage data 304 may include code that causesclient 102 to request additional files to be used as part of the displayed webpage. For example,webpage data 304 may include an HTML image tag of the form: - <img src=“Monday_forecast.jpg”>
- Such code may cause
client 102 to request the image file “Monday_forecast.jpg,” fromcontent source 108. - In some implementations,
webpage data 304 may includecontent tag 306 configured to causeclient 102 to retrieve an advertisement fromcontent selection server 104. In some cases,content tag 306 may be an HTML image tag that includes the network location ofcontent selection server 104. In other cases,content tag 306 may be implemented using a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript. For example,content tag 306 may be of the form: -
<script type= ‘text/javascript’> AdNetwork_RetrieveAd(“argument”) </script>
where AdNetwork RetrieveAd is a script function that causesclient 102 to send acontent request 308 tocontent selection server 104. In various implementations, the argument of the script function may include the network address ofcontent selection server 104, the referring webpage, and/or additional information that may be used bycontent selection server 104 to select content to be included with the webpage. -
Content request 308 may include aclient identifier 310, used bycontent selection server 104 to identifyclient 102. In various implementations,client identifier 310 may be an HTTP cookie previously set bycontent selection server 104 onclient 102, the IP address ofclient 102, a unique device serial forclient 102, other forms of identification information, or combinations thereof. For example,content selection server 104 may set a cookie that includes a unique string of characters onclient 102 when content is first requested byclient 102 fromcontent selection server 104. Such a cookie may be included in subsequent content requests sent tocontent selection server 104 byclient 102. - In some implementations,
client identifier 310 may be used bycontent selection server 104 to store history data forclient 102, with the permission of the user ofclient 102. For example,content request 308 may include data relating to which webpage was requested byclient 102, when the webpage was requested, and/or other history data. Wheneverclient 102 visits a webpage that allowscontent selection server 104 to select content to appear in conjunction with the webpage,content selection server 104 may receive and store history data forclient 102. In this way,content selection server 104 is able to reconstruct the online history ofclient 102 regarding webpages that utilizecontent selection server 104. In some implementations,content selection server 104 may also receive history data forclient 102 from content sources that do not use its content selection services. For example, a website that does not use content selected bycontent selection server 104 may nonetheless provide information aboutclient 102 visiting the website tocontent selection server 104, if the user has opted in to receiving relevant content selected bycontent selection server 104. - In some cases,
client identifier 310 may be sent tocontent selection server 104 when a particular online event occurs. For example,webpage data 304 may include a tag that causesclient 102 to sendclient identifier 310 tocontent selection server 104 when a displayed advertisement is clicked by the user ofclient 102.Client identifier 310 may also be used to record information afterclient 102 is redirected to another webpage. For example,client 102 may be redirected to an advertiser's website if the user selects a displayed advertisement. In such a case,client identifier 310 may also be used to record which actions were performed on the advertiser's website. For example,client identifier 310 may be sent tocontent selection server 104 as the user ofclient 102 navigates within the advertiser's website. In this way, data regarding whether the user searched for a product, added a product to a shopping cart, completed a purchase on the advertiser's website, etc., may also be recorded bycontent selection server 104. -
Content selection server 104 may analyze history data associated withclient identifier 310 to identify one or more interest categories and to model the behavior of the user ofclient 102. In various implementationscontent selection server 104 may utilize a machine learning model, such as a logistic regression model, to generate one or more likelihood values (e.g., the likelihood one or more events occurring). For example,content selection server 104 may generate a likelihood value indicative of the likelihood that the user ofclient 102 will click on a particular type of advertisement (e.g., a predicted click through rate), if selected bycontent selection server 104. In some implementations,content selection server 104 may conduct an auction in response to receivingcontent request 308. Bids in the auction may be based in part on a likelihood value, in some implementations. For example, a bid on behalf of an advertiser may be higher or lower based in part on how likely the user ofclient 102 is to interact with an advertisement from the advertiser.Content selection server 104 may use the results of the auction to selectcontent 312 from the winner and providecontent 312 toclient 102. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , an illustration is shown of anexample process 400 for providing online content.Process 400 may be implemented by one or more computing devices to select content that may be of interest to a user. For example,process 400 may be implemented bycontent selection server 104, shown inFIG. 1 . In various implementations, a user may opt in to receiving content selected for the user viaprocess 400. For example, a user may opt in to allowing history data to be stored regarding the user's online history (e.g., information regarding the websites visited by the user, whether the user interacted with certain content, etc.). -
Process 400 includes receiving history data (block 402). In various implementations, the history data may be associated with a user identifier and/or a client identifier. For example, a cookie may be associated with the history data to represent a client device operated by a user. The history data may include, but is not limited to, event data indicative of events such as webpage visits (e.g., which webpages were visited, whether one webpage referred the client to another webpage, etc.), content interactions (e.g., how long a user reviewed a video or audio file, whether a user clicked on a displayed advertisement, etc.), and events regarding a retailer's webpage (e.g., whether the user searched for a good or service, whether the user completed a purchase, etc.). The history data may be received by a client device and/or by one or more content sources. For example, a client device may provide history data to a content selection server. In another example, a content source may provide the history data to the content selection server. In some implementations, the history data may be received from a local memory of the content selection server (i.e., the content selection server may retrieve stored history data from memory). -
Process 400 includes analyzing the history data to identify content presentations (block 404). In general, content presentations refer to events corresponding to a client device presenting online content to a user. For example, a content presentation may correspond to a user being presented with a requested webpage devoted to the local webpage. In some implementations, content presentations may correspond to content selected by a content selection server. For example, the history data may be analyzed to identify the number of times an advertisement was provided to the client and/or the number of times an advertisement regarding a certain topic was presented by the client device. In some implementations, the content presentations may be grouped by topical category. For example, the history data may be analyzed to identify the number of times an advertisement for golf clubs was presented to the client device. -
Process 400 includes analyzing the history data to identify content interactions (block 406). In general, content interactions refer to events corresponding to a user reacting to content presentations. Content interactions may include, but are not limited to, data indicative of the user performing a search in response to being presented content (e.g., the user is shown an advertisement for a new automobile and uses a search engine to find out more information about the advertised vehicle), clicking on presented content (e.g., playing a video or audio file, clicking on a displayed advertisement, etc.), or performing an action on a hotlinked webpage (e.g., adding a product to a shopping cart on an advertiser's website, making a purchase at the advertiser's website, etc.). Similar to content presentations, content interactions may be divided by topical categories, in some implementations. For example, the history data may be analyzed to determine how many times a presented advertisement for golf clubs was clicked by the user. -
Process 400 includes determining the likelihood of an event occurring regarding content (block 408). In various implementations, a behavioral model may be constructed using the identified content presentations and content interactions. Such a behavioral model may be used to generate one or more likelihood values indicative of the likelihood of an event occurring. For example, previous content presentations and content interactions regarding golf-related advertisements may be analyzed to determine the likelihood of the user clicking on a future golf-related advertisement. In some cases, the likelihood value may correspond to a general event, such as the user interacting with any content selected by the content selection server. In some implementations, a behavioral model may be trained using history data for a plurality of other user identifiers. For example, how other users having similar interests interact with presented content may be analyzed to train such a model. - In some implementations, logistic regression may be used to generate a likelihood value. In general, a logistic regression function may be defined as follows:
-
- where f(z) represents the probability of an outcome, given a set of factors represented by z. The value of z may be determined as follows:
-
z=β 0+β1 x 1+β2 x 2+ . . . +βk x k - where β0 is the y-axis intercept, xi is a characteristic affecting the probability outcome, and, βi is a regression coefficient (e.g., how much xi affects the outcome). According to some implementations, one or more values of xi may be based on identified content presentations and content interactions for a user identifier. In some cases, xi may correspond to the number of times a user interacted with content regarding a particular topic and βi may correspond to a determined strength of the user's interest in the topic (e.g., based on the number of visits to webpages regarding the topic, based on a posted comment regarding the topic, based on a rating regarding the topic, etc.). Additional characteristics that may affect the probability outcome may include a topic of the content itself (e.g., one or more words in the content, an image in the content, etc.) and/or characteristics of the webpage with which the content is to be provided. For example, there may be a higher likelihood that a user interested in golf will click on a golf-related advertisement. However, the actual likelihood may vary, depending on the webpage with which the advertisement is provided (e.g., the user may be more likely to click on the advertisement if the webpage is also related to golf than if the webpage is unrelated to golf). Thus, some of the xi values used in the logistic regression may relate to the content itself and/or the webpage with which the content is to be presented. In various implementations, f(z) may be used as a likelihood value or the likelihood value may be based on f(z). For example, the likelihood value may be the probability of a user clicking on a presented advertisement and making a purchase on the advertiser's website. In further implementations, other models may be used, such as naïve Bayesian, linear regression, etc., to generate a likelihood value indicative of an event occurring regarding content.
-
Process 400 includes providing content to a client device based in part on the determined likelihood value (block 410). Content may be selected according to various degrees of specificity regarding a particular topic and/or event. For example, a golf-related advertisement may be provided based on a user identifier being associated with the interest category of golf and having a high likelihood that the user will click on the advertisement. In another example, the golf-related advertisement may be provided based on the user identifier being associated with the interest category of sports. Similarly, the golf-related advertisement may be provided based on the likelihood that the user will click on any presented advertisement. In various implementations, an auction may be conducted to determine which content is to be provided. In such a case, the likelihood value may be used to generate one or more bids in the auction. For example, an advertiser may have a higher bid if the user is more likely to click on an advertisement and make a purchase. - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
