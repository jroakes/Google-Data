A2 starts, but can start from intention group 312-d1.In some implementations, intermediate intention group is (for example, as in present exemplary
Intention group 312-d1) startup may or may not be shown at user apparatus 108.
For example, it is assumed that user checks the Email from partner Jane Doe, and intention group 312-a2 is living
Dynamic.User may wish to arrange with the meeting of Jane, and therefore user says and " shows the calendar of sender to me." enable
Connector 325 can be the intention for starting calendar application " display " intention group, correspond to the intention group of calendar application 310d
312-d1.For intention group 312-d1, it is understood that there may be intended to " displaying $ Contact Calendar (contact person's calendar) ", wherein $
Contact is name of contact person.Herein, user specifies " sender ", it is resolved to the sender of email message
Jane Doe.This passes to the operation called by intention group 312-d1, such as " displaying Jane Doe calendars " as parameter value,
The example " calendar view " intention group 312-d3, and lead to the operation for showing the calendar of Jane Doe.If lacking parameter value,
It can then promote user apparatus 108 that user is prompted to input the value.
Therefore, by traversing the associated data, it is intended that processor 109 eliminates current in the specified application from activity of user
State is transformed into the demand of each intermediary operation needed for another state in activity application or another different application.
Being intended to registration table allows publisher's dynamic update intent data, and provides newer intent data to user apparatus.
