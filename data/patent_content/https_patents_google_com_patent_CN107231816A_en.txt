Embodiment
System can be by before the request that client device submits to data, by transmitting data to client device simultaneously
And the data are cached in client device, reduce the time delay that data are presented.However, the data volume that can be cached be typically smaller than it is available
Data volume.Therefore, system determines which data cached to different user so that can realize and provide the advantage that (example by data cached
Such as, faster user interface updating and/or with user interface real-time, interactive).The system can be based on user with the data are presented
User interface previous interaction, selection is supplied to the data of client device.If for example, user is more in special time period
Secondary requested specific data (for example, data in last week), the system can really be submitted in user and the data are asked
There is provided the specific data in that period before asking.If user submits the request to the data later, set in user
Standby place caches the data and for example from remote system the data must be asked to compare by network than client device, more
Obtain and present soon the data.It can also be set by remote system buffer additional data for being delivered to client more quickly
It is standby.
When user is accessed by the account of the system administration, the system can send for the data that are presented to user and
For the data cached at user equipment.For example, when account described in User logs in, the system, which can be provided, is included in instrument
The user interface of primary account view and the additional data cached at user equipment in plate.The instrument board can include account
General view, the general view of the account includes interacting with the previous of user interface provided by the system based on user, to described
The general introduction of the data of user's selection.It can also be interacted based on user with the previous of user interface provided by the system, selection is in
The mode of existing data.These user mutuals can include the particular user interface element (example that such as user checks, selects or interacted
Such as, control, display card etc.), user request or modification data type, and/or data dimension (for example, in special time
Section in or the data relevant with specific geographic position).Then, user can interact to check not with the user interface element of instrument board
With data or check that different types of data are presented., can be from the data acquisition of caching or from safeguarding the data as response
The appropriate data of system request.
The user's group that can be assigned based on user, data and/or be in client that selection is presented in primary account view
The data that caching is provided at end equipment.For example, particular group of users can ask similar type data and/or with similar type
User interface element is interacted.In particular example, the user with similar role but in different tissues can ask and look into
The data seen in the data and similar dimension of similar type.In some embodiments, can be based on by other use in described group
The action that family is performed, selects the data to giving user cache, even if when the given user is not carried out those actions.
Fig. 1 is the example context 100 that pre-cache system 110 provides the data for being cached at client device 130.In advance
Caching system 110 can there is provided from data storage device 115 in response to the request of data 140 that is received from client device 130

In one or many transmission of packet, the data 142 asked are sent to client device 130.Pre-cache system 110
It can also select and provide request of data 140 unsolicited additional data 144.For example, the user of client device 130 may not ask
Seek additional data 144.Additional data 144 can be buffered at client device 130 so that if user asks additional data
144, it can quickly provide additional data 144 and without submitting another request of data by network 120.For example, additional data 144
It can be stored in the cache 135 of client device 130.Cache 135 can include being arranged on client device 130
And store the high speed memory device of additional data 144.
In some embodiments, user of the pre-cache system 110 based on client device 130, selects additional data
144.For example, pre-cache system 110 can based on user with to user present data one or more user interfaces (for example,
The one or more user interfaces provided by pre-cache system 110) previous interaction, select additional data 144.Pre-cache system
110 are used for selecting the user mutual of additional data 144 can include the user interface element of such as user mutual (for example, control, aobvious
Show card, graph type etc.), the reality asked of the type (for example, keyword, performance metric, bid etc.) of data of user's request, user
Border data (for example, specific activities, special key words, specific content item etc.), the dimension of the data of user's request are (for example, specific
Period, specific geographic position, specific range of values etc.), user how long access once the account and/or user selection it is inclined
It is good.If pre- slow for example, user's previous user ession for telecommunication asks the impression data of the last week for certain content delivering activity
Impression data for the last week of specific activities can be provided for working as by deposit system 110 before user asks the data
The additional data of preceding user conversation.
In some embodiments, some request of data 140 can be common or impliedly request rather than to specific
The specific request of data.For example, pre-cache system 110 can generate and provide user interface, for example, instrument board, the instrument
Plate has the primary account view that Account Overview is provided in response to User logs in or the access account.It can be stepped in response to user
The account rather than the specific request to being included in the data in the general view are recorded, the general introduction of data is selected.Pre-cache
System 110 can also select and provide user and check the additional data that can be can request that after instrument board.
In some embodiments, pre-cache system 110 can also at pre-cache system 110 buffer additional data.With
This mode, pre-cache system can in response to specify additional data request of data, data are provided more quickly.Can with transmission
To the similar mode of additional data 144 of client device 130, the additional data is selected.For example, pre-cache system 110 can
To select additional data set for pre-cache.The subset of additional data can be sent to client device by pre-cache system 110
130 with the caching at client device.Pre-cache system 110 can also cache the additional data at pre-cache system 110
Subset.For example, pre-cache system 110 can recognize the data of user's most probable selection from additional data set and count that
According to being supplied to client device 130.The remaining data that the additional data is concentrated can be cached at pre-cache system 110.
Caching can reduce the time delay for serving data to client device 130 at pre-cache system 110, because in response to the data
Request, from data storage device 115 obtain data can spend the time and increase to for obtain the data calculating provide
The demand in source.

Performance numbering, diagram performance color, or highlighted different conditions activity between difference another visual effect.
In another example, user interface maker 229 can generate highlighted based on to the activity offer content item
The visualization of the difference of what day different same or like movable performance.For example, thermal map can be used to show the week
Different time movable relative performance.In another example, multiple activities can be based only upon the matching (example of key word type
Such as, accurate matching, wide in range matching etc.) it is different.In the example, user interface can be presented for each type of keyword
The movable performance of matching.
Fig. 3 is the screenshot capture 300 for the example user interface 310 that account data is presented.Example user interface 310 is included in
The primary account view of the account shown in instrument board for the account.For example, based in the previous of user's access account
Interacting for user and user interface is given during user conversation, for given user's generation primary account view.
User interface 310 includes menu 320 and display card collection 330.Menu 310, which can provide user, can select its to check
He shows the list of card.User interface 310 can also provide the data list that user can select to check.In response to menu 320
In item selection, user interface 310 can make the selected display card or selected of the client device requests at presentation user interface 310
Select data.For example, client device can access client equipment first caching to determine that data selected (or will be selected
Select the data presented in display card) whether store in the buffer.If it is, client device can from caching obtain data and
Data are presented in user interface 310.If data are not stored in caching, client device can from remote system (such as Fig. 2's
Account management system 210) request data.
Certain types of data can be presented in a specific way for each display card.For example, performance data is presented in display card 331
(for example, convert number, click on number and number of flashing) and the cost data for activity.Display card 331 is with numeric format
The data are presented and also include the line chart of presentation performance and/or a part for cost data.
Display card 333 is presented for some movable performances and cost data in table form.Similarly, display card
337 are presented the performance and cost data for being used to some keywords for distributing content item in table form.Another display
Performance and the bar shaped of cost data that diagram is used to the different types of equipment of the content item for activity is presented is presented in card 335
Figure.The thermal map that activity metric (for example, performance metric, cost metric etc.) is illustrated with the time is presented in another display card 339.For example,
Each square dark value change that can be based on the measurement for the correspondence time in thermal map.Can be by selecting display card 339
Top " my god ", " day ＆ hours " or " hour ", adjust the time range for thermal map.
As described above, the user's group that previous based on user and user interface is interacted and/or user is assigned, selection includes
Display card and/or data in primary account view.For example, can be based in the previous user ession for telecommunication user with account
Selection display card 331-339, selection display card 331-339 and the data presented by display card 331-339.Furthermore, it is possible to be based on
User's previous Request data relevant with these activities, are optionally comprised in the activity in display card 333.Similarly, it can be based on
User asks the data relevant with these keywords, is optionally comprised in the keyword in display card 337.In another example, may be used
Previously interact based on user with display card 339 (or another display block), select display block the time range that is presented in 339 with
Check the data of that period.
Before user's request additional card, the additional card with additional data can be provided to client device and in client
Cached at end equipment.For example, user interface 310 includes five display card 331-339.However, user generally check 9 it is different
Display card.When account described in User logs in, present in the user interface five display cards and other four display cards (together with
The data presented in display card) client device can be provided to.By this way, when user is selected in 4 display cards
, can be without selected display card being rapidly presented to user in the case of another request is submitted by network at one.
Another example display card can show to show the mode of specific content item at user equipment.For example, can be based on
Lower every presentation content in a different manner：The type of the client device of presentation content is (for example, can be in smart phone
On, be presented differently from content item with desktop computer), the position of the resource of presentation content (for example, can with the one of webpage
Differently in the top presentation content of webpage on side) or presentation content resource type (for example, can be different from blog
Ground presentation content in search results pages).To the display card, user interface maker 229 can be made on to content item
It is each flash how display content probability determination and illustrate how the expression of presentation content.For example, user circle
Surface generator 229 can the type based on the equipment of presentation content, the position of the resource of presentation content, presentation content
The type of resource and/or can influence content item presentation other proper datas, probability determination is made to specific flash.
The subset for the mode for determining presentation content can be presented in display card.For example, user interface maker 229 can be directed to
The each of content item is flashed, make how the probability determination of display content.User interface maker 229 can be based on general
It is forthright to determine, count the number of flashing of each mode for presentation content.Then, the generation of user interface maker 229 is retouched
Paint the display card for the expression of the content item with the mode at most flashed.For example, can be presented in display card based on sudden strain of a muscle
Existing preceding 4 expressions.By this way, user, which can quickly see content item and have, much may be presented to user.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart for reducing the instantiation procedure 400 for the time delay that account data is presented.For example, at by data
Manage device, such as Fig. 2 account management system 210, the operation of implementation process 400.Can also be by computer-readable storage medium
The instruction of storage, implementation process 400 performs the instruction by data processing equipment and causes data processing equipment implementation procedure
400 operation.
User (402) is given to online account authorization.Online account can be that user has the account accessed.For example, with
Family can be the employee of the tissue of the account data of account management system management tissue.Account described in multiple different user Internet access
Family.For example, the difference that tissue can have different role (for example, management of product person, brand managers, campaign manager etc.) is employed
Member, the different employees respectively the online account of Internet access to check and/or change the data relevant with the employee.
Based on by giving the data that the client device of user is submitted, certification gives user.For example, user can provide
Unique user name and password access online account.If by giving the username and password of user's offer and to the given use
The username and password matching of family storage, to user described in the online account authentication.
In response to certification user, user conversation (404) is initiated to the given user.User conversation allows user to check use
In the account data of online account.One or more user interfaces can be used, account data is presented to user.For example, can be with
Instrument board is presented to user.The instrument board can include the primary account view of the general view with account.In addition, instrument board can
To ask link or the other users interface of additional data or the given user of selection other display cards interested including the use of family
Control.
The user's group (406) that the given user of identification is assigned to.For example, based on the given user during previous user conversation
With interacting and other users and the user interface element for the user interface element that is presented in the user interface of the account
Other interaction between similarity, given user is assigned to one or more user's groups.Based in the previous user conversation phase
Between by giving the phase between at least one data type and at least one data type for being asked by other users of user's request
Like spending, given user is assigned to user's group.Figure 6 illustrates the instantiation procedure for user to be assigned to user's group, and
It is described below.
Selection first data set (408) relevant with online account.First data set includes certification user to access
The account data of line account.For example, the first data set can include being used to present with primary account view, be provided to given user
The account data of the general view of online account.Primary account view can be customized and based on to user interface element to given user
User's previous Request of (for example, being particularly shown card, control, figure etc.) and/or interaction, the given user to data or data type
Request modification, the request of the given user of specific data dimension (for example, period, geographical position etc.) or check, user
How long access the online account once, the user's group that is assigned of the preference of given user selection, given user and/or other are suitable
Work as data.Primary account view, which can be presented, to be incorporated into single presentation and the general view of online account is supplied into given user
Multiple different types of data.
In some embodiments, the user interface presented based on user and in the previous user session of given user
The user's group that previously interaction and/or given user are assigned, can from the data storage of the account data for online account,
Select the first data set for being presented in primary account view.For example, can be based on during previous user conversation by
Determine the user interface member of the data type of user's request and/or the given user mutual of previous user ession for telecommunication in given user
Element, selects the first data set.It is also based on the data type by giving the other users request in the user's group that user assigns
And/or the user interface element of other users interaction, select the first data set.
Selection second data set (410) relevant with online account.Second data set can be included in primary account view
The data not presented.On the contrary, the second data set can be sent to the client device of user, in the client device
Place's caching.By this way, if given user's request is to check not shown in primary account view, but it is included in the second number
According to the additional data of concentration, can without in the case of from additional data described in remote device requests by additional data be presented to
Determine user.Thus, the time delay that additional data is presented can be reduced.
Generally, the second data set can include being likely to related to given user, but may be unlike in the first data set
The data of data equally correlation.The elder generation for the user interface that can also be presented based on user and in the previous user session of given user
The user's group that preceding interaction and/or given user are assigned, selects the second data set.For example, the second data set can be by giving
Other users at least threshold value in the other users request of at least threshold number in the user's group that user is assigned or user's group
The data of frequent requests.
The user interface for account is updated at least a portion (412) of the first data set is presented.For example, can update to
Determining user submits the user interface of authentication data that the primary account view of the account for giving user is presented.To given user
At least a portion of the first data set can be included by providing the primary account view of the general view of online account.
By before the request for receiving to the second data set from client device, by the way that the second data set is supplied into client
End equipment, reduces when the extention of the first data set or the second data set is presented at client device, updates user circle
The time delay (414) in face.For example, the second data set can be sent to client device together with the first data set.In another example
In, after the first data set is sent to client device, but before the request to the second data set is received, by the second data
Collection is sent to client device.Second data set (and first data set) can be stored in the cache of client device with
Reduce when in client device requests, the time delay of the data of cache is presented.
After each user conversation, based on the friendship that user and data and user interface element are given during user conversation
Mutually, the profile of given user is updated.Based on the renewal to profile, the primary account view for the user can be updated.Example
Such as, during primary account view can be updated with the display card and/or user conversation of user's request during being presented on user conversation
The data that user asks or changed.Based on the renewal of the profile to giving user, it can update in the first data set and/or second
The data that data set includes.
If for example, data have changed or data are stored up at least threshold amount of time, Ke Yili in the caches
With updated data, refresh the cache of client device.However, in the presence of the cost associated with updating cache.
For example, it is desired to which across a network is obtained and transmission mass data.Thus, the pre-cache engine 223 of pre-cache engine, such as Fig. 2 can base
In those costs, it is determined whether update cache and the benefit related to updating cache.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart for updating the instantiation procedure 500 of cache.For example by data processing equipment (such as
Fig. 2 account management system 210), the operation of implementation process 500.Can also by the instruction that is stored on computer-readable storage medium,
Implementation process 500, wherein, data processing equipment execute instruction causes the operation of the data processing equipment implementation procedure 500.
Recognize trigger, the cache (502) for updating client device.In some embodiments, trigger
Can be based on the time quantum passed from client device is transferred data to since storing in the caches.Trigger can also
Whether changed based on the data stored in the caches by the value stored in the caches.For example, due to utilizing bag
The new transformation event occurred after the data filling cache for including the inversion quantity for content item, increases the turn over number of content item
Mesh.Multiple data that trigger can have been changed based on client device is sent to from data since storing in the caches
.If for example, at least multiple data item of threshold value have changed, cache renewal can be triggered.Trigger can also based on pair
