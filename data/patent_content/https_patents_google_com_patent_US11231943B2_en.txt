Definitions
- Some computing platforms may provide a user interface from which a user can chat, speak, or otherwise communicate with a virtual, computational assistant (e.g., also referred to as “an intelligent digital assistant”, “a digital assistant”, or simply “an assistant”) to cause the assistant to output useful information, respond to a user's needs, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks.
- the assistant may work with a third party (3P) agent server system.
- a computing device receives, with a microphone, voice input (e.g., audio data) from a user.
- An assistant executing at least in part at the computing device outputs an indication of the voice input to a third party agent server system.
- the assistant executing at least in part at the computing device outputs the useful information to the user.
- techniques of this disclosure may enable a digital assistant to recommend agents (also referred to as “software agents”) for responding to user input (e.g., for satisfying user utterances or textual input).
- agents also referred to as “software agents”
- a computing device may determine that the user of the digital assistant uses services outside of the digital assistant that are provided by a particular vender.
- the computing device may further determine that the particular vender is associated with an agent that is available for using services of the particular vender.
- An agent may refer to software, that when executed by a processor, autonomously interacts with the digital assistant, other agents, and/or systems to accomplish tasks on behalf of a user of the digital assistant.
- Agents may be configured to interact with users in natural language (e.g., “you can use this agent to order a taxi”, “you can use this agent to find food recipes”). Agents may be separate from the digital assistant. For example, agents may operate at a different processor or server than the digital assistant. Agents may be capable of providing services in addition to services provided by the digital assistant. For instance, an agent may provide services of a third party vender that the digital assistant is not configured to provide.
- agents may include first and third party digital agents configured to provide services associated with, for example, but not limited to, news media (e.g., a news feed, sports scores), food ordering (e.g., ordering food delivered), television (e.g., a recipe discussed in a television show), transportation (e.g., requesting automobile transportation or any other type of transportation), medical (e.g., a description of medical terms, ordering prescription refills), and other services.
- the digital assistant may output a recommendation for the agent for using services of the particular vender.
- a digital assistant may recommend agents that are likely to be used by the user. For example, the digital assistant may determine, with user permission, services that the user already uses, and recommend agents for using the services that the user already uses. In another example, the digital assistant may determine that a user has setup a user account for obtaining services from a particular service provider. In this manner, the digital assistant may recommend agents for the digital assistant that are likely to be used by the user.
- the disclosure is directed to a method that includes determining, by a digital assistant device, a set of candidate third party agents for a digital assistant service.
- the set of candidate third party agents are accessible via the digital assistant device.
- the method further includes receiving, by the digital assistant device, from a computing device that is associated with a user, information indicative of one or more interests of the user and determining, by the digital assistant device, based on the information, a set of relevance scores.
- Each relevance score of the set of relevance scores is indicative of whether the user will initiate at least one task requiring a respective candidate third party agent of the set of candidate third party agents.
- the method further includes selecting, by the digital assistant device, one or more candidate third party agents from the set of candidate third party agents that have a respective relevance score that satisfies a threshold and outputting an indication of a recommendation to configure a user account of the digital assistant service with the one or more candidate third party agents.
- the user account of the digital assistant service is associated with the user. Responsive to receiving an indication of user input that accepts the recommendation to configure the user account of the digital assistant service with the one or more candidate third party agents, the method further includes configuring, by the digital assistant device, the user account of the digital assistant service for operation with the one or more candidate third party agents.

- the instructions further cause at least one processor to receive, from a computing device that is associated with a user, information indicative of one or more interests of the user and to determine, based on the information, a set of relevance scores. Each relevance score of the set of relevance scores is indicative of whether the user will initiate at least one task requiring a respective candidate third party agent of the set of candidate third party agents.

- FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system that executes an example digital assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device that is configured to execute an example digital assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by one or more processors executing an example digital assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an example server system that is configured to execute an example digital assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- techniques of this disclosure enable an improved out-of-box experience when initially setting up a digital assistant for responding to user input (e.g., for satisfying user utterances or textual input).
- the out-of-box experience may require that a user choose, from a list of available agents, one or more agents that the user is likely to use services of. For example, upon initially powering on a computing device for executing the digital assistant, a user may provide input at a graphical user interface associated with the digital assistant to select, or unselect, agents for services available from the digital assistant that the user will or will not use.
- the digital assistant may recommend specific agents that are likely to be used by the user. For example, during an initial setup of a digital assistant, after explicitly having obtained permission from a user, a computing device may determine that the user of the digital assistant uses services outside of the digital assistant that are provided by a particular vender. The computing device may determine that the particular vender is associated with an available agent for using services of the particular vender, and the digital assistant may output a recommendation for the agent for using services of the particular vender. For instance, in response to determining that an e-mail account associated with the user of the digital assistant indicates the user recently ordered pizza from Pizza Company X, the digital assistant may recommend a particular agent for ordering pizza from Pizza Company X. In this manner, the digital assistant may direct the user to agents that the user will likely use rather than inundating the user with an amalgamation of agents that are useful to the user and agents that are useless to the user.
- the digital assistant may determine, with user permission, whether an application installed on a computing device for the user has corresponding agents for use with the digital assistant. For example, the digital assistant may receive, from a computing device, information indicating that the user has installed an application for scheduling a flight with a particular airline company. In this example, in response to identifying an agent for scheduling a flight with the particular airline company, the digital assistant may recommend that the user allow the digital assistant to enable the agent for scheduling of future flights with the particular airline company.
- the digital assistant may determine whether a computing device available for connection on a local area network (e.g., LAN) has a corresponding agent for use with the digital assistant. For example, the digital assistant may receive an indication that a computing device having a media access control address (MAC address) associated with a smart lighting system is available for connection using the LAN. In this example, in response to identifying an agent for controlling the smart lighting system using the digital assistant, the digital assistant recommends the agent for controlling the smart lighting system.
- MAC address media access control address
- the digital assistant may only maintain or have access to information associated with the user after first receiving explicit permission from the user to do so. Thus, the user may have complete control over how the assistant collects and uses information about the user. Before the digital assistant stores personal information, the digital assistant may encrypt or otherwise treat the information to remove the actual identity of the user, so that personally-identifiable information is removed while being stored. The digital assistant may provide a way for the user to modify or remove information maintained by the digital assistant. In this way, the user may have complete control over the information being retained by the digital assistant.
- the digital assistant can immediately configure the user account for operation with the recommended agent. For example, the assistant can retrieve data necessary for operating the recommended agent. Additionally, to further reduce a setup time, the digital assistant may, with user permission, automatically setup a third party user account for the recommended agent. In this way, the user may configure a digital assistant module with the recommended agent without necessarily inundating the user with trivial and repetitive requests for user information.

- agent recommendation modules 182 may determine third party agent modules 128 for a digital assistant service. For example, agent recommendation modules 182 may determine third party agent modules 128 as third party agent modules that are accessible via computing device 110 A. For instance, agent recommendation modules 182 may include third party agent modules 128 in third party agent list 124 A when each of third party agent server systems 170 may be accessed, via network 130 , by computing devices 110 .
- Agent recommendation modules 182 may recommend a selection of third party agent modules 128 based on popularity of that agent, or may provide a user interface from which a user can browse through a complete list of third party agent modules 128 . Rather than recommending a selection of third party agent module 128 based solely on a popularity or requiring a user to browse through a complete list of third party agent modules 128 , agent recommendation modules 182 may work with computing devices 110 to identify information indicative of interests of the user. In this way, agent recommendation modules 182 may alert the user to useful third party agent modules 128 that avoids overwhelming the user with an amalgamation of useful and nonviable third party agent modules 128 .
- agent recommendation modules 182 may receive information indicative of one or more interests of the user from computing devices 110 .
- Such interests of a user may include subjective interests (e.g., being a fan of sports team A).
- interests of a user may include objective interests (e.g., controlling a home thermostat).
- the user may be interested in controlling a home thermostat to simply accomplish the task of reducing a temperature in a home without a desire to interact with the home thermostat.
- agent recommendation modules 182 may determine third party agent lists 124 as a sub-set of one or more of third party agent modules 128 based the information indicative of one or more interests of the user.

- Agent recommendation modules 182 may determine a set of relevance scores based on the information indicative of interests of the user. For example, agent recommendation modules 182 may increase a relevance score of third party agent module 128 A when the information indicates that the user utilizes services of a particular vender that is associated with third party agent module 128 A. For instance, in response to receiving an indication that the user has recently ordered consumer products from a particular website for ordering products from a first particular vender and that third party agent module 128 A is configured to permit the user to order consumer products from the first particular vender, agent recommendation modules 182 may increase a relevance score for third party agent module 128 A.
- agent recommendation modules 182 may refrain from increasing (e.g., not change) or may decrease the relevance score for third party agent module 128 B. In this manner, each relevance score of the set of relevance scores is indicative of whether the user will initiate at least one task requiring a respective third party agent of third party agent modules 128 .
- Agent recommendation modules 182 may select one or more third party agents of third party agent modules 128 to recommend to the user. More specifically, for example, agent recommendation modules 182 may select one or more third party agents of third party agent modules 128 that have a respective relevance score that satisfies a threshold.
- the threshold may be indicative of a minimum interest threshold of the user.
- the threshold may be predefined (e.g., selected by a one or more of computing devices 110 ), user selected, or dynamically configurable based on user input (e.g., decreased when the user accepts a recommendation and increased when a user refuses a recommendation). In some examples, increasing a relevance score may indicate a higher user interest. In such examples, a respective relevance score that satisfies a threshold may be greater than the threshold.
- agent recommendation modules 182 may increase a relevance score for a third party agent module 128 A that is for enabling purchases from clothing company Y.
- agent recommendation modules 182 recommends third party agent module 128 A that is for purchasing from clothing company Y because the relevance score for a third party agent module 128 A is greater than the threshold.
- decreasing a relevance score may indicate a higher user interest.
- a respective relevance score that satisfies a threshold may be less than the threshold.
- agent recommendation modules 182 may recommend two or more of third party agent modules 128 .
- Agent recommendation modules 182 may sort a recommendation of third party agent module 128 using relevance scores. For example, when two or more of third party agent modules 128 have a respective relevance score that satisfies a threshold, agent recommendation modules 182 may sort the two or more of third party agent modules 128 by the relevance score. For instance, when third party agent module 128 A-C have relevance scores, 97, 80, and 90 that satisfies a threshold of 75, agent recommendation modules 182 may sort a recommendation to suggest a ranked list that starts with third party agent module 128 A, then third party agent module 128 C, and then third party agent module 128 B.

- agent recommendation modules 182 may cause UID 112 to output a visible notification of “Would you like me to link to your digital assistant account with news company Y and review service Z?,” and, after receiving an indication of consent from the user, output another visible notification of “Would you like me to also link to your digital assistant account with transportation company X?”.
- agent recommendation modules 182 may configure the user account of the digital assistant service for operation with the selected third party agent modules 128 .
- agent recommendation module 182 may, automatically, with user permission, request user data from third party agent server systems 170 to support the selected third party agent modules 128 . Further, in instances where the user has granted permission to share personal or sensitive information with third party agent modules 128 , agent recommendation module 182 may output, automatically, without further user input, an indication of authentication information to third party agent server systems 170 and share information about the user account already setup by the user at digital assistant server 160 . In this way, agent recommendation module 182 may simplify a setup to configure assistant module 122 with third party agent modules 128 without necessarily inundating the user with trivial and repetitive requests for user information.
- Agent recommendation modules 182 may recommend one or more third party agent modules 128 during a setup of computing device 110 B, such as initiating the user account of the digital assistant service, computing device 110 B first being powered on, an out-of-box experience, or another setup. Additionally, or alternatively, agent recommendation modules 182 may re-engage the user by recommending one or more third party agent modules 128 in response to information indicative of interests of the user. For instance, agent recommendation modules 182 may recommend third party agent module 128 A for ordering pizza from pizza company X at 4:45 PM on a Friday in response to receiving an e-mail receipt indicating that the user has previously ordered pizza at 5:00 PM on Friday. In this manner, agent recommendation modules 182 may recommend one or more third party agent modules 128 that are useful at a time that a user is likely to utilize the services of the recommended one or more third party agent modules 128 .
- the processing complexity and time for a device to act may be reduced by directing the user to the useful third party agents rather than relying on specific inquiries from the user;
- agent information may be stored locally reducing the need for complex and memory-consuming transmission security protocols on the user's device for the private data;
- the example assistant directs the user to third party agents, fewer specific inquiries may be requested by the user, thereby reducing demands on a user device for query rewriting and other computationally complex data retrieval;
- network usage may be reduced as the data that the local agent recommendation module needs to respond to specific inquires may be reduced as a quantity of specific inquires is reduced.
