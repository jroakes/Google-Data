The associated data offer of event to entity interpreter is broadcast, the entity interpreter selects one or more entity from sterogram,
And one or more entity is included in the entity sets being associated with live event.
In some embodiments, event data is processed for each live event in live event superset, to carry
For corresponding quality score.In some instances, quality score reflects the degree of live event, and is based on event
Data, for example, one or more entity that organizer is associated with event.For example, State of the Union Message ground disclosed in US President
Location can have of a relatively high quality score, but user can have relatively low matter from the performance of family's trustship of user
Amount score value.
In some embodiments, the quality score of live event is determined based on one or more sub- score value.Example
Sub- score value can include organizer's score value, one or more entity score value and description score value.In some instances, will organize
Square score value is defined as the average value of one or more sub- score value.In some instances, by organizer's score value be defined as this one
The individual or many weighted average of sub- score value.For example, can be to the corresponding sub- corresponding weight of score value application.According to this side
Formula, corresponding score value can influence quality score based on corresponding weight.For example, organizer's score value can be endowed than description
The heavier weights of score value, so that the contribution to quality score that organizer's score value is provided is bigger than description score value.
In some instances, organizer's score value specifically designed for event organizer, and can be based on and organizer's phase
The information of association.Example information can include the number of the quality live event organized by organizer and/or the organizer one
The number of the follower having in individual or multiple computer implemented services.In some instances, it is based at least partially on
The number of the quality live event organized by organizer and/or it is based at least partially on the number of the follower that the organizer has
Mesh determines organizer's score value.
For example, the live event set organized by organizer can be provided, and the live event set can include phase
The quality score answered.In some instances, if the quality score of live event exceedes threshold quality score value, by the live thing
Part is designated as qualified live event.In some instances, if organizer did not organize other live events (except determining
Outside the current live event of quality score), or organizer do not organized quality live event, then can be by organizer
Score value is set to minimum value, for example, 0.In some instances, if organizer organized the live thing of the quality of at least threshold number
Part, then can be set to maximum, for example, 1 by organizer's score value.In some instances, can be ranked based on organizer
Quality live event number, organizer's score value is set to the value between minimum value and maximum.
Used as another example, one or more user of computer implemented service is properly termed as organizer mutually accrued
The follower in service that calculation machine is realized.In some instances, follower is to be elected to be received and in computer for automatic
The user of the information that another user in the service of realization is associated.For example, the follower of organizer can receive and group automatically
The information that the live event that the side of knitting has been ranked is associated.In some instances, can be realized from one or more computer
Service receive the number of follower that organizer has.In some instances, if the number of follower exceedes follower
Threshold number, then organizer's score value can be set to maximum, for example, 1.In some instances, if the number of follower
Organizer's score value can be then set to minimum value, for example, 0 by mesh not less than the threshold number of follower.In some instances,
The number of the follower that the organizer has can be based on, organizer's score value is set between minimum value and maximum
Value.
In some embodiments, organizer can be provided based on the number of the number of quality live event and follower
Score value.For example, the first score value can be determined based on the number of quality live event, and can be based on the number of follower come
Determine the second score value.In some instances, organizer can be provided score value based on the first score value and the second score value.For example, group
The side's of knitting score value can be the average value of the first score value and the second score value.Used as another example, organizer's score value can be first point
The weighted average of value and the second score value, wherein, to the first score value and the second corresponding weight of score value application.
In some embodiments, entity score value is specifically designed for the entity being associated with live event.As described above
, example physical includes people, brand, company, university, institute, nonprofit organization and government organs.In some instances, entity
Score value indicates the popularity of corresponding entity.For example, can be based on the number of the inquiry that (for example, pass through search system) be received come
Entity score value is provided, the inquiry that this is received clearly includes corresponding entity and/or is associated with the corresponding entity.As another
Example, can be based on one or more social networking service issue model in explicitly refer to corresponding entity number of times and/
Or the number of times for being associated corresponding entity with the model issued by one or more social networking service provides entity point
Value.In some embodiments, receiving entity score value is indexed from entity score value.For example, one or more is computer implemented
Service can determine entity score value and by entity score value storage in entity score value index.
In some embodiments, description score value is provided based on the description (if present) being associated with event.At some
In example, determine to describe score value based on the length of description.For example, length can be provided as into number of words.In some instances, will
Number of words is defined as the number of the word that description includes.In some instances, number of words only includes the number of the unique word provided in description
Mesh.If for example, word occurs in that many times, the word is only calculated once in the de-scription.In some instances, number of words does not include disabling
Word.For example, it is determined that before number of words, one or more stop words can be filtered out from description.Example stop words can be wrapped
Include " the (being somebody's turn to do) ", " is (YES) ", " its (it) ", " are (YES) ", " a (one) " and " an (one) ".
In some embodiments, number of words is compared with one or more threshold value number of words.In some instances, such as
Fruit number of words exceedes threshold value number of words, then description score value can be equal into maximum, for example, 1.In some instances, if
Description score value can be then equal to minimum value, for example, 0 by number of words not less than threshold value number of words.In this manner it is achieved that comparing
Relatively short description can be assigned to lower score value for relatively long description.In some instances, it is too long of to retouch
State and be likely to that lower description score value can be caused.For example, number of words can be carried out with first threshold number of words and Second Threshold number of words
Compare.If number of words exceedes Second Threshold number of words, and not less than first threshold number of words, then can be set to description score value
In maximum.If number of words exceedes first threshold number of words, or not less than Second Threshold number of words, then can set description score value
It is equal to minimum value.
In some embodiments, live event is provided based on the quality score of the live event in live event superset
Set.In some instances, the quality score of the live event in live event superset is compared with threshold quality score value.
In some instances, if quality score exceedes threshold quality score value, live event is included in live event set.
In some examples, if quality score does not include in live event set live event not less than threshold quality score value.
In this way it is possible to be the subset of live event superset by live event set description.In some instances, live event
Set can include and live event superset identical live event.If for example, all events in live event superset
Quality score is above threshold quality score value, then also include in live event set all events in live event superset
In.
