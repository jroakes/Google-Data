Embodiment
Fig. 1 is the block diagram of example online advertising system 100.In some embodiments, one or more advertisers 102 can import directly or indirectly, advertisement (" the ad ") information in maintenance and the track ad management system 104.Though what quote is advertisement, the content of other form can be sent by system 100, comprises the sponsored content of other form.Advertisement can be with following form: such as one or more advertisement of any such assembly of graphical advertisement, plain text advertisement, image ad, audio advertisement, video ads, the combination of banner etc.Advertisement can also comprise embedded information, such as the executable instruction of link, metamessage and/or machine.The request that one or more publishers 106 can submit to advertisement to system 104.System 104 responds with one or more upward storing the in publisher's web assets (for example website or other network distribution of content) by the publisher 106 who advertisement is sent to the request of sending.Advertisement can comprise that embedded chain connects landing page, the page on advertiser 102 websites for example, and the user is directed to described landing page when the user clicks the advertisement that is presented on the publisher website.
Whether other entities such as user 108 and advertiser 102 can provide use information to system 104, advance to take place such as conversion relevant with advertisement or point.This use information can comprise the measured or observed user behavior relevant with the advertisement of having distributed.System 104 carries out financial transactions, such as buying on credit and to advertiser's 102 charges to publisher 106 based on use information.
Computer network 110 such as Local Area Network, wide area network (WAN), the Internet or its combination connects advertiser 102, system 104, publisher 106 and user 108.
An example of publisher 106 is conventional content server, and it receives the request to content (for example, article, discussion topic, music, video, figure, Search Results, webpage are included, information providing etc.), and the content of being asked in response to the request retrieval.Content server can be with the Advertisement Server of the request of advertisement being submitted in the system 104.Ad-request can comprise the quantity of desired advertisement.Ad-request can also comprise content request message.This information (for example can comprise content itself, the page or other content document), with the corresponding classification of interior perhaps content requests (for example, art, commerce, computing machine, art film, arts-music etc.), content requests partly or entirely, content life-span, content type (for example, text, figure, video, audio frequency, mixed-media etc.), geographical location information etc.
In some embodiments, one or more combined in the content server advertisement that the content of being asked and system 104 can be provided.The content of this combination and advertisement can be sent to the user 108 of request content to present in reader (for example, browser or other content display system).Content server can send back Advertisement Server with the information about advertisement, and how described information comprise description, when and/or present advertisement wherein (for example, with HTML or JavaScript
TM) information.
Another example published person 106 is search services.Search service can receive the inquiry to Search Results.In response, search service can be from the index of the document index of webpage (for example, from) retrieve relevant search results.S.Brin and L.Page deliver on the SeventhInternational World Wide Web Conference (the 7th international web-seminar) that Brisbane ,Australia is held paper " The Anatomy of a Large-Scale HypertextualSearch Engine (analyzing extensive hypertext search engine) " and U.S. Patent No. 6, the examplar search service has been described in 285,999.The extracts of the text that Search Results can comprise the tabulation of web page title for example, extract from those webpages and the hypertext link of pointing to those webpages, and can be grouped into the Search Results of predetermined quantity (for example 10).
Search service can will be submitted to system 104 to the request of advertisement.Request can comprise the quantity of desired advertisement.This quantity can depend on size and dimension of screen that Search Results, Search Results occupy or the page empty area of a room, advertisement etc.In some embodiments, the quantity of desired advertisement will be from 1 to 10 or from 3 to 5.Request to advertisement can also comprise (as being transfused to or resolved) inquiry, based on information inquiring (such as geographical location information, inquiry whether from the member and member's identifier) and/or be associated with Search Results or based on the information of Search Results.Such information (for example can comprise for example relevant with Search Results identifier, document identifier or " docID "), the proper vector of the full text of the extracts of the score value (for example, information retrieval (" IR ") score value) relevant, the text that extracts from the document of being discerned (for example webpage), the document discerned, the document discerned etc. with Search Results.In some embodiments, the IR score value can calculate from for example waiting with the combination of dot product, page rank score value and/or the IR score value of inquiry and the corresponding proper vector of document and page rank score value.
One or more combined in the advertisement that search service can provide Search Results and system 104.This combined information can be transmitted to the user 108 of request content then.Search Results can be maintained as and be different from advertisement, in order to avoid the user is in paid advertisement be speculated as to produce between the neutral Search Results and obscure.At last, search service can with relevant with advertisement and when, wherein and/or the information that how to present advertisement send back system 104.
As understanding from aforementioned, Advertising Management System 104 can be publisher's 106 services such as content server and search service.System 104 allows the advertisement that the document that is provided by content server is provided is distributed.For example, network or internet can comprise in response to from the request of the search service with the advertisement position that is used to sell and distribute the Advertisement Server of targeted ads.Suppose that the internet is a WWW.Search service is climbed and is got a large amount of or all contents.Some of this content can comprise available advertisement position (being also referred to as " stock ").More specifically, one or more content servers can comprise one or more documents.Document can comprise webpage, Email, content, embedded information (for example, embedded media), metamessage and executable instruction of machine and available advertisement position.Be inserted into advertisement in the advertisement position in the document and can when distributing document, change at every turn or can have as an alternative static related with given document.
In one embodiment, Advertising Management System 104 can comprise the auction process of selection from advertiser 102 advertisement.Can allow 102 couples of advertisers of advertiser be willing to for advertisement click the amount of money of paying each time, every capital sum of clicking into of advertisers pay when for example the user clicks advertisement is for example selected or is bid.Every click cost can comprise maximum every click cost, and for example the advertiser is willing to be the maximum dollar amount of clicking payment each time based on the advertisement of the keyword of the word in the inquiry for example or a plurality of words.Yet, also can use other bid type.Based on these bids, advertisement can be selected and rank for presenting.
In some embodiments, system 104 comprises the advertising page malware detection system, and it can determine that sponsored content (for example, the landing page of advertisement) comprises the possibility of Malware.Malware can comprise the computing machine murder by poisoning thing of any kind, such as dishonest ad ware, computer virus, spyware, Trojan Horse, computer worm or other such malice, non-selected and/or unwanted software.Particularly, Malware can be included in any suspicious software that landing takes place automatically and installs such as the webpage of the landing page of advertisement the time.In some embodiments, the advertising page malware detection system can cover the user and must click link (such as " free download ") on the page so that the situation of Malware to be installed.Yet software need not to carry out malicious act just becomes Malware; Invade any software of installing and can be considered to Malware, and no matter whether the behavior that software carries out is malice.Therefore, except that Trojan Horse, virus, worm and browser leak, can be considered to Malware such as other software that not necessarily damages computer system of monitoring software, start page abduction etc.
Malware detection system can for example be tested landing page (for example, the webpage that is limited by the URL that embeds or be associated with sponsored content) automatically and take suitable behavior when detecting Malware for Malware.Such behavior can be abideed by predetermined policy, such as the account who suspends the advertiser (for example, about the advertiser of AdSense of Google or AdWords account), will relevant and help final user avoids such advertisement negative effect in future for Malware with landing page associated advertisement " mark ".Malware detection system can for the advertiser process is provided so that its " mark " advertisement heavily looked into and the account be disengaged time-out.In addition, if malware detection system heavily look into the advertiser mark advertisement landing page and determine that related landing page is clean (for example, do not have Malware), then can recover (or clarification) advertiser's account.In some embodiments, can total ban and landing page associated advertisement, for example can get rid of distributing to advertisement.
In some embodiments, malware detection system can have the dirigibility that suspends advertisement group, described advertisement group such as all advertisements in advertisement group or the advertising campaign or have all advertisements of common URL.For example, malware detection system can determine that just the subclass of advertiser's advertisement comprises Malware, thereby only suspends these advertisements.Determining like this can be based on the shared common trait of the landing page of advertisement.
May meet with Malware in the landing page of advertisement or redirected chain, perhaps Malware can cause in every way.Particularly, redirected chain can comprise a series of URL, and it comprises the advertisement (or purpose URL) clicked, as the result's who clicks advertisement the final URL by the landing page of illustrative URL such as script and advertisement.In some cases, advertiser's website can be attacked and Malware directly is inserted on the landing page.In another example, but the malice advertiser can deliberately install perhaps Malware on its advertisement landing page.In the 3rd example, click tracker and can insert Malware by the whole redirected chain before arriving final URL.In the 4th example, the advertiser can install advertisement and/or widgets on its landing page that can be expanded by the third party who inserts Malware.In these and other example of Malware, when the user clicked such advertisement, user's computer can be endangered by the installation of intrusive software.
For example, Fig. 2 is the process flow diagram of the example associating of sponsored content.The advertisement 202 of consideration on welcome website 204.For example, in question website or webpage can comprise having by oneself the banner of the 206a of advertising company of prestige.The user for example can click the advertisement 202 in the web browser of carrying out on home computer the user, the PDA etc.The purpose URL of advertisement 202 can point to or start the single file script of quoting at the 206a of advertising company of first geographic area 208 (for example a, JavaScript).The one JavaScript and then can generate the URL that the 2nd JavaScript is redirected to the 206b of advertising company (for example, another advertising company).The 2nd JavaScript and then can generate sensing and can be for example use more JavaScript of the geographical directed 206c of another advertising company for its advertisement.Geographical directed advertisement can cause pointing in another geographic area the single file HTML that comprises iFrame of 210 the 206d of advertising company.
When attempting to retrieve this iFrame, can be with browser such as being redirected towards the IP address of leak server via the position head.For example, the IP address can be with for example xx.xx.xx.xx/＜leak server 〉/form, such as the IP address of leak server 212.The IP address that is provided can comprise the JavaScript that can make leak server 212 can attempt the encryption of a plurality of leaks at user's browser.As a result, several Malware binary files can be installed on user's computer.The Malware that meets with in this case and/or install may be ignorant for the initial 206a of advertising company.Yet being redirected each time from purpose URL (for example, the 206a of advertising company) to the landing page that is associated with sponsored content (for example, on leak server 212) can cause that the opposing party controls the content on the original web page.By this way, can guide the non-expectation experience of user and Malware at this by the son associating that several URL are redirected the sponsored content that characterizes.
Detection of malicious software can comprise that use commerce can obtain malware detection software or other such virus scanning software or system.Can also pass through the surveillance behavior,, come detection of malicious software such as supervision use to registration table and system file behind visit URL.For example, invade the detection engine and can monitor that the behavior of the browser on the virtual machine is to determine whether to exist Malware.
Fig. 3 is the block diagram of example sponsored content disposal system 300.The data relevant with sponsored content can be stored in the advertising database 302.For example, advertising database 302 can comprise the sponsored content of several forms, such as one or more advertisement of any such assembly of graphical advertisement, banner, plain text advertisement, image ad, audio advertisement, video ads, combination etc.Advertisement can be for example according to keyword, advertising campaign, URL or other content are organized.
The initial assessment that Malware evaluator 304 is carried out can be discerned the landing page of advertisement or the invasion character of the URL in the redirected chain.Assessment can be examined iFrame feature, URL feature, script feature of advertisement etc. and the storage vault of such feature with the known feature that is associated with the landing page that comprises Malware compared.As the result to the initial assessment of the landing page feature of advertisement, the landing page that Malware evaluator 304 can generate the indication advertisement comprises the feature score value of the possibility of Malware.For example, higher score value can represent that the landing page of advertisement more may comprise Malware.Can be categorized as and be used for the more fully candidate of Malware evaluation process having landing page above any advertisement of the feature score value of characteristic threshold value.By this way, can promote reduce to sound out to Feature Recognition, the permission system significantly is reduced to the quantity of landing page subsequently can be by the more fully more small set of the candidate landing page of Malware evaluation process assessment.
In some embodiments, Malware evaluator 304 can use and realize that more fully the intrusion of Malware evaluation process detects engine 3 05.For example, Malware evaluator 304 can provide webpage (for example, the landing page of advertisement) and receive intrusion score value about this webpage to invade detecting engine 3 05.In other embodiments, Malware evaluator 304 can comprise that intrusion detects engine 3 05.
More fully process can be submitted to candidate landing page at the Malware evaluator by Malware evaluator 304 and start when intrusion detects engine 3 05.Invade detection engine 3 05 and can comprise for example virtual machine, via this virtual machine, system 300 can carrying advertisement, (for example, being redirected via one or more URL) navigating to the landing page of advertisement and carry out one or more malware detection system that can obtain computer malware and viral detection system such as commerce in browser.During this process, virtual machine can also for example monitor to system file use and to the establishment of undelegated process.Intrusion detection engine 3 05 can generate to invade score value and will invade score value and offer Malware evaluator 304.Invade score value and can indicate the level of the Malware in the landing page of advertisement.If it is significantly high to invade score value, such as being higher than predefined intrusion threshold value, then system 300 can (for example, in advertising database 302) with AD tagged for may in its landing page, comprising Malware.
The advertisement that can get rid of mark in advertising database 302 to be to be distributed to the user, and perhaps the note advertisement comprises the possibility of Malware with the landing page of the advertisement of indicating it in some way.In some embodiments, note can comprise to advertisement being the intrusion score value of each grading in the relevant possibility of Malware.Comprise the result of Malware as any part (for example, single advertisement landing page) of the sponsored content of determining the advertiser, system 300 some or all in can mark advertiser's advertisement.System 300 can also suspend advertiser's account, such as submitting new advertisement to the prevention advertiser.Such as knowing that advertisement is Malware when relevant, for example high relatively intrusion score value, system 300 can automatically perform some behaviors.Other behavior can be based on determining such as the user behind the result who consults the Malware assessment.
In system 300, can there be Customer Service Representative (CSR) front end 308 that allows the advertiser to start the appeal process for the advertisement of mark.For example, client (for example, advertiser) can have the corresponding one or more landing page of sponsored content of determining to comprise Malware with Malware evaluator 304.For example, after such website was removed Malware, the advertiser can start the appeal to advertisement.Such appeal can be for example in the mode of the communication between CSR front end 308 and Malware evaluator 304 and/or account manager 306.Communication can comprise advertiser's for example title and the URL of the landing page treating to be reappraised by Malware evaluator 304.If advertiser's the appeal to the advertisement of mark is successful, then system 300 can be to the advertisement releasing marks.In some embodiments, as the result that success is appealed, advertiser's account can also recover in system 300.In some embodiments, when the advertiser appeals advertisement,, then just recover account's (and to advertisement releasing marks) of advertiser if system 300 can check that about all advertisements in all advertisements of this advertiser and this advertiser's the advertisement be clean.
In some embodiments, system 300 can comprise hierarchical time-out account model.For example, based on the possibility that has Malware in the landing page, landing page can be classified be gone in the various classifications or level that Malware invades.Such classification for example can comprise " OK " (for example, determining it may is the software that means no harm), " suspicious " (for example, may comprise Malware) or " affirmation " (for example, very may or comprising Malware certainly).Suspicious classification can be such as further to sort out based on the grading of invading score value.
In some embodiments, the malware detection score value can be accumulated about the account, and account self can go into the risk classification by " branch level ", and each of kind of risk is differently handled, consult automatically, manually consult and automatic pause in change.For example, system 300 can be when one or more advertisements be in " affirmation " Malware classification the automatic pause account or can 5% or more advertisement suspend account etc. when being " suspicious ".
For example, in one embodiment, Malware evaluator 308 can be discerned the landing page that is associated with the sponsor account who has above the feature score value of characteristic threshold value.Can accumulate obtaining account's score value the feature score value of these landing page, and can kind of risk be distributed to sponsor account based on account's score value.Can select to be used for sponsor account's of several account's remedial procedures based on kind of risk, for example consult automatically, manually consult, automatic pause, the part of pause etc. of candidate landing page just.
Detection to potential Malware can take place continuously, periodically or aperiodically.For example, advertising database 302 can be checked continuously by Malware evaluator 304.In another example, advertising database 302 can periodically be checked by the Malware evaluator, for example every month or inspection weekly.In another example, each advertisement of adding advertising database 302 to can be examined when advertisement is added to advertising database 302.Can also use other to detect scheduling.
Fig. 4 is the block diagram that makes up the example training process 400 of disaggregated model 402.Feature in the landing page that disaggregated model 402 can be used to assess with advertisement is associated such as the feature that can indicate the possibility that has Malware, for example little iFrame, is obscured script etc.In some embodiments, can during training process the characteristic allocation weight.The assessment based on feature like this can be used to reduce the quantity of the URL that the evaluation process of more robust to be used assesses, and described process is such as by invading the process that engine 3 05 is realized that detects.
At the example general flow of the training process 400 that is used for producing disaggregated model 402, processing can begin with the use to advertisement 302.Can discern the information that is used for training process 400 from landing page and URL 404.Process 400 can further be divided into " training " landing page and " test " landing page with landing page and URL 404.For example, the landing page of larger amt (for example 10,000) can be used as the training example and come train classification models 402, and the landing page of lesser amt (for example 1,000) can be used to testing classification model 402.
In some embodiments, characteristic extraction engine 406 can comprise the tabulation of the feature that is weighted.For example, the specific invasion character about the URL of known malware website can receive the fewer higher weight of invasion character that may be associated with Malware.Because disaggregated model 402 is used to comprise that according to landing page the possibility of Malware classifies landing page, so can As time goes on adjust the weight of feature.
Weight can be accumulated, and makes landing page comprise that the overall possibility of Malware can be by carrying out addition or make up with the corresponding weight of detected feature determining.In some embodiments, for can be in landing page the appearance each time of detected characteristic of correspondence, the weight of feature can be included in the summation.In other embodiments, can add the weight of feature to total score value once, and do not consider the number of times that feature occurs in advertisement.Can also use other assessment based on feature weight.
Though many features can have corresponding positive weight, further feature can have negative weight.For example, feature A (for example, corresponding to the relevant function call of possible Malware) can have weight 2.5.Simultaneously, the existence of feature X can deny partly that feature A is the possibility of malice, impels system 400 will bear weight allocation and gives feature X.
In the training stage of training process 400, can use control assessment 408.Control assessment 408 can comprise mankind's assessment of advertisement landing page.For example, the mankind to the landing page that is used for particular advertisement consult the examination that can comprise the feature of advertisement.Consult the overall grading of the possibility that comprises Malware that landing page can also be provided, such as the infection of extreme Malware, the infection of part Malware etc.
Can during the training stage of feature weight being distributed to the feature of extracting by characteristic extraction engine 406, quote by the information that control assessment 408 generates.For example, machine learning engine 410 can be distributed to the result of feature with test control assessment 408 with feature weight for example by the similar characteristics of examination in other URL (for example, from the URL of " test " landing page).Particularly, machine learning engine 410 can use the feature of self-test landing page to come the related of iterative refinement feature weight and invasion character.
Refining like this can for example be realized by the model based on linear regression.For example, machine learning engine 410 can use the training and testing landing page of cutting apart with landing page and URL 404.Machine learning engine 410 can for example be adjusted feature weight based on the training and testing landing page and think test landing page generating feature score value.If the feature score value produces the malware detection result near the control assessment result, then disaggregated model can be considered to train.On the contrary, if the feature score value produces and the very big different malware detection result of control assessment result, then machine learning engine 410 can be readjusted feature weight.For example, through the several iteration, machine learning engine 410 can determine that feature X is weighted De Taigao, therefore can reduce the feature weight that is associated with feature X.
Can continue to stop incident at the invasion character of training and testing landing page iteration training and testing, for example test result be converged to control assessment 408 up to test occurring to disaggregated model 402, or up to reaching the iteration boundary.After stopping incident, feature weight can be retained in disaggregated model 402 lastingly with the related of invasion character.
Can also use other process of train classification models 402.
Fig. 5 is the block diagram that utilizes another example sponsored content disposal system 500 of disaggregated model 402.System 500 comprises 402 pairs of rating engines 502 of marking from the advertisement of advertising database 504 of use disaggregated model.For example, use the feature weight be stored in the disaggregated model 402, rating engine 502 can be marked to the feature of the landing page of handled advertisement from advertising database 504.Any advertisement that scoring is higher than predetermined threshold can be identified as candidate URL 506.
In some embodiments, when determining that candidate URL has infected Malware, can distribute similar score value at Malware evaluator 508 (for example, based on detecting the height intrusion score value that engine 3 05 receives) to other relevant candidate URL 506 from invading.For example, can be clear that the candidate URL 506 with same domain name too might be infected.Determining like this can be partly based on geographic factor, if for example known Russia, China or any other country with higher infected territory rate gone up from statistics in the territory.
Fig. 6 is the block diagram of another example sponsored content disposal system 600.System 600 comprises the advertisement malware detection system 602 of the possibility that can detection of malicious software be associated with advertisement in the advertising database 604.Advertisement malware detection system 602 can also promote the appeal process, can ask being marked as and the reappraising of Malware associated advertisement by this appeal process advertiser.In some embodiments, advertisement malware detection system 602 can comprise software instruction, and it carries out continuously the information for example used from advertisement 604 with the Malware in the landing page that continues the identification advertisement.For example, identifying can relate to the surveillance behavior, such as the use that monitors behind user capture URL registration table and system file.In another example, identifying can relate to regular examination to each advertiser's landing page URL, maybe can relate to or the corresponding landing page URL that is considered to comprise Malware.Such process can monitor the particular advertisement landing page feature that can indicate the possibility that has Malware.One or more assemblies of advertisement malware detection system in other embodiments, 602 can be used for climbing in powerful (brute force) process to be got advertising database 604 and thinks possible related examination landing page URL with Malware.Advertisement is had the definite of related Malware can be based on the advertisement group in single advertisement, advertisement group, keyword, one or more related urls, advertiser's the account or some above combinations.
In one embodiment, the information from advertising database 604 can be offered advertisement group standard feature database 606 and URL property data base 608.For example, the information in the database 606 and 608 can comprise the relevant information from advertisement, such as URL, from the keyword of advertisement, related advertiser's title, advertiser's account information etc.The needs that for example to eliminate memory image, video, audio frequency or other such ad related information that provide to this information.Make advertising message this locality can also provide the advantage of tissue and/or index data with more effective use in advertisement malware detection system 602 in advertisement group standard feature database 606 and URL property data base 608.The such information in the database 606 and 608 of being stored in can be enough to determine related based on characteristic of malware with particular advertisement under the situation that needn't climb the landing page of getting advertisement.In another embodiment, system 600 can climb the landing page of getting advertisement and use from the retrievable information of landing page, rather than uses database 606 and 608 (or except that using database 606 and 608).
Advertisement group standard feature database 606 can comprise the information of one or more advertisement groups of advertiser, the keyword that is associated with advertisement, product assortment information, advertiser's account information and other ad related information of being used by advertisement malware detection system 602.URL property data base 608 can comprise each single advertisement URL (for example, landing page URL), advertiser title and can allow accessed any out of Memory or the index of associated data in the advertisement group standard feature database 606.
Advertisement malware detection system 602 comprises sampler 610, and it can be used as coarse filter when identification may comprise the advertisement of Malware.Particularly, sampler 610 can be identified as its advertisement of recommending malware detection.Identifying can be used the ad related information that is stored in advertisement group standard feature database 606 and the URL property data base 608.For example, sampler 610 can be any content characteristic search advertisement in the set of the pre-determined advertisement content characteristic of identification in advertisement group standard feature database 606.
In some embodiments, URL property data base 608 can comprise obscuring detecting device and can make and be used for to obscuring the scramble data of script examination html page in the sampler 610, describedly obscures script such as the script of writing with JavaScript, VBScript etc.What such script can comprise character usually obviously is the set of chaotic data, it is rewritten as self another URL character string when the user clicks advertisement, and then is rewritten as another character string etc. and is write or download on the computer equipment up to bug code.Can follow this level of redirected chain generation or rewrite the HTML code that can make identification malice and become difficult.
In some embodiments, URL property data base 608 can comprise geographical location information.The URL that such information can be used to for example will to be used for advertisement sorts out geographically.Usually may provide Malware from some country, so the positional information of analysis of built-in link can help to discern potential Malware website.For example, has sensing can provide potential Malware in the US-.com territory of the iFrame of well-known website with the high rate of Malware of the remote position of geography strong signal.
When sampler 610 had been discerned the candidate's advertisement that comprises Malware under a cloud, sampler 610 can send to Malware center 612 with candidate URL and account information.Malware center 612 can be used as central interface, and it is used to receive the advertisement for the treatment of more fully to be checked Malware, and as will be described below, is used to receive to being marked as the appeal of the advertisement that comprises Malware.For any advertisement that consult at sampler 610 request Malware centers 612, Malware center 612 can with the URL of advertisement and such as with the corresponding tracked information update mode database 614 of advertisement associated advertisement master's account information.In some embodiments, the information in the slip condition database 614 of being stored in can comprise that sampler 614 thinks the information of the reason that is used for more senior malware detection.In some embodiments, reason can be used to the advertisement status packet in slip condition database 614, so that the advertisement status packet is used for more effective processing.
In some embodiments, sampler 610 comparative lifetime that can also assess the territory and be used for the URL link of those territories (or point to) in those territories.Because Malware is distributed the website of making a fresh start usually, so the life-span in territory can be used to discern suspicious Malware website.For example, new distribution website is constantly created and can only be had several weeks before website is removed.In order to determine the life-span in territory, sampler 610 can be used the public or private list of the domain name of nearest activation that may be available, for example from territory registration liquidation organization.
In some embodiments, Malware center 612 can be used as the central interface that is used for receiving from other Advertising Management System 104 request of advertisement malware detection.For example, though advertisement malware detection system 602 can be the assembly of the AdSense system of Google, compete Advertising Management System 104 can defrayment so that the Malware examination is carried out in advertisement under its control.So, advertisement malware detection system 602 can be used as the liquidation organization of the malware detection that is used for several Advertising Management Systems 104.
