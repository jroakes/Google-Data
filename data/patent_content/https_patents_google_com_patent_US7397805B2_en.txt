Definitions
- the invention relates generally to wireless communications and more specifically to techniques for allocating channel capacity among several user applications.
- the channel capacity of a communications channel indicates the maximum data rate that can be transmitted through the channel.
- the channel capacity is colloquially referred to as the channel's “bandwidth.”
- Fairness among users generally implies that the channel capacity has been successfully allocated among the users' data flows in proportion to the “weights” of the users.
- fluid fair queuing has long been a popular paradigm for achieving instantaneous fairness with bounds on the maximum delays in channel access.
- adapting wireline fair queuing to the wireless domain is complicated by domain-specific issues such as location-dependent transmission errors and errors from bursty channels. Consequently, several wireless fair queuing schemes have been proposed for adapting fair queuing to the wireless domain, but many problems still exist.
- Previous research adapting wireline fair queuing to the wireless domain has generally produced techniques that approximate fair queuing when the channel is clean.
- these techniques defer sending packets for the affected mobile user's data flow during the error bursts.
- the affected flow's time slots are instead used to transmit the packets of the clean flows.
- the transmission is resumed only when its link quality improves to an acceptable level.
- some of the techniques also supplement the mobile user with additional bandwidth to compensate for the time period when it was skipped. In this way the flow that was denied service because of the channel error is expected to eventually receive its fair share of services, once its channel becomes clean.
- a method of communicating a number of data flows on a shared communications channel includes the acts of (1) calculating a set of optimum goodput rates for the data flows, in order to maximize a total utility of the data flows, (2) calculating a set of optimum throughput rates for the data flows based on the optimum goodput rates, and (3) transmitting the data flows on the shared communications channel with the optimized throughput rates.
- the optimum goodput rates can be preferably found in response to utility functions for the various data flows, where the utility functions indicate the utility of the data flows, preferably as a function of their goodput rates.
- the method calculates the set of optimum throughput rates using (1) the relationship between throughput rates and goodput rates and (2) the optimum goodput rates.
- the relationship between throughput rates and goodput rates is preferably estimated by examining real-time operating conditions.
- the method additionally involves monitoring a transport layer of at least one of the data flows and, if the transport layer of that data flow is bottlenecked, temporarily blocking that data flow or temporarily assigning a low throughput rate to that data flow.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a variety of communication links for parallel data flows.
- FIG. 2 illustrates some of the conceptual network layers in the communications path between applications running on two devices.
- FIG. 3 illustrates the transmission of several parallel data flows through the network layers between two applications communicating over a communications channel.
- FIG. 4 is a high-level block diagram of one embodiment of a data transmission system that allocates resources on a shared channel.
- FIG. 5 is an overview flowchart of one embodiment of a method for transmitting multiple flows of data on a single shared channel.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart of one preferred implementation of a procedure for estimating overhead added by an application layer to a data flow.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of one preferred implementation of a procedure for estimating overhead added by a transport layer to a data flow.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart of one preferred implementation of a procedure for estimating overhead added by a link layer to a data flow.
- FIG. 9 is a flowchart of one preferred implementation of a procedure for modeling the relationship between throughput and goodput for a data flow.
- FIG. 10 is a flowchart of one preferred implementation of a procedure for finding the optimal goodput transmission rates.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a variety of communications links that can benefit from the network communications techniques described herein.
- the links can connect a central computer 150 , a client computer 110 , a portable computer 120 , peripherals such as a printer 160 , a wireless tower 165 , a mobile telephone 170 , a telephone network 180 , a satellite dish 185 , a communications satellite 190 , and a wire line telephone 195 . While these devices span a broad range of complexity and cost, the techniques herein described can be adapted to improve their usage of the data channels over which they communicate.
- Those data channels include, for example, wired links such as a local area network (LAN) 111 , a peripheral connection 113 , a digital subscriber line (DSL) 181 , a base station link 182 , a satellite dish link 183 , and a digital telephone link 184 , among others.
- the data channels also include wireless links such as a wireless link 121 (such as an IEEE 802.11 (a), (b), or (g) link), a cellular data link 122 (such as a 2.5 G or 3 G link), a wireless peripheral link 123 (such as a Bluetooth link), a cellular digital voice link 172 , and a satellite microwave link 192 , among others.
- client computer 110 communicates with central computer 150 through LAN 111 , and with printer 160 through peripheral connection 113 .
- Telephone network 180 communicates with central computer 150 through DSL line 181 , with wireless tower 165 through base station link 182 , with satellite dish 185 through satellite dish link 183 , and with wire line telephone 195 through digital telephone link 184 .
- Portable computer 120 communicates with central computer 150 through wireless link 121 , with printer 160 through wireless peripheral link 123 , and with wireless tower 165 through cellular data link 122 .
- Wireless tower 165 communicates with mobile telephone 170 through cellular digital voice link 172 .
- Satellite dish 185 and communications satellite 190 communicate through satellite microwave link 192 .
- the transmitted data can generally include a number of separate data flows.
- wireless link 121 can be used to transmit a variety of information streams in parallel between portable computer 120 and central computer 150 .
- the various data flows can be, for example, information sent by a file transfer application, information sent to a browser application, information sent by system software, and others. All these data flows need to efficiently share the common resource of the communications link (wireless link 121 ) that connects the two communication devices (portable computer 120 and central computer 150 ).
- the techniques described herein preferably look to the rate of goodput transmission, rather than the rate of throughput transmission, for each of the various data flows sharing a communications link.
- Information transmitted in a data flow includes payload data that are the intended objects of the communications.
- the goodput of a data flow is this payload information.
- the transmission also includes other information in addition to the payload.
- the additional information includes redundancy bits, retransmissions, packet headers, and other information that is important to the various layers of the communications system, but that is not directly important to the applications that have requested the communications.
- this information plus the goodput is the throughput of the data flow.
- “goodput” and “throughput” can be more precisely defined, based on the types of protocols used in the various layers of the communications system.
- FIG. 2 illustrates some of the conceptual network layers in the communications path between applications running on two devices, such as portable computer 120 and central computer 150 connected by wireless link 121 .
- Portable computer 120 and central computer 150 each have a series of programs that implement communications in layers. Shown in the FIG. 2 for portable computer 120 are an application layer 222 , a transport layer 228 , a network layer 230 , and a link layer 232 (also known as a data layer).
- central computer 150 also has an application layer 202 , a transport layer 208 , a network layer 210 , and a link layer 212 . Not all of these layers are necessarily implemented in all communications units.
- wireless link 121 can include a wireless access point (WAP) connected by cable to central computer 150 , and a wireless network card connected by socket to portable computer 120 . An RF connection between the central computer's WAP and the portable computer's network card completes the link 121 .
- WAP wireless access point
- portable computer 120 An RF connection between the central computer's WAP and the portable computer's network card completes the link 121 .
- a transmitting application such as an FTP server, running on portable computer 120 sends data through application layer 222 to transport layer 228 , which sends the data in turn to network layer 230 , which then sends the data to link layer 232 .
- Each layer can parse and encapsulate the transmitted data according to a variety of protocols.
- Each layer also cooperates with the previous and subsequent layer to smoothly control the timing of the data transfers.
- Link layer 232 in portable computer 120 transmits the data over wireless link 121 to link layer 212 in central computer 150 .
- the data received by link layer 212 are passed up the layers in central computer 150 .
- the received data are sent sequentially from link layer 212 through network layer 210 and transport layer 208 to application layer 202 , which makes them available to a receiving application, such as an FTP client on central computer 150 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates the transmission of several data flows through the communications layers of portable computer 120 . Shown by way of example are four data flows 310 , 320 , 330 , and 340 , identified by index numbers i that range from 1 to 4. Each data flow is a stream of transmitted data from an application on portable computer 120 and is being sent through the shared link 121 , intended for a particular application on another communications device.
- link layer 232 is the arbiter that allocates the channel resources of wireless link 121 among the data flows 310 , 320 , 330 , and 340 .
- the separate flows use interleaved time slots that are assigned to them by link layer 232 .
- the data flows 310 , 320 , 330 , and 340 in this implementation are not simultaneous flows in a strict sense. In this implementation, at any given instant the entire channel capacity of link 121 is assigned to a single data flow. However, in the sense that the data flows still share a common resource, they can be considered “parallel” or “simultaneous” flows even in this implementation.
- FEC is used in different layers, such as the application layer (source coding), network layer (overlay network) or link layer (channel coding) to protect information from packet loss by adding some redundant bits to the transmitted packets.
- FEC can deal both with channel corruption errors and with packet loss errors.
- FEC is coded by the information in each individual packet, it is used to tolerate some number of bit corruptions from channel interference.
- FEC is coded across multiple packets or multiple flows, it can be used to recover from both channel corruption error and congestion loss path error. In either case, there is a tradeoff between error recovery ability and bandwidth overhead. In general, more FEC bits mean more protection ability and less corruption loss. But more FEC bits also increase the bandwidth overhead because of the redundancy bits. This increase can be an undue expense when the channel error or congestion loss is not high.
- ARQ advanced retransmit threshold
- Some of the existing schemes compensate the flows experiencing corruption with an increased share of channel resources. Some existing schemes also require multiple ARQs to transmit a packet by adjusting weights according to the success rate of the transmission.
- a second common problem for application goodput is that no generic methods exist to guarantee the application layer goodput.
- Different schemes have been designed to take into account the overhead of techniques for combating wireless channel error, such as FEC and ARQ. But none of these schemes use the interaction of FEC, ARQ, and transport layer rate adaptation techniques to propose a generic framework guaranteeing goodput rates for the application layer.
- the design of communication protocols can also benefit from identifying the main reasons that cause the differences between throughput and goodput for the application layer. It is then possible to propose a fair queuing scheme with an adaptive link layer.
- the adaptive link layer can dynamically adjust weights of each flow to take these differences into account.
- FIG. 4 is a high-level block of one embodiment of a data transmission system 400 that allocates resources on a shared channel, such as wireless link 121 , in terms of the goodput rates for several data flows.
- the system has six interacting modules: a utility function and weight-specification module 410 , a utility-curve based weights generation module 420 , a weighted fair queuing module 430 , an application-layer overhead estimation module 440 , a transport-layer rate adaptation estimation module 450 , and a link layer FEC and/or ARQ overhead estimation module 460 .
- Three of the modules evaluate factors that contribute to overhead and other factors that make the throughput rate different from goodput rate for a data flow.
- Modules 440 , 450 , and 460 analyze each of the data flows being transmitted on the shared channel for the appropriate factors.
- a fourth module, the utility function and weight-specification module 410 characterizes the value of the various data flows.
- Module 410 specifies the relative weights to be accorded to each of the data flows.
- Module 410 also specifies information about the utility of increased transmission speed for the data flows; that is, it quantifies the value of increasing the transmission rate for each of the data flows. As discussed below, this module 410 usefully recognizes that an increased data rate benefits some flows more than others.
- data transmission system 400 includes two modules that use information collected by the other four modules to efficiently allocate the resources of the shared channel among the various data flows. These two modules include utility-curve based weights generation module 420 and weighted fair queuing module 430 .
- Module 420 preferably receives the information generated by modules 440 , 450 , and 460
- module 430 preferably receives the information generated by modules 460 and 420 .
- the utility function and weight specification module 410 enables the higher layer (typically, based on application or user-level service level agreement) to specify the utility function and weight for each application flow. These two parameters jointly capture the price that the application is willing to pay for effective service—a “goodput” rate of overhead-free useful data.
- the weight utility of a flow i is specified as w i U i (r i ), where the quantity w i and the function U i (r i ) are provided by the higher layer.
- w i is the assigned weight of flow number i
- the variable r i is the transmission rate of the goodput information in flow number i
- U i (r i ) is the utility function for flow number i.
- the utility function U i (r i ) borrows from concepts of economics to quantify the value of increasing the goodput data rate for each flow i.
- the goal is to optimize the aggregate weighted utility of the system subject to channel and capacity constraints.
- the overhead estimation modules include three separate but interacting modules for assessing the added overhead in each layer.
- the application layer overhead estimation module 440 takes into account the difference between goodput and throughput in the application layer. Because a particular application may not in itself include such functionality, this module 440 can preferably reside in the middleware and provide standard service to each application running on top of it.
- the transport layer rate adaptation estimation module 450 reports the packet loss rate seen at the transport layer. If UDP is used as the transport protocol, only the loss percentage needs to be considered. On the other hand, if elastic protocols such as TCP or RAP are used, the rate adaptation due to the packet loss also needs to be considered.
- Link layer FEC and ARQ overhead estimation module 460 is used to capture the overhead of channel FEC coding and retransmission at the link layer.
- the overhead of ARQ is considered in some wireless fair scheduling schemes but not in other schemes.
- a second preferred feature of the system is that the allocation of the channel resources are preferably based on the specified value of the data flow (preferably, the specified weight w i and utility function U i (r i )).
- the utility curve based weights generation module 420 preferably takes the output of the overhead estimation modules 440 , 450 , 460 as its input, and based on the set of ⁇ w i , U i (r i ), and overhead ratio>parameters for all the flows on the shared channel, generates the link-layer weights that are used to determine slot allocation for the flows under the fair scheduling technique.
- the goal of this module 420 is to generate the link-layer weights for slot allocation such that the aggregate weighted utility of the system is maximized.
- a third preferred feature of the system is that the fair scheduling module 430 takes the link-layer weights for the flows and allocates to each flow an appropriate portion of the of the shared channel's resources.
- these resources are time slots for transmission, such as interleaved time slots on wireless link 121 .
- the resources can alternatively be measured as other units of the channels resources, such as the frequency bands in an FDMA link or the spreading codes in a CDMA link.
- the simplest technique for allocating time slots is a weighted round robin scheduler that allocates the channel in accordance with the flow weights, without any consideration for perceived location-dependent channel error. More sophisticated techniques, such as Wireless Packet Scheduling (WPS), may be used in order to account for bursty and location-dependent channel error.
- WPS Wireless Packet Scheduling
- standard wireless fair scheduling techniques are used without modification.
- the utility function and weight specification module 410 specifies the application-level goodput fairness model. It provides the network operator or the user application the flexibility to specify the utility curve according to their needs.
- the data rate r indicates the number of bits per second of payload that are transmitted for a certain application.
- r does not include the transmission of overhead bits that accompany the application's payload.
- a utility function U(r) can be specified to indicate the value or worth of the data flow as a function of the flow's goodput rates r.
- the function U(r) generally increases as a function or r, indicating that a data flow is more valuable to the system and its users if the data flow is transmitted at a high data rate than if it is transmitted at a low data rate.
- the function U(r) quantitatively expresses this worth.
- U(r) is expected to be a concave function, meaning that its slope decreases as a function of r.
- the utility function U(r) can be modeled as continuous, differentiable, increasing, and strictly concave over the range r ⁇ 0.
- the derivative of U(r) indicates the marginal utility of the data flow.
- the marginal utility can be recognized in economic terms as an important quantity for identifying optimal conditions for a system.
- U(r) The concaveness of U(r) is due to the decreasing marginal value of high goodput rates.
- a fixed increase in transmission rate is typically more valuable to a flow when the data rate is slow than when the data rate is high.
- an increase in data rate by 50 kb/s can be beneficial, but the value of the benefit depends on the current data rate for the flow: an increase from 10 kb/s to 60 kb/s is generally more significant to a user application than is an increase in that flow from 1000 kb/s to 1050 kb/s.
- any type of concave utility function can achieve a corresponding fairness model.
- any fairness objective in application level can be modeled by the following approach: Maximize ⁇ i w i U i (r i ) subject to ⁇ i F i ( r i ) ⁇ C, where r i is the application layer goodput rate and w i is the flow weight.
- the quantity C is the channel capacity.
- the function F i (r i ) is an “overhead function” that indicates the actual sending rate (throughput rate) at the link layer, including the overheads from all the layers.
- the throughput rate F i (r i ) is larger than the goodput rate r because in addition to the payload bits that make up the goodput, the throughput includes error-correction bits, retransmission bits, and other overhead bits for the data flow.
- the above approach provides the set of r i , the optimized application-layer goodput sending rates.
- the following discussion describes the preferred operation of the overhead calculating modules 440 , 450 , and 460 , which provide information on the throughput rate F i (r i ) that is needed to achieve a given goodput rate r i .
- overhead estimation modules include the three separate but interacting estimation modules 440 , 450 , and 460 , which operates on different layers to determine the overhead functions F i ( ).
- the following discussion focuses on how each layer can introduce overhead, and how the layers interacts with each other to create the added overhead.
- bits in a data stream are not equal. Some bits belong to segments defining vital information such as control messages, synchronization messages, or the main frame of a Group of Block (GOB). Some bits belong to lower priority segments that are data messages, or dependent frames of a GOB.
- wireless communications systems protect against wireless channel corruption loss and provide experiences similar to the wireline counterpart by adding some enhanced form of error correction. These additional mechanisms for removing the errors and restoring the original information are often deployed by the application layer. They include techniques such as (a) interleaving, (b) forward error correction (FEC), and (c) automatic repeat request (ARQ). These three application-layer techniques, and others, contribute to a data flow's overhead. Each technique creates overhead in a different way.
- Interleaving is a mechanism to reorganize and redistribute the information to un-adjacent frames to deal with bursty wireless channel error.
- FEC is commonly suggested for real-time applications due to the strict delay requirements.
- FEC incurs constant transmission overhead even when the channel is loss-free.
- a number of adaptive and hierarchical FEC coding schemes have been proposed. They all share the common point that the packets are divided into multiple priorities or classes and different levels of FEC protection are used to protect packets of different classes. For example, MPEG2 video can be classified into four classes including control class, I class, P class and B class.
- FEC could also be coded in a layered/hierarchical manner and could be transmitted when the corresponding data layer information is transmitted.
- Common FEC coding schemes include Reed-Solomon and Rate-compatible Punctured Convolutional.
- the application-layer overhead estimation module 440 of data transmission system uses an overhead ratio ⁇ appl to model the application layer FEC and ARQ overhead and a loss ratio ⁇ appl to model the overhead of the application layer loss.
- ⁇ appl the application-layer goodput rate
- ⁇ appl the loss ratio
- Transport layer protocols can be generally divided into two categories.
- One category is non-elastic protocols, i.e., UDP, which does not adjust transmission rate upon packet loss.
- the other category is elastic protocols, which adjust the transmission rate upon packet loss.
- TCP traffic is the main traffic of the Internet and many other protocols use the TCP-friendly congestion control schemes to control the transmission rate. From the angle of congestion control and rate adaptation techniques, these protocols have a similar analysis to TCP.
- rate adaptation when the packet loss ratio is high, the transport layer transmission rate T could be so small that the transport layer is the bottleneck between application layer and the link layer. In this case, although the link layer provides the flow with enough bandwidth, the flow cannot get service because the sender queue may be empty due to the bottleneck at the transport layer.
- the wireless fair scheduling schemes only track the backlogged flows (flows with packets in the queue) and give credits to the flow if the flow's transmission either fails or gets postponed by the channel error. Because the flows with transport-layer bottleneck have an empty queue and receive no credit at the link layer, their fair share cannot be claimed back later when packets at the transport layer pour in. So the net result is that the flows with transport-layer backlogs receive an unfairly low share of the service.
- Transport-layer rate adaptation estimation module 450 preferably uses this approach to model the overhead generated in the transport layer.
- the average transport layer transmission rate T is calculated using measured average packet loss rate ⁇ tran and equation (7).
- the average expected application-layer transmission rate R (application-layer goodput together with application layer overhead) is obtained from the application layer. If T ⁇ R, no compensation is needed because the transport layer is not the bottleneck. Otherwise, if T ⁇ R, the link layer weight w has to be adjusted accordingly.
- r tran is the rate adjustment ratio (R/T) and utility function is U(r).
- link layers Similar to the application layer, link layers also typically use channel coding FEC and ARQ to combat the channel corruption. Because the link layers usually obtain the channel condition much quicker than upper layers, more advanced FEC and ARQ schemes tend to be used. Adaptive FEC coding schemes are proposed to adjust protection ability under the current channel state and to decrease where possible unnecessary FEC overhead. Compared with application-layer FEC, the adjustment frequency of link-layer FEC is much faster. ARQ is more suitable in the link layer than in the application layer, since application-layer retransmission is end-to-end. ARQ in the link layer is local and is commonly used in wireless LAN scenarios, because it has a smaller delay between consecutive tries.
- link layer FEC and/or ARQ overhead estimation module 460 uses the quantity ⁇ link to denote the packet loss ratio of the link layer, and the quantity alink to denote the FEC overhead of the link layer and the residue ARQ that is not considered by fair queuing schemes.
- Application-layer overhead estimation module 440 determines ⁇ appl to model the application layer FEC and ARQ overhead, and ⁇ appl to model the overhead of the application layer loss ratio.
- Transport-layer rate adaptation estimation module 450 determines the quantity ⁇ tran to model packet loss rate for non-elastic protocols, and the quantity r tran to model the influence of rate adaptation of elastic protocols.
- Link layer FEC and/or ARQ overhead estimation module 460 determines the quantity ⁇ link to model link layer FEC and residue ARQ overhead and the quantity ⁇ link to denote the link layer packet loss. Also notice that each layer's adjustment interval could be different. Assume t appl , t tran , and t link are the adjustment intervals of application layer, transport layer and link layer, respectively. It is reasonable to assume that t appl ⁇ t tran ⁇ t link .
- the packet loss at the lower layers may or may not be recovered by the upper layers' reliable transmission schemes, such as ARQ schemes.
- the total system-wide packet loss rate is therefore not simply the sum of loss rates of each layer.
- the loss rate for the flow at each layer is the sum of loss rate of each sub-flow at each layer.
- the system wide packet loss ratio ⁇ is seen by choosing the minimum among the loss ratios at each layer.
- ⁇ appl ⁇ i ⁇ appl,i
- ⁇ tran ⁇ i ⁇ tran,i
- ⁇ link ⁇ i ⁇ link,i .
- F loss ( r ) r /(1 ⁇ ).
- Equation (13) when T ⁇ R, equation (13) is the overhead function and when T ⁇ R, equation (14) is the overhead function.
- the overhead function is then made available to (or is calculated by) utility-curve based weights generation module 420 .
- WPS Wireless Packet Scheduling
- WRR basic weighted round robin
- FIG. 5 is an overview flowchart of one embodiment of a method for transmitting multiple flows of data on a single shared channel.
- the data flows being transmitted in this embodiment each connect one application (either a user application or a system application) at one end of the channel to another application at the other end of the channel.
- the data flows can be considered “parallel” data flows in the sense that they share the same channel, even if the channel uses time-division multiplexing to transmit the flows in time slots, sending one flow at a time.
- the total number of parallel data flows depends on the number of applications that are trying to communicate over the shared channel. Let the symbol N indicate the total number of parallel flows.
- the method determines a weighted utility for the goodput of the i-th flow.
- the weighted utility of flow number i is preferably given by two quantities: a number w i (the assigned weight for the i-th flow), and a function U i (r i ) (indicating the utility of the i-th flow as a function of r i , the goodput of the i-th flow).
- These utility functions can be assigned by the method, or they can be received from an over-layer of system tools that indicate how much priority is to be given to each flow.
- Block 514 estimates the various forms of overhead that arise in the application layer of the transmitting system.
- a primary source of application-layer overhead is the redundancy and other overhead from error-protection tools, such as interleaving, FEC, or ARQ.
- the estimation can be preformed by looking up the overhead characteristics in a data table, by receiving the overhead information from another source, or preferably, by making repeated empirical measurements of the overhead as a function of time.
- block 516 estimates the overhead added in the transport layer, including overhead from error-protection tools.
- Block 516 also preferably evaluates the loss rate in the transport layer, including packet loss rates, required retransmission rates, and average transmission rates.
- Block 518 estimates the overhead added in the link layer, and block 519 uses the information from blocks 512 , 514 , 516 , and 518 to generate a composite model of the overhead for data flow number i.
- This composite model can be symbolized by the function F i (r i ), which indicates the throughput rate F i that is needed to achieve a desired goodput rate r i on data flow number i.
- Block 520 uses the flow weights w i , the utility functions U i (r i ), and the overhead functions F i (r i ) from all of the N parallel data flows to find the optimal goodput rates for each data flow. Since a single communications channel can only communicate a limited amount of information at a time, this optimization takes into account the limits of the shared channel resource. Block 520 does its optimization in light of the channel capacity C of the shared channel.

- block 1020 generates the optimized goodput rate for each flow number i among the N data flows.
- the mechanisms described above can be used to dynamically adjust the weights of the link layer weighted fair queuing schemes to guarantee the application layer goodput rate and the optimization of overall system-wide goodput.
- the techniques related in the above discussions and equations can be suitable for different utility functions and fairness models.
- the utility function gives applications or system operators the flexibility to express the relative importance of the data and/or the price the application is willing to pay for the service.
- goodput better captures the requirements of the applications than the previous techniques using throughput.
- Goodput only considers useful application layer data packets that are directly related to the application performance. Compared with link layer throughput, goodput is a better index than throughput from the user's point of view.
Abstract
Description
Maximize Σi wiUi(ri)
subject to
Σi F i(r i)≦C,
where ri is the application layer goodput rate and wi is the flow weight. The quantity C is the channel capacity. The function Fi(ri) is an “overhead function” that indicates the actual sending rate (throughput rate) at the link layer, including the overheads from all the layers. As discussed above, the throughput rate Fi(ri) is larger than the goodput rate r because in addition to the payload bits that make up the goodput, the throughput includes error-correction bits, retransmission bits, and other overhead bits for the data flow.
for all i,j, w i U′ i(r i)=w j U′ j(r j)=K
where K is some constant. So the optimum rate ri is:
for all i, r i=(U′ i)−1(K/w i). (1)
r i=(U′ i)−1(K/w i)=w i /K, (2)
and the constraint condition in terms of the throughput rates Fi(ri) becomes
Σi F i(r i)=Σi F i(w i /K)=1. (3)
Σi F i(r i)=Σi F i((w i /K)1/2)=1. (4)
F appl(r i)=r i*(1+αappl,i)/(1−βappl,i) (5)
F tran,i(r i)=r i/(1−βtran,i) (6)
T=s/(RTT*(2 βtran/3)1/2), (7)
where s is the packet size and RTT is the round trip time.
K/w new =U′ i((U′ i)−1(K/w old)*(R/T). (8)
Hence, if the utility function U(r) is log(r),
w new =r tran *w old=(R/T)w old. (9)
Similarly, if the utility function U(r) is (−1/r),
w new=(r tran)2 w old=(R/T)2 w old. (10)
F fec-arq(r)=r*(1+αappl)*(1+αtran)*(1+αlink)
≈r*(1+αappl+αtran+αlink)=r*(1+α). (11)
β=min {βappl, βtran, βlink}.
βappl=Σi βappl,i, βtran=Σi βtran,i, and βlink=Σi βlink,i.
β=min {βappl, βtran, βlink}.
The system-wide loss function is then:
F loss(r)=r/(1−β). (12)
F(r)=r*(1+α)/(1−β). (13)
F(r)=r*r tran*(1+α)/(1−β). (14)
F(r)=r*μ. (15)
The overhead ratio μ has a value of μ=(1+α)/(1−β) when T≧R, and a value of μ=rtran(1+α)/(1−β) when T≦R.
for all i, r i=(U′ i)−1(K/w i) (1)
r i=(U′ i)−1(K/w i)=w i /K (2)
and equation (15) indicates that the constraint condition from equation (3) becomes
Σi F i(r i)=Σi μi×(w i /K)=1. (16)
so that K=Σi μiwi and the overhead functions are Fi(ri)=μiwi/Σi μiwi.
Σi F i(r i)=Σi μi((w i /K)1/2)=1. (17)
so K=(Σi μi(wi 1/2))2 and the overhead functions are Fi(ri)=μi(wi 1/2)/(Σi μi(wi 1/2)).
6. Weighted Wireless Fair Queuing Module
-
- Spreading: generates a time slot allocation identical to weighted fair queuing (WFQ) or worst-case fair weighted fair queuing (WF2Q) when all flows are backlogged.
- Swapping within frame: when a flow cannot transmit in its slot because of channel error, it tries to swaps its slot with another backlogged flow that (a) has been allocated a slot later in the same frame, and (b) perceives a good channel at the current time; intra-frame swapping is a first level mechanism to accommodate location-dependent errors.
- Credit adjustment: when a flow f1 cannot transmit during its slot and cannot swap slots within a frame, but there is at least one backlogged flow f2 that can transmit at the current time (f2 does not have any slots during the remainder of the frame), f1's credit is incremented and f2's credit is decremented (both within bounds); the effective weight of each flow at the start of a frame is the aggregate of its default weight and its credit, and the spreading technique generates a slot allocation with respect to the effective weights of the flows. Thus, credit adjustment compensates lagging flows at the expense of leading flows in future frames.
- The credit adjustment procedure preferably uses interaction between weighted
fair queuing module 430 and link layer FEC and/or ARQoverhead estimation module 460.Module 460 identifies backlogs in the link layer, and provides this information tomodule 460. Where possible,module 460 preferably adjusts the credits of the flows so that the backlogged flows can be compensated later.
- The credit adjustment procedure preferably uses interaction between weighted
- One-step prediction: predicts that the channel state for the current time slot will be the same as the monitored channel state during the previous time slot.
7. Embodiment of a Method for Transmitting Multiple Data Flows
where Ri is the application-layer transmission rate, and where Ti is the average transmission rate, estimated by:
where rtran,i is described above in the discussion of
Σi F i((U′ i)−1(K/w i))≦C
r i=(U′ i)−1(K/w i)
With this set of optimized goodput rates, block 530 from
