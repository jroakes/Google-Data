FIG. 3 illustrates an example where a plurality ofusers device - As shown in
FIG. 3 , theusers devices device 100 described above. For purposes of ease,devices device 302. - There may be background noise, including
music 320, within café 300. Whilemusic 320 is shown as being played through a speaker,music 320 may include a DJ, live music, radio, etc. The background noise may also include people talking, outside noise such as traffic and construction, or any variety of other noises. - The
device 302 may detect the background noise, such as through the microphone, and determine a volume level of the background noise. For example, thedevice 302 may determine whether the background noise volume exceeds a predetermined threshold to be considered loud. Thedevice 302 may include a plurality of predetermined thresholds or intervals to determine whether the background noise volume is loud, conversational, quiet, etc. For example, if the background noise volume is below 50 dB, the background noise volume may be determined to be quiet. If the background noise volume is between 50-70 decibels (dB), the background noise volume may be determined to be conversational or allow for conversation. If the background noise volume is between 70-90 dB, the background noise volume may be determined to be noisy, such a heavy traffic or a noisy restaurant. If the background noise volume level is above 90 dB, the background noise volume may be determined to be loud, such as a live sporting event or music. The ranges described herein are merely examples. The volume ranges for what constitutes noisy, conversational, or quiet may change as thedevice 302 receives verification or feedback from users about the noise levels. For example, thedevice 302 may ask verification questions pertaining to the received audio input. The verification questions may ask whether the background noise volume level is loud. If the user answers yes, the device may determine the background noise volume level, in decibels, and use that volume level to create or update the ranges. Moreover, the classifications provided herein are merely exemplary and may have different labels and may change based on the feedback from users. - The
device 302 may determine the type of background noise based on the audio input. For example, thedevice 302 may determine whether the received audio input is the background chatter of people talking, music playing, street noise, etc. Thedevice 302 may determine that the received audio input is a combination ofmusic 320, background chatter, street noise, etc. According to some examples, thedevice 302 may determine additional audio properties for each of the determined types of background noise. The additional audio properties may include, for example, a volume level, pitch, tone, frequency, intensity, direction, etc. If the device determines that the received audio is music, the device may determine a genre, artist, song title, etc. - In examples where the background noise is the lull of people chattering, the device may determine a volume level associated with the background chatter. In some examples where the background noise is the lull of people chattering, the
device 302 may determine a pitch, tone, etc. associated with the chatter. A user may disable receiving background noise as audio input at any time. Similar to determining whether the background noise volume is loud, thedevice 302 may determine whether the volume of the chatter exceeds a predetermined threshold to be considered loud. Thedevice 302 may include a plurality of predetermined thresholds or intervals to determine whether the volume of the chatter is loud, average, quiet, etc. A quiet chatter volume may indicate that meetings or other conversations can easily occur. In some examples, thedevice 302 may determine whether people are talking loudly over other background noise, such as overmusic 320. - In examples where the background noise is music playing, such as
music 320, the device may determine additional audio properties, such as a volume level, genre, title of the song, etc. For example, thedevice 302 may determine a volume level associated with themusic 320. Similar to determining whether the background noise volume is loud, thedevice 302 may determine whether the music volume exceeds a predetermined threshold to be considered loud. Thedevice 302 may include a plurality of predetermined thresholds or intervals to determine whether the music volume is loud, average, quiet, etc. According to some examples, thedevice 302 may determine other audio properties formusic 320. Thedevice 302 may determine a music genre, a title of the song playing, whether the music is recorded or whether theremusic 320 is a live band, etc. - The audio properties may further be associated with timestamps. In this regard, a particular point of interest may be associated with multiple different audio properties at different points in time. For example, while a coffee shop may be a quiet place for working during the day, it may also be a lively spot with loud folk music in the evening.
- Location information may be received and associated with the audio input. For example, the GPS sensors may provide an indication as to the location of the
device 302. The GPS data that provides the indication of the location of thedevice 302 may be used to determine a point of interest associated with that location. In some examples, information from the sensors and/or from interactions with devices such as wireless base stations or wireless access points, RFID readers, etc., can be employed by the position determination module to calculate or otherwise estimate the physical location ofdevice 302. Other examples of location determination systems may determine location based on images of geographic objects such as landmarks, semantic indicators such as light or noise level, etc. While these are a few examples, it should be understood that any of a variety of location determination techniques may be used. - Location information is only provided when authorized by the user, such as when the device is configured to allow for sharing of location information. The user may enable or disable providing location, and may limit the recipients of such information and/or the applications or use of the location information. Moreover, the location data excludes any personal information. According to some examples, a user may adjust settings on the device to enable providing location information when the device is in particular geographical areas, at certain times, or conditions, such as when the device is within Bluetooth range of a predetermined number of other user devices. The user may set the device to automatically disable providing location information in particular locations, such as familiar locations.
- The audio input may be received by the device, such that the device may determine the one or more audio properties. The one or more determined audio properties may be received at the servers. According to some examples, the audio input may be received at the servers from a number of devices which have authorized sharing of detected background noise information. The user can enable or disable receiving background noise as audio input, and the device may only receive background noise as audio input if the user has enabled this feature. According to some examples, a user may adjust settings on the device to restrict sharing to particular geographical areas, particular audio properties or a subset of audio properties, times, or conditions, such as when the device is within Bluetooth range of a predetermined number of other user devices. Moreover, the user may set the one or more microphones to automatically disable in particular locations. According to some examples, the user may set the device to automatically disable receiving background noise as audio input in particular locations, such as familiar locations. The user may further configure the device to receive audio input without further active input from the user.
- The device may ask the user to verify or provide feedback regarding the received audio input. For example, the device may ask a series of verification questions regarding the location information, volume levels, type of background noise, etc. In examples where the background noise includes music, the verification questions may be about the genre, artist, song title, etc. of the music playing. The questions are used to verify the audio properties associated with the point of interest before updating the audio properties associated with the point of interest.
-
FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate examples where the user may be asked to verify the audio properties of the audio input received by the device. For example, the device may display a series of prompts or questions to the user. The questions may ask the user to verify the location, the music genre, whether the environment is noisy or quiet, whether there is a live music or a DJ, whether the background noise is loud, whether the music is loud, etc. The device may determine, based on the user's engagement with the prompts, whether to ask more questions. In some examples, the device may look to a user's past cooperation and/or participation with providing feedback for other applications to determine whether to ask a series of questions verifying the audio properties. - As shown in
FIG. 4A ,device 402 may display afirst question 430 seeking feedback. The first question may ask to verify the point of interest. For example,question 430 asks the user to confirm whether the point of interest is a café. The user may answer yes 440 or no 450. This may verify the location information to be associated with the audio input. In some examples, there may be an option to “end” 460. The user may select end 460 if the user does not want to answer any verification questions. -
FIG. 4B illustrates a second question. Thesecond question 432 may be asked based on receiving a response to thefirst question 430. Thesecond question 432 may ask about the overall background volume level. The background volume level may include street noise, chatter, music, etc. The user may answerquestion 432 with a yes 442, no 452, or end 462. In some examples, the answer may be a ranking scale that the user can provide a rank between 1-10, with 1 being the quietest and 10 being the loudest. In some examples, the scale may be between 1-5. The scale may be a sliding scale, such that the user does not have to select one number but, instead, slides a marker along a scale to indicate the background volume level. The user may select end 462 if the user does not want to answer additional verification questions -
FIG. 4C illustrates a third question that may be based on thesecond question 432. Thesecond question 432 may ask about the background noise volume level. The background noise may include music. In some examples, based on the answer to question 432, thethird question 434 may ask whether the music volume is loud. The user may select yes 444, no 454, or end 464. In some examples, the user may answer based on a ranking scale or a sliding scale to denote whether the music is loud or not. If the user selectsend 464 no further questions will be asked. - Based on the answers provided by the user in response to the verification questions, the audio properties of the point of interest may be updated in real time. For example, information regarding the particular point of interest may include indications pertaining to the type of background noise in real-time. If the type of background noise is music, the information regarding the particular point of interest may include indication of the music genre, the title of a song playing at the time audio input is received, artist, volume level of the music, etc. As one example, the information regarding a particular point of interest may indicate that classic rock is playing at a moderate volume level at the time the audio input is received.
- In some examples, real-time audio properties may be compared to historical audio properties, or historical and real-time audio properties may be combined in a statistical model to produce a better estimate. For example, an evaluation period such as a week, a month, etc. may be used. The real-time audio properties may be provided for display in relation to the historical data for the given point of interest.
-
FIG. 5 illustrates another example where a plurality of users are in a particular point of interest and their respective devices may be detecting audio properties of the background noise. For example,users bowling alley 500.Users device Devices device 100 described herein. For purposes of ease,device - Within the
bowling alley 500, there may be background noise. The background noise may include the sound of voices, the lull of conversations, or chatter, the sound of the bowling ball hitting the pins,music 520, etc.Music 520 may be live music, a DJ, radio (i.e. different music tracks mixed together so that there is no gap between them), music from a jukebox, etc. -
Devices 502 may receive the background noise, includingmusic 520, as audio input. Thedevice 502 may determine a type or types of background noise. For example, the device may determine that there are conversations happening, music is playing, and there is some noise associated with the activity in the particular point of interest. Inbowling alley 500, the noise associated with the activity may be the sound of the bowling ball hitting the pins. According to some examples, thedevice 502 may determine additional audio properties for each of the determined types of background noise. The additional audio properties may include an overall background noise volume level, a volume level for chatter, a volume level for music, a genre of music, etc. - In examples where the
device 502 determines that the background noise includes the sound of voices or chatter at the particular point of interest, thedevice 502 may determine a volume level associated with the chatter. According to some examples, thedevice 502 may determine that people in thebowling alley 500 are talking loudly. People in the bowling alley may have to talk loudly to be heard over themusic 520 and/or the sound of the ball hitting the pins. For example, on a weekend night, such as Friday or Saturday night, a live band may playing at thebowling alley 500 with the volume on the speakers turned all the way up. Themusic 520 may be very loud causing people to have to talk very loud to be heard overmusic 520. In some examples, thedevice 502 may determine other audio properties associated with the chatter. For example, thedevice 502 may determine a pitch, tone, frequency, etc. associated with the chatter. - During some periods of time, the
device 502 may determine that people in thebowling alley 500 are talking quietly. In such an example, thedevice 502 may determine that the other types of background noise, such asmusic 520, are also quiet. For example, during the day on a weekday, themusic 520 may be a radio station playing in the background as thebowling alley 500 may not be as busy. - In examples where the background noise includes
music 520, the device may determine a volume level associated with themusic 520. For example, thedevice 502 may classify the volume level of the music as loud, average, or quiet, etc. Loud music may bemusic 520 that is played at a volume level above 100 dB. Average music may bemusic 520 that is played at a volume level between 60 dB to 100 dB. Quiet music may bemusic 520 that is played at a volume level below 60 dB. These ranges are merely examples and may depend on the particular point of interest. For example, if a user is at a concert, a loud volume level may be music that is played at a volume level above 120 dB and a quiet volume level may be music that is played at a volume level below 80 dB. Thus, the ranges and labels are merely examples and may change or be called different things. - According to some examples where the background noise includes
music 520, thedevice 502 may determine a music genre, a title of the song playing, the name of the artist, whether themusic 520 is live, on the radio, or being played by a DJ, etc. The determined audio properties associated with the point of interest may be shared with or sent to a server to update information pertaining to the particular point of interest. For example, if the device determines that the bowling alley is playing pop music by a particular artist, those audio properties may be used to update the audio properties associated with the bowling alley in real time. - The audio properties may be associated with a time stamp and particular place of interest. For example, as the
device 502 determines the audio properties, the audio properties may be associated with the time they were collected and where they were collected. Audio properties associated with the background noise in thebowling alley 500 on a Tuesday afternoon may be different than the audio properties associated with the background noise in thebowling alley 500 on a Friday night. For example, on a Tuesday afternoon, the background noise of thebowling alley 500 may have a quieter overall background noise volume level. This may allow for a meeting or conversation to occur within thebowling alley 500 and/or while bowling. Themusic 520 may be a classic rock radio station played at a moderate or average volume level. On a Friday night, the background noise of thebowling alley 500 may have a loud overall background noise volume level. The loud background noise volume may be due to a live band or a DJ playing at thebowling alley 500. Thus,music 520 may be very loud. Theloud music 520 may deter people from hosting meetings or having conversations at thebowling alley 500 on a Friday night. - As described previously herein, the determined audio properties of the received audio input may be received at a server from a plurality of devices that have previously authorized the sharing of the determined audio properties. The user may enable or disable the receiving background noise as audio input and the determining of audio properties of the received audio input. The determined audio properties may be aggregated and used to build a model of the audio properties associated with the point of interest. The determined audio properties may be grouped based on the associated time stamp or the time the audio properties were determined. Once the model is built, subsequently received audio properties may be used to update the model. As such, when subsequent search queries are received, the information about the audio properties associated with particular points of interest may be provided to other users in response.

FIGS. 6A-6C illustrate examples of questions that may be asked to verify the location information and/or audio properties of the received audio input. As described herein, the questions may ask the user to confirm the particular point of interest, the music genre, whether the music is live, the background noise volume level, the music volume level, etc. The device may determine, based on the user's engagement with the prompts, whether to ask more questions. In some examples, the device may look to a user's past cooperation and/or participation with providing feedback for other applications to determine whether to ask a series of questions verifying the audio properties. -
FIGS. 6A-6C may ask verification questions regarding the audio input received while at the bowling alley as compared toFIG. 4A-4C which may ask verification questions regarding the audio input received while at the café. The questions that may be asked may be based on the type of background noise detected, the volume of the background noise, whether the background noise is chatter or music, etc. - As shown in
FIG. 6A ,device 602 may display afirst question 630 seeking feedback regarding the audio input received while at the bowling alley. Thefirst question 630 may ask the user to verify the point of interest. For example,question 630 may ask the user to confirm whether the point of interest is a bowling alley. The user may answerquestion 630 with a yes 640, no 650, or end 660. This may verify the location information to be associated with the audio input.

For example, the updated information may provide a user information that on Monday country music is played, on Tuesday pop music is played, on Wednesday classic rock is played, on Thursday there is live music, etc. The updated information may allow users to identify particular points of interest based on the determined audio properties. - Once a model of the audio properties associated with a point of interest is built, a user may search the model.
FIG. 8 illustrates an example interface of a search query for finding or determining a plurality of points of interest based on audio properties associated with those points of interest.Device 800 may include adisplay 820,output 816,input 810 and at least onemicrophone 812.Display 820 may include asearch bar 824 and amap section 822.Map section 822 may include aposition identifier 826 showing the current location of thedevice 800. -
Display 820 may further include a plurality of search options including “explore” 830, “commute” 832, “for you” 834, and “audio” 836. “Explore” 830 provides a plurality of suggestions based on the location indicated byposition identifier 826 of thedevice 800 or any selected geographic location. For example, selecting “explore” 830 may provide suggestions such as cake shows, family restaurants, activities, golf courses, etc. around the location indicated byposition identifier 826 of thedevice 800 or any other geographic location searched by the user. “Commute” 832 may check the traffic between thelocation 826 of thedevice 800 and a preset address set by the user. The preset address may be the address of the user's location of work. “For you” 834 may provide suggestions regarding points of interest around the location indicated byposition identifier 826 of thedevice 800 that are open for business. When selecting “for you” 834, the suggestions may include restaurants, events, businesses, etc. - “Audio” 836 may allow the user to search for locations based on audio properties associated with the points of interest. The user may search based on the type of background noise, such as whether there is conversation and/or music, the volume level of the background noise, the volume level of conversation, the volume level of the music, whether there is other noise in the background such as construction or traffic noise. The user may search particular audio properties with respect to the type of background noise. For example, the user may want to find a location that will allow for conversation that can be heard over the background noise. Thus, the user may use the “audio” 836 search to find a place with quiet background noise. In some examples, the user may want to find a location that has a live band playing on a Friday night. The user may be able to refine the search to find only points of interest that have audio properties indicating that a live band plays on Friday nights.
- Allowing users to search and identify points of interest based on the associated audio properties may help find a place best suited for their needs. For example, people with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty having conversations when there is relatively high background noise level, and therefore may prefer to identify establishments with low background noise levels. Additionally, people with reduced hearing sensitivity who do not want to have a conversation may prefer establishments with higher volumes of music. As such, allowing users to identify establishments with high music volumes would benefit this category of person.
