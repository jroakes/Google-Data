- FIG. 2 shows a high-level diagram 200 where the input video signal x 202 is decomposed into two sets of features by a feature set device 104 .

- the input video signal x 202 can also be decomposed by spatiotemporal frequency, signal vs. noise, or by using some image model.
- the input video signal x 202 can be decomposed using a combination of any of the different categories.
- each one can be more appropriately encoded by encoder 106 with one or more of the different encoders E i 204 , 206 using different encoder parameters to produce bitstreams b i 208 , 210 .
- the encoder E 106 can also make joint use of the individual feature encoders E i 204 , 206 .

- output video signal x′ 216 corresponds to the input video signal x 202 .
- FIG. 3 shows a diagram of the proposed High-Efficiency Video Coding (HVC) approach.
- HVC High-Efficiency Video Coding
- the features used as a part of HVC are based on a spatial frequency decomposition. It is understood, however, that the principles described for HVC can be applied to features other than spatial frequency decomposition.
- an input video signal x 302 is provided to the divider 105 , which includes a partitioning module 304 and a channel analysis module 306 .
- the partitioning module 304 is configured to analyze the input video signal x 302 according to a given feature set, e.g. spatial frequency, and divide or partition the input video signal x 302 into a plurality of partitions based on the feature set.
- the partitioning of the input video signal x 302 is based on the rules corresponding to the given feature set. For example, since the spatial frequency content varies within a picture, each input picture is partitioned by partitioning module 304 so that each partition can have a different spatial frequency decomposition so that each partition has a different feature set.
- an input video partition can be decomposed into 2 ⁇ 2 bands based on spatial frequency, e.g. low-low, low-high, high-low, and high-high for a total of four feature sets, or into 2 ⁇ 1 (vertical) or 1 ⁇ 2 (horizontal) frequency bands that require two features (H & L frequency components) for these two feature sets.
- These sub-bands or “channels” can be coded using spatial prediction, temporal prediction, and cross-band prediction, with an appropriate sub-band specific objective or perceptual quality metric (e.g. mean square error (MSE) weighting).
- MSE mean square error
- Existing codec technology can be used or adapted to code the bands using channel encoder 106 .
- the resulting bitstream of the encoded video signal partitions is transmitted to subscriber units 150 a - n for decoding.
- the channels decoded by decoder 124 are used for channel synthesis by module 308 to reconstruct the partitions by module 310 that thereby produce output video signal 312 .
- the input video signal x 402 can be the entire image or a single image partition from divider 105 .
- the input video signal x 402 is filtered according to a function h i by filters 404 , 406 . It is understood that any number of filters can be used depending on the features set.
- filtered signals are then sampled by sampler 408 by a factor corresponding to the number of filters 404 , 406 , e.g. two, so that the total number of samples in all channels is the same as the number of input samples.
- the input image or partition can be appropriately padded (e.g. using symmetric extension) in order to achieve the appropriate number of samples in each channel.
- the resulting channel data is then encoded by encoder E 0 410 and E 1 412 to produce the channel bitstream b 0 414 and b 1 416 , respectively.
- the input data can be appropriately re-scaled prior to encoding.
- This re-scaling can be done through bounded quantization (uniform or non-uniform) of data which may include scaling, offset, rounding and clipping of the data. Any operations performed before encoding (such as scaling and offset) should be reversed after decoding.
- the particular parameters used in the transformation can be transmitted to the decoder or agreed upon a priori between the encoder and decoder.
- a channel encoder may make use of coding information i 01 418 from other channels (channel k for channel j in the case of i jk ) to improve coding efficiency and performance. If i 01 is already available at the decoder there is no need to include this information in the bitstream this information; otherwise, i 01 is also made available to the decoder, described below, with the bitstreams.
- the coding information i ik can be the information needed by the encoders or decoders or it can be predictive information based on analysis of the information and the channel conditions. The reuse of spatial or temporal prediction information can be across a plurality of sub-bands determined by the HVC coding approach.
- Motion vectors from the channels can be made available to the encoders and decoders so that the coding of one sub-band can be used by another sub-band. These motion vectors can be the exact motion vector of the sub-band or predictive motion vectors. Any currently coded coding unit can inherit the coding mode information from one or more of the sub-bands which are available to the encoders and decoders. In addition, the encoders and decoders can use the coding mode information to predict the coding mode for the current coding unit. Thus, the modes of one sub-band can also be used by another sub-band.
- the decoder reconstruction loop 420 is also included in the encoder, as illustrated by the bitstream decoder D i 422 , 424 .
- the decoded bitstreams 414 , 416 are up-sampled by a factor of two by samplers 423 , where the factor corresponds to the number of bitstreams, and is then post-filtered by a function of gi by filters 428 , 430 .
- the filters h i 404 , 406 and filters g i 428 , 430 can be chosen so that when the post-filtered outputs are added by combiner 429 , the original input signal x can be recovered as reconstructed signal x′ in the absence of coding distortion.
- the filters h i 404 , 406 and g i 428 , 430 can be designed so as to minimize overall distortion in the presence of coding distortion.
- FIG. 4 also illustrates how the reconstructed output x′ can be used as a reference for coding future pictures as well as for coding information i for another channel k (not shown).
- a buffer 431 stores these outputs, which then can be filtered h i and decimated to produce picture r i , and this is performed for both encoder E i and decoder D i .
- the picture r i can be fed back to be used by both the encoder 410 as well as the decoder 422 , which is a part of the reconstruction loop 420 .
- filters R i 432 , 434 which filter and sample the output for the decoder reconstruction loop 420 using a filter function h 436 , 438 and samplers 440 .
- the filters R i 432 , 434 select one of several channel analyses (including the default with no decomposition) for each image or partition.
- the buffered output can then be filtered using all possible channel analyses to produce appropriate reference pictures.
- these reference pictures can be used as a part of the encoders 410 , 412 and as coding information for other channels.
- FIG. 4 shows the reference channels being decimated after filtering, it is also possible for the reference channels to be undecimated. While FIG. 4 shows the case of a two-channel analysis, the extension to more channels is readily understood from the principles described.
- Sub-band reference picture interpolation can be used to provide information on what the video stream should be.
- the reconstructed image can be appropriately decomposed to generate reference sub-band information.
- the generation of sub-sampled sub-band reference data can be done using an undecimated reference picture that may have been properly synthesized.
- a design of a fixed interpolation filter can be used based on the spectral characteristics of each sub-band. For example, a flat interpolation is appropriate for high frequency data.
- adaptive interpolation filters can be based on MSE minimization that may include Wiener filter coefficients that apply to synthesized referenced frames that are undecimated.
- FIG. 5 shows the corresponding decoder 500 to the encoder illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- the decoder 500 operates on the received bitstreams b i 414 , 416 and co-channel coding information i 418 . This information can be used to derive or re-use coding information among the channels at both the encoder and decoder.
- the received bitstreams 414 , 416 are decoded by decoders 502 , 504 which are configured to match the encoders 410 , 412 .
- decoders 502 , 504 are configured with similar parameters.
- decoders 502 , 504 receive parameter data as a part of the bitstreams 414 , 416 so as to be configured corresponding to the encoders 410 , 412 .
- Samplers 506 are used to resample the decoded signal.
- Filters 508 , 510 using a filter function g i are used to obtain a reconstructed input video signal x′.
- the output signals ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 0 512 and ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 514 from filters 508 , 510 are added together by adder 516 to produce reconstructed input video signal x′ 518 .
- the reconstructed video signal x′ 518 is also provided to buffer 520 .
- the buffered signal is supplied to filters 522 , 524 that filter the reconstructed input signal by a function of h i 526 , 528 and then resamples the signals using sampler 530 .
- the filtered reconstruction input signal is fed back into decoders 502 , 504 .
- an input video stream x can be divided into partitions by divider 105 .
- the pictures of an input video stream x are divided into partitions where each partition is decomposed using the most suitable set of analysis, sub-sampling, and synthesis filters (based on the local picture content for each given partition) where the partitions are configured having similar features from the feature set.
- FIG. 6 shows an example of a coding scenario which uses a total of four different decomposition choices using spatial frequency decomposition as an example of the feature set used to adaptively partition, decompose and encode a picture 600 .
- Adaptive partitioning of pictures in a video stream can be described by one feature set FS that is based on a minimal feature description length criterion.
- the picture 600 is examined to determine the different partitions where similar characteristics can be found. Based on the examination of the picture 600 , partitions 602 - 614 are created. As shown, the partitions 602 - 614 are not overlapping with one another, but it is understood that the edges of partitions 602 - 614 can overlap.
- the feature set options are as based on vertical or horizontal filtering and sub-sampling.
- V 1 H 1 used in partitions 604 , 610 as an example, the pixel values of the partition are coded.
- This feature set has only one feature, which are the pixel values of the partition. This is equivalent of the traditional picture coding, where the encoder and decoder operate on the pixel values.
- partitions 606 , 612 which are designated by V 1 H 2 , are horizontally filtered and sub-sampled by a factor of two for each of the two sub-bands. This feature set has two features.
- partition 602 which is designated by V 2 H 1 , is filtered using a vertical filter and sub-sampled by a factor of two for each of the two sub-bands.
- partitions 606 , 612 using V 1 H 2 the feature set for partition 602 has two features. One is the value(s) of the low frequency sub-band and the other is the value(s) of the high frequency sub-band.
- Each sub-band can be coded with an appropriate encoder.
- Partitions 608 , 614 which are designated by V 2 H 2 , use separable or non-separable filtering and sub-sampling by a factor of two in each of the horizontal and vertical directions.
- the filtering and sub-sampling is in two dimensions, the operation takes place for each of four sub-bands so that the feature set has four features.
- the first feature captures the value(s) of a low frequencies (LL) sub-band
- the second and third features capture the combination of low and high frequencies, i.e. LH and HL sub-band value(s), respectively
- the fourth feature captures the value(s) of high frequencies (HH) sub-band.
- Each sub-band is then coded with an appropriate encoder.
- Divider 105 can use a number of different adaptive partitioning schemes to approach creating the partitions 602 - 614 of each picture in a input video stream x.
- One category is rate distortion (RD) based.
- RD rate distortion
- One example of RD based partition is a Tree-structured approach. In this approach, a partitioning map would be coded using a tree structure, e.g. quadtree. The tree branching is decided based on cost minimization that includes both the performance of the best decompositioning scheme as well as the required bits for description of the tree nodes and leaves.
- the RD based partition can use a two pass approach.
- the partitions from the first pass would go through adaptive decompositioning to find the cost of each decompositioning choice, then the partitions from the first pass would be optimally merged to minimize the overall cost of coding the picture. In this calculation, the cost of transmission of the partitioning information can also be considered.
- the picture In the second pass the picture would be partitioned and decomposed according to the optimal partition map.
- Norm-p Minimization is utilized.
- a norm-p of the sub-band data for all channels of the same spatial locality would be calculated for each possible choice of decompositioning.
- Optimal partitioning is realized by optimal division of the picture to minimize the over norm-p at all partitions 602 - 614 .
- the cost of sending the partitioning information is considered by adding the suitably weighted bit-rate (either actual or estimated) to send the partitioning information to the overall norm-p of the data. For pictures with natural content a norm-1 is mostly used.
- the adaptive sub-band decomposition of a picture or partition in video coding is described above.
- Each decomposition choice is described by the level of sub-sampling in each of horizontal and vertical directions, which in turn defines the number and size of sub-bands. e.g. V 1 H 1 , V 1 H 2 , etc.
- the decomposition information for a picture or partition can be reused or predicted by sending the residual increment for a future picture or partition.
- Each sub-band is derived by application of analysis filters, e.g. filters h i 404 , 406 , before compression and reconstructed by application of a synthesis filters, e.g. filters g i 428 , 430 , after proper upsampling. In the case of cascading the decomposition, there might be more than one filter involved to analyze or synthesize each band.
- filters 404 , 406 , 428 , 430 , 436 , 438 , 508 , 510 , 526 , 528 can be configured and designed to minimize the overall distortion and as adaptive synthesis filters (ASF).
- ASF adaptive synthesis filters
- filters are attempting to minimize the distortion caused by the coding of each channel.
- the coefficients of the synthesis filter can be set based on the reconstructed channels. On example of ASF is based on joint sub-band optimization.
- the Linear Mean Square Estimation technique can be used to calculate the coefficients of g i such that the mean square estimate error between the final reconstructed partition x′ and the original pixels in the original signal x in the partition is minimized.
- independent channel optimization is used.
- the joint sub-band optimization requires the auto and cross correlations between the original signal x and the reconstructed sub-band signals after upsampling. Furthermore, a system of matrix equations can be solved. The computation associated with this joint sub-band optimization might be prohibitive in many applications.
- FIG. 7 An example of independent channel optimization solution for an encoder 700 can be seen in FIG. 7 , which focuses on the ASF so the reference picture processing using filters 432 and 434 shown in FIG. 3 are omitted.
- filter estimation module (FE) 702 , 704 is provided to perform filter estimation between the decoded reconstructed channel ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ i , which is generally noisy, and the unencoded reconstructed channel c′ i , which is noiseless.
- an input video signal x 701 is split and provided to filters 706 , 708 that filter the signal x according to the known function h i and then sampled using samplers 710 at a rate determined by the number of partitions.
- one of the filters 706 , 708 can be a low pass filter and the other can be high pass filters. It is understood, the partitioning the data in a two-channel decomposition doubles the data.
- the samplers 710 can critically sample the input signals to half the amount of data so that the same number of samples are available to reconstruct the input signal at the decoder.
- the filtered and sampled signal is then encoded by encoders E i 712 , 714 to produce bitstreams b i 716 , 718 .
- the encoded bitstreams b i 716 , 718 are provided to decoders 720 , 722 .
- Encoder 700 is provided with an interpolation module 724 , 726 that receives a signal filtered and sampled signal provided to the encoders 712 , 714 and from decoder 720 , 722 .
- the decimated and sampled signal and the decoded signal are sampled by samplers 728 , 730 .
- the resampled signals are processed by filters 732 , 734 to produce signal c′ i while the decoded signals are also processed by filters 736 , 738 to produce signal ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ i .
- the signals c′ i and ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ i are both provided to the filter estimation module 702 , 704 described above.
- the output of the filter estimation module 702 , 704 corresponds to the filter information info i of the interpolation module 724 , 726 .
- the filter information info i can also be provided to the corresponding decoder as well as to other encoders.
- the interpolation module can also be configured with a filter 740 , 742 utilizing a filter function f i .
- the filter 740 , 742 can be derived to minimize an error metric between c′ i and ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ i , and this filter is applied to c′′ i to generate ⁇ i .
- the resulting filtered channel outputs ⁇ i are then combined to produce the overall output.
- the ASF outputs ⁇ i can be used to replace ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ i in FIG. 4 . Since the ASF is applied to each channel before combining, the ASF filtered outputs c i can be kept at a higher bit-depth resolution relative to the final output bit-depth resolution.
- the combined ASF outputs can be kept at a higher bit-depth resolution internally for purposes of reference picture processing, while the final output bit-depth resolution can be reduced, for example, by clipping and rounding.
- the filtering performed by the interpolation module 740 , 742 can fill in information that may be discarded by the sampling conducted by samplers 710 .
- the encoders 712 , 714 can use different parameters based on the features set used to partition the input video signals and then to encode signals.
- the filter information info i or i i can be transmitted to the decoder 800 , which is shown in FIG. 8 .
- the modified synthesis filter 802 , 804 g i ′ can be derived from the functions gi and fi of filters 706 , 708 , 732 - 742 so that both encoder 700 and decoder 800 perform equivalent filtering.
- the synthesis filter 732 - 738 g i is modified to g′ i in filters 802 , 804 to account for the distortions introduced by the coding. It is also possible to modify the analysis filter functions hi from filters 706 , 708 to hi′ in filters 806 , 808 to account for coding distortions in adaptive analysis filtering (AAF).
- AAF adaptive analysis filtering
- ASF/AAF can be applied to the entire picture or to picture partitions, and a different filter can be applied to different partitions.
- the analysis filter e.g. 9/7, 3/5, etc.
- the filter that is used is based on the qualities of the signal coming into the filter.
- the coefficients of the AAF filter can be set based on the content of each partition and coding condition.
- the filters can be used for generation of sub-band reference data, in case the filter index or coefficients can be transmitted to the decoder to prevent a drift between the encoder and the decoder.
- bitstreams bi 716 , 718 are supplied to decoders 810 , 812 , which have complementary parameters to encoders 712 , 714 .
- Decoders 810 , 812 also receive as inputs coding information i i from the encoder 700 as well as from other encoders and decoders in the system.
- the output of decoders 810 , 812 are resampled by samplers 814 and supplied to the filters 802 , 804 described above.
- the filtered decoded bitstreams c i ′′ are combined by the combiner 816 to produce reconstructed video signal x′.
- the reconstructed video signal x′ can also be buffered in buffer 818 and processed by filters 806 , 808 and sampled by samplers 820 to be supplied as feedback input to the decoders 810 , 812 .
- cross sub-band prediction can be used.
- the encoder and the decoder can use the coding information from all the sub-bands that are already decoded and available at the decoder without the need to send any extra information. This is shown by the input of coding information i i provided to the encoders and decoders. An example of this is the re-use of temporal and spatial predictive information for the co-located sub-bands which are already decoded at the decoder.
- the issue of cross band prediction is an issue related to the encoder and the decoder. A few schemes which can be used to perform this task in the context of contemporary video encoders and decoders are now described.
- One such scheme uses cross sub-band motion vector prediction. Since the motion vectors in corresponding locations in each of the sub-bands point to the same area in the pixel domain of the input video signal x and therefore for the various partitions of x, it is beneficial to use the motion vectors from already coded sub-bands blocks at the corresponding location to derive the motion vector for current block.
- Two extra modes can be added to the codec to support this feature.
- One mode is the re-use of motion vectors. In this mode the motion vector used for each block is directly derived from all the motion vectors of the corresponding blocks in the already transmitted sub-bands.
- Another mode uses motion vector prediction. In this mode the motion vector used for each block is directly derived by adding a delta motion vector to the predicted motion vector from all the motion vectors of the corresponding blocks in the already transmitted sub-bands.
- Another scheme uses cross sub-band coding mode prediction. Since the structural gradients such as edges in each image location taken from a picture in the video stream or from a partition of the picture can be spilled to corresponding locations in each of the sub-bands, it is beneficial for coding of any given block to re-use the coding mode information from the already coded sub-band blocks at the corresponding location. For example, in this mode the prediction mode for each macroblock can be derived from the corresponding macroblock of the low frequency sub-band.
- codec enhancement uses reference picture interpolation.
- the reconstructed pictures are buffered as seen in FIGS. 4 and 5 and are used as references for coding of future pictures. Since the encoder E i operates on the filtered/decimated channels, the reference pictures are likewise filtered and decimated by reference picture process R i performed by filters 432 , 434 . However, some encoders may use higher subpixel precision and the function R i is typically interpolated as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B for the case of quarter-pel resolution.
- the reconstructed input signals x′ are provided to the filter Q i 902 and Q′ i , 904 .
- the reference picture processing operation by filter Ri 432 operation uses filter h i 436 and decimates the signal using sampler 440 .
- the interpolation operation typically performed in the encoder can be combined in the filter's Q i 902 operation using quarter-pel interpolation module 910 . This overall operation generates quarter-pel resolution reference samples qi 906 of the encoder channel inputs.
- FIG. 9B another way to generate the interpolated reference picture q i ′ is shown in FIG. 9B .
- the reconstructed output is only filtered in R i ′ using filter h i 436 and not decimated.
- the filtered output is then interpolated by half-pel using half-pel interpolation module 912 to generate the quarter-pel reference picture q i ′ 908 .
- the advantage of Q i ′ over Q i is that Q i ′ has access to the “original” (undecimated) half pel samples, resulting in better half-pel and quarter-pel sample values.
- the Q i ′ interpolation can be adapted to the specific characteristics of each channel i, and it can also be extended to any desired subpixel resolution.
- each picture which in series makes up the input video stream x, can be processed as an entire picture, or partitioned into smaller contiguous or overlapping sub-pictures as seen in FIG. 5 .
- the partitions can have fixed or adaptive size and shape.
- the partitions can be done at the picture level or adaptively.
- the picture can be segmented into partitions using any of a number of different methods include a tree structure or a two-pass structure where the first path uses fixed blocks and the second pass works on merging blocks.
- the channel analysis and synthesis can be chosen depending on content of the picture and video stream.
- the decomposition can take on any number of horizontal and/or vertical bands, as well as multiple levels of decomposition.
- the analysis/synthesis filters can be separable or non-separable, and they can be designed to achieve perfect reconstruction in the lossless coding case. Alternatively, for the lossy coding case, they can be jointly designed to minimize the overall end-to-end error or perceptual error. As with the partitioning, each picture or sub-picture can have a different decomposition.
- Examples of such decomposition of the picture or video stream are filter-based, feature-based, content based such as vertical, horizontal, diagonal, features, multiple levels, separable and non-separable, perfect reconstruction (PR) or not PR, and picture and sub-picture adaptive methods.
- the low frequency band may be directly coded as a normal video sequence since it retains many properties of the original video content. Because of this, the framework can be used to maintain “backward compatibility” where the low band is independently decoded using current codec technology.
- the higher bands can be decoded using future developed technology and used together with the low band to reconstruct at a higher quality. Since each channel or band may exhibit different properties from one another, specific channel coding methods can be applied. Interchannel redundancies can also be exploited spatially and temporally to improve coding efficiency.
- motion vectors, predicted motion vectors, coefficient scan order, coding mode decisions, and other methods may be derived based upon one or more other channels.
- the derived values may need to be appropriately scaled or mapped between channels.
- the principles can be applied to any video codec, can be backward compatible (e.g. low bands), can be for specific channel coding methods (e.g. high bands) and can exploit interchannel redundancies.
- a combination of undecimated half-pel samples, interpolated values, and adapative interpolation filter (AIF) samples for the interpolated positions can be used.
- AIF adapative interpolation filter
- the half-pel interpolation in Q′ can be adapted to the signal and noise characteristics of each channel, a lowpass filter can be used for all channels to generate the quarter-pel values.
- the best quantization parameter is chosen for each partition/channel based on RD-cost.
- Each picture of a video sequence can be partitioned and decomposed into several channels. By allowing different quantization parameters for each partition or channel, the overall performance can be improved.
- an RD minimization technique can be used. If the measure of fidelity is peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), it is possible to independently minimize the Lagrangian cost (D+ ⁇ R) for each sub-band when the same Lagrangian multiplier ( ⁇ ) is used to achieve optimal coding of individual channels and partitions.
- PSNR peak signal-to-noise ratio
- a quantization parameter (qp) is obtained by a recursive RD cost search.
- ⁇ is set to be 2 in the low frequency channel search, and this results in a 5 ⁇ increase in coding complexity in time relative to the case without RD optimization at the channel level.
- ⁇ is set to be 3, corresponding to a 7 ⁇ increase in coding complexity.
- an optimal qp for each channel is determined at the expense of multi-pass encoding and increased encoding complexity.
- Methods for reducing the complexity can be developed that directly assign qp for each channel without going through multi-pass encoding.
- lambda adjustment can be used for each channel.
- the equal Lagrangian multiplier choice for different sub-bands will result in optimum coding under certain conditions.
- One such condition is that the distortions from all sub-bands are additive with equal weight in formation of the final reconstructed picture.
- picture type determination can be used.
- An advanced video coding (AVC) encoder may not be very efficient in coding the high frequency sub-bands.
- Many microblocks (MB) s in HVC are intra coded in predictive slices, including P and B slices. In some extreme cases, all of MBs in a predictive slice are intra-coded. Since the context model of the intra MB mode is different for different slice types, the generated bit rates are quite different when the sub-band is coded as an I slice, P slice or a B slice. In other words, in natural images, the intra MBs are less likely occur in a predictive slice. Therefore, a context model with a low intra MB probability is assigned. For I slices, a context model with a much higher intra MB probability is assigned.
- a predictive slice with all MBs intra-coded consumes more bits than an I slice even when every MB is coded at the same mode.
- a different entropy coder can be used for high frequency channels.
- each sub-band can use a different entropy coding technique or coder based on the statistical characteristics of each sub-band.
- another solution is to code each picture in a channel with a different slice type, and then choose the slice type with the least RD cost.
- Intra skip mode benefits sparse data coding for a block-based algorithm where the prediction from already reconstructed neighboring pixels are used to reconstruct the content.
- High sub-band signals usually contain a lot of flat areas and the high frequency components are sparsely located. It might be advantageous to use one bit to distinguish whether an area is flat or not.
- an intra skip mode was defined to indicate an MB with flat content. Whenever an intra skip mode is decided, the area is not coded, no further residual is sent out, and the DC value of the area is predicted by using the pixel values in the neighboring MB.
- the intra skip mode is an additional MB level flag.
- the MB can be any size. In AVC, the MB size is 16 ⁇ 16. For some video codecs, larger MB sizes (32 ⁇ 32, 64 ⁇ 64, etc.) for high definition video sequences are proposed.
- Intra skip mode benefits from the larger MB size because of the potential fewer bits generated from the flat areas.
- the intra skip mode is only enabled in the coding of the high band signals and disabled in the coding of the low band signals. Because the flat areas in low frequency channel are not as frequent as those in the high frequency channels, generally speaking, the intra skip mode increases the bit rate for low frequency channels while decreasing the bit rate for high frequency channels.
- the skip mode can also apply to an entire channel or band.
- an inloop deblocking filter is used.
- An inloop deblocking filter helps the RD performance and the visual quality in the AVC codec.
- FIGS. 10 and 11 are configured as the encoder 400 of FIG. 4 and the decoder 500 of FIG. 5 where similar components are numbered similarly and perform the same function as described above.
- One inloop deblocking filter is a part of the decoder D i 1002 , 1004 at the end of each individual channel reconstruction.
- the other inloop deblocking filter 1006 is after channel synthesis and the reconstruction of the full picture by combiner 431 .
- the first inloop deblocking filters 1002 , 1004 are used for the channel reconstruction and are an intermediate signal. Its smoothness on the MB boundaries may improve the final picture reconstruction in an RD sense. It also can result in the intermediate signals varying further away from the true values so that a performance degradation is possible.
- the inloop deblocking filters 1002 , 1004 can be configured for each channel based on the properties of how that channel is to be synthesized. For example the filters 1002 , 1004 can be based on the up sampling direction as well as the synthesis filter type.
- the inloop deblocking filter 1006 should be helpful after picture reconstruction. Due to the nature of the sub-band/channel coding, the final reconstructed pictures preserve artifacts other than blockiness, such as ringing effects. Thus, it is better to redesign the inloop filter to effectively treat those artifacts.
- inloop deblocking filters 1002 - 1006 apply to the inloop deblocking filters 1102 , 1104 and 1106 that are found in decoder 1100 of FIG. 11 .
- sub-band dependent entropy coding can be used.
- the legacy entropy coders such as VLC tables and CABAC in conventional codecs (AVC, MPEG, etc.) are designed based on the statistical characteristics from natural images in some transform domain (e.g. DCT in case of AVC which tend to follow some mix of Laplacian and Gaussian distributions).
- DCT in case of AVC which tend to follow some mix of Laplacian and Gaussian distributions.
- the performance of sub-band entropy coding can be enhanced by using an entropy coder based on the statistical characteristics of each sub-band.
- decomposition dependent coefficient scan order can be used.
- the optimal decompositioning choice for each partition can be indicative of the orientation of features in the partition. Therefore it would be preferable to use a suitable scan order prior to entropy coding of the coding transform coefficients. For example, it is possible to assign a specific scan order to each sub-band for each of the available decomposition schemes. Thus, no extra information needs to be sent to communicate the choice of scan order. Alternatively, it is possible to selectively choose and communicate the scanning pattern of the coded coefficients, such as quantized DCT coefficients in the case of AVC, from a list of possible scan order choices and send this scan order selection for each coded sub-band of each partition.
- This scan order can also be predicted from the already coded sub-bands with the same directional preference.
- fixed scan order per sub-band and per decomposition choice can be performed.
- a selective scanning pattern per sub-band in a partition can be used.
- sub-band distortion adjustment can be used.
- Sub-band distortion can be based on the creation of more information from some sub-bands while not producing any information for other sub-bands.
- Such distortion adjustments can be done via distortion synthesis or by distortion mapping from sub-bands to the pixel domain.
- the sub-band distortion can be first mapped to some frequency domain and then weighted according to the frequency response of the sub-band synthesis process.
- many of the coding decisions are carried out by minimization of a rate-distortion cost.
- the measured distortion in each sub-band does not necessarily reflect the final impact of the distortion from that sub-band to the final reconstructed picture or picture partition.
- sub-band up-sampling and synthesis filtering may be necessary before calculating the distortion for that given block.
- a fixed mapping from distortion in sub-band data to a distortion in the final synthesized partition. For perceptual quality metrics, this may involve gathering subjective test results to generate the mapping function.
- the sub-band distortion can be mapped to some finer frequency sub-bands where the total distortion would be a weighted sum of each sub-sub-band distortion according to the combined frequency response from the upsampling and synthesis filtering.
- sub-band data can be a floating point that needs to be converted to integer point with certain dynamic range.
- the encoder may not be able to handle the floating point input so the input is changed to compensate for what is being received. This can be achieved by using integer implementation of sub-band decomposition via a lifting scheme.
- a generic bounded quantizer can be used that is constructed by using a continuous non-decreasing mapping curve (e.g. a sigmoid) followed by a uniform quantizer. The parameters for the mapping curves should be known by the decoder or passed to it to reconstruct the sub-band signal prior to upsampling and synthesis.
- Frequency sub-band decomposition can provide better band-separation for better spatiotemporal prediction and coding efficiency. Since most of the energy in typical video content is concentrated in a few sub-bands, more efficient coding or band-skipping can be performed for the low-energy bands. Sub-band dependent quantization, entropy coding, and subjective/objective optimization can also be performed. This can be used to perform coding according to the perceptual importance of each sub-band. Also, compared to other prefiltering only approaches, a critically sampled decomposition does not increase the number of samples and perfect reconstruction is possible.
- HVC adds cross sub-band prediction in addition to the spatial and temporal prediction.
- Each sub-band can be coded using a picture type (e.g. I/P/B slices) different from the other sub-bands as long as it adheres to the picture/partition type (e.g. an Intra type partition can only have Intra type coding for all its sub-bands).
- a picture type e.g. I/P/B slices
- an Intra type partition can only have Intra type coding for all its sub-bands.
- the HVC framework is independent of the particular channel or sub-band coding used, it can utilize different compression schemes for the different bands. It does not conflict with other proposed coding tools (e.g. KTA and the proposed JCT-VC) and can provide additional coding gains on top of other coding tools.
- HVC 3D video outputs
- 3DTV 3D video outputs
- HVC can also take most advantage of the 3DTV compression technologies, newer encoding and decoding hardware is required. Because of this, there has been recent interest in systems that provide a 3D compatible signal using existing 2D codec technology. Such a “base layer” (BL) signal would be backward compatible with existing 2D hardware, while newer systems with 3D hardware can take advantage of additional “enhancement layer” (EL) signals to deliver higher quality 3D signals.
- BL base layer
- EL additional “enhancement layer”
- One way to achieve such migration path coding to 3D is to use a side-by-side or top/bottom 3D panel format for the BL, and use the two full resolution views for the EL.
- the BL can be encoded and decoded using existing 2D compression such as AVC with only small additional changes to handle the proper signaling of the 3D format (e.g. frame packing SEI messages and HDMI 1.4 signaling).
- Newer 3D systems can decode both BL and EL and use them to reconstruct the full resolution 3D signals.
- the BL and the EL may have concatenating views.
- the first two views e.g. left and right views
- the concatenated 2 ⁇ picture would be decomposed to yield the BL.
- a view can be decomposed and then the low frequency sub-bands from each view can be concatenated to yield the BL.
- the decomposition process does not mix information from either view.
- the first two views may be concatenated and then the concatenated 2 ⁇ picture would be decomposed to yield the enhancement layer.
- Each view may be decomposed and then coded by one enhancement layer or two enhancement layers.
- the high frequency sub-bands for each view would be concatenated to yield the EL as large as the base layer.
- the high frequency sub-band for one view would be coded first, as the first enhancement layer and then the high frequency sub-band for the other view would be coded as the second enhancement layer.
- the EL_ 1 can use the already coded EL_ 0 as a reference for coding predictions.
- FIG. 12 shows the approach to migration path coding using scalable video coding (SVC) compression 1200 for the side-by-side case.
- SVC scalable video coding
- MVC multiview video coding
- the two full resolution views are typically sampled without filtering to produce two panels.
- the BL panel 1302 contains the even columns of both the left and right views in the full resolution 1304 .
- the EL panel 1306 contains the odd columns of both views 1304 . It is also possible for the BL 1302 to contain the even column of one view and the odd column of the other view, or vice-versa, while the EL 1306 would contain the other parity.
- the BL panel 1302 and EL panel 1306 can then coded as two views using MVC, where the GOP coding structure is chosen so that the BL is the independent AVC-encoded view, while the EL is coded as a dependent view.
- the two full resolution views can be generated by appropriately re-interleaving the BL and EL columns. Prefiltering is typically not performed in generating the BL and EL views so that the original full resolution views can be recovered in the absence of coding distortion.
- the BL 1402 is the low frequency band in a 2-band horizontal decomposition (for the side-by-side case) of the full resolution view 1406
- the EL 1404 can be the high frequency band.
- FIG. 15 This HVC approach to 3DTV migration path coding by encoder 1500 is shown in FIG. 15 , which is an application and special case of the general HVC approach. As seen, many of the principles discussed above are included in the migration path for this 3DTV approach.
- a low frequency encoding path using of input video coding stream x 1502 is shown using some of the principles described in connection with FIG. 4 . Since it is desired that the BL be AVC-compliant, the top low-frequency channel in FIG. 15 uses AVC tools for encoding.
- a path of the stream x 1502 is filtered using filter h 0 1504 and decimated by sampler 1506 .
- a range adjustment module 1508 restricts the range of the base layer as described in more detail below.
- Information info RA can be used by the encoder shown, the corresponding decoder (see FIG. 16 ) as well as other encoders etc. as described above.
- the restricted input signal is then provided to encoder E 0 1510 to produce bitstream b 0 1512 .
- Coding information i 01 which contains information regarding the high and low band signals form the encoder, decoder or other channels is provided to the encoder 1526 to improve the performance.
- the bitstream b 0 can be reconstructed using a reconstruction loop.
- the reconstruction loop includes a complementary decoder D 0 1514 , range adjustment module RA ⁇ 1 1516 , sampler 1518 and filter g 0 1520 .
- a high frequency encoding path is also provided, which is described in connection with FIG. 7 .
- the high frequency channel can use additional coding tools such as undecimated interpolation, ASF, cross sub-band mode and motion vector prediction, Intra Skip mode, etc.
- the high frequency channel can even be coded dependently where one view is independently encoded and the other view is dependently encoded.
- the high frequency band includes the filter h 1 1522 that filters the high frequency input stream x that is then decimated by sampler 1524 .
- Encoder E 1 1526 encodes the filtered and decimated signal to form bitstream b 1 1525 .
- the high frequency channel includes a decoder D 1 1529 which feeds a decoded signal to the interpolation module 1530 .
- the interpolation module 1530 is provided for the high frequency channel to produce information info 1 1532 .
- the interpolation module 1530 corresponds to the interpolation module 726 shown in FIG. 7 and includes samplers 728 , 730 , filters g 1 734 , 738 , FE 1 filter 704 , and filter f 1 742 to produce information info 1 .
- the output from the decoded low frequency input stream 1521 and from the interpolation module 1530 are combined by combiner 1534 to produce the reconstructed signal x′ 1536 .
- the reconstructed signal x′ 1536 is also provided to the buffer 1538 , which is similar to the buffers described above.
- the buffered signal can be supplied to reference picture processing module Q′ 1 1540 as described in connection with FIG. 9B .
- the output of the reference picture processing module is supplied to the high frequency encoder E 1 1526 .
- the information i 01 from the reference picture processing module that includes coding the low frequency channel can be used in coding the high frequency channel, but not necessarily vice-versa.
- RA Range Adjustment
- the RA module 1508 is intended to map the input values into the desired bit-depth.
- the RA process can be accomplished by a Bounded Quantization (uniform or non-uniform) of the input values.
- RA out clip(round(scale* RA in+offset)), where round( ) approximates to the nearest integer, and clip( ) limits the range of values to [min, max] (e.g. [0, 255] for 8 bits), and scale ⁇ 0.
- Other RA operations can be defined, including ones that operate simultaneously on a group of input and output values.
- the RA parameter information needs to be sent to the decoder (as info RA ) if these parameters are not fixed or somehow are not known to the decoder.
- RA ⁇ 1 out ( RA ⁇ 1 in ⁇ offset)/scale.
- Range adjustment of the BL provides for acceptable visual quality by scaling and shifting the sub-band data, or by using a more general nonlinear transformation.
- a fix scaling is set such that the dc gain of synthesis filter and scaling is one.
- adaptive scaling and shifting two parameters of scale and shift for each view are selected such that the normalized histogram of that view in the BL has the same mean and variance as the normalized histogram of the corresponding original view.
- the corresponding decoder 1600 shown in FIG. 16 also performs the RA ⁇ 1 operation, but only for purposes of reconstructing the double-width concatenated full resolution views, as the BL is assumed to be only AVC decoded and output.
- the decoder 1600 includes a low frequency channel decoder D 0 1602 which can produce a decoded video signal ⁇ tilde over (x) ⁇ bl for the base layer.
- the decoded signal is supplied to the reverse range adjustment module RA ⁇ 1 1604 that is resampled by sampler 1606 and filtered by filter g 0 1608 to produce the low frequency reconstructed signal ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 0 1610 .
- the decoder D 1 1612 decodes the signal that is then resampled by sampler 1614 and filtered by filter g′ 1 1616 .
- Information info i can be provided to the filter 1616 .
- the output of the filter 1616 produces reconstructed signal ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 1617 .
- the reconstructed low frequency and high frequency signals are combined by combiner 1618 to create the reconstructed video signal ⁇ tilde over (x) ⁇ 1620 .
- the reconstructed video signal ⁇ tilde over (x) ⁇ 1620 is supplied to the buffer 1621 to be used by other encoders and decoders.
- the buffered signal can also be provided to a reference picture processing module 1624 that is fed back into the high frequency decoder D 1 .
- RA modules can be determined based on perceptual and/or coding efficiency considerations and tradeoffs. From a coding efficiency point of view, it is often desirable to make use of the entire output dynamic range specified by the bit-depth. Since the input dynamic range to RA is generally different for each picture or partition, the parameters that maximize the output dynamic range will differ among pictures. Although this may not be a problem from a coding point of view, it may cause problems when the BL is decoded and directly viewed, as the RA ⁇ 1 operation may not be performed before being viewed, possibly leading to variations in brightness and contrast. This is in contrast to the more general HVC, where the individual channels are internal and not intended to be viewed.
- An alternative solution to remedy the loss of information, associated with the RA process is to use an integer implementation of sub-band coding using a lifting scheme which brings the base band layer to the desired dynamic range.
- the RA and RA ⁇ 1 operations can be chosen to optimize both perceptual quality and coding efficiency.
- the EL can also undergo similar RA and RA ⁇ 1 operations.
- the EL bitdepth is typically higher than that required by the BL.
- the analysis, synthesis, and reference picture filtering of the concatenated double-width picture by h i and g i in FIGS. 15 and 16 can be performed so that there is no mixing of views around the view border (in contrast to SVC filtering). This can be achieved, for example, by symmetric padding and extension of a given view at the border, similar to that used at the other picture edges.
- the discussed HVC video coding provides a framework that offers many advantages and flexibility from traditional pixel domain video coding.
- An application of the HVC coding approach can used to provide a scalable migration path to 3DTV coding. Its performance appears to provide some promising gains compared to other scalable approaches such as SVC and MVC. It uses existing AVC technology for the lower resolution 3DTV BL, and allows for additional tools for improving coding efficiency of the EL and full resolution views.
- the devices described above perform a method 1700 of encoding an input video stream.
- the input video stream is received 1702 at a head end of a video distribution system described and is divided 1704 into a series of partitions based on at least one feature set of the input video stream.
- the feature set can be any type of features of the video stream including features of the content, context, quality and coding functions of the video stream.
- the input video stream can be partitioned according to the various channels of the video stream such that each channel is separately divided according to the same or different feature sets. After dividing, the partitions of the input video stream are processed and analyzed to decompose 1706 the partitions for encoding by such operations as decimation and sampling of the partitions.
- the decomposed partitions are then encoded 1708 to produced encoded bitstreams.
- coding information can be provided to the encoder.
- the coding information can include input information from the other channels of the input video stream as well as coding information based on a reconstructed video stream. Coding information can also include information regarding control and quality information about the video stream as well as information regarding the feature sets.
- the encoded bitstream is reconstructed 1710 into a reconstructed video stream which can be buffered and stored 1712 .
- the reconstructed video stream can be fed back 1714 into the encoder and used as coding information as well as provided 1716 to encoders for other channels of the input video stream.
- the process of reconstructing the video stream as well as providing the reconstructed video stream as coding information can include the processes of analyzing and synthesizing the encoded bitstreams and reconstructed video stream.
- FIG. 18 is a flow chart that illustrates a method 1800 of decoding encoded bitstreams that are formed as a result of the method shown in FIG. 17 .
- the encoded bitstreams are received 1802 by a subscriber unit 150 a - n as a part of a video distribution system.
- the bitstreams are decoded 1804 using coding information that is received by the decoder.
- the decoding information can be received as a part of the bitstream or it can be stored by the decoder.
- the coding information can be received from different channels for the video stream.
- the decoded bitstream is then synthesized 1806 into a series of partitions that are then combined 1808 to create a reconstructed video stream that corresponds to the input video stream described in connection with FIG. 17 .
- FIG. 19 illustrates the decomposition of the input x into two layers through analysis filtering.
- the filtering separates x into different spatial frequency bands.
- the input x can correspond to a portion of a picture or to an entire picture, the focus in this contribution is on the entire picture.
- most of the energy can be concentrated in the low frequency layer l 0 as compared to the high frequency layer l 1 .
- l 0 tends to capture local intensity features while l 1 captures variational detail such as edges.
- Each layer l i can then be encoded with E i to produce bitstream b i .
- the analysis process can include filtering followed by subsampling so that b 0 can correspond to an appropriate base layer bitstream.
- b 1 can be generated using information from the base layer b 0 as indicated by the arrow from E 0 to E 1 .
- the combination of E 0 and E 1 is referred to as the overall scalable encoder E s .
- the scalable decoder D s can consist of base layer decoder D 0 and enhancement layer decoder D 1 .
- the base layer bitstream b 0 can be decoded by D 0 to reconstruct the layer l′ 0 .
- the enhancement layer bitstream b 1 can be decoded by D 1 together with possible information from b 0 to reconstruct the layer l′ 1 .
- the two decoded layers, d′ 0 and d′ 1 can then used to reconstruct x′ using a synthesis operation.
- the performance of the proposed implementation was compared to the single layer and simulcast cases.
- x is encoded using HM 2.0 directly.
- the bitrate is determined by adding together the bits for encoding x directly and the bits for encoding l 0 directly, while the PSNR is that corresponding to the direct encoding of x.
- the bitrate corresponds to the bits for all layers, and the PSNR is that for x′.
- the encoders E i in this example operate on the same total number of pixels as the input x. This is in contrast to SVC, where for spatial scalability there is an increase in the total number of pixels to be encoded, and the memory requirement is also increased.
- the implementation can extend to other spatial scalability factors, for example, 1:n. Because the layers can have the same size, there can be a simple correspondence in collocated information (e.g. pixels, CU/PU/TU, motion vectors, coding modes, etc.) between layers. This is in contrast to SVC, where the size (and possibly shape) of the layers are not the same, and the correspondence in collocated information between layers may not be as straightforward.
- collocated information e.g. pixels, CU/PU/TU, motion vectors, coding modes, etc.
- Sharpness enhancement The implementations herein can be used to achieve sharpness enhancement as additional layers provide more detail to features such as edges. This type of sharpness enhancement is in contrast to other quality scalable implementations that improve quality only by changes in the amount of quantization.
- Independent coding of layers The simulation results for spatial scalability indicate that it is possible to perform independent coding of layers while still maintaining good coding efficiency performance. This makes parallel processing of the layers possible, where the layers can be processed simultaneously. For the two-layer spatial scalability case with SVC, independent coding of the layers (no inter-layer prediction) would correspond to the simulcast case. Note that with independent coding of layers, errors in one layer do not affect the other layers. In addition, a different encoder E i can be used to encode each l i to better match the characteristics of the layer.
- Dependent coding of layers can improve coding efficiency. When the layers have the same size, sharing of collocated information between layers is simple. It is also possible to adaptively encode layers dependently or independently to trade-off coding efficiency performance with error resiliency performance.
Abstract
Description
RAout=clip(round(scale*RAin+offset)),
where round( ) approximates to the nearest integer, and clip( ) limits the range of values to [min, max] (e.g. [0, 255] for 8 bits), and scale≠0. Other RA operations can be defined, including ones that operate simultaneously on a group of input and output values. The RA parameter information needs to be sent to the decoder (as infoRA) if these parameters are not fixed or somehow are not known to the decoder. The “inverse” RA−1 module 1516 rescales the values back to the original range, but of course with some possible loss due to rounding and clipping in the forward RA operation, where:
RA −1out=(RA −1in−offset)/scale.
