Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to testing variations in web page content.
- Web pages available on modern websites, such as websites available on the Internet are powerful communication tools for disseminating information regarding current events, organizations, and other items of interest to website visitors. Web pages can also provide targeted advertising of products and services. The content of web pages used to convey this information and deliver these advertisements varies considerably. Selections regarding style, graphics, and layout impact visitors' responses to the information offered on the web page, and seemingly small changes in web page appearance can sometimes dramatically change the effect of a web page on visitors.
- the effectiveness of differing combinations of web page content can be gauged by measuring visitor responses to varying web page content. Through experimentation, effective website content can be identified.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a test web page, extracting an experiment identifier from the test web page, identifying a plurality of variable content sections in the test web page, extracting a respective section identifier for each of the plurality of variable content sections, storing the section identifiers in association with the experiment identifier, presenting a user interface screen requesting content for a variable content section corresponding to at least one of the section identifiers, receiving content for a variable content section corresponding to the at least one section identifier, and storing the received content in a record in association with the at least one section identifier.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Combinations of the content can be selectively delivered to a web browser accessing the test web page.
- User responses to the delivered combinations can be recorded, and a interface can be provided for accessing the recorded responses.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 of an automated web page experimentation system 110 .
- a web server 102 is connected to a network 104 such as the Internet.
- a website operator using a computer 106 can create, maintain, and otherwise administrate a website 103 having one or more web pages 105 stored on the web server 102 .
- the web server can serve web page content 105 of the website 103 to visitors such as users of user computers 108 A- 108 C through web browser software installed on the user computers 108 A-C.
- the web pages 105 include hypertext markup language (HTML) code that is interpreted by the web browsers to render the pages for display to a visitor, for example, on a display of the computer 108 A.
- the web pages 105 can also include scripts.
- a script in this context, refers to code embedded in a web page. Scripts can be written in, for example, Javascript.
- Content of the web pages 105 of the website 103 can be directed toward one or more goals such as, for example, collecting names of visitors/customers, selling a product or service, directing traffic to more pages 105 of the website 103 , and/or directing traffic to the website of a sponsor.
- Website operators, designers, and/or publishers (referred to collectively below as operators) generally select website content to achieve these goals.
- experimentation system 110 can be used to conduct a test that presents one or more web page variations to visitors and records the effectiveness of each variation in achieving the goal.
- a test that presents multiple variations in web page and/or website content is referred to herein as a multivariate test.
- the website operator can access the experimentation system 110 to create experiments, manage experiments, and view reports regarding the effectiveness of the variations.
- the website operator utilizes an advertising system 114 to direct visitor traffic to the website 103 .
- the website operator can arrange to have advertisements, including hypertext links directing users to the website 103 , placed on other Internet web pages.
- the pages selected for placement of the advertisements can, for example, be search engine results pages generated after a user enters a search string including one or more words selected by the website operator as relevant to the content of website 103 .
- the website 103 includes information regarding bicycling, for example, the website operator might arrange for advertisements to be placed on results pages for search queries including the word “cycling”.
- advertisements can be placed by the advertising system on web pages operated by other website operators who agree to partner with the advertising system in delivering advertisements.
- the advertising system can then place advertisements for the website 103 on pages determined to have content that is contextually significant to the website 103 .
- an advertisement for the website 103 might appear on another bicycling related website.
- the website operator can agree to pay an owner of the advertising system a fee for each advertisement shown, and/or a fee for each time the advertisement successfully directs a visitor to the website 103 .
- the experimentation system can maintain records for a number of website operators. Each website operator can, for example, be given a user account. By logging into the experimentation system the website operator can view experiments that have been created by the website operator. For example, the website operator can create new experiments, start and stop experiments, and view experiment progress.
- the website operator can use the computer 106 to access a user interface of the experimentation system 110 .
- the experimentation system 110 provides HTML code of user interface pages to web browser software of the computer 106 .
- the computer 106 operates as a user interface device, and the HTML is interpreted by the web browser to render a user interface for display to the website operator.
- the experimentation system can generate an experiment identifier for a newly created experiment.
- An experiment identifier can be associated with a user account by, for example, storing the experiment identifier in a field of a database record that includes a user account identifier in another field.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart 200 of an example method of performing a web page experiment using an experimentation system 110 .
- the website operator accesses a user interface (for example, a web based interface) of the experimentation system 110 .
- the system collects experiment information ( 202 ).
- the experimentation system can prompt the website operator to enter a name of a new experiment, a URL of a test page for the experiment, and a URL of a conversion page for the experiment.
- the test page is the page on which the experimentation system will conduct a multivariate test.
- the conversion page is a page designated by the website operator as a goal. A conversion occurs, and a given test page combination can be credited with the conversion, if a visitor reaches the conversion page after viewing the test page combination.
- the experiment information can be stored in the experimentation system 110 in a way that identifies it with the experiment identifier.
- the experiment information can be stored in a database record that includes the experiment identifier.
- the experimentation system 110 generates one or more scripts for use on the test and/or conversion pages of the experiment ( 204 ).
- the experimentation system 110 can provide the scripts to the website operator through the user interface or in an email, for example. Instructions for installing the scripts on the test and conversion pages are also provided.
- the scripts can be installed, by inserting the scripts into the hypertext markup language of the test and/or conversion pages.
- the experimentation system additionally provides instructions for placing variable content sections in the test page.
- the website operator can indicate that the scripts have been installed using the user interface of the experimentation system 110 .
- the experimentation system verifies that the scripts have been installed ( 206 ).
- the experimentation system reads the test page of the experiment to acquire the experiment schema ( 208 ).
- the experiment schema includes the name (or other identifier) and number of variable content sections to be varied on the test page by the experimentation system during the experiment. If variable content sections are found, the experimentation system captures information from these sections to use as the schema for the experiment.
- the schema is then used to prompt for and collect variation information for the experiment from the website operator ( 210 ).
- the variation information will be inserted into corresponding variable content sections by the experimentation system as explained below.
- the variation information is stored for use by the experimentation system.
- the experiment is then conducted ( 212 ). During the experiment, varying combinations of the test page are displayed to visitors, and the respective number of conversions for the combinations displayed are recorded by the experimentation system 110 .

- the confirmation page can be a page linked to by the sponsor link 310 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example sponsor forward web page 500 .
- the sponsor link 310 links to the forward page 500 which, after a short delay, redirects the user's browser to the sponsor website.
- the URL of the conversion page selected by the website operator as the goal is provided to the experimentation system 110 through the user interface.
- FIG. 6 is an example message 600 including instructions for placing variable content sections in a test page.
- the example message 600 includes a control script and a tracker script.
- Scripts can include, for example, an experiment identifier that uniquely identifies the experiment in the experimentation system 110 .
- the control script can include code that when interpreted by a web browser causes the web browser to contact the experimentation system 110 to retrieve content for display by the browser in the variable content sections of the web page 300 .
- the tracker script can include, for example, code for storing a cookie in memory of a computer on which a web browser is running (computer 108 A, for example).
- the cookie can be used, for example, to determine whether a user has visited the test page within a certain period of time prior to visiting the conversion page as well as determining which combination of variable content was displayed to the user on the test page.
- the cookie can include the experiment identifier of a test page accessed by the user, the time the test page was accessed, and/or indicators that denote which variable content was displayed to the user in respective variable content sections.
- the example message 600 includes a format for variable content sections to be placed on the test page.
- the format shown in the example is: “ ⁇ script>utmx_section(“NAME_OF_SECTION”) ⁇ /script>DEFAULT_VALUE ⁇ /noscript>” where NAME_OF_SECTION is a name given to the variable content section by the website operator.
- DEFAULT_VALUE is the default page content for the given variable content section.
- FIG. 7 is an example of HTML source 700 of a test web page having installed scripts.
- the HTML source includes a control script 702 and a tracker script 704 .
- the HTML source also includes three variable content script sections 706 , 708 , and 710 .
- the three variable content script sections correspond to the variable content sections of the example test page 300 .
- the variable content script section 706 corresponds to the variable content section 302 of the test page 300 . This section has been given the name “Header” by the website operator, and default content of “Come Ride With Us!”.
- the variable content script section 708 corresponds to the variable content section 304 of the test page 300 .
- the file “racer.jpg” is the image file of the image shown in section 304 of the test page 300 .
- the variable content script section 710 corresponds to the variable content section 306 of the test page 300 .
- This section has been given the name “Text” by the website operator, and default content matching the text shown in section 306 of the test page 300 .
- FIG. 8 is an example of HTML source 800 of a conversion web page.
- the HTML source 800 corresponds to the example page 500 of FIG. 5 and includes a tracker script 802 that has been installed by the website operator.
- the website operator can initiate a script verification process.
- the operator can do this, for example, using the user interface of the experimentation system 110 .
- the verification process can optionally check the HTML source of the web pages at the URL locations indicated for the experiment to determine if the scripts are installed correctly.
- FIG. 9 is a flowchart of an example process 900 for scanning a test web page to extract a test schema.
- the test page is read by the experimentation system 110 ( 902 ).
- the test page has a corresponding experiment identifier included in its source code.
- the experiment identifier can be located, for example, in one or more of the scripts installed on the test page.
- the experimentation system 110 begins parsing the HTML source of the test page to locate a variable content section ( 904 ). If there is no more source to parse ( 906 ) the process ends ( 908 ).
- the process loops to continue parsing the test page if a variable content section is not encountered ( 910 ). If a variable content section is found ( 910 ) the name of the variable content section is extracted ( 912 ) and the section name is stored in the experimentation system and associated with the experiment identifier ( 914 ).
- the process 900 reads the example test page source code 700 , the process reads the source code, and extracts section names “Header”, “Image” and “Text” and stores these section names in the experimentation system 110 along with the experiment identifier corresponding to the experiment to be run on the test page.
- the experimentation system By reading the HTML source of the test page, parsing the source, and extracting the variable content section names found on the test page, the experimentation system extracts a schema for the experiment for use with the experiment.
- the experimentation system 110 can request variable content from the website operator for use in the multivariate test to be conducted on the test page that is specific to the extracted schema.
- the website operator With the experiment schema known to the experimentation system, the website operator is not required to manually enter a schema for the test that matches the schema of the test page. Manual entry is repetitive in that the schema is entered by the website operator once on the test page, and error prone since the manual entry might not match the schema on the test page. Following a manual entry of web page schema an additional testing step may be needed to confirm that the manually entered schema matches the schema of the test page. Extraction of the test page schema by the experimentation system reduces the data entry burden on the website operator in conducting a multivariate test and reduces the possibility of errors.

- test page 300 While the experiment is running, on the test page 300 , for example, the experimentation system, through communication with the web browser of a visitor's computer running the scripts installed on the test page 300 , varies the test page displayed to visitors by selectively replacing the content in the variable content sections with one instance of the corresponding variable content entered by the website operator into the experimentation system.
- a number of resulting test page variations can be produced that include combinations of default variable section content (one instance of a variation for a given variable content section is using the default content) and content stored in the experimentation system.
- the experimentation system balances the number or instances of that a given combination is displayed to visitors such that each of the combinations are displayed an approximately equal number of times.
- Traffic to the page 300 is tracked by the experimentation system which records the number of times a given combination of variable content achieves the designated goal for the experiment.
