- a mobile device 112 is used by an end-user to request services from the service provider 110 .
- One such service is mapping.
- the end-user, or an application executing on the mobile device 112 requests map information for the geographic area proximate to the mobile device.
- logic within the mobile device 112 determines the current geographic location of the device, and requests a map centered on this location from the service provider 110 .

- the services module 122 can provide maps to the mobile device that include layers graphically illustrating parking availability for the areas shown in the maps.
- One such layer graphically illustrates the parking availability using a heat map or other technique.
- parking availability predictions can be displayed in a color-coded format with red indicating that parking availability is low and green indicating that parking availability is high.
- parking availability predictions may be displayed in percentages of available parking spaces, numbers of available parking spaces, or amounts of time which would be required in order to find a parking space.
- the services module 122 can provide user interface tools that allow a user to toggle the parking availability map layer on or off, adjust the layer to show parking availability at different times or dates, or control other aspects of the presentation.
- the network 114 enables communications between the service provider 110 and the mobile devices 112 .

- FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a detailed view of modules within the population density module 118 according to one embodiment. Some embodiments of the population density module 118 have different and/or other modules than the ones described herein. Similarly, the functions can be distributed among the modules in accordance with other embodiments in a different manner than is described here. Likewise, the functions can be performed by other entities.
- a storage module 310 stores data used by the population density module 118 . Examples of such data include historical and current mobile device usage data, intermediate data created and used during the population density prediction process, and predicted population densities.
- the storage module 310 may include a relational database or another type of database.
- an embodiment of the storage module 310 stores a dataset 312 of historical population density data.
- the historical data describe data points received from mobile devices 112 within a defined time interval, such as within one year.
- a data point is an observation that a mobile device 112 was used at a particular geographic location at a particular date and time.
- a request for a location-based service received from a mobile device 112 that identifies a location is a data point.
- the storage module 310 stores data points corresponding to the center points of map requests received by the service provider over the defined time interval.
- the storage module 310 may provide the parking availability module 120 with historical population density data automatically, at the request of the parking availability module 120 , or at any other time.
- the historical data describe data points for a particular geographic area for which the population density will be predicted.
- the historical data can describe data points for a particular city such as San Francisco.
- the locations of the data points are quantized within the geographic area.
- the geographic area is divided into a grid, and the locations of the data points are mapped to nodes within the grid.
- the grid has 1000 nodes, with each node representing roughly a two-by-two block square of a city.
- the center point of each map request received from a mobile device 112 is mapped to the node in which the center point is located.
- the nodes of the grid vary in size. For instance, node size may represent historical population densities, with each node configured to represent roughly the same number of people; larger nodes would correlate to smaller population densities for a given area, and vice versa.
- the data points within the historical dataset 312 are aggregated by time.
- the data points can be aggregated into hours.
- a node of the grid has 168 (24*7) values, with each value representing the number of data points received from that node within an hour of that week.
- a current dataset 314 within the storage module 310 stores current data describing data points observed in a current time interval, e.g., a current hour.
- the current dataset 314 can be populated, for example, by the interface module 116 of the service provider 110 as service requests are received from the mobile devices 112 .
- the data within the current dataset 314 can move to the historical dataset 312 as the data age.
- the data within the current dataset 314 are organized into the same grid and temporal aggregation as the data within the historical dataset 312 .
- the current data describe the number of data points observed for a particular node of a grid for a geographic area within a current hour.
- the data in the current dataset 314 , as well as the data in the historical dataset 312 are anonymous so that the mobile devices 112 and end-users cannot be identified.
- a MRF module 316 maintains data describing a MRF model that the population density module 118 uses to estimate the number of mobile devices used within geographic areas.
- the MRF model has state variables x, observations y, and prior (historical) measurements ⁇ .
- the MRF model can be visualized as having the state variables x arranged as nodes in a regular 3-D lattice.
- a plane of the lattice corresponds to the grid of the geographic area described above; neighboring nodes reflect areas that neighbor other geographical areas in reality.
- the third dimension in the lattice reflects the influence of time slices immediately preceding and following the time slice for which the population density is being estimated (i.e., the state of the grid in the time slices preceding and following the time slice represented by the current grid).
- the state variables x are unobservable and represent the actual number of mobile devices 112 being used in given areas at a given time.
- the MRF module 316 uses a set of potentials and priors to capture the relationship between the values of x and the neighbors in time and space, as well as the current and historical observations.
- the potentials and priors are rules about how to use the datasets 312 , 314 to produce the estimate.
- a “prior measurement potential” enforces a rule that the current usage estimate of the number of mobile devices 112 being used in a node of the grid should be close to the historical usage for the node.
- the prior measurement potential is defined as:
- ⁇ represents a cost associated with the prior measurement potential.
- the potential itself is quadratic and captured over a set of indices L, where k ⁇ , is a weight, x i represents the unobservable variable for node i (the current number of mobile devices being used in node i), and ⁇ 1 represents the historical measurement for node i (the number of mobile devices historically observed at that node).
- observation potential enforces a rule that the current usage estimate for a node in the grid should be close to the current observed usage for the node.
- the observation potential is defined as:
- ⁇ ⁇ L ⁇ k y ⁇ ( x i - y i ) 2 ( 2 )
- ⁇ represents a cost associated with the observation potential. This potential is also quadratic and captured over a set of indices L, where k y is a weight, x i represents the unobservable variable for node i, and y i represents the current observed readings for node i (i.e., the number of data points observed for the node in the current period).
- a “spatial smoothness prior” enforces a rule that the current usage estimate for a node in the grid should be close to the usage estimates for the node's neighbors in space. There are four neighbors j in the lattice arrangement, corresponding to the four neighbors of a node in the grid.
- the spatial smoothness prior is defined as:
- ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ ⁇ j ⁇ N ⁇ ( i ) ⁇ k x ⁇ ( x i - x j ) 2 ( 3 )
- ⁇ represents a cost associated with the spatial smoothness prior. This prior is quadratic and captured for each node and each node's neighbors.
- k x is a weight
- x i represents the unobservable variable for node i
- a “temporal smoothness prior” enforces a rule that the current usage estimate for a node in the grid should be close to the usage estimates for the node's neighbors in time. There are two time neighbors j in the lattice arrangement, corresponding to the nodes of the time intervals preceding and following the current node i.
- the temporal smoothness prior is defined as:
- T represents a cost associated with the temporal smoothness prior. This prior is quadratic and captured for each node and each node's neighbors.
- k is a weight
- x i represents the unobservable variable for node i
- x j represents the unobservable variable for node i's j time neighbors.
- Each of the equations has a parameter representing the weight that the equation has in the MRF model (i.e., k ⁇ , k y , k x , k ⁇ ).
- a learning module 318 uses the historical dataset 312 to learn the values of the weight parameters. In one embodiment, the learning module 318 selects two weeks of historical data from the dataset 312 . The two weeks can be selected at random or based on other considerations and need not be temporally adjacent.
- the learning module 318 treats one of the two weeks as the test dataset and treats the other week as the training dataset.
- the learning module 318 optimizes the MRF model to determine values of the unobservable variables x (the optimization is described in more detail below) and changes the values of the parameters to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between estimated usage produced by the MRF model when using the training dataset as current observations and the test dataset.
- RMSE root mean squared error
- the learning module 318 treats the other three parameters as constants (e.g. with values of ‘1’) and changes the value of the parameter being learned until a value is found that minimizes the RMSE. In one embodiment, learning module 318 minimizes the error by performing a hill-climbing optimization. The learning module 318 repeats this process for each of the other three parameters in order to learn the values. The process is then repeated, for all the parameters, until a predetermined number of iterations has occurred, or until the RMSE has dropped below some threshold. Moreover, some embodiments of the learning module 318 repeat this process multiple times using different weeks from the historical dataset 312 to refine the parameter values.
- constants e.g. with values of ‘1’
- learning module 318 minimizes the error by performing a hill-climbing optimization. The learning module 318 repeats this process for each of the other three parameters in order to learn the values. The process is then repeated, for all the parameters, until a predetermined number of iterations has occurred, or until the RMSE has dropped below
- the values of the weight parameters can be fixed or can vary based on time.
- the learning module 318 determines fixed values for the parameters. That is, the parameters have the same values across all of the times in the dataset.
- the values of the weight parameters vary based on time or other factors.
- the learning module 318 uses 24 different values for each parameter, one for each hour of the day.
- the learning module 318 uses the same learning technique described above, except that the module solves for the parameters at each hour of the day, producing 24 different values for each parameter.
- Using multiple parameter values can enhance the accuracy of the MRF model.
- the weight of the temporal smoothness prior can change such that temporal smoothness has greater weight at times when the population density is unlikely to significantly change, e.g., between 2-3:00 AM, and lesser weight at times when the population density is likely to significantly change, e.g., between 4-5:00 PM.
- the weight of the spatial smoothness prior varies depending upon the location of the nodes being operated upon. Varying the spatial smoothness prior weight allows for incorporation of knowledge regarding the locations of the nodes. For example, a spatial smoothness prior having a relatively large weight can be used with nodes representing adjacent areas that typically have similar population densities, while a spatial smoothness prior having a relatively small weight can be used with nodes representing adjacent areas that typically have different population densities.
- An estimate generation module 320 generates an estimate of the current number of mobile devices 112 being used within the areas represented by the nodes of the MRF model.
- the estimate generation module 320 uses the values of the weight parameters learned by the learning module 318 in combination with the historical 312 and current 314 datasets to solve for the state variables x in the MRF model.
- the historical data can be the aggregation of data received in a predetermined time interval, such as a year, scaled so that the mean over the dataset approximately matches the mean of one week's worth of data.
- the estimate generation module 320 calculates the state variables x as the mode of the posterior distribution of the MRF model by solving for x as an optimization problem.
- the estimate generation module 320 identifies the values of the related variables in the MRF model.
- Two variables, x 1 and x ⁇ 1 respectively represent node x 0 's two neighbors in time.
- Variable x ⁇ 1 is the value of node x 0 in the prior measurement period (e.g., the preceding hour).
- Variable x 1 is the value of node x 0 in the subsequent measurement period (e.g., the next hour).
- the estimate generation module 320 uses a “historical future” value for the node.
- the estimate generation module 320 can use the historical value of the area at 4:00 PM as the value for x 1 .
- four variables, x 00 , x 01 , x 10 , and x 11 respectively represent the node's four neighbors in the space defined by the grid of the MRF model.
- One variable, y 0 represents the current observation of the number of mobile devices being used in the area represented by node x 0 .
- Another variable, ⁇ 0 represents the historical value for node x 0 .
- the estimate generation module 320 uses these values in the MRF model, as represented by equations (1)-(4) described above, and optimizes by solving for the values of x i that minimize cost, i.e., minimize the sum of ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ , and T.
- minimize cost i.e., minimize the sum of ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ , and T.
- the more x i varies from its historic value, its currently observed values, the values of its neighbors in space, and the values of its neighbors in time, the greater the cost.
- Minimizing cost based on x i thus produces values for x i that optimally conform to the model given the weights learned by the learning module 318 .
- the value of a given state variable for a node e.g., x 0 , represents the estimate of the current number of mobile devices 112 being used within the area represented by that node.
- the estimate generation module 320 uses the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm to minimize the cost.
- This algorithm simultaneously solves for x i in all four equations, for all nodes.
- nodes are influenced by adjacent nodes and, thus, each node is dependent on every other node.
- the adjacent nodes are given a predetermined value (e.g., 0). The nodes quickly converge to their “real” values as the optimization is performed.
- a density prediction module 322 uses the estimates of numbers of mobile devices being used within given areas produced by the estimate generation module 320 to predict the population densities of the areas.
- the density prediction module 322 predicts the population density as a function of the number of mobile devices being used. For example, the density prediction module 322 can multiply the estimated number of mobile devices being used in an area by scale factor that accounts for people in the area that are not using and/or carrying mobile devices, in order to calculate a prediction of total people within the area.
- the scale factor can vary in different areas. For example, the density prediction module 322 can use different scale factors for areas known to contain primarily pedestrian traffic and areas known to contain primarily vehicular traffic. Similarly, the scale factor can vary over time. In one embodiment, the density prediction module 322 is absent and the estimate of numbers of mobile devices is used as the population density prediction.

- other embodiments can perform the steps of the method in different orders and can include different and/or additional steps.
- the population density module 118 establishes 410 a historical population density dataset 312 .
- the historical data may describe data points received from mobile devices 112 observed within a defined historical time interval.
- the historical dataset 312 can describe the data points observed in a prior year.
- the population density module 118 also defines 412 a MRF model.
- the MRF model can be defined by a human operator who provides computer program instructions that implement the MRF model.
- the MRF model has state variables x, observations y, and prior (historical) measurements ⁇ , and is represented by equations (1)-(4) described above.
- the MRF model can be visualized as having the state variables x arranged as nodes in a regular 3-D lattice.
- the MRF model has parameters representing weights that the equations have in the overall model.
- the population density module 118 learns 414 the values of the weight parameters by analyzing the historical dataset 312 .
- the population density module 118 selects two sets of historical data from the dataset 312 , treats one set as test observations, treats the other set as training observations, and computes the unobserved variables using the data.
- the population density module 118 performs optimizations on the weight parameters to learn values that minimize RMSE between the estimates produced by the MRF model using the training data as the current observations and the test data.
- the population density module 118 stores 416 the learned weight parameter values and data describing the MRF model in, e.g., the storage module 310 .
- FIG. 5 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a detailed viewed of modules within the parking availability module 120 according to one embodiment.

- the storage module 510 may include a relational database or another type of database.
- an embodiment of the storage module 510 stores a dataset 512 of historical parking availability data.
- the historical data comprise descriptions of vehicle parking availability within specified geographic areas at specific dates and times.
- the historical parking availability data are organized in a similar manner as the geographic population data. That is, a geographic area such as a city is organized into nodes of a grid, and each node within the grid describes parking availability for the portion of the geographic area represented by the node. Each node can have associated parking availability data for different dates and/or times of day.
- the historical parking availability data are obtained by observing the actual vehicle parking available within the geographic areas.
- the parking availability data for a particular geographic area can be observed using manual techniques including having a human observer tally available vehicle parking within the area at a given date and time (and/or related measurements, such as the number of occupied parking spaces).
- the observer can observe the parking from street level, via an aerial survey, via stationary or mobile cameras, etc.
- the vehicle parking availability data for the area can also be observed using automated techniques.
- the observations can be formed of data reported by smart parking meters that electronically report whether associated parking spaces are occupied or free, from parking garages that electronically report utilization rates, and/or via an automated analysis of visual data.
- the historical parking data can represent the vehicle parking availability using a variety of different techniques.
- the data can specify the number of available parking spaces in a given geographic area at a given time, the percentage of spaces available, and/or the average time required to find a parking space.
- a current dataset 514 within the storage module 510 stores current parking availability predictions.
- Current parking availability predictions may be stored for an entire area, such as a city, and/or for a particular time period, such as an hour. In such instances, current parking availability predictions may be produced on a fixed time interval, such as once an hour; these predictions may then be stored in dataset 514 and retrieved whenever a current parking availability query is received within the time interval. Alternatively, current parking availability predictions may be produced any time current population density data is updated or received and/or when a query is received.
- the data within the current dataset 514 are organized into the same grid and temporal aggregation as the data within the historical dataset 512 .
- a parking availability model module 516 creates and maintains data describing a parking availability model for predicting the availability of parking within geographic areas.

- the parking availability model is trained using the historical parking availability data 512 and the population density predictions from the population density module 118 .
- training data can be obtained from the historical parking availability data 512 indicating the amount of parking available at 2:00 PM on each Monday of the preceding year.
- the training data are correlated with the population density predictions for the same geographic area at the same time and day. This correlation can be performed by calculations that perform the equivalent of plotting the parking availability against the population density on a graph, and fitting a curve to the plotted points.
- the curve describes a parking availability function indicating the relationship between parking availability and population density for that geographic area at 2:00 PM on Mondays.
- the technique described above can be performed to learn parking availability functions for multiple geographic areas at different times and dates. These functions collectively form the parking availability model.
- the model is invariant over date and time.
- a given geographic area's relationship between population density and parking availability is plotted for multiple different dates/times. For example, the relationship can be plotted at different times of the same day and/or at different times on different days to learn a single parking availability function for the area that is invariant over date and time.
- models can be trained that are invariant over just time by learning a single parking availability function for the area using multiple observations from a same day and learning different functions for each day of the year or week.
- models can be trained that are invariant over just date by learning a single parking availability function for the area using multiple observations made at the same time on different days.
- models can be trained to be invariant over a time period such as one hour or a few hours.
- a model is trained for a type of geographic area, and then applied to all areas of that type.
- the geographic areas represented by the nodes can be classified as specific types of areas such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
- a model can be trained for a representative subset of the residential areas and then applied to all nodes representing areas classified as residential.
- a model can be trained using aggregate data for all of the residential areas, and then applied to all such areas. Models can likewise be trained for other types of geographic areas.

Abstract
Description
In equation (2), Φ represents a cost associated with the observation potential. This potential is also quadratic and captured over a set of indices L, where ky is a weight, xi represents the unobservable variable for node i, and yi represents the current observed readings for node i (i.e., the number of data points observed for the node in the current period).
In equation (3), Ω represents a cost associated with the spatial smoothness prior. This prior is quadratic and captured for each node and each node's neighbors. In the equation, kx is a weight, xi represents the unobservable variable for node i, and represents the unobservable variable for node i's j spatial neighbors.
