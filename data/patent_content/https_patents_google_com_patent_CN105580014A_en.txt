Embodiment
Subject technology provides the mechanism in a kind of social networks, this mechanism automatically detect upload in the digital picture of social networks can subject of a sale's (brand such as, provided by supplier, product or service).When digital picture is uploaded, image recognition software is configured to the project of answering with known brand, product or service relative in recognition image, and can subject of a sale be associated the social network user of upload images and having identified in database.Also can from the metadata mark brand embedded in upload images, product or service.Therefore, between the user of system banner shared relationship in social networks of subject technology (such as, its contacted as " friend " in socialgram or otherwise by common interest relationship) public can subject of a sale and those can the popularity of subject of a sale between groups of users.
For associated user group, can based on detecting in group can the relevant threshold value of subject of a sale upload number of times to identify with detect can the current trend that is associated of subject of a sale.Can such as comprise can the image of this number of subject of a sale uploaded by the most of users in particular demographic or uploaded in the schedule time window time mark with can the trend that is associated of subject of a sale.In this, system the time of the timestamp be associated with image or upload images can be associated with the date and time of other nearest upload images to determine in image can detected object be correspond to develop in or occurent trend.
Once identify current trend, system this trend can be informed to detect can the relevant supplier of subject of a sale.In certain aspects, system can determine that current trend comprises the change of initial trend, and notifies supplier in response to this change.In addition or in alternative, system can generate or indicate supply (such as, advertisement) in response to change current trend or trend being detected to the one or more users be associated with current trend.
Also can determine the correlativity of the trend detected from upload images, and adjust this trend based on determined correlativity.Such as, or can be used for the popularity of subject of a sale can adjusting trend for user or groups of users for the correspondence in the image of relative users viewing based on the closure of the relation between user.In this, correlativity can indicate trend to have and how to be applicable to specific user by force.Such as, about the trend of the Association football shirt in groups of users may not be suitable for do not express clearly any interest to Association football (such as, by user previously posting or by analyzing its picture) the user of group.About participate in particular business company group user trend may and be not suitable for the user of the group not being arranged in same city with this commercial company.
This system also promotes the target marketing of the user to social networks further based on trend criterion, comprise the correlativity of trend and those trend and the specific user detected.Can for supplier's setting value to provide supply based on trend criterion to user.Such as, this value can increase comparably along with the popularity of trend and with the increase of the correlativity of user or groups of users or reduction or reduce.This value can increase when new trend being detected, because it can indicate correspondence can the employing of subject of a sale early, and promote can subject of a sale's target offerings of being undertaken by supplier and the chance of possibility of disseminating out for supplier provides.
Another aspect, system can detect clothes in upload images and keep " prototype " user to identify for the fashion trend of prototype user.The most popular clothes for each part of anatomical structure can be stored (such as, as database table).The trend that the garment type for each part of anatomical structure is associated can be identified, make the trend for particular brand mark not overlapping for every part clothes.
Fig. 1 is the state flow chart for detecting the example process of trend from the image uploading to social networks of some aspects described according to subject technology.The square frame of Fig. 1 does not need to perform according to shown order.It should be understood that described order is the diagram of one or more exemplary method, and be not intended to the particular order or the hierarchy that are confined to proposition.Square frame can be rearranged and/or side by side can perform two or more in square frame.
According to one or more embodiment, one or more square frames of Fig. 1 can be performed by one or more computing equipment.Computing equipment can carry out trustship or operation in combination with one or more social networks.In this, non-provisional machine readable media can comprise software or machine-executable instruction in the above, and it performs the square frame of Fig. 1 when being performed by computing machine or machine.Therefore, the square frame of Fig. 1 can be performed explicitly with social networks.
First process 101 can perform to monitor society's exchange activity for one or more user in social networks, and detects and analyze and upload to the image of social networks to show in social activity stream by user.Therefore, the first process 101 analysis charts as 101 with to determine in image known can the existence of subject of a sale.First process 101 can be analyzed image when image uploads, or can periodically analyze the image previously uploaded.
Can subject of a sale comprise such as the particular brand mark of product or service, the clothes of specific style or the mark of clothing (such as, jeans, footwear, boots, wallet etc.) or commercial company.First process 101 can use various technology to detect in 103 images 101 can subject of a sale.Such as, the first process 101 can realize computer vision to determine whether view data comprises some known special object, feature, texture or activity.
In many aspects, can the predetermined directories of subject of a sale can be stored in a database or similar memory location 104 and during computer vision analysis quilt process be indexed.In other side, son process can realize optical character identification with the one or more titles in identification image, and once identified, by name or other mark memory location 105 is indexed determine identified character whether correspond to known can subject of a sale.First process 101 also can to identify in the metadata that is embedded in upload images known can subject of a sale.
Can subject of a sale once be identified to, the first process 101 can subject of a sale, image and upload images user be associated.Then can by this association store 105 in memory location 104.Therefore, memory location 104 can comprise multiple user and can relation between subject of a sale.Such as, if multiple product is stored, then each product can be associated with one or more user.In some embodiments, subject of a sale multiple association level can be comprised.Such as, product can be associated with product category and brand, multiple brand is associated with each product category.In one example, the footwear of particular type can be kind " footwear " and be manufactured by one or more brand manufacturer or sold.
First process 101 along with image be uploaded to social networks and continue by user with can subject of a sale be associated.When making association (such as, in memory location 104), the first process 101 mark or generate and be used for the timestamp of image, make to determine in image can the correlativity of subject of a sale and current trend.In one example, the timestamp when expression image can taken is together with in other metadata embedded images.Then this timestamp can be identified by the first process 101 in image.In another example, time of social networks and/or date can be uploaded to based on image by user and the rise time stabs.
Second process 106 accessible storage positions 104 with mark with detect can the current trend that is associated of subject of a sale.In many aspects, can based on such as with detecting in one or more group the threshold number of the relevant image uploading of subject of a sale can identify current trend for one or more groups of users.Therefore, the second process 106 accessible storage positions 104 are to determine 107 groups of users based on predetermined criterion.Such as, group can be determined based on the relation between user.In this, this relation can be determined when user uses social networks relative to specific user.
Additionally or alternatively, the relation between the user in group can be determined based on common interest.Second process 106 can determine one or more interest of each user based on the information being supplied to social networks by user, and then determines common interest based on provided information.Customer-furnished information can based on society's exchange activity.Such as, the second process 106 can determine relation based on the viewing etc. of the identical or approval of similar model or content in one or more social activity stream, identical or similar model or goods or advertisement.In many aspects, the relation between one or more user can based on the social connections made between users.Such as, user may be added to " friend " mutually, and a user may follow another user, may be responded by Email or other communication, or user may in the certain separation degree in social networks.
Once determine group, the second process 106 can estimate that 108 can the popularity of subject of a sale in group.Such as, second process 106 can determine to comprise can how many images of subject of a sale or message be uploaded by the user in group, how many images in image or message or message is approved of by the user of group or viewing, user approve of or viewing how much with can the relevant image of subject of a sale or message or advertisement (such as, face in or beyond group), how many users of group generate with can the relevant activity of subject of a sale, comprise and approving of or viewing etc.
When analyze by the user of group provide can the example of subject of a sale time, the second process 106 can further to described many examples filter only to comprise wherein with can the related example of timestamp within certain time period that be associated of subject of a sale.This time period can comprise such as at current date or the scheduled time slot before the time or around the one or more scheduled time slot in the timestamp be associated with one or more analyzed image.In one example, the second process 106 mark be used for for groups of users detect can averaging time of all examples of subject of a sale, and from averaging time, then select the period corresponding with standard deviation as the described time period.
In one or more embodiment, the second process 106 is configured to determine popularity and aforesaid intervals and the current trend 109 that identifies for groups of users based on the institute of number image.Therefore, can such as identify when reaching the related example of threshold number for this group in group for can the current trend of subject of a sale.In this, current trend can periodic variation, depend on current slot and for this current slot can the number of related example of subject of a sale.In many aspects, current trend can comprise about related example number or can the popularity of subject of a sale be increasing or the instruction reduced in group.When increasing or reduce to be greater than predetermined threshold speed, current trend can be identified further.
Once for groups of users deterministic trend, the second process 106 can determine the value of 110 these trend.The value of this trend can be used to for detect can the supplier of the relevant product of subject of a sale or service to set the value of supply (such as, advertisement).In various embodiments, each relative users for group determines this value.Therefore, the second process 106 can determine default value or based on determined can the value of the popularity (such as, proportional) of subject of a sale in the group be associated with user " friend " of user (such as).
In one or more embodiment, can based on the correlation level of subject of a sale and user can determine or adjust this value.One or more interest of user can be determined based on one or more activities of the user in social networks (such as, by model, approval, viewing, click etc.).Then can identify can relation between subject of a sale and one or more interest, and determines user and can correlation level between subject of a sale based on the intensity of this relation.In addition, user and also can be used to determine whether what be supplied to social networks by user can the example of subject of a sale be related example by this correlation level between subject of a sale.
Once determine trend for this groups of users, can to can the relevant one or more suppliers of subject of a sale to notify that 111 these current trend are applicable in this groups of users one or more.Such as, when can subject of a sale be specific products or service, notified supplier can comprise the supplier of product or service or provide the supplier of competing product or service.
Supplier can be notified when meeting one or more predetermined condition.Such as, supplier can be notified when current trend departs from initial trend.Deviation or change can comprise such as popularity and increase above certain amount (such as in certain hour section, in 5 hours present 15% image in the previous product detected in the image of 5% that detects), or in popular, become decline from previous rising.
Subject technology can comprise for by trend and the user interface 112 informing to supplier about the groups of users of those trend.Supplier can use interface 112 identify with the product provided by supplier or serve relevant trend, the user that mark and those trend correlations join, and the advertisement bought in social networks is placed to be shown to one or more user identified.Such as can set based on the previous determined value for selected user or group the cost placing advertisement.This value can further based on (such as, by user and can the relation between subject of a sale measure) trend and the user-dependent degree that identified.Therefore, interface 112 is bought for supplier provides and provides advertisement and other supply to be shown to the ability of selected user.
Fig. 2 is the process flow diagram for detecting the example process of trend from the image uploading to social networks of the one or more aspects illustrated according to subject technology.The square frame of Fig. 2 does not need to perform according to shown order.It should be understood that described order is the diagram of one or more exemplary method, and be not intended to the particular order or the hierarchy that are confined to proposition.Square frame can be rearranged and/or side by side can perform two or more in square frame.
According to one or more embodiment, one or more square frames of Fig. 2 can process by execution first machine or the computing equipment execution that 101 and/or second process 106.Similarly, non-provisional machine readable media can comprise machine-executable instruction in the above, and it performs the square frame of Fig. 2 when being performed by machine or computing equipment.Therefore, can be able to upload with wherein user and shared digital picture social networks, socially particularly flow the square frame performing Fig. 2 explicitly.
