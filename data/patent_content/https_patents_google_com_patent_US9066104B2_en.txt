Definitions
- Particular embodiments generally relate to video compression.
- a great degree of redundancy may exist. That is, within a very short period of time, the shape(s) of foreground object(s) and the background within a picture may not vary very much, and pixels in the foreground objects may move along a similar nature.
- object-based video coding different parts of a picture can be coded and transmitted separately as video objects. Motion information of different pixels in the same object should be the same in some cases. However, many bits still need to be used to describe the arbitrary object shape, which reduces coding efficiency. Thus, the efficient representation of object motion is challenging.
- High efficiency video coding is a block-based hybrid spatial and temporal predictive coding scheme.
- HEVC partitions an input picture into square blocks referred to as largest coding units (LCUs) that could be a size up to 64 ⁇ 64. Theoretically, a larger coding unit is preferred to take advantage of correlation among immediate neighboring pixels.
- LCU largest coding units
- Each LCU can be partitioned into smaller square blocks called coding units (CUs).
- FIG. 1A shows an example of an LCU partition of CUs.
- An LCU 100 is first partitioned into four CUs 102 .
- Each CU 102 may also be further split into four smaller CUs 102 that are a quarter of the size of the CU 102 .
- CUs 102 - 1 , 102 - 3 , and 102 - 4 are a quarter of the size of LCU 100 . Further, a CU 102 - 2 has been split into four CUs 102 - 5 , 102 - 6 , 102 - 7 , and 102 - 8 .
- FIG. 1B shows a quadtree 104 of the LCU partition shown in FIG. 1A .
- Each node of quadtree 104 is assigned a flag of “1” if the node is further split into four sub-nodes and assigned a flag of “0” if the node is not split.
- the flag is called a split bit (e.g. 1) or stop bit (e.g., 0) and is coded in a compressed bitstream.
- a node 106 - 1 includes a flag “1” at a top CU level because LCU 100 is split into 4 CUs. At an intermediate CU level, the flags indicate whether a CU 102 is further split into four CUs. In this case, a node 106 - 3 includes a flag of “1” because CU 102 - 2 has been split into four CUs 102 - 5 - 102 - 8 . Nodes 106 - 2 , 106 - 4 , and 106 - 5 include a flag of “0” because these CUs 102 are not split.
- Nodes 106 - 6 , 106 - 7 , 106 - 8 , and 106 - 9 are at a bottom CU level and hence, no flag bit of “0” or ‘1” is necessary for those nodes because corresponding CUs 102 - 5 - 102 - 8 are not split.
- the partitioning process may continue all the way to 4 ⁇ 4 blocks.
- the quadtree data representation for quadtree 104 shown in FIG. 1B may be represented by the binary data of “10100”, where each bit represents a node 106 of quadtree 104 .
- the binary data indicates the LCU partitioning to the encoder and decoder, and this binary data needs to be coded and transmitted as overhead.
- Each CU 102 may include one or more prediction units (PUs).
- the PUs may be used to perform spatial prediction or temporal prediction.
- FIG. 2 shows an example of a CU partition of PUs 202 . As shown, a CU 102 has been partitioned into four PUs 202 - 1 - 202 - 4 . Spatial or temporal prediction coding may be performed over each PU 202 . In inter-mode, motion parameters are coded and transmitted for each PU. The structure may require many bits for motion information, especially for irregularly shaped objects.
- a spatial merge mode may be used to improve coding efficiency.
- the spatial merge mode may merge a current block with its neighboring block(s) to form a “region”. All the pixels within the region share the same motion parameters. Thus, there is no need to code and transmit motion parameters for each individual block of a region. Instead, for a region, only one set of motion parameters is coded and transmitted.
- the current block is allowed to merge with a spatially-located block that is neighboring the current block to the left or the top.
- An indicator is used to specify whether the current block is merged with an available neighboring block, either the left neighboring block or the top neighboring block should be used in the spatial merge.
- the spatial merge mode is limited to merging with spatially-located blocks in the same frame.

- FIG. 9 depicts a simplified flowchart of an alternate embodiment for a method for determining which mode to use in an encoding process according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 10 depicts a simplified flowchart of a method for decoding for a current block according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 11 depicts an example of an encoder according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 12 depicts an example of a decoder according to one embodiment.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example of a system for encoding and decoding video content according to one embodiment.
- the system includes an encoder 300 and a decoder 301 , both of which will be described in more detail below.
- Encoder 300 uses a spatial merge manager 302 - 1 in an encoding process and decoder 301 uses a spatial-merge manager 302 - 2 in a decoding process.
- encoder 300 and decoder 301 use the HEVC coding scheme.
- Each spatial merge manager 302 allows spatial correlation to be taken into consideration for spatially-located blocks while in a merge mode. That is, given a current block in the merge mode, spatially-located blocks may be used (i.e., a spatial merge mode) in a merge with the current block. For example, the left and top neighboring blocks may be used as spatially-located blocks may be used. Motion parameters of the current block may be derived from the spatially-located blocks and used in the spatial merge.
- Spatial merge mode may merge a current block with the spatially-located block to form a “region”. All the pixels within the region share the same motion parameters. Thus, there is no need to code and transmit motion parameters for each individual block of a region. Instead, for a region, only one set of motion parameters is coded and transmitted.
- a current block may conceptually merge with more than one spatially-located block and use the motion parameters of more than one spatially-located block(s) to form its own motion parameters.
- the current block may conceptually merge with two different spatially-located blocks, and use the motion parameters from the two different spatially-located blocks to form the motion parameters in spatial merge.
- motion parameters may be determined by combining motion parameters from spatially-located blocks. For example, two different sets of motion parameters may be determined from different spatially-located blocks.
- the motion parameters including motion vectors, may be scaled according to the temporal difference between the reference picture and the current picture.
- Motion parameters are motion vectors plus reference picture indices. Reference picture indices are used to indicate which picture is used for reference. For the scaling process, this should be applied on motion vectors and may be scaled according to the temporal difference between the reference picture and the current picture.
- block A is the current block in picture 3 and it needs to get a reference in picture 2 .
- Block B is the upper block and its motion parameter points to a reference in picture 1 . Due to the different reference pictures, the motion vector of block B needs to be scaled before applied to block A in merge mode.
- the spatially-located blocks described above may be identified on a merge mode candidate list. For example, the left and top spatially-located blocks, and two combined blocks may be candidates to be merged with a current block.
- Particular embodiments provide signaling from spatial merge manager 302 - 1 to spatial merge manager 302 - 2 to indicate which motion parameters from a block to use in decoding the current block.
- Particular embodiments may not require providing signaling from spatial merge manager 302 - 1 to spatial merge manager 302 - 2 to indicate which merge mode to use.
- an index may be set and signaled to indicate which motion parameters are used.
- flags may be set and signaled to indicate which motion parameters should be used in the coding process.
- actual signaling of which merge mode is preferred and which blocks are merged may not be performed as encoder 300 and decoder 301 separately determine which merge mode to use.
- FIGS. 4-8 illustrate the various merging scenarios for spatial merging according to one embodiment.
- the motion vector parameters may be determined in different ways. Described herein are different ways of determining which merge mode to use.
- FIG. 4 depicts spatial neighboring blocks according to one embodiment.
- a current block is a block X.
- Current block X is allowed to spatially merge with a left neighboring block, block B, or a top neighboring block, a block A.
- FIG. 5 depicts a scenario when block X is not in any merge mode according to one embodiment.
- Motion vectors 502 - 1 , 502 - 2 , and 502 - 3 are shown for blocks in frame t.
- the motion parameters such as the motion vector, need to be coded.
- the motion parameters may include a reference picture index indicating which reference picture is used for prediction.
- the actual motion parameters are sent from encoder 300 to decoder 301 in this case.
- FIG. 6 depicts a scenario when block X is merged with block A in the spatial merge mode according to one embodiment.
- motion vector 502 - 1 for block X is the same as motion vector 502 - 2 .
- Block X is thus spatially merged with block A, which is the top neighboring block.
- Motion parameters for motion vector 502 - 1 only need to be coded once in this example for block X and block A. As will be discussed below, certain calculations will determine that block X is merged with block A.
- FIG. 7 depicts a scenario when block X is merged with block B in the spatial merge mode according to one embodiment.
- Block B is the left neighboring block to block X
- motion vector 502 - 1 is the same as motion vector 502 - 3 for block B.
- Motion parameters only need to be coded once in this example for block X and block B. That is, the same motion parameters used for block B, such as motion vector 502 - 3 , are used to for block X.
- Known methods use different ways of indicating which merge mode to use.
- an index may be used.
- flags may be used. In all these cases, the use of two-three extra bits must be used to communicate the signal.
- merge mode is the saving of motion information for block X.
- one extra bit is required for a current block to indicate if the current block is in merge mode, or not, for example, through the use of flags.
- flags if the current block is in merge mode, for example merge_flag is set to 1, one additional bit is required to indicate if the current block is merged with its left or top coded neighboring block if the left and top coded neighboring blocks have different motion information.
- a flag can be used, for example, merge_left_flag to signal such scenarios.
- Described herein is a way to save one bit per block. Instead of sending the bit to signal if the current block is merged with its top or left neighboring block, the merging direction is derived based upon the motion information of the coded neighboring blocks.
- FIG. 8 depicts a simplified flowchart of a method for determining which mode to use in an encoding process according to one embodiment.
- spatial merge manager 302 - 1 determines if a current block X should be in a merge mode. If not, at 804 , motion parameters for block X are coded. This may be the normal coding process for block X. Either flags, indexes or some other mechanism is used to indicate that merge mode is not enabled.
- spatial merge manager 302 - 1 enables the merge mode. For example, spatial merge manager 302 - 1 sets an index, flag, bit or some other indicator to indicate that the merge mode is enabled.
- MV A , MV B , MV C , MV D be the MV of the spatial neighbors A, B, C, and D, per reference list individually.
- refIdx A , refIdx B , refIdx C , refIdx D be the reference pictures pointed by MV A , MV B , MV C , MV D , individually, per reference list.
- the current block X is in merge mode. Possible actions include being spatially merged with either block A or block B.
- merging direction is determined dependent upon motion information to the neighboring blocks. This is explained in more detail, below.
- a current block X has four spatially coded neighbors, A, B, C and D in the current picture. There may be one, two, or more reference lists available for the current block X.
- the merging direction of block X per reference list is determined as follows:
- MV A scale ⁇ ( M ⁇ ⁇ V A )
- MV B scale ⁇ ( MV B )
- MV C scale ⁇ ( MV C )
- MV D scacle ⁇ ( MV D )
- ⁇ MV AD MV A ⁇ MV D
- ⁇ MV BC MV BC ⁇ MV C .
- the calculation is norm of ⁇ MV AD smaller than or equal to the norm of ⁇ MV BC , that is, ⁇ MV AD ⁇ MV BC ⁇ is performed
- block X is merged with the top block B, implying blocks X and B will share the same MV B and refIdx B ,
- block X is merged with the left block A, implying blocks X and A will share the same MV A and refIdx A .
- spatial merge manager 302 - 1 has determined and can store information indicating the motion parameters used.
- Encoder 300 also encodes the motion parameters for the merged region at least once. Each block in the merged region use the same motion parameters so sending the motion parameters for each block in the region is avoided, which reduces overhead.
- An alternative embodiment is as follows in FIG. 9 .
- spatial merge manager 302 - 1 determines if a current block X should be in a merge mode. If not, at 904 , motion parameters for block X are coded. This may be the normal coding process for block X. Either flags, indexes or some other mechanism is used to indicate that merge mode is not enabled.
- spatial merge manager 302 - 1 enables the merge mode. For example, spatial merge manager 302 - 1 sets an index, flag, bit or some other indicator to indicate that the merge mode is enabled.
- MV A , MV B , MV C , MV D be the MV of the spatial neighbors A, B, C, and D, per reference list individually.
- refIdx A , refIdx B , refIdx C , refIdx D be the reference pictures pointed by MV A , MV B , MV C , MV D , individually, per reference list.
- merging direction is determined dependent upon motion information to the neighboring blocks. This is explained in more detail, below.
- the merging direction of block X per reference list is determined as follows:
- MV A scale ⁇ ( M ⁇ ⁇ V A )
- MV B scale ⁇ ( MV B )
- MV C scale ⁇ ( MV C )
- MV D scale ⁇ ( MV D )
- the calculation is norm of ⁇ MV AD smaller than or equal to the norm of ⁇ MV BD , that is, ⁇ MV AD ⁇ MV BD ⁇ is performed.
- block X is merged with the top block B, implying blocks X and B will share the same MV B and refIdx B ,
- block X is merged with the left block A, implying blocks X and A will share the same MV A and refIdx A .
- spatial merge manager 302 - 1 has determined and can store information indicating the motion parameters used.
- Encoder 300 also encodes the motion parameters for the merged region at least once. Each block in the merged region use the same motion parameters so sending the motion parameters for each block in the region is avoided, which reduces overhead.
- the same reference picture mentioned above can be, for example, the reference pointed by either MV A or MV B , whichever has a smaller nonnegative refIdx x .
- blocks A, B, C, and D are coded block for the current block X, their MV(s) are available for both encoder and decoder. Hence, no bit is required to indicate which neighbor block's MV(s) are used for a block in merging mode. If A, B, C, or D is not available or in intra mode, the associated MV(s) are set to be (0,0) and refIdx to ⁇ 1.
- FIG. 10 depicts a simplified flowchart 1000 of a method for decoding for a current block according to one embodiment.
- spatial merge manager 302 - 2 determines if the merge mode is enabled for a current block X. For example, spatial merge manager 302 - 2 determines if the flag merge_flag is set to a value of “0” to indicate that current block X is not in any merge mode or to a value of “1” to indicate that the current block X is in the merge mode. If the merge mode is not enabled, at 1004 , then motion parameters for block X are determined and used in motion prediction at decoder 301 . In another embodiment, information in an index is used to determine if the merge mode is or is not enabled.
- MV A , MV B , MV C , MV D are set to the MV of the spatial neighbors A, B, C, and D, per reference list individually.
- refIdx A , refIdx B , refIdx C , refIdx D are set to the reference pictures pointed by MV A , MV B , MV C , and MV D , individually.
- merging direction is determined dependent upon motion information to the neighboring blocks. This is explained in more detail, below.
- MV A scale ⁇ ( M ⁇ ⁇ V A )
- MV B scale ⁇ ( MV B )
- MV C scale ⁇ ( MV C )
- MV D scale ⁇ ( MV D )
- ⁇ MV AD is smaller than or equal to the norm of ⁇ MV BC , that is, ⁇ MV AD ⁇ MV BC ⁇
- block X is merged with the top block B, implying blocks X and B will share the same MV B and refIdx B
- block X is merged with the left block A, implying blocks X and A will share the same MV A and refIdx A .
- FIG. 11 depicts an example of an encoder 300 according to one embodiment.
- a general operation of encoder 300 will now be described. It will be understood that variations on the encoding process described will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art based on the disclosure and teachings herein.
- a spatial prediction block 1104 may include different spatial prediction directions per PU, such as horizontal, vertical, 45-degree diagonal, 135-degree diagonal, DC (flat averaging), and planar.
- a temporal prediction block 1106 performs temporal prediction through a motion estimation and motion compensation operation.
- the motion estimation operation searches for a best match prediction for the current PU over reference pictures.
- the best match prediction is described by a motion vector (MV) and associated reference picture (refIdx).
- MV motion vector
- refIdx reference picture
- the motion vector and associated reference picture are included in the coded bit stream.
- a best match prediction for the current PU is determined using the MV and refIdx.
- Spatial merge manager 302 - 1 may communicate with a temporal prediction block 306 to perform motion prediction for a current PU. If the current block is merged with a spatially-located block or a temporally-located block, spatial-temporal merge manager 302 may signal information indicating which block should be used in the decoding the current block. Motion parameters for the current block do not need to be signaled again if the current block is merged spatially or temporally.
- Transform block 1107 performs a transform operation with the residual PU, e. Transform block 1107 outputs the residual PU in a transform domain, E.
- a quantizer 1108 then quantizes the transform coefficients of the residual PU, E.
- Quantizer 1108 converts the transform coefficients into a finite number of possible values.
- Entropy coding block 1110 entropy encodes the quantized coefficients, which results in final compression bits to be transmitted. Different entropy coding methods may be used, such as context-adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) or context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC).
- CAVLC context-adaptive variable length coding
- CABAC context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding
- a de-quantizer 1112 de-quantizes the quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU.
- De-quantizer 1112 then outputs the de-quantized transform coefficients, E′.
- An inverse transform block 1114 receives the de-quantized transform coefficients, which are then inverse transformed resulting in a reconstructed residual PU, e′.
- the reconstructed PU, e′ is then added to the corresponding prediction, x′, either spatial or temporal, to form the new reconstructed PU, x′′.
- a loop filter 1116 performs de-blocking on the reconstructed PU, x′′, to reduce blocking artifacts.
- loop filter 1116 may perform a sample adaptive offset process after the completion of the de-blocking filter process for the decoded picture, which compensates for a pixel value offset between reconstructed pixels and original pixels. Also, loop filter 1116 may perform adaptive filtering over the reconstructed PU, which minimizes coding distortion between the input and output pictures. Additionally, if the reconstructed pictures are reference pictures, the reference pictures are stored in a reference buffer 1118 for future temporal prediction.
- FIG. 12 depicts an example of decoder 301 according to one embodiment.
- Decoder 301 receives input bits from encoder 300 for compressed video content.
- An entropy decoding block 1230 performs entropy decoding on input bits corresponding to quantized transform coefficients of a residual PU.
- a de-quantizer 1232 de-quantizes the quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU.
- De-quantizer 1232 then outputs the de-quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU, E′.
- An inverse transform block 1234 receives the de-quantized transform coefficients, which are then inverse transformed resulting in a reconstructed residual PU, e′.
- the reconstructed PU, e′ is then added to the corresponding prediction, x′, either spatial or temporal, to form the new constructed PU, x′′.
- a loop filter 1236 performs de-blocking on the reconstructed PU, x′′, to reduce blocking artifacts. Additionally, loop filter 1236 may perform a sample adaptive offset process after the completion of the de-blocking filter process for the decoded picture, which compensates for a pixel value offset between reconstructed pixels and original pixels. Also, loop filter 1236 may perform an adaptive loop filter over the reconstructed PU, which minimizes coding distortion between the input and output pictures. Additionally, if the reconstructed pictures are reference pictures, the reference pictures are stored in a reference buffer 1238 for future temporal prediction.
- the prediction PU, x′ is obtained through either spatial prediction or temporal prediction.
- a spatial prediction block 1240 may receive decoded spatial prediction directions per PU, such as horizontal, vertical, 45-degree diagonal, 135-degree diagonal, DC (flat averaging), and planar. The spatial prediction directions are used to determine the prediction PU, x′.
- temporal prediction block 1242 performs temporal prediction through a motion estimation and motion compensation operation. A decoded motion vector or a motion vector derived from other motion information is then used to determine the prediction PU, x′. Temporal prediction is not contemplated in the embodiment disclosed herein.
- Spatial merge manager 302 - 2 receives signaling from spatial merge manager 302 - 1 indicating the motion parameters to use for the current PU. Spatial merge manager 302 - 2 may communicate with temporal prediction block 1242 to indicate whether the current PU should use motion parameters for a spatially-located block or a temporally-located block. For example, a decoded motion vector may be used for a temporally-located block or a decoded motion vector may be used for a spatially-located block in a temporal prediction.
- Particular embodiments may be implemented in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, system, or machine.
- the computer-readable storage medium contains instructions for controlling a computer system to perform a method described by particular embodiments.
- the instructions when executed by one or more computer processors, may be operable to perform that which is described in particular embodiments.
