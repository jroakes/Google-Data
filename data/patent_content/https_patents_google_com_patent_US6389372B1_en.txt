Definitions
- This invention relates generally to automatic collaborative filtering systems for predicting a user's level of interest in new information, and more particularly to a system and method of bootstrapping or cold starting a collaborative filtering system.
- One way of managing and distributing information is to use a collaborative filtering system to predict a user's preference and use that information to distribute new information to the user.
- Collaborative filtering the sharing of knowledge through recommendations, is an important vehicle for distributing information.
- collaborative filtering mechanisms those which enable active collaborative filtering by making it easier for people to share pointers to interesting documents and those which automate collaborative filtering by using statistical algorithms to make recommendations based on correlations between personal preferences.
- Collaborative filtering systems are of particular value to suppliers of goods and services in that they can be used to enhance the distribution of their goods and services to customers.
- Automated collaborative filtering is a general type of statistical algorithm that matches items (such as movies, books, music, news articles, etc.) to users by first matching users to each other.
- ACF uses statistical algorithms to make recommendations based on correlations between personal preferences.
- Recommendations usually consist of numerical ratings input manually by users, but can also be deduced from user behavior (e.g., time spent reading a document, actions such as printing, saving or deleting a document).
- the premise of such systems is that a user is going to prefer an item that is similar to other items chosen by the user and by other users.
- U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,567 to Rose et al. entitled System for Directing Relevance Ranked Data Objects to Computer Users, describes a system for matching a user's interests by comparing the content of an item with a user's adaptive profile. Feedback is also available to enable the user to update his/her profile.
- Knowledge Pump is a Xerox system which employs a push methodology of sharing knowledge where users are connected by a central knowledge repository with software tracking their interests and building up information that is sent to appropriate users.
- the system is seeded with a skeletal social network of the intended users, a map of the organization's domains of interest and a collection of recommended items. For example, user-provided lists of immediate contacts or friends—people whose opinion the user tends to particularly value—may be used. See Glance et al., “Knowledge Pump: Supporting the Flow and Use of Knowledge,” in Information Technology for Knowledge Management, Eds. U. Borghoff and R. Pareschi, New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 35-45, 1998.
- ACF even when ACF is feasible, it does not necessarily yield accurate predictions.
- the accuracy of the prediction depends on the number of items rated in common by pairs of users X and Y, the number of ratings available for the item and the number of other items each rater of that item has rated.
- a method of predicting a user's rating of a new item in a collaborative filtering system includes providing an initial set of correlation coefficients for the intended users.
- the users are members of a predetermined organization and the correlation coefficient for each pair of users is based on the organizational relationship between the users.
- One such predetermined organizational relationship includes the strength of ties between potential users.
- Examples of organizational data include a formal organization chart and social network maps built using interviews or deduced from observed (online and/or offline) interaction patterns. Such data is generally readily available in an Intranet setting, and may also be inferred for an Internet setting.
- a collaborative filtering system for predicting a user's rating for an item includes a memory and a processor.
- the memory stores a correlation coefficient for each user in the system or the data necessary for calculating the correlation coefficients.
- the correlation coefficient is a measure of the similarity in ratings between pairs of users in the system who have rated a particular item.
- the memory also stores ratings for the item made by other users in the system.
- the processor calculates the weighted average of all the ratings for the item, wherein the weighted average is the sum of the product of a rating and its respective correlation coefficient divided by the sum of the correlation coefficients to provide a predicted user rating.
- the users are members of a predetermined organization and the initial value of the correlation coefficient for each pair of users in the system comprises a predetermined organizational relationship among the users.
- the initial the values for the correlation coefficients can be updated as users provide ratings to items.
- the correlation coefficients can be updated when a user changes his/her rating for a particular item. This is accomplished by backtracking, i.e., removing the prior rating and replacing it with the new rating, then recalculating the affected correlation coefficients.
- ratings are provided in the form of enumerated values (such as 0,1,2,3,4,5). This guarantees that correlations are always defined (no division by zero). Also, preferably, predictions are calculated about a threshold value or constant (such as the midpoint or average of the enumerated values, 2.5).

- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of a method, according to the invention, of updating the correlation coefficients to take into account a new user rating
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a method, according to the invention, of backtracking the correlation coefficients after a user has rerated a previously rated item;
- FIG. 6 is flow chart of another overall method, according to the invention, of updating the correlation coefficients.
- ACF system 10 includes processor 12 and memory 18 .
- Correlation coefficients ⁇ xy and ratings (S i x , S i y ) provided by the various users and others are stored in memory 18 .
- ⁇ xy (0) When the system 10 first starts up, only initial correlation coefficients ⁇ xy (0) need be stored. Subsequent values of ⁇ xy can be stored or calculated in real-time from ratings (S i x , S i y ) and the initial values ⁇ xy (0) . However, it should be noted that for incremental update, the correlation values need to be stored.
- the ⁇ xy (0) for cold-starting the ACF system are provided in a manner described below.
- Initial ratings (S i x , S i y ) may also be provided.
- the processor 12 performs various calculations described below: user prediction, correlation coefficient update, and user-applied ratings.
- a group of users 20 may request and receive recommendations from, and provide ratings to, ACF system 10 via interface 20 .
- Interface 24 may be via an Intranet or the Internet.
- ACF User to user correlations are an essential part of an ACF system.
- a standard approach to ACF is to use the Pearson r Algorithm to calculate user to user correlations (correlation coefficients) from ratings data that has been provided by the users. These correlation coefficients are then used to predict a user's score for an item as a correlation-weighted average of all the ratings for the item.
- S x is X's rating for item S and S y is Y's rating for item S.
- the coefficient r ranges from ⁇ 1, which indicates a negative correlation, to 0, which indicates no correlation, to 1 which indicates a positive correlation between both users.
- Constrained Pearson r Algorithm which takes into account variations of ratings about a fixed point (usually the midpoint of the range). For example, if ratings range from 0 to 5, the constrained Pearson r coefficient would take into account variations around 2.5.
- ⁇ xy ⁇ ( S x - P 0 ) ⁇ ( S y - P 0 ) ⁇ ( S x - P 0 ) 2 ⁇ ⁇ ( S y - P 0 ) 2 . ( 2 )
- a set of values ⁇ xy ⁇ would be obtained, with separate correlation coefficients for each pair of users (X,Y).
- the prediction can be used by a recommender system to make a recommendation to the user X. For example, if P i x is less than the average or midpoint of the ratings, P 0 , the recommender system would likely not recommend item i to user X. If the P i x is greater than P 0 , the recommender system would likely recommend the item i to user X.
- the recommender system may also use the predictions to rank the recommended items shown to the user.
- this prediction relationship (3) is modified to take into account only correlations above a certain threshold.
- the sum is taken over a neighborhood of the N most highly correlated raters.
- the ACF system must be bootstrapped with a set of user to user correlation coefficients and a set of prior user ratings.
- ⁇ xy (0) There are several preferred methods of estimating the initial values of user to user correlations, ⁇ xy (0), and they may be obtained according to one or a combination of the methods described below.
- the first method is to use a formal organizational chart among the intended users and scale the correlation by the number of steps, n, required to reach a common ancestor:
- ⁇ xy (0) ⁇ 0 n , where 0 ⁇ 0 ⁇ 1.
- a second method is to provide a map of the competencies in an organization.
- This map can be used alone or in combination with the correlation relationship (4) to complement the organizational structure.
- the approach to collaborative filtering described herein in fact, is community-centered. That is, the prediction process described above is iterated over a set of communities (or domains of interest). The bootstrapped correlation values can be different for each community. While the organizational chart will stay the same, the set of experts (higher ranked persons in the organization) will depend on the community. By default, all non-expert users would be given a higher default correlation with the experts, with the amount of correlation proportional to the expert's perceived level of competence.
- An advantage of taking into account experts is that they cut across the formal organizational structure.
- Another method of bootstrapping correlation values is to ask users who their advisors are, that is, whose opinions they particularly trust and respect. These advisors could then be given an initially very high correlation with the user. Conversely, users could be asked for those people whose opinion they do not trust (a kind of “kill” file or contrary indicator). These “advisors” would be assigned very low default correlations. More generally, the system could include a method of allowing users to specify default correlations between themselves and anyone else in the organization. This same method could be used to dynamically “re-set” or tweak correlation values that the system has learned for the user.
- step 102 a set of initial correlation coefficients ⁇ xy (0) is provided using one of the methods described above.
- a set of prior user ratings (or estimates) is also provided.
- the variance ⁇ 0 for each user is also provided as part of the prior ratings.
- step 106 a new item i, which has been rated by at least some of the other users in the community, is provided.
- step 108 a prediction of how user X will rate item i is made.
- step 110 if the rating is greater than a threshold value P 0 , then the recommender system makes a recommendation to user X in step 112 . If not, the recommender system does not make a recommendation in step 114 .
- the user to user correlation values ⁇ xy (0) must be updated to incorporate the ratings made by users for the same items in the system.
- a method for updating the correlation values using data about ratings for documents rated by X and Y as such data becomes available is also described below.
- To update the correlation value the update relationship, with a parameterized weight accorded to the initial value, is obtained.
- the update formula is a much more efficient way to calculate the correlation coefficient. Every time there is a new rating by X on an item that has also been rated by Y, the new correlation coefficient is calculated from the previous value using the update relationship. Referring to FIG. 3, a flow chart of the overall method of updating the correlation coefficients ⁇ xy is shown. For each item i in step 120 , a check is made in step 122 to determine if user X has provided a rating for item i. If not, the routine ends at step 124 . If the user X does rate item i, the routine checks if X has previously rated the item i at step 126 .
- step 128 the system backtracks the ⁇ xy for all affected ⁇ xy in step 128 (i.e., the system replaces the old rating for i with the new rating). Then in step 130 the routine updates the ⁇ xy for all affected users Y who have rated item i in common with user X.
- the update formula is obtained by expanding the correlation coefficient relationship (Equation 2) as a function of the previous correlation coefficient, the new rating pair, the variance of X's distribution of ratings on items in common with Y and the variance of Y's distribution of ratings in common with X (not including the new rating).
- ⁇ xy ⁇ ( T xy + 1 ) N ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ ( T xy ) ⁇ ⁇ y ⁇ ( T xy ) ⁇ ⁇ xy ⁇ ( T xy ) + ( S x - P 0 ) ⁇ ( S y - P 0 ) ( N + 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ ( T xy + 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ y ⁇ ( T xy + 1 ) ⁇ ⁇
- N xy (T xy ) N 0 +T xy .
- N 0 is a parameter of the system which reflects the weight attributed to the prior estimate of the user-user correlation.
- N 0 is a parameter of the system which reflects the weight attributed to the prior estimate of the user-user correlation.
- the value for ⁇ 0 could be estimated using ratings data sets taken from other systems. It is expected that the initial value chosen for ⁇ 0 to be about 20% of the range of the rating scale (i.e., somewhere between 0.5 to 1.5 for a six-point rating scale that goes from 0 to 5 as in the example above).
- the update routine 130 for updating ⁇ xy is used.
- the current value for T xy is obtained.
- the standard deviations ⁇ x and ⁇ y are updated in step 134 using Equations (6).
- ⁇ xy (T xy +1) is calculated in step 136 using Equation (5).
- the routine checks if the ⁇ xy have been updated for all users Y who have rated an item in common with user X. Once all the applicable ⁇ xy have been updated, the routine ends at step 140 .
- ⁇ xy ⁇ ( T xy - 1 ) N ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ ( T xy ) ⁇ ⁇ y ⁇ ( T xy ) ⁇ ⁇ xy ⁇ ( T xy ) - ( S x - P 0 ) ⁇ ( S y - P 0 ) ( N - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ ( T xy - 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ y ⁇ ( T xy - 1 ) ( 7 )
- the backtrack routine 150 for backtracking ⁇ xy is used.
- step 152 the current value for T xy is obtained.
- the standard deviations ⁇ x and ⁇ y are backtracked in step 154 using Equations (8).
- ⁇ xy (T xy ⁇ 1) is calculated in step 156 using Equation (7).
- the routine checks if the ⁇ xy have been backtracked for all users Y who have rated an item in common with user X. Once all the applicable ⁇ xy have been backtracked, the routine ends at step 160 .
- step 180 For each new rating by user X of an item i the routine at step 180 is called.
- step 182 all users Y who have also rated item i are determined.
- step 184 increment and save T xy for all such users X and Y.
- step 186 update and save ⁇ x , ⁇ y and ⁇ xy , indexed by X and Y using Equations (5) and (6).
- step 188 for all items j ⁇ i, which Y has rated, but X has not, predict (and save) X's rating on j using Equation (3).
- step 190 for all items j ⁇ i, which X has rated, but Y has not, predict (and save) Y's rating on j using Equation (3).
- step 192 find all users Y where Y has not rated i.
- step 194 predict (and save) Y's rating on i using Equation (3).
- step 184 is skipped and step 186 is modified to include a backtrack calculation (using Equations (7) and (8)) before the update calculation.
- Equation (3) the update relationship Equation (5) can also be employed to calculate the predictions. If used, additional intermediate calculations would need to be saved that entail additional storage that scales with M ⁇ D. If storage is limited, the correlations can be calculated from the ratings data only by iterating over the following revised procedures.
- the modified method is accomplished by iterating over the time-ordered list of ratings. For each new rating by user X of an item i,
- step (2) For subsequent ratings of user X of an item i, step (2) is skipped and step (3) is modified to include an update step. All predictions for all users on all unrated documents can then be calculated in one pass.
- the present invention may be readily implemented in software using software development environments that provide portable source code that can be used on a variety of hardware platforms.
- the disclosed system may be implemented partially or fully in hardware using standard logic circuits. Whether software or hardware is used to implement the system varies depending on the speed and efficiency requirements of the system and also the particular function and the particular software or hardware systems and the particular microprocessor or microcomputer systems being utilized.
