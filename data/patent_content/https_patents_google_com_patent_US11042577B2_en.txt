CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/073,082, filed Mar. 17, 2016, which is incorporated by reference.
FIELD
The present specification relates to search engines.
BACKGROUND
In general, some users are limited with their ability to generate appropriate search queries, as well as process search results based on the search query. For example, these users may not be tech-savvy and their web experience is limited by a lack of understanding on how to use online tools such as search engines.
SUMMARY
According to some innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification, a computing device provides an interface to a user that includes relevant information with minimal interaction by the user by suggesting questions to the user for initiating a search. The interface can include relevant information based on contextual information of the user, such as a location of the user or interests of the user. The user can select a provided question, and in response, the interface is updated to display answers that are associated with the selected question. The user can subsequently select one of the provided answers that in turn is used as a basis for identifying additional questions related to the selected answer. The interface is updated to display the additional questions, and the process repeats iteratively until there are no further associated questions or answers.
In one example implementation, the user launches an application running on a mobile computing device, and the application can initially display an interface including relevant questions to the user based on the location of the user. For example, the user is located in downtown New York City, and the interface can display popular questions for New York City, such as “What are the best sites for New York City” and “What are the best shows to see in New York City.” The user can select the question “What are the best sites for New York City,” and in turn, the interface is updated to display relevant answers to the question, such as “Empire State Building” and “Times Square.” The user can subsequently select “Empire State Building” and the interface is further updated to include additional questions based on the answer “Empire State Building” such as “How tall is the Empire State Building” and “How old is the Empire State Building.” The user can select the question “How old is the Empire State Building” and the interface is further updated to include an answer “84 years.” Upon selection of the answer “84 years” by the user, it is determined that there are no further questions associated with the answer “84 year.” However, the interface can be updated for input of an additional question provided by the user for association with the answer “84 years.”
Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving data identifying one or more contexts; selecting an initial set of one or more questions based at least on one or more of the contexts; providing a respective representation of one or more of the questions of the initial set, for output; receiving data indicating a selection of a particular representation associated with a particular question of the initial set of questions; selecting a set of one or more answers associated with the particular question; providing a respective representation of one or more of the answers of the set that are associated with the particular question, for output; receiving data indicating a selection of a particular representation associated with a particular answer of the set that are associated with the particular question; determining that an additional set of one or more other questions is associated with the particular answer; and in response to determining that the additional set of one or more other questions is associated with the particular answer, providing a respective representation of one or more of the other questions of the additional set, for output.
Other embodiments of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, determining that no other questions are associated with the particular answer; and in response to determining that no other questions are associated with the particular answer: providing, for output, a control for submission of a new question, receiving the new question entered through the control, and storing data associating the new question with the particular answer. The one or more contexts includes a location-based context of a mobile computing device providing the data identifying the one or more contexts. The one or more contexts includes an interest-based context of a user associated with a mobile computing device providing the data identifying the one or more contexts. The one or more of the questions of the initial set are ranked based on a popularity of each of the questions. The one or more of the answers of the set are ranked based on a popularity of each of the answers. Providing the respective representation of one or more of the answers of the set that are associated with the particular question, for output, further includes: providing, for output, a control for submission of a new answer, receiving the new answer entered through the control, and storing data associating the new answer with the particular question.

Computing device 400 includes a processor 402, memory 404, a storage device 406, a high-speed interface 408 connecting to memory 404 and high-speed expansion ports 410, and a low speed interface 412 connecting to low speed bus 414 and storage device 406. Each of the components 402, 404, 406, 408, 410, and 412, are interconnected using various busses, and may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. The processor 402 may process instructions for execution within the computing device 400, including instructions stored in the memory 404 or on the storage device 406 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such as display 416 coupled to high speed interface 408. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system).
The memory 404 stores information within the computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. The memory 404 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk.
The storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 400. In one implementation, the storage device 406 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product may be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 404, the storage device 406, or a memory on processor 402.
The high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while the low speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled to memory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled to storage device 406 and low-speed expansion port 414. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. IN some examples, the storage device 406 is coupled to a high-speed bus.
The computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a rack server system 424. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as device 440. Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing device 400, 440, and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 400, 440 communicating with each other.
Computing device 440 includes a processor 452, memory 464, an input/output device such as a display 454, a communication interface 476, and a transceiver 468, among other components. The device 440 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of the components 440, 452, 464, 454, 476, and 468, are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate.
The processor 452 may execute instructions within the computing device 640, including instructions stored in the memory 464. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of the device 440, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by device 440, and wireless communication by device 440.
Processor 452 may communicate with a user through control interface 468 and display interface 446 coupled to a display 454. The display 454 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. The display interface 446 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving the display 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. The control interface 448 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to the processor 452. In addition, an external interface 462 may be provide in communication with processor 452, so as to enable near area communication of device 440 with other devices. External interface 462 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used.
The memory 464 stores information within the computing device 440. The memory 464 may be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 444 may also be provided and connected to device 440 through expansion interface 442, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface. Such expansion memory 444 may provide extra storage space for device 440, or may also store applications or other information for device 440. Specifically, expansion memory 444 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 444 may be provide as a security module for device 440, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of device 440. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner.
The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 464, expansion memory 444, memory on processor 452, or a propagated signal that may be received, for example, over transceiver 468 or external interface 462.
Device 440 may communicate wirelessly through communication interface 476, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. Communication interface 476 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 468. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver module 440 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data to device 440, which may be used as appropriate by applications running on device 440.
Device 440 may also communicate audibly using audio codec 460, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information. Audio codec 460 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of device 440. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating on device 440.
The computing device 440 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of a smartphone 482, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device.
Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here may be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations may include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and may be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here may be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user may provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices may be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user may be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
The systems and techniques described here may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user may interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
The computing system may include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
While this disclosure includes some specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosure or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features of example implementations of the disclosure. Certain features that are described in this disclosure in the context of separate implementations can also be provided in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be provided in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
Thus, particular implementations of the present disclosure have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For example, various forms of the flows shown above may be used, with steps re-ordered, added, or removed. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
