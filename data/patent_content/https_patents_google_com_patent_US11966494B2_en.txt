Definitions
- Computing devices may have access to one or more types of input and output interfaces.
- the computing device can receive or transmit data to one or more types of devices via a network.
- it can be challenging to efficiently present data via the computing device.
- assistant devices As automated assistants become more ubiquitous, computing devices specifically designed to facilitate interaction with automated assistants—referred to herein as “assistant devices”—are becoming more commonplace. Many assistant devices enable users to engage in touch-free interaction with automated assistants. For example, assistant devices often include microphones that allow users to provide vocal utterances as input. Additionally, more and more assistant devices now include display capabilities.
- Techniques are described herein for responding to requests for automated assistants to act in accordance with information associated with a given user (e.g., a homeowner, or more generally, a user who controls/owns device(s) that provide automated assistant access, also referred to herein as a “subject user”) when the request originates with other users (e.g., guests of the homeowner, or “guest” users operating particular device, also referred to herein as a “requesting user”).
- a request submitted by a first user that relates to information associated with a second user may be relatively broad and/or open-ended. Satisfying such a request may require access to multiple data sources that store data associated with the second user.
- Techniques described herein are usable to aggregate individual privacy scores associated with these data sources and/or data obtained from these data sources, and to determine whether (or how specifically) to respond to the request based on the aggregate privacy score.
- the automated assistant may formulate a natural language response based on the multiple data from the multiple data sources, and this natural language response may be associated with the aggregate privacy score.
- the automated assistant may perform an action (such as controlling one or more devices).
- a determination may be made of whether the aggregate data score satisfies some criterion, such as not exceeding a privacy threshold. If the criterion is satisfied (e.g., the aggregate privacy score does not exceed the privacy threshold), the formulated natural language response may be output by the automated assistant to the requesting user and/or an action requested by the requesting user may be performed.
- Alice may not necessarily maintain a comprehensive calendar, particularly for social activities occurring outside of business hours. Accordingly, in order to answer this question the automated assistant may need to access data source(s) beyond Alice's calendar, such as Alice's emails or texts (which may contain communications about upcoming dinner plans), or Alice's current location (which could rule out dinner in the immediate future if Alice is far away).
- data source(s) beyond Alice's calendar such as Alice's emails or texts (which may contain communications about upcoming dinner plans), or Alice's current location (which could rule out dinner in the immediate future if Alice is far away).
- any data obtained on behalf of Dave from Alice's calendar may be assigned a relatively low privacy score.
- Alice may consider her electronic correspondence and/or current location to be far more private/sensitive. Consequently, data obtained from those sources may have relatively high privacy scores.
- the automated assistant is able to determine, using data from all three sources, that Alice is next available for dinner a week from Tuesday. The automated assistant may formulate a natural language response such as “Alice is available for dinner a week from Tuesday.” However, the automated assistant may not yet provide this response to Dave.
- the automated assistant may determine and/or evaluate an aggregate privacy score determined from the three underlying data sources, and determine that Alice's privacy criterion with respect to Dave (or at least with respect to this particular request) does not permit the automated assistant to provide this response. Accordingly, the automated assistant may instead tell Dave, “Sorry, I can't provide that information.” In some implementations, the automated assistant (or, technically, another instance of an automated assistant) may meanwhile seek permission from Alice to provide Dave with an answer to his request.
- Dave is visiting Alice at her home. Dave may request an automated assistant to “Turn up the heating”.
- a data source relevant to this request may provide the current temperature to which a heating system linked to the automated assistant is set. Alice may be willing to share this data with Dave. However, Alice may additionally control her heating in dependence on both a set schedule and her current location. Since, as above, Alice may consider location information to be sensitive, the aggregate privacy score for the data sources necessary to perform the request may be such that Dave does not meet the privacy criterion. If so, the automated assistant may reply “Sorry, I can't help with that” or similar. If Dave does meet the privacy criterion, the automated assistant may enact the relevant action (for example, by instructing the heating system to respond accordingly).
- the automated assistant may go ahead and assemble sufficient data to formulate an answer (referred to as “fulfillment information” below), and then present that answer to Alice as part of soliciting permission from Alice to present it to Dave.
- full information referred to as “fulfillment information” below
- Alice could even be presented with audible or visual output that identifies the data sources used to generate the answer, which data points from each data source were used to assemble the answer. That way Alice can see exactly how the answer was assembled and decide whether to permit the answer to be presented to Dave.
- subject users' responses to such requests may be used to determine whether future requests should be fulfilled or denied.
- various aspects of the answer, the data sources used, attributes of Dave, attributes of a relationship between Dave and Alice, etc. may be used to generate a feature vector that is then labeled as a positive or negative training example (depending on whether Alice permitted or denied the request) and used to train a machine learning model.
- Alice denies permission that may be used as a negative training example (i.e., deny access).
- the machine learning model e.g., neural network, support vector machine, etc.
- unlabeled feature vectors may be generated based on attributes of the request (e.g., number of words, semantic/syntactic attributes, breadth, etc.), the requesting user, the subject user, a relationship between the requesting and subject user, etc., and applied as input across the trained machine learning model to generate output that indicates whether or not the request should be fulfilled.
- attributes of the request e.g., number of words, semantic/syntactic attributes, breadth, etc.
- different data sources may have different privacy scores.
- data sources that are available online e.g., on one or more servers forming what is often referred to as a “cloud” computing system
- users may explicitly assign privacy scores to different data sources.
- a user may elect to make her calendar less private than, say, electronic correspondence.
- some data sources may arbitrarily or by default be assigned different privacy scores, e.g., based on general notions of privacy and/or sensitivity.
- most users would likely agree that their personal electronic correspondence (e.g., emails, text messages) are more private than, say, data sources that are at least partially available to others, such as social network profiles.
- a user's browsing and/or search history would be considered by most users to be more private than say, a user's song playlist or restaurants that the user has recommended to others.
- data itself may be used to determine its privacy score.
- a son could say something like, “Hey assistant, can you order me a supreme pizza to be delivered from ⁇ store_x>. We can use mom's VISA.”
- Such highly-sensitive information may be assigned a relatively high privacy score, regardless of where it is drawn from.
- the son's request may be denied.
- a privacy threshold may be determined in various ways.
- the privacy threshold may be determined based on a measure of specificity or granularity associated with a user's request, e.g., as a sliding scale. In other words, the breadth of the user's request may be used to determine how strictly it should be scrutinized for privacy concerns. This may reduce the likelihood of the requestor being able to infer specific pieces of information about the other user from general answers.
- a request that seeks highly specific information may be subject to relatively strict scrutiny.
- the privacy threshold may be set relatively low, and therefore, may be more easily matched and/or exceeded (in which case the request would be denied).
- a request seeking coarser, less specific information e.g., “Is Cynthia available for Dinner tomorrow or Wednesday?”
- the privacy threshold may be set relatively high, and therefore, may be more difficult to violate.
- a requests' breadth may be determined based on signals other than time slots or locations associated with users. For example, a general or broad request such as “Does George like historical fiction?” may be subjected to less scrutiny (e.g., an aggregate privacy score associated with the response may be compared to a relatively high privacy threshold) than, say, a highly specific request such as “Does George already own an electronic copy of ‘Gone with the Wind’?” As another example, a request such as “Does Antoine like seafood?” may be subjected to less scrutiny than, say, a highly-specific request such as “When has Antoine most recently eaten at ⁇ seafood_restaurant>?”
- relatively innocuous information divulged to a requesting user about a particular user may be selectively obscured from the particular user.
- the subject user may be required to provide some sort of input first before being informed about the requesting user's request and/or the information divulged. This may be beneficial, for instance, for users to be able to buy presents for other users.
- Jack asks an automated assistant “Does Mary like peonies?” It would be unfortunate if Mary were immediately informed that Jack had asked this question because she would not be surprised when Jack presented her with peonies.
- Mary may only be pushed output (e.g., a card on her home screen) informing her that someone asked about her tastes, may have purchased her a present, etc.
- the output might not specify the request or the responsive information unless Mary takes some affirmative action, such as clicking on the output.
- this feature may only be available for users who are deemed highly trustworthy. For example, if a husband asks his wife's assistant for restaurant recommendations for their anniversary, the wife's automated assistant (or in some cases, an instance of an automated assistant presented as serving the wife) may search one or more data sources (e.g., receipt history of the wife, past electronic correspondence of the wife, calendar entries of the wife, etc.) and formulate an answer as described herein.
- a privacy threshold for this request may be determined to be relatively high, because the wife likely has a high level of trust for the husband. Consequently, even if the formulated answer is drawn from multiple, high-sensitivity data sources associated with the wife, the privacy threshold may not be met, and the husband might be provided with one or more restaurant recommendations.
- the wife may only be presented with vague output indicative of the husband's request.
- the output may not identify the husband or the nature of the request, with the goal of allowing the wife to preserve the surprise.
- a different user such as the wife's co-worker, requested similar information (restaurant recommendations for the wife), they may or may not have been provided with responsive information, and the wife may have been pushed more detailed information about the request.
- Formulating responses to relatively open-ended and/or broad requests enables automated assistants to “hide” individual data points in relatively broad answers, preserving a user's privacy in specific data points. For instance, in the example above, Alice's electronic correspondence may reveal relatively specific data points, such that she has dinner Sunday night at Restaurant A at 7:30 PM and dinner Monday night at Restaurant B at 7:00 PM. However, the ultimate formulated response of “Alice is available for Dinner on Tuesday” provides a satisfactory answer to Dave without divulging more information about Alice's personal life than necessary.
- users are able to determine information about other users without actually establishing communications (e.g., telephone calls, electronic correspondence) with the other users, or without having to repeatedly attempt to establish communications with the other users. This may conserve network resources and/or time that might otherwise be spent by users repeatedly trying to connect with one another.
- communications e.g., telephone calls, electronic correspondence
- a method performed by one or more processors includes: receiving a free-form natural language text segment from a first user via a client device operated by the first user, wherein the free-form natural language text segment comprises a request pertaining to a second user; identifying at least first and second data sources that are accessible by an automated assistant to retrieve data associated with the second user, wherein the first and second data sources include sufficient data to respond to the request; determining a first privacy score associated with the first data source and a second privacy score associated with the second data source; determining an aggregate privacy score associated with responding to the request based on the first privacy score and the second privacy score; and causing the client device operated by the first user to respond to the request in response to a determination that the aggregate privacy score associated responding to the request satisfies a privacy criterion established for the second user with respect to the first user.
- the request may be a request for information and causing the client device to respond to the request for information may comprise causing the client device to output a natural language response to the request for information.
- the request may be a request to control one or more devices, and causing the device to respond to the request may comprise transmitting instructions to the one or more devices.
- the method may further include obtaining a first data point from the first data source and a second data point from the second data source; and formulating the natural language response based on the first data point and the second data point.
- the first data source may include a calendar database or a location service.
- the first data source may include a corpus of communications sent or received by the second user.
- the corpus of communications may be stored locally on a second client device operated by the second user.
- determining the first privacy score associated with the first data source may include determining that the first data source is local to a second client computing device operated by the second user.

These trained machine learning models may also be stored in one or more databases and may be trained to identify intents, e.g., by embedding data indicative of a user's utterance and/or any detected user-provided other (e.g., visual) cues into a reduced dimensionality space, and then determining which other embeddings (and therefore, intents) are most proximate, e.g., using techniques such as Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc.
- some grammars have slots (e.g., ⁇ artist>) that can be filled with slot values (or “parameters”). Slot values may be determined in various ways. Often users will provide the slot values proactively. For example, for a grammar “Order me a ⁇ topping> pizza,” a user may likely speak the phrase “order me a sausage pizza,” in which case the slot ⁇ topping> is filled automatically. Additionally or alternatively, if a user invokes a grammar that includes slots to be filled with slot values, without the user proactively providing the slot values, automated assistant 120 may solicit those slot values from the user (e.g., “what type of crust do you want on your pizza?”).
- slots may be filled with slot values based on other cues detected by misc. cues modules 112 . For example, a user could utter something like “Order me this many cat bowls” while holding up three fingers to a visual sensor (not depicted) of client device 106 . Or, a user could utter something like “Find me more movies like this” while holding of a DVD case for a particular movie.

- a user may invoke automated assistant 120 and provide a command such as “I'd like to turn the heating on.”
- Intent matcher 135 may map this command to a grammar that triggers automated assistant 120 to engage with the third party service, thereby to cause the user's heating to be switched on.
- the third party service may provide automated assistant 120 with a minimum list of slots that need to be filled in order to fulfill (or “resolve”) a command to turn the heating on.
- the slots may include the temperature to which the heating is to be set, and a duration for which the heating is to be on.
- Automated assistant 120 may generate and provide to the user (via client device 106 ) natural language output that solicits parameters for the slots.
- Fulfillment module 124 may be configured to receive the predicted/estimated intent that is output by intent matcher 135 , as well as an associated slot values (whether provided by the user proactively or solicited from the user) and fulfill (or “resolve”) the intent.
- fulfillment (or “resolution”) of the user's intent may cause various fulfillment information (also referred to as “responsive” information or “resolution information”) to be generated/obtained, e.g., by fulfillment module 124 .
- the fulfillment information may in some implementations be provided to a natural language generator (“NLG” in some Figs.) 126 , which may generate natural language output based on the fulfillment information.
- NVG natural language generator
- Fulfillment (or “resolution”) information may take various forms because an intent can be fulfilled (or “resolved”) in a variety of ways.
- a user requests pure information, such as “Where were the outdoor shots of ‘The Shining’ filmed?”
- the intent of the user may be determined, e.g., by intent matcher 135 , as being a search query.
- the intent and content of the search query may be provided to fulfillment module 124 , which may be in communication with one or more search modules (not depicted) configured to search corpuses of documents and/or other data sources (e.g., knowledge graphs, etc.) for responsive information.
- Fulfillment module 124 may provide data indicative of the search query (e.g., the text of the query, a reduced dimensionality embedding, etc.) to a search module (not depicted).
- the search module may provide responsive information, such as GPS coordinates, or other more explicit information, such as “Timberline Lodge, Mt. Hood, Oreg.” This responsive information may form part of the fulfillment information generated by fulfillment module 124 .
- fulfillment module 124 may be configured to receive, e.g., from natural language understanding module 135 , a user's intent and any slot values provided by the user or determined using other means (e.g., GPS coordinates of the user, user preferences, etc.) and trigger a responsive action. Responsive actions may include, for instance, ordering a good/service, starting a timer, setting a reminder, initiating a phone call, playing media, sending a message, etc. In some such implementations, fulfillment information may include slot values associated with the fulfillment, confirmation responses (which may be selected from predetermined responses in some cases), etc.
- Natural language generator 126 may be configured to generate and/or select natural language output (e.g., words/phrases that are designed to mimic human speech) based on data obtained from various sources.
- natural language generator 126 may be configured to receive, as input, fulfillment information associated with fulfillment of an intent, and to generate natural language output based on the fulfillment information. Additionally or alternatively, natural language generator 126 may receive information from other sources, such as third party applications (e.g., required slots), which it may use to compose natural language output for the user.
- third party applications e.g., required slots
- a single data source may not have sufficient data to accurately respond to a request pertaining to a user.
- user 140 A may not have a habit of keeping after-work plans in his online calendar 142 .
- automated assistant 120 might incorrectly inform user 140 B that user 140 A is available on a particular night, when in fact user 140 A has plans that simply did not end up in his calendar.
- users ask automated assistant 120 for information about other users those requests are often broad and/or open-ended, and therefore may not be resolvable using a single data source.
- fulfillment module 124 may generate fulfillment information, and/or natural language generator 126 may formulate natural language output, based on multiple data points retrieved from multiple different data sources, such as two or more of 142 - 150 . That way it does not matter that online calendar 142 does not store sufficient information about the evening plans of user 140 A to inform another user, such as user 140 B, of whether user 140 A is available to meet after work sometime soon. User 140 A may exchange email or other electronic correspondence ( 144 ), and/or may update his status or communicate with others over social media ( 146 ), about his evening plans. By consulting with these additional data sources, in addition to or instead of online calendar 142 , automated assistant 120 may be able to respond more effectively/accurately to a request from another user about the evening plans of user 140 A.
- automated assistant 120 may formulate a natural language response based on the multiple data from the multiple data sources, and this natural language response may be associated with an aggregate privacy score.
- a determination may be made of whether the aggregate data score satisfies some criterion, such as not exceeding a privacy threshold. If the criterion is satisfied (e.g., the aggregate privacy score does not exceed the privacy threshold), the formulated natural language response may be output by the automated assistant to the requesting user. Otherwise the request may be denied.
- Some data sources may store data that is deemed by users to be more sensitive and/or private than others. Accordingly, various techniques described herein are usable to aggregate individual privacy scores associated with these data sources and/or data obtained from these data sources, and to determine whether (or how specifically) to respond to the request based on the aggregate privacy score. For example, data sources that are available online, e.g., on a “cloud” computing system, may have lower privacy scores than, say, data sources that are only available locally on one or more client devices operated by a user. As another example, users may explicitly assign privacy scores to different data sources. For example, a user may elect to make her data from online calendar 142 less private than, say, emails from email data source 144 .
- some data sources may arbitrarily or by default be assigned different privacy scores, e.g., based on general notions of privacy and/or sensitivity. For example, most users would likely agree that their personal electronic correspondence (e.g., emails, text messages) stored in 144 are more private than, say, data sources that are at least partially available to others, such as social network profiles available from 146 . As another example, a user's browsing and/or search history would be considered by most users to be more private than say, a user's song playlist or restaurants that the user has recommended to others

For example, if the aggregate privacy score satisfies a threshold or digital component selection threshold, then the digital component selector 160 , using the policy, can determine to select a digital component for rendering by the client device 106 . In some cases, if the aggregate privacy score does not satisfy the threshold or the digital component selection threshold, then the digital component selector 160 , using the policy, can determine to block execution of the digital component real-time selection process.
- the first automated assistant 120 A may not have access to the information from the first and second data sources.
- Performing a real-time digital selection process without the information from the first and second data sources may result in inaccurate results, less relevant results, erroneous results, or low performance (e.g., low interaction rate with the digital component object), which may result in wasted computing resources such as processor utilization, network bandwidth utilization, or memory utilization because the real-time digital component selection process may result in the selection and presentation of a digital component that is not utilized.
- the computing resource reduction policy can determine to block or not to perform a real-time digital component selection process if the aggregate privacy score is less than a threshold that prevents access to information from or based on the data sources.
- the digital component selector 160 can identify a computing resource reduction policy.
- the digital component selector 160 can determine, via the computing resource reduction policy, to block execution of a real-time digital component selection process based on the aggregate privacy score. However, the digital component selector 106 can then detect an indication of a change in the aggregate privacy score to a second aggregate privacy score (e.g., based on different data sources or different parameters).
- the digital component selector 160 can determine, via the computing resource reduction policy, to initiate execution of a real-time digital component selection process based on the second aggregate privacy score.
- the digital component selector 160 can provide, to the client device 106 , a digital component selected via the real-time digital component selection process.
- FIGS. 2 A and 2 B demonstrate one example of how a human-to-computer dialog session between user 101 and an instance of automated assistant ( 120 A or B in FIG. 1 , not depicted in FIG. 2 ) may occur, via the microphone(s) and speaker(s) of a client computing device 206 (depicted as a standalone interactive speaker but this is not meant to be limiting) according to implementations described herein.
- automated assistant 120 may be implemented on the computing device 206 and/or on one or more computing devices that are in network communication with the computing device 206 .
- user 101 (“Dave”) provides natural language input of “Hey Sarah's assistant, is Sarah available for lunch this week?” in a human-to-computer dialog session between the user 101 and automated assistant 120 .
- automated assistant 120 may transition into a mode in which it attempts to mimic Sarah's experience when she engages with automated assistant 120 .
- automated assistant 120 may activate the same voice synthesizer as is used by Sarah when she engages with automated assistant 120 . Assuming Sarah prefers a different voice synthesizer for her interactions with automated assistant 120 than Dave, using Sarah's preferred synthesizer when providing natural language output to Dave will provide Dave an experience akin to speaking with Sarah's assistant, rather than with his own.
- FIG. 2 B depicts examples of multiple data sources that may be consulted to determine Sarah's availability lunch.
- these data sources include Sarah's electronic calendar 252 (which may be stored, for instance, in 142 ), an email message exchange thread 254 between Sarah and another user named Mavis (obtained from 144 ), and Sarah's current or last-known location 256 (which in some implementations may be acquired from position coordinate service 150 ). Additional or alternative data sources may be considered for any given scenario.
- Sarah may have a relatively lenient or permissive privacy criterion set for Dave. For instance, Sarah may have selected a relatively high privacy threshold for Dave of, for instance, nine of ten. In some implementations this privacy threshold may be stored in ACL 136 , e.g., in association with Sarah's user profile. Suppose further that Sarah has set, for her online calendar 252 , a privacy score of two, and that Sarah has set, for her message exchange 254 and current location 256 , privacy scores of three each. These privacy scores may indicate that Sarah considers her emails and current location to be more sensitive than her online calendar. In some implementations, Sarah may set these scores manually.
- these scores may be set in other ways, such as by default. Moreover, these scores may vary depending on users and/or the context from which the information is gathered. For example, suppose that message exchange thread 254 was drawn from Sarah's social media page, rather than from her private emails. In such a scenario, a privacy score for social media messages may, in some cases, be lower than email, such as two or even lower (especially if the message exchange occurred on a publicly-viewable portion of Sarah's social media profile).
- automated assistant 120 may formulate an appropriate natural language response.
- automated assistant 120 may compare an aggregate privacy score—e.g., a sum of the first, second, and third privacy scores mentioned above—to Sarah's privacy threshold for Dave.
- the aggregate score is eight (2+3+3) and the threshold is nine. Accordingly, and referring back to FIG. 2 A , automated assistant 120 responds, “Let me check . . .
- Sarah appears to be available for lunch on Wednesday and Friday.” However, if Dave and Sarah were not as close, and Sarah had a lower privacy threshold set for Dave, then the aggregate privacy score (eight) might meet or exceed the threshold, in which case automated assistant 120 might reply, “I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.” In some implementations, Sarah also may or may not be notified of Dave's request and/or resulting response.
- Privacy thresholds for particular users or groups of users need not be static, nor are they required to always be the same for a particular user.
- privacy thresholds may be dynamic, e.g., generated or calculated on the fly. This is particularly beneficial because users are not required to manually set permissions for all other users. Rather, privacy thresholds can be determined automatically, based on a variety of signals and using a variety of techniques.
- a privacy threshold for a requesting user may be determined at the time of the requesting user's request, e.g., using one or more trained machine learning models.
- various attributes of the requesting user and/or their request, their context, the subject user's context, the data sources required to fulfill the request, etc. may be used to assemble a feature vector associated with the request (or the user).
- This feature vector may then be embedded into a latent space (also referred to as a “reduced dimensionality embedding”) that also includes embeddings of other requests (or users). Euclidian distance(s) between the various embeddings may be determined.
- privacy thresholds associated with the “closest” other requests in the latent space may be used to determine the privacy threshold for the current request (or for the requesting user), e.g., as an average or median of those scores.
- a history of requests from a particular user may be considered when determining a privacy threshold for the user and/or their request.
- a malicious user could string together a multitude of individual requests, each by itself being relatively innocuous, but the information provided in response to all the requests collectively could be more revealing than a subject user may desire.
- a malicious user could ask, “Is John on vacation on May 1 st ? Is John on vacation May 2 nd ?,” etc., to ascertain a general idea of John's comprehensive schedule, which John may not wish to disclose.
- a requesting user's privacy threshold may decrease (i.e., become more easily violated) the more questions they ask, especially in a particular time period (e.g., within a few minutes, an hour, a day, etc.).
- a requesting user's privacy threshold may be determined based on a breadth of their request, i.e., a measure of specificity or granularity associated with the request. Put another way, the breadth of the requesting user's request may be used to determine how strictly it should be scrutinized for privacy concerns. This may reduce the likelihood of the requesting user being able to infer specific pieces of information about the other user from general answers.
- a request that seeks highly specific information may be subject to relatively strict scrutiny.
- the privacy threshold may be set relatively low, and therefore, may be more easily matched and/or exceeded (in which case the request would be denied).
- a request seeking coarser, less specific information e.g., “Is Findlay available for Dinner tomorrow or Wednesday?”
- the privacy threshold may be set relatively high, and therefore, may be more difficult to violate.
- a general or broad request such as “Does George like historical fiction?” may be subjected to less scrutiny (e.g., an aggregate privacy score associated with the response may be compared to a relatively high privacy threshold) than, say, a highly specific request such as “Does George already own an electronic copy of ‘Gone with the Wind’?”
- a relatively broad request such as “Does Antoine like seafood?” may be subjected to less scrutiny than, say, a highly-specific request such as “How often does Antoine eat seafood?”
- a request's breadth may be determined based at least in part on the resulting fulfillment information (which, recall, may be used to generate natural language output). For example, the number of distinct data sources required to fulfill the request may be considered, e.g., with the greater number of data sources required being associated with a greater breadth than, say, a relatively low number of data sources. Intuitively, the more data sources drawn from to generate fulfillment information, the more difficult it is to infer a particular piece of data being from a particular source.
- a request's breadth may be determined based on aspects of the request itself. For example, in some implementations, the number of terms in the request may be considered, e.g., with less terms being indicative of greater breadth, and vice versa. As another example, the number of times a request is encountered, e.g., across a population of users, may be considered. In some such implementations, the more frequently the same request or semantically/syntactically similar requests are encountered, the greater the request's breadth, and vice versa.
- FIG. 3 sets up an alternative to the scenario depicted in FIGS. 2 A- 2 B .
- a response is formulated from a single data source—Sarah's online calendar 252 .
- Sarah has created calendar entries that indicate lunch conflicts Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. While it is still possible to determine that Sarah is available for lunch on Wednesday and Friday from online calendar 252 , this determination is now made from a single data source. Consequently, in some implementations, Dave's request may be considered relatively narrow, and the privacy threshold vis-à-vis Dave and his request may therefore be set relatively low, e.g., much lower than the scenario depicted in FIG. 2 B .
- FIG. 4 depicts another dialog between the user Dave 101 and his automated assistant 120 operating on a computing device 406 A during a different session.
- Dave provides the free-form natural language input request, “Hey Sarah's assistant, does Sarah like Science Fiction?”
- automated assistant 120 consults four different data sources to determine that Sarah does like science fiction, and to formulate the response, “Yes, Sarah appears to enjoy science fiction.”
- Two of the data sources are cloud-based, and include an online media profile 480 and the aforementioned social media 146 .
- Online media profile 480 may contain information about books, movies, podcasts, etc. that have been or are to be recommended to Sarah based on various signals, such as her shopping history, search history, media consumption history, etc.
- Social media 146 may include, for instance, comments made by Sarah on her status page or to other social media users that are useful for gauging her interest in science fiction (e.g., “I loved the original ‘Alien’ movie, and the first sequel.”). It could also include, for instance, comments made by Sarah on various message threads, such as comments at the end of articles, etc.
- Two additional data sources in FIG. 4 are available locally on a client device 406 B operated by Sarah. These include a search/browsing history 482 and locally-stored media 484 . For example, Sarah's searching and/or browsing history may reveal a likely interest by Sarah in science fiction. Additionally, if media stored locally on Sarah's client device 406 B includes substantial science fiction content (e.g., determined from metadata), that may also indicate an interest by Sarah in science fiction.
- data sources that are only available locally on client devices, such as 482 - 484 in FIG. 4 may be deemed more private and/or sensitive than other data sources available, for instance, on the cloud (e.g., 480 , 146 ). Consequently, these local data sources may have higher privacy scores associated with them than other online sources.
- data is drawn from all four data sources to determine that Sarah likes science fiction, as indicated by the arrows.
- drawing data from such a large number of data sources results in the request being interpreted as having relatively large breadth. This in turn may result in a relatively high privacy threshold (difficult to violate) being established, at least for this particular request from Dave. But that isn't to say Dave always will be according such a high privacy threshold when requesting information about Sarah.
- automated assistant 120 is able to determine, from a single data source, that Sarah has read that book.
- the single data source is locally stored media 484 of Sarah's client device 406 B, where Sarah might have an electronic copy of the book stored (and in some cases it may be labeled with metadata indicating that Sarah has read it).
- the other data sources depicted in FIG. 5 did't provide any help in answering Dave's request. Accordingly, even though an answer to Dave's request was ascertained, in FIG.
- automated assistant 120 tells Dave that it cannot provide that information. This may be because, for instance, Dave's request was interpreted as having narrow breadth, e.g., due to it being answered based on data obtained from a single data source ( 484 ).
- Sarah may or may not be notified of Dave's request and/or whether the request was fulfilled.
- Dave may be looking for a birthday for present for Sarah.
- Notifying Sarah of Dave's request about “Rendezvous with Rama” may clue Sarah in to the fact that Dave is shopping for her birthday present, and that he's likely to get her a science fiction book.
- Sarah may receive no notification, or may receive a push notification (e.g., a pop up card on her lock screen) that indicates Dave made a request about her, but that doesn't inform her about the specific request. That way Sarah can avoid reading Dave's specific request, e.g., so that she can still be surprised by his present.
- a push notification e.g., a pop up card on her lock screen
- automated assistant 120 may determine, e.g., from Sarah's calendar, that Sarah's birthday (or another present-giving occasion) is going to occur soon. Based on that determination, automated assistant 120 may determine that Dave's request likely relates to purchase of a birthday present for Sarah, and thereby might take various steps to avoid spoiling Sarah's surprise, such as by not notifying Sarah of the request, obscuring the request, leaving the notification of the request vague or ambiguous, etc.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example method 600 according to implementations disclosed herein. For convenience, the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems, such as one or more components of automated assistant 120 . Moreover, while operations of method 600 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added.
- the system may receive a free-form natural language text segment from a first user (e.g., 140 A) via a client device (e.g., 106 1 ) operated by the first user.
- the free-form natural language text segment may include a request for information pertaining to a second user (e.g., 140 B).
- the requested information may be information that can be formulated based on data created by and/or wholly or partially under the control of the second user.
- the request may be received as speech that is then converted to text (e.g., by module 117 ) and/or as typed textual input.
- the request may be submitted by a first user (caller) who is attempting to make a telephone call (e.g., using cellular, VOIP, etc.) to a second user. If the second user is not available to take a call, the first user may be connected to an automated assistant that may or may not operate at least in part on the first user's smart phone or the second user's smart phone.
- a first user caller
- VOIP Voice over IP
- the first user may be connected to an automated assistant that may or may not operate at least in part on the first user's smart phone or the second user's smart phone.
- the request may be targeted by the first user to the second user's automated assistant.
- each user may not actually have a distinct automated assistant that serves them. Rather, each user may have an automated assistant client 118 that interfaces with cloud-based automated assistant components 119 to provide the user with an experience akin to having their own personalized virtual assistant.
- each user may select attributes of their automated assistant, such as a voice synthesizer to be employed by their automated assistant.
- a voice synthesizer selected by the second user when they engage with automated assistant 120 may be used to communicate with the first user, thereby giving the illusion to the first user of speaking with the second user's automated assistant.
- a requesting user may ask their own assistant to ask someone else's assistant for information (e.g., “Hey assistant, will you ask Sarah's assistant if she likes science fiction?”).
- a user may engage with another user's assistant by calling the other user's telephone (or, more generally, attempting to establish some sort of voice communication session with the other user) while the other user is busy, on another call, etc.
- the calling user may be presented with an automated assistant interface that mimics the other user's automated assistant, at which point the calling user can make requests. And requests are not limited to voice-based requests.
- a user may engage with another user's automated assistant using other input/output modalities, such as visual (e.g., using message exchange application 107 ).
- the system may identify at least first and second data sources that are accessible by automated assistant 120 to retrieve data associated with the second user.
- the first and second data sources (and any number of additional resources as necessary) may collectively include sufficient data to generate responsive fulfillment information and/or formulate a natural language response to the request for information, whereas neither of the sources might have had sufficient data alone.
- the system may determine a first privacy score associated with the first data source and a second privacy score associated with the second data source.
- the system may determine an aggregate privacy score associated with responding to the request for information. In some implementations, this aggregate score may be based on the first privacy score and the second privacy score, e.g., a sum of the two scores.
- fulfillment module 124 may attach the aggregate privacy score to the fulfillment information.
- privacy scores associated with data sources may be selected by the user, set by default, learned over time (e.g., using machine learning models), and so forth. Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, privacy scores for each data source may be weighted, e.g., based on a number of individual data points drawn from that particular data source relative to other data sources. For example, if a user's online calendar is used to determine that they are unavailable for dinner on three days, and the user's emails are used to determine that the user is unavailable on a fourth day, the user's online calendar may be weighted more or less heavily than the user's email.
- the system may determine whether that aggregate privacy score determined at block 608 satisfies a privacy criterion.
- the privacy criterion may take the form of a privacy threshold.
- a privacy threshold may be set for particular users (e.g., Sarah sets a privacy threshold for any request from Dave) or requests, and/or may be determined dynamically, e.g., based on a breadth of the request, a number of data sources required to fulfill the request, etc.
- satisfying the privacy criterion means not meeting or exceeding the privacy threshold.
- the system may cause the natural language response to be formulated and/or output at the client device operated by the first user.
- the natural language response may be output in various ways, such as audibly, visually (e.g., by message exchange client 107 ), and so forth.
- the user about which the request was made may also be notified of the request and/or its fulfillment.
- the system may cause the client device to output other natural language output denying the request received at block 602 . Similar to block 612 , in some implementations, the user about which the rejected request was made be notified of the request and/or its denial. And as noted above, in some implementations, the subject user may or may not be notified of the request and/or its fulfillment or denial, depending on whether it would be desirable to maintain some level of surprise for the subject user.
- Requests as described herein are not necessarily limited to requests for information.
- a first user may request that an automated assistant engage with a resource that is controlled by a second user.
- the automated assistant may only be permitted to engage with that resource if it determines, e.g., using techniques described herein, that the first user should be granted such permission.
- a child may ask an automated assistant to purchase something from an online marketplace.
- the automated assistant may determine an aggregate privacy score associated by the request based on a variety of different factors, such as the trustworthiness of the online market place, a privacy score associated with a data source (e.g., mom's credit card), and so forth.
- a data source e.g., mom's credit card
- This aggregate privacy score may be compared to a privacy threshold established for the child with regard to, for instance, the child's mother or father.
- Other responsive actions that may be authenticated using techniques described herein include but are not limited to operating home appliances (e.g., should a guest be permitted to adjust the thermostat?), changing lighting scenery, locking/unlocking doors, etc.
- FIG. 7 depicts a flowchart illustrating an example method of assembling responses from automated assistants according to implementations disclosed herein.
- the method 700 can be performed by one or more component or system depicted in FIG. 1 , 4 , 5 or 8 , including, for example, cloud-based automated assistant components 119 , a first automated assistant 120 A, a second automated assistant 120 B, a client device 106 1 a client device 106 N , or a user-controlled resources engine 134 .
- the method 700 can be performed by one or more computing devices 710 (which can be referred to as server computing devices).
- a first automated assistant executed by one or more server computing devices receives a text segment via a client device associated with a first electronic account.
- the text segment can include a request for information from a second electronic account associated with a plurality of data sources.
- the request can be received as an input audio signal.
- the request can be received via one or more data packets over a network.
- the request can be detected by a microphone or sensor of a client computing device.
- the request can be a voice-based request.
- the request can be received via a graphical user interface presented by the client device.
- the request can include a query or command.
- the one or more server computing devices can determine whether a second assistant is available.
- the second assistant can refer to an automated assistant.
- the second assistant can be associated with the second electronic account that corresponds to a plurality of data sources containing information that is requested by the input text segment received by the first automated assistant.
- the one or more server computing devices can determine whether a second automated assistant is configured, operational or otherwise operational for the second electronic account.
- the one or more server computing devices (or first automated assistant) can transmit a query or a ping to the second electronic account to determine whether a second automated assistant for the second electronic account is operational.
- the first automated assistant can determine that a second assistant is not configured for the second electronic account, and then terminate the process at 706 .
- the one or more servers can generate a prompt indicating that the requested information from the data sources is not accessible or available, and provide the prompt to the first automated assistant for presentation via the first client device.
- the first automated assistant can transmit the request for the information from the second electronic account to the second assistant configured for the second electronic account at 708 .
- the second automated assistant can select one or more data sources responsive to the request for information received from the first automated assistant.
- the one or more data sources can include, for example, online calendar information, email information, social media information, cloud storage information, or location information.
- the one or more servers can determine an aggregate privacy score 712 .
- the aggregate privacy score can be based on an individual privacy score for each of the data sources selected at 710 .
- the one or more servers can generate the aggregate privacy score by combining the individual privacy scores.
- the one or more servers can determine whether the aggregate privacy score satisfies a criterion at 714 . Satisfying a criterion can refer to or include satisfying a threshold. If the one or more servers determines that the aggregate privacy score does not satisfy the criterion, then the one or more servers can proceed to determine whether there are multiple data sources at 716 .
- the multiple data sources can refer to the data sources selected at 710 . If the one or more servers selected multiple data sources at 710 , then at 716 the one or more servers can determine that there are multiple data sources that are contributing to the aggregate privacy score determined at 712 which are determined to not satisfy the criterion at 714 .
- the one or more servers can remove a data source at 720 .
- the one or more servers can remove a data source based on the individual privacy score of the data source. For example, the one or more servers can rank the data sources based on the individual privacy scores of the data sources in order to identify a highest ranking data source or lowest ranking data source.
- the one or more servers can remove one of the highest ranking or lowest ranking data sources in order to facilitate the aggregate privacy score satisfying the criterion at 714 . For example, if satisfying the criterion at 714 is based on the aggregate privacy score being greater than or equal to a threshold, then the one or more servers can remove a lowest ranking privacy score at 720 .
- the one or more servers can remove a highest ranking data source at 720 .
- the one or more servers at determine the aggregate privacy score again at 712 , but without the data source that was removed.
- the one or more severs can proceed to generate and provide a response based on the data sources at 722 . If the one or more servers determines that the aggregate privacy score satisfies the criterion, the one or more severs can proceed to determine whether to initiate a real-time selection process at 724 .
- the real-time selection process can refer to or include a real-time digital component selection process performed by a digital component selector. The one or more servers can determine whether to initiate a real-time selection process based on satisfying the criterion at 714 , satisfying a different criterion, a policy, or a computing resource reduction policy.
- the one or more servers can determine whether to initiate a real-time selection process based on satisfying the criterion at 714 . If the criterion is satisfied at 714 , then the one or more servers can proceed with initiate the real-time selection process at 728 .
- the one or more servers can determine whether to initiate the real-time selection process based on satisfying a different criterion.
- the different criterion can refer to or include a different threshold with which the aggregate privacy score is compared.
- the one or more servers may require satisfaction of a higher threshold in order to initiate the real-time selection process as compared to the threshold used to generate the response at 722 .
- Using a higher threshold can reduce excess resource consumption and can result in more reliable, relevant, or higher performing digital components.
- the one or more servers can use a policy, such as a computing resource reduction policy, to determine whether to initiate real-time selection.
- the policy can refer to or include comparison of the aggregate score with a threshold or criterion, or other policy.
- the one or more servers can determine whether to initiate real-time selection based on the type of data sources. If one of the types of data sources are “email” or “cloud storage”, then the policy may indicate to block real-time data selection. If the types of data sources are calendar and location, then the policy may allow real-time content selection.
- the computing resource reduction policy can take additional factors into account, such as a type of client device that is requesting the information, available interfaces, remaining battery power, or type of network. For example, if the first client device is low on battery power (e.g., less than 20%) and uses a small, handheld display to provide the digital component, then the one or more servers can determine to block the real-time content selection process. If the first client device is stand-alone speaker that does not include a display and is connected to a power outlet, then the computing resource reduction policy may allow for real-time content selection and provision of a selected digital component.
- the one or more servers determines to not initiate real-time selection at 724 , the one or more servers can proceed to block execution of the real-time selection process at 726 . If, however, the one or more servers determines to proceed with the real-time digital component selection at 724 , then the one or more servers can proceed to execute the real-time digital component selection process and provide the digital component at 728 .
- the one or more servers can provide the selected digital component along with the response generated at 722 .
- the one or more servers can combine the selected digital component with the generated response to provide a single data object that includes both the response and selected digital component, thereby reducing a number of transmissions to the first client device.
- the one or more servers can assemble the response with the selected digital component. For example, if the output is an audio output, then the one or more servers can overlay the selected digital component with the response, append the selected digital component to the response, present the selected digital component before the response, or identify a location within the response to insert the selected digital component.
- the one or more servers can assemble an output that can include both the selected digital component and the generated response to cause the first client device to output (e.g., via audio output via a speaker or a display output) the present the combined selected digital component and the generated response.

- Computing device 810 can be of varying types including a workstation, server, computing cluster, blade server, server farm, or any other data processing system or computing device. Due to the ever-changing nature of computers and networks, the description of computing device 810 depicted in FIG. 8 is intended only as a specific example for purposes of illustrating some implementations. Many other configurations of computing device 810 are possible having more or fewer components than the computing device depicted in FIG. 8 .
- users are provided with one or more opportunities to control whether information is collected, whether the personal information is stored, whether the personal information is used, and how the information is collected about the user, stored and used. That is, the systems and methods discussed herein collect, store and/or use user personal information only upon receiving explicit authorization from the relevant users to do so.
- a user is provided with control over whether programs or features collect user information about that particular user or other users relevant to the program or feature.
- Each user for which personal information is to be collected is presented with one or more options to allow control over the information collection relevant to that user, to provide permission or authorization as to whether the information is collected and as to which portions of the information are to be collected.
- users can be provided with one or more such control options over a communication network.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined.
- a user's geographic location may be generalized to a larger region so that the user's particular location cannot be determined.
