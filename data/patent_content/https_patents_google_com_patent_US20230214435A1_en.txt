- a web browser can be used to display content that is searched via a search engine. Content can be displayed within the web browser in response to selection of one or more of the search results by a user.
- Implementations relate to providing persistent search results within a browser.
- implementations relate to rendering a search result area concurrently with a display area (a main content window).
- the search result area displays at least two search results, where a search result represents a resource that is responsive to a query.
- the display area displays the content associated with a webpage (resource) that corresponds to one of the two search results.
- the search results may be represented in the search result area by search result indicators, which are actionable user interface elements.
- Each search result indicator is associated with a resource determined to be responsive to the query. This resource is referred to as the search result target.
- Interaction with a search result indicator causes the browser to display the resource associated with the search result (the search result target) in the display area without closing the search result area.
- the search result area represents search results for a portion of a search result page (i.e., selected search results from the search result page).
- Rendering of the search result area can be triggered by selection of a search result in a search result page.
- Rendering of the search result area can be triggered by interaction with a webpage displayed in response to selection of a search result in a search result page.
- the interaction can include selecting a “back” action when viewing a target of a search result.
- the interaction can include a scrolling pattern detected during display of the target of a search result.
- a method can include receiving a search query and causing display of a first search result and a second search result within a display area of a browser in response to the search query.
- the method can include causing display of a webpage identified by the first search result within the display area of the browser, and causing display of a first search result indicator corresponding with the first search result and a second search result indicator corresponding with the second search result in a search result area outside of the display area, where the search result area is within the browser.
- a method can include receiving a search query and causing display of a first search result and a second search result within a display area of a browser in response to the search query.
- the method can include causing display of a webpage identified by the first search result within the display area of the browser, and in response to receiving an interaction with the display of the webpage, causing display of a first search result indicator corresponding with the first search result and a second search result indicator corresponding with the second search result in a search result area outside of the display area, where the search result area is still within the browser.

- This disclosure is related to navigation of content associated with search results retrieved in response to a search query.
- the search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, or in a search result area of another browser, so that the content of a webpage associated with a search result is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while the search results are displayed.
- the search results are maintained (e.g., persist) while content of the resources associated with the search results are maintained.
- At least one of the search results in the search result area can be selected, and content associated with the selected search result can be displayed in the display area.
- implementations enable navigation of webpages represented by the search results with fewer user interactions.
- the content associated with the search results can replace content of the webpage within the browser.
- the content associated with the search results can be displayed within another browser.
- the search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed.
- the browser can be referred to as a browser window when associated with a window of an operating system (OS).
- OS operating system
- a technical problem associated with searches is that several interactions are needed to navigate to resources represented in the search result page.
- a search result page is generated by a search engine in response to a query.
- the search result page includes search results and can include other content, such as ads, knowledge panels, short answers, other types of rich results, links to limit the search to a particular resource type (e.g., images, travel, shopping, news, videos, etc.).
- Each search result corresponds to a resource available via a network, e.g., via a URL/URI/etc.
- the resources were determined to be responsive to the query by the search engine.
- the search result includes a link to its corresponding resource.
- the search result can include additional information, such as a title, a snippet (text obtained from the content of the resource), an image associated with the resource, etc., or other information relevant to the resource and/or the query, as determined by the search engine.
- the browser displays the search result page in the display area.
- a search result or in other words, selects the link to the resource, the link being included in the search result
- the browser requests the content of the resource associated with the link and replaces the search result page in the display area with the content of the resource.
- the user To return to the search result page to view a different resource, the user must resubmit the query or must select a browser interface control configured to return the user to the previous resource (e.g., a back control). Selection of this back control causes the browser to again render the search result page in the display area, where the user can select a different link to a different resource, which causes the browser to fetch and render the content of the different resource.
- This back-and-forth between the search result page and the resources represented in the search result page is inefficient for the computing device and the user. For example, the computing device expends resources (battery, processing power, and potentially network bandwidth for re-fetching) to re-render the search result page several times as the user navigates to the resources represented by the search results.
- the user must perform an extra interaction with the browser to accomplish the navigation because the search results are not maintained during navigation of the content.
- At least one technical solution to the technical problems described above is that search results can be maintained (persist) within a search result area of the browser while the user navigates to resources represented by the search result.
- the content of the resource is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser in a separate display area while the search results are displayed.
- the computing device on which the browser executes performs fewer renderings of the search results.
- Search results within a search result area and webpage content within a display area can be simultaneously displayed within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser).
- This technical solution has the technical effect of reducing the number of interactions a user has with the browser to navigate the different resources represented by the search results. Put another way, because search results for a query persist in the search result area, interactions with the back control of a browser are eliminated.
- a search result area can be integrated as part of the browser so that the search result area may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by a third party or the owner of the webpage content.
- This can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of a webpage or other resource. Accordingly, the technical problem of spoofing search results can be obviated by the technical solution of integrating a search result area within the browser as described above.
- the technical effect of integration of a search result area within a browser is that spoofing can be prevented.
- search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) in a search result area even as the content of resources represented by the search results are navigated to and displayed.
- the content associated with the resources represented by the search results can be displayed within the display area simultaneously within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser) with the search result area. This can be achieved even if only a limited available screen space is available by, e.g., scaling the resolution of the content to be displayed in the display area in case the size of the display area is decreased in order to display the display area and the search result area together within the browser on the limited available screen space. Accordingly, the technical problem of being unable to simultaneously navigate content associated with search results while viewing the search results in a search result area is solved by the technical solution and technical effect described above.
- the implementations described herein enable improved guided human-machine interactions for viewing webpages and other resources on the one side and displaying search results on the other side.
- the viewing of results of a query and the viewing of webpages represented by the results are done simultaneously by using one user interface only. This saves processing resources and potentially bandwidth (by avoiding additional fetching of a search result page).
- This also results in fewer interactions of the user with the user interface as the user may easily switch between different resources from the results and view the content of the resource at the same time in the same interface.
- the browsers described herein can be executed within a computing device.
- the browsers can be executed within a laptop device.
- the browsers can be executed within a mobile device. or on any other device with limited available screen space.
- any of the implementations described herein can be rendered in a landscape mode.
- implementations described herein in landscape mode can be rendered in a portrait mode.
- FIG. 1 A is a diagram that illustrates search results SR 1 through SR 3 (collectively can be referred to as search results 125 ) displayed within a display area 120 of a browser 110 .
- the display area 120 can be within a tab of the browser 110 .
- the search results 125 can be triggered for display in response to a search query.
- the display area 120 can include an indication of the query 122 .
- the indication of the query 122 includes the content (e.g., text/image) used as the query.
- the indication of the query 122 is a text entry area where the user can provide a new query and trigger a new search.
- the search results 125 can be included in a search result page.
- a search result page is a webpage generated by a search engine of a search server in response to a query and typically includes one or more search results.
- the search results e.g., SR 1 through SR 3
- the search results 125 are each associated with a respective resource, e.g., webpage, file, etc., available over a network.
- the search query, to which the search results 125 are responsive can be triggered by a user of, for example, a computing device via a text search, an image search, and/or so forth.
- a user interface for triggering the search query is not illustrated herein.
- one or more of the search results 125 can include text. In some implementations, one or more of the search results 125 can include images.
- One or more of the search results 125 include a respective link, i.e., a link to a resource available via a network such as the Internet.
- the resource is a source of content (e.g., images, webpages, documents, etc.).
- Any search result that includes a link is actionable.
- a search result with a link can be interacted with, e.g., via selection of the link.
- the interaction with a link of a search result of search results 125 causes the browser to fetch the content of the resource associated with the link. Because of this, a search result can be referred to as selectable and interaction with a search result is understood to refer to interaction with (e.g., selection of) the link associated with the search result.
- FIG. 1 B is a diagram that illustrates a search result area 130 (shown by a dashed box) triggered for display within the browser 110 .
- the search result area 130 can be triggered in response to at least one of the search results 125 being selected (e.g., interacted with).
- search result SR 1 in FIG. 1 A has been selected.
- the webpage W 1 is displayed within the display area 120 ′ in FIG. 1 B .
- the webpage W 1 is the resource associated with the link of SR 1 in this example.
- the search result area 130 is rendered within the browser 110 in FIG. 1 B . Accordingly, in response to the selection of search result SR 1 in FIG. 1 A , as illustrated in FIG. 1 B , both the webpage W 1 is displayed within the display area 120 ′ and the search result area 130 is rendered within the browser 110 . Also, in response to the selection of search result SR 1 in FIG. 1 A , as illustrated in FIG. 1 B , both the webpage W 1 is displayed within the display area 120 ′ and the search result indicator SRI′ is displayed within the search result area 130 within the browser 110 .
- rendering of the search result area 130 in FIG. 1 B is triggered in response to an interaction with (e.g., selection of) one or more of the search results 125 in FIG. 1 A .
- Rendering of the search result area 130 in FIG. 1 B can be triggered in response to an interaction with any of the search results 125 in FIG. 1 A .
- rendering of the search result area 130 in FIG. 1 B can be triggered in response to selection of the search result SR 2 in FIG. 1 A .
- an interaction can include a selection.
- an interaction and/or selection (or an indication thereof) can be used to trigger an action or result.
- a user interface element that triggers an action in response to interaction with the element is referred to as an actionable element.
- the search results 125 are examples of actionable elements.
- the search results SRI through SR 3 of FIG. 1 A can be replaced with search result indicators SRI′ through SR 3 .
- the browser can use a template or a DOM model to identify search results 125 in the search result page.
- the search result page can be a cached page or can be re-fetched from the search server.
- the search result indicators 125 ′ each correspond to a respective search result of the search results 125 .
- the search result indicators 125 ′ are also actionable elements. A search result indicator performs the same action when interacted with that its corresponding search result performs.
- selection of search result indicator SR 1 ′ causes display of webpage W 1
- selection of search result SR 1 causes display of webpage W 1
- a search result indicator occupies much less area within the browser than its corresponding search result.
- a search result indicator has a smaller footprint than the search result it corresponds to. The smaller footprint enables the browser to display the search results in the search result area 130 concurrently with the webpage W 1 in the display area 120 .
- the smaller footprint can be important for a computing device with a limited screen size, such as a mobile phone, smart watch, smart glasses, tablet, etc.
- Example search result indicators 125 ′ are discussed in more detail with respect to FIGS. 2 A- 2 C .
- the search results 125 are displayed within the search result area 130 as search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ (collectively referred to as search result indicators 125 ′).
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ correspond, respectively, with the search results SRI through SR 3 .
- the user can use the search results indicators SRI′ through SR 3 ′ to navigate to resources associated with the search results SR 1 through SR 3 .
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be, or can include, for example, links associated with search results SRI through SR 3 .
- the search results SRI through SR 3 may be a subset of search results surfaced in response to a search query.
- the search SRI through SR 3 (and search result indicators SRI′ through SR 3 ′) can be a rank-ordered (e.g., highest ranked) subset of search results surfaced in response to a search query.
- one or more of the search results SR 1 through SR 3 can be prioritized so that the most relevant search results (or a subset thereof) are rendered within the search result area 130 .
- the search result indicator SR 1 ′ may not be displayed within the search result area 130 because the webpage W 1 corresponding to the search result SR 1 is displayed. Accordingly, at least the search result associated with the resource (e.g., a webpage) already displayed in the display area 120 ′ may not be included in the search result area 130 . This enables other search result indicators to be visible in the search result area 130 , especially where a size of the screen is limited.
- the resource e.g., a webpage
- additional search results 125 accessible via scrolling (or otherwise navigating through the display area 120 ) in FIG. 1 A can correspond to additional search result indicators 125 ′ accessible via scrolling in FIG. 1 B .
- the additional search results can be viewed by scrolling left and right within the search result area 130 .
- the browser includes an address bar area 114 .
- An address of the webpage W 1 can be illustrated in the address bar area 114 (e.g., input address area 113 ).
- Other controls, icons, and/or so forth can be included in the address bar area 114 .
- the address bar area 114 can be controlled by and/or associated with the browser 110 (e.g., the browser application). Because the address bar area 114 is controlled by the browser 110 , the webpage W 1 and/or a provider of the webpage W 1 does not have access to content displayed in the address bar area 114 or triggering actions provided by actionable elements of the address bar area 114 .
- the search result area 130 is separated from the address bar area 114 by a visible separation line between the address bar area and the search result area 130 .
- the line can be eliminated (e.g., omitted), for security purposes.
- this is a line that a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W 1 ) may not remove (e.g., paint over, scrub out).
- this is a line that is controlled (e.g., provided by, eliminated by) the browser 110 (e.g., browser application), similar to the address bar area 114 .
- the size (e.g., an area) of the display area 120 (shown in FIG. 1 A ) is decreased to a size of the display area 120 ′.
- the display area 120 (shown in FIG. 1 A ) is decreased in size in response to the search result area 130 being displayed to accommodate the search result area 130 .
- the webpage W 1 can be modified (e.g., scaled) in layout to fit (e.g., fit for display) into the display area 120 ′.
- scaling of the webpage W 1 is achieved by displaying the webpage W 1 in lower resolution so that the webpage W 1 is displayed without decreasing the visible area of the webpage W 1 within the decreased display area 120 ′.
- This implementation has the technical effect that in addition to the webpage W 1 as displayed in the display area 120 ′ the search results can be displayed in the search result area 130 on a, e.g., limited available screen space.
- the search result area 130 can overlap with the webpage W 1 without modifying the scale of the webpage Wl. Put another way, a visible portion of W 1 may decrease because of the decreased visible area of the display area 120 ′ but a scale of the webpage W 1 does not change.
- the combined areas of the display area 120 ′ and the search result area 130 shown in FIG. 1 B can be the same as the area of the display area 120 as shown in FIG. 1 A .
- the combined areas of the display area 120 ′ and the search result area 130 can be different from (e.g., smaller than, larger than) the area of the display area 120 .
- FIG. 1 C illustrates content of a webpage W 2 rendered in display area 120 ′ within the browser 110 .
- the content of the webpage W 2 is rendered in the display area 120 ′ in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search result indicator SR 2 ′ in the search result area 130 of FIG. 1 B .
- the webpage W 2 displayed in the display area 120 ′ replaces the webpage W 1 displayed in the display area 120 ′.
- the combination of concurrent display of the search result area 130 and the display area 120 ′ can be used to consume (e.g., explore) the search results in the search result area 130 with minimal user interactions and reduced computing resource usage. For example, in response to a first search result indicator being selected from the search result area 130 , first content can be rendered in the display area 120 ′. In response to a second search result indicator being selected from the search result area 130 , second content can be rendered in the display area 120 ′, replacing the first content. This improved search result navigation can occur while the search results (e.g., search result indicator SR 1 ′) are maintained within the search result area 130 .
- search results e.g., search result indicator SR 1 ′
- FIG. 1 D illustrates content of a webpage W 3 rendered in a display area 120 ′ within the browser 110 .
- the content of the webpage W 3 is rendered in the display area 120 ′ in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search result indicator SR 3 ′ in the search result area 130 .
- the webpage W 3 displayed in the display area 120 ′ replaces the webpage W 2 displayed in the display area 120 ′ of FIG. 1 C .
- the positions of the search result indicators are shifted so that the search result indicator SR 3 ′ corresponding with the webpage W 3 is more centered within the search result area 130 . Also, in FIG.
- search result indicator SR 4 ′ is displayed because search result indicator SR 3 ′ has shifted position in the search result area 130 .
- This shift of position may result in SR 1 ′ not being rendered in the search result area 130 .
- the browser may scroll SR 3 ′ to a position of prominence (centered in the display), causing SR 1 ′ to scroll off the visible portion of the screen and causing SR 4 ′ to scroll onto the visible portion of the screen.
- a new resource location (web address) or search can be input into input address area 113 of the address bar area 114 after the search result area 130 and the display area 120 ′ are defined.
- a different webpage (not shown) can replace the webpage W 2 (or other content) in the display area 120 ′, while maintaining the search result indicators SR′ in the search result area 130 .
- the search result indicators SR′ can be maintained even while navigating within the display area 120 ′ and using a different web address in the address bar area 114 of the browser 110 .
- the browser in response to the input to the input address area 113 , may remove the search result area 130 , returning the display area 120 ′ to display area 120 .
- the content of the resource corresponding to the input to the input address area 113 may be displayed in the display area 120 .
- input to the input address area 113 may cause removal of the search result area 130 .
- a user interface element e.g., a back control, such as a back button, a back arrow
- remove e.g., clear, navigate away from
- content rendered in the display area 120 ′ e.g., the webpage W 2
- user interaction with a back control can trigger removal of the search result area 130 .
- removal of (e.g., clearing) the search result area 130 automatically returns the display area 120 ′ to display area 120 .
- removal of the search result area 130 does not occur until the prior back action returns the user to the search result page.
- the first interaction with the back control may cause generation of the browser interface illustrated in FIG.
- next interaction with the back control may cause generation of the browser interface illustrated in FIG. 1 B
- the next interaction with the back control may cause generation of the browser interface to the interface illustrated in FIG. 1 A , removing the search result area 130 and returning the display area 120 ′ to display area 120 .
- the content rendered in the display area 120 ′ may not be a webpage.
- the content may be associated with any resource accessible via a network.
- the content displayed in the display area 120 ′ can be in an image, a link, a video, text, and/or so forth.
- the search results 125 can be bookmarked or associated with a bookmark of the browser 110 .

- FIG. 2 C illustrates an information mode.
- the search result area 130 illustrates at least search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′.
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ are represented by icons. In the example of FIG. 2 A , the icons are circles, but any icons can be used.
- the open circle represents the current search result being selected. Put another way, the open circle represents the search result that corresponds to the content currently displayed in the display area 120 ′.
- the closed circles represent search results that are not selected, or in other words search results not associated with the content currently displayed in the display area 120 ′.
- the search result area 130 illustrates textual search result indicators SR 1 ′ and SR 2 ′.
- the text for a search result indicator represents minimal text used to identify the resource associated with the search result.
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ and SR 2 ′ include a portion of the domain of the website addresses (e.g., a portion of the uniform resource locators (URLs)).
- the website addresses represent identifiers of the resources associated with the search result indicators SRI′ and SR 2 ′.
- the portion of the domain used as text for the search result indicators may be sufficient to differentiate SR 1 from SR 2 .
- Some implementations may use other text from the search results, e.g., document title, an image thumbnail, etc. to identify the resource corresponding to the search result.
- the search result area 130 illustrates informational search result indicators SR 1 ′ and SR 2 ′.
- the informational textual search result indicators can include the textual search result indicators (or image thumbnail) plus some additional information about the resource.
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ and SR 2 ′ include information about websites as well as website addresses.

- the search result area 130 may be switched between one or more of the modes shown in FIGS. 2 A through 2 C .
- the search result area 130 can be transformed to, for example, the search result area 130 in the normal mode. Selection of the search result area 130 in the compact mode can demonstrate interest in more information that is illustrated in the normal mode.
- the location and/or shape of the search result area 130 can be different than shown in FIGS. 1 B through 1 D .
- the search result area 130 can be smaller in size than shown.
- the search result area 130 can be included along a different side of the browser 110 (e.g., along a bottom portion, along a top portion, along the left side, and/or so forth).
- the search result area 130 can be at a bottom location within the browser 110 , can be above the address bar area 114 , can be on a side of the browser 110 (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 7 C and 7 D ), and/or so forth.
- the search result area 130 can float above (e.g., can be rendered in a window above) the display area 120 so that the display area 120 in FIG. 1 A is not decreased in size to the area of the display area 120 ′ shown in FIG. 1 B .
- the search result area 130 can be a different shape (e.g., a circular shape) rather than a square or rectangular shape.
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ are arranged horizontally within the search result area 130 and can be navigated along a horizontal direction.
- the search result indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be arranged within the search result area 130 in a different orientation (e.g., vertically and navigated along a vertical direction).
- rendering of the search result area 130 is triggered in response to one or more interactions with a webpage.
- the interaction is detection of a scrolling pattern.
- a scrolling pattern defines one or more scrolling inputs that meet a criterion or criteria.
- the criterion can include an attribute of the scrolling input.
- a criterion in a scrolling pattern can be a scroll down input that has at least a certain velocity, that meets a distance threshold (e.g., halfway through the content, within a specified distance of the end of the content, etc.), etc.
- a criterion in a scrolling pattern can specify an order of scrolling actions, e.g., a scroll down followed by a scroll up.
- a scrolling pattern can combine multiple criteria, e.g., a scroll down to at least a particular threshold, followed by a scroll up of high velocity.
- the scrolling pattern can be device dependent.
- the scrolling pattern can be, or can partially be, defined by and/or changed by a user, e.g., as part of a user preference.
- search results 125 are displayed within the display area 120 of the browser 110 , similar to FIG. 1 A .
- webpage W 1 is displayed in display area 120 as shown in FIG. 3 B .
- selection of the search result SR 1 does not trigger display of the search result area 130 .
- the search result area 130 is rendered in response to an interaction with the webpage Wl.
- the interaction is defined by detection of a scroll pattern.
- the scroll pattern may be detection of a scroll down action, as represented by the arrow A in FIG. 3 B .
- a scroll down action occurs when content not initially displayed is scrolled into view. Although referred to as “down” it is understood that any direction that moves content not initially displayed into view corresponds to a scroll down.
- a scroll up action is in a direction opposite of a scroll down action.
- the search result area 130 can be displayed (as illustrated in FIG. 3 C ) in response to detection of the scroll pattern.
- a scroll pattern that includes the existence of a scroll down action may represent a user demonstrating interest in the webpage W 1 associated with the search result SR 1 , e.g., by scrolling down to review the content.
- scroll pattern may include detection of a scroll down action followed by a scroll up action having a threshold velocity.
- the browser may render the search result area 130 in response to the user demonstrating disinterest in the webpage W 1 associated with the search result SR 1 . Disinterested may be demonstrated by the user scrolling down to view the content followed by a scroll up occurring at a much faster rate, e.g., at least a threshold velocity. This interaction may indicate the user did not find the content satisfactory and the user is likely to return to the search result page and select another search result.
- the browser may anticipate the return to the search results page (e.g., via the browser's back control) and may trigger display of search result area 130 automatically.
- Triggering the search result area 130 in response to a scroll pattern can save the user from navigating back to the search result page and allow the user to navigate through the search results via the search result area 130 .
- the search result area 130 may not be rendered until the system detects scrolling back up (arrow B) after scrolling down.
- the search result area 130 may be rendered, e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 3 C , in response to detecting a scroll pattern of a scroll down action followed by a scroll up action.
- the scroll pattern can also specify attributes of the scroll actions (e.g., the scroll up action and/or the scroll down action).
- the scroll pattern may trigger display of the search result area 130 when the user has performed a first scroll action (e.g., scrolled down (arrow A)) to a certain threshold (e.g., halfway down the content, 1/3 of the way down the content, etc.) before the performing the second scroll action (e.g., a scroll up (arrow B)) completes the scroll action and triggers display of the search result area 130 .
- the browser may require a scroll speed threshold to be met, e.g., faster scrolling in either direction satisfying the scroll pattern criteria.
- the search result area 130 may be rendered after more than one search result of the search results 125 is selected. This implementation is illustrated in FIGS. 4 A through 4 D .
- search results 125 are displayed within the display area 120 of the browser 110 as shown in FIG. 4 A , similar to FIG. 1 A .
- webpage W 1 is displayed in display area 120 as shown in FIG. 4 B .
- a user may navigate back (e.g., via selection of a back control) to the search results as shown in FIG. 4 C and the user may select the search result SR 2 .
- the search result area 130 and the webpage W 2 associated with the search result SR 2 may be rendered as shown in FIG.
- the search result area 130 can be displayed in response to a user demonstrating interest in additional search results SR.
- the user interaction with the back control while viewing webpage W 1 may trigger display of the search result area 130 and content of webpage W 1 (e.g., similar to FIG. 1 B or 3 C ).
- interaction with a back control can trigger display of the search result area 130 .
- the trigger of the search result area 130 also depends on the target of the back control, or in other words, what content /resource is to be displayed as a result of the selection of (interaction with) the back control. If the target is a search result page the browser may, instead of navigating back to the search result page, trigger display of the search result area 130 .
- interaction with e.g., selection of
- a link A 1 within a webpage W 1 while the search result area 130 is shown can result in the search result area 130 being closed (as shown in FIG. 5 B ).
- selection of any actionable element within the content displayed in the display area 120 ′ may trigger removal of the search result area 130 .
- the webpage WA 1 which is associated with the link A 1 in FIG. 5 A can be rendered within the display area 120 .
- the search result area 130 is not closed in response to interaction with a link Al within the webpage W 1 and opening of the webpage WA 1 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein.
- the address bar area 114 of the browser 110 and the search result area 130 are part of a contiguous area.
- the browser can render the search result area 130 as part of the browser-controlled address bar area 114 .
- This contiguous area e.g., combined address bar area 114 and search result area 130
- the browser search area 135 is illustrated in FIG. 6 by the gray color that is contiguous between the address bar area 114 and the search result area 130 .
- This implementation shown and described in connection with FIG. 6 can be combined with any of the implementations described above, for example, in connection with FIGS. 1 A through 5 B .
- the search result area 130 can be integrated as part of the browser 110 (e.g., address bar area 114 ) as the browser search area 135 so that the search result area 130 may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by, for example, a third party or the owner of the content of the webpage W 1 content. Because the search result area 130 is part of the application of the browser 110 , the integration of the search result area 130 would be difficult to imitate. In some implementations, no clear separation (e.g., no separate line exists between the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 .
- any background or theme applied to the address bar area 114 would flow into (and would be contiguous with) the search result area 130 (as illustrated by the gray area).
- the contiguous background would be difficult for a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W 1 ) to imitate within an application of the browser 110 .
- the browser search area 135 can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search engine in response to a query from search results that can be inserted or manipulated by a third party or by the provider of the webpage.
- the combining of the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 can be an indicator of the authenticity of the content in the search result area 130 .
- the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 are combined, it signifies that the browser 110 (or provider of the browser 110 ) is providing the search result indicators 125 ′ in the search result area 130 .
- results in the search result area 130 may be provided by an untrusted provider (e.g., a third party).
- the display area 120 ′ is shown as being adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof). In some implementations, the display area 120 ′ (as shown in FIG. 1 B , for example) can be included in the browser 110 adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof).
- FIGS. 7 A through 7 D illustrate a search result area for a browser executing on a device with a larger screen.
- the example of FIG. 7 A through 7 D also illustrates the security feature described in FIG. 6 .
- the search result page returned in response to the query 122 can include more search results (e.g., search results SR 1 through SR 5 ) and may include additional elements, such as knowledge panel KP, sponsored area SA (e.g., a sponsored link or advertisement), etc.
- the display area 120 can include an indication of the query 122 .
- the indication of the query 122 is a text entry area where the user can provide a new query (e.g., modifying or overwriting the current query) and trigger a new search.
- selection of a search result such as SR 1 of FIG. 7 A , results in display of webpage W 1 in a display area 120 of the browser, as illustrated in FIG. 7 B .
- the search results 125 and the webpage W 1 are opened in the same browser tab, i.e., browser tab 112 .
- This functionality is similar to FIG. 4 B .
- interaction with a back control e.g., back control 716 , triggers the rendering of the search result area 130 , as illustrated in FIG. 7 C .
- the search result area 130 of FIG. 7 C is contiguous with address bar area 114 .
- the search result area 130 and the address bar area 114 are referred to as browser search area 135 .
- the search result area 130 is larger.
- the search result indicators 125 ′ i.e., SR 1 ′ through SR 5 ′
- the search result indicators 125 ′ of FIG. 7 C can include a portion of the information from the search results 125 of FIG. 7 A .
- the portion may include text portions but lack image portions.
- the portion can be a title portion.
- the search result indicator may include a title from the search result but lack a snippet from the search result.
- the search result indicators for the search result area 130 of a screen with larger area can include less text and/or images than the search results, but more than the search result indicators for a screen with limited area.
- the search result indicators 125 ′ may be similar to the informational search result indicators of FIG. 2 C .
- a search result indicator has the same identification of (link to) a resource that its corresponding search result has and selection of a search result indicator in the search result area 130 causes the browser to display the content of the resource associated with the selected search result in the display area 120 ′.
- selection of SR 4 in FIG. 7 C causes display of content associated with website W 4 in the display area 120 ′, as illustrated in FIG. 7 D .
- the search result area 130 may include other elements from the search result page, e.g., knowledge panel KP (illustrated in FIG. 7 C ) and/or sponsored area SA (not illustrated in FIG. 7 C ).
- the browser may extract information from the search result page and determine what information to include in the search result area 130 .
- the search server may communicate which elements to include in the search result area to the browser.
- the search result area 130 may include search result navigation controls, such as previous control 717 and next control 718 .
- the browser may be configured to ensure that use of the previous control 717 and the next control 718 (or other navigation controls in the search result area 130 ) do not result in navigation away from the search domain.
- the search result area 130 may display the identifier (e.g., the URL) from which the content of the search result area 130 is obtained. This may provide an indication that the content of the side panel is not spoofed.
- the browser may be configured to only communicate with a known search server when a navigation request is initiated in the search result area (requests to view a target of a search result are loaded in the display area 120 ′ and do not constitute navigation within the search result area 130 .
- the browser may be configured to only send messages to a known domain for a search engine identified to the browser, e.g., a search configuration in user settings, when the message is triggered by navigation controls interacted with in the search result area 130 .
- the browser may use an address pattern (e.g., a URL pattern) that is specified, e.g., as a search configuration to determine whether navigation occurs in the search result area 130 or the display area 120 ′. For example, when a requested resource does not match the address pattern navigation occurs in the display area 120 ′.
- selection of the search result SRI in FIG. 7 A can trigger display of the search result area 130 and the content of webpage W 1 in the display area 120 ′, e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 7 C .
- interaction with a search result on a search result page may trigger display of the search result area 130 .
- the user may expressly open (trigger display of) the search result area 130 . For example, if a user performs an alternate selection (e.g., right-click, long-press, long touch, two finger touch, etc.) on a search result (e.g., SRI of FIG.
- the browser may render a menu of actions.
- the alternate selection can be any gesture or action that is not the default gesture/action for a link.
- a default gesture/action causes the browser to navigate to (open) the webpage associated with the link in the display area 120 .
- the menu of actions may be a pop-up menu.
- the menu of actions may include actionable elements for performing various actions using the link associated with the search result.
- the actions can include opening the webpage W 1 in a new browser tab.
- the actions can include opening the webpage W 1 in a new browser instance (also called a new browser window).
- the actions can include copying the link to a clipboard, sharing the link etc.
- the actions can include a persistent search action.
- the persistent search action is an action that causes rendering of the search result area 130 and opening the webpage W 1 in the display area 120 ′.
- one of the actions can be a persistent search action that triggers display of the search result area 130 and causes the browser to open the content of the webpage W 1 , e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 7 C .

- the search result page includes search results (i.e., a first search result, a second search result, etc.) that are responsive to a query.
- the search result page is generated by a search engine in response to the query and returned to the browser that initiated the search request.
- the system may receive a selection of the first search result (e.g., search result SR 1 in FIG. 1 A and others). Because a search result includes a link to its respective resource, the search result is selectable, or in other words an actionable element.
- the system may, at step 908 , cause display of a webpage (or other resource) identified by the first search result.
- the resource identified by the search result e.g., as the target of the link of the search result, is referred to as the search result target.

- the system causes display of a first search result indicator and a second search result indicator in a search result area of the browser.
- the search result area is displayed concurrently with the display area.
- the content of the search result area (e.g., the first search result indicator and the second search result indicator) is visible with the content of the display area (e.g., the content of the webpage).
- the search result indicators each correspond to a respective search result in the search result page.
- the first search result indicator corresponds to the first search result
- the second search result indicator corresponds to the second search result, etc.
- the correspondence means that selection of the first search result indicator causes display of the same resource (e.g., webpage) that selection of the first result causes.

- the system may receive an interaction with the display of the resource.
- the interaction can be selection of a back control.
- the back control is a control configured to, when interacted with (e.g., when selected), cause the browser to render content for a resource that was displayed immediately prior to the current resource.
- this is the search result page that includes the first search result and the second search result.
- Some implementations may determine that the prior resource is a search result page (i.e., the back control target is a search result page) and change the default behavior. For example, when the back control target is a search result page, instead of re-rendering the search result page in the display area, the system may instead trigger display of the search result area.
- the search result area includes search result indicators corresponding to search results of the back control target (i.e., the search result page).
- the search result page is cached.
- the search result page is re-fetched (re-requested) from the search server.
- the interaction can be identification of a scroll pattern that triggers display of the search result area. Scroll patterns are discussed in more detail with respect to FIGS. 3 A to 3 C .
- Triggering display of the search result display area in response to interaction with the webpage can include, at step 1010 , decreasing a size of the display area of the browser. This reduction in size makes room for the search result area. As discussed above, in some implementations, the reduction in size may make less content of the webpage visible. In some implementations, the reduction in size may cause the content of the webpage to be resized, or in other words the content of the webpage can also be resized.

- the search result area can be removed in response to an express action to close the search result area (e.g., selection of actionable control 131 ), in response to selection of a link in the display area that causes the browser to navigate to (display) another resource in the display area etc.

Abstract
In one general aspect, a method can include receiving a search query and causing display of a first search result and a second search result within a display area of a browser in response to the search query. In response to a selection of the first search result, the method can include causing display of a webpage within a display area of the browser, and causing display of a first search result indicator corresponding with the first search result and a second search result indicator corresponding with the second search result in a search result area outside of the display area where the search result area is within the browser. In some implementations, the method includes causing display of the search result area in response to interaction with the display of the webpage in the display area.
Description
- This application is a non-provisional of, and claims priority to, U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/266,295, filed Dec. 31, 2021, and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/266,296, filed Dec. 31, 2021, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- A web browser can be used to display content that is searched via a search engine. Content can be displayed within the web browser in response to selection of one or more of the search results by a user.
- Implementations relate to providing persistent search results within a browser. In particular, implementations relate to rendering a search result area concurrently with a display area (a main content window). The search result area displays at least two search results, where a search result represents a resource that is responsive to a query. The display area displays the content associated with a webpage (resource) that corresponds to one of the two search results. In some implementations, the search results may be represented in the search result area by search result indicators, which are actionable user interface elements. Each search result indicator is associated with a resource determined to be responsive to the query. This resource is referred to as the search result target. Interaction with a search result indicator causes the browser to display the resource associated with the search result (the search result target) in the display area without closing the search result area. In some implementations the search result area represents search results for a portion of a search result page (i.e., selected search results from the search result page). Rendering of the search result area can be triggered by selection of a search result in a search result page. Rendering of the search result area can be triggered by interaction with a webpage displayed in response to selection of a search result in a search result page. The interaction can include selecting a “back” action when viewing a target of a search result. The interaction can include a scrolling pattern detected during display of the target of a search result.
- In one general aspect, a method can include receiving a search query and causing display of a first search result and a second search result within a display area of a browser in response to the search query. In response to a selection of the first search result, the method can include causing display of a webpage identified by the first search result within the display area of the browser, and causing display of a first search result indicator corresponding with the first search result and a second search result indicator corresponding with the second search result in a search result area outside of the display area, where the search result area is within the browser.
- In one general aspect, a method can include receiving a search query and causing display of a first search result and a second search result within a display area of a browser in response to the search query. In response to a selection of the first search result, the method can include causing display of a webpage identified by the first search result within the display area of the browser, and in response to receiving an interaction with the display of the webpage, causing display of a first search result indicator corresponding with the first search result and a second search result indicator corresponding with the second search result in a search result area outside of the display area, where the search result area is still within the browser.

FIG. 11 shows an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device, which may be used with the techniques described herein. - This disclosure is related to navigation of content associated with search results retrieved in response to a search query. The search results can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, or in a search result area of another browser, so that the content of a webpage associated with a search result is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while the search results are displayed. Likewise, the search results are maintained (e.g., persist) while content of the resources associated with the search results are maintained. At least one of the search results in the search result area can be selected, and content associated with the selected search result can be displayed in the display area. Thus, implementations enable navigation of webpages represented by the search results with fewer user interactions. In some implementations, the content associated with the search results can replace content of the webpage within the browser. In some implementations, the content associated with the search results can be displayed within another browser. The search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of the search results are navigated and/or displayed. The browser can be referred to as a browser window when associated with a window of an operating system (OS).
- A technical problem associated with searches, such as Internet-based searching, is that several interactions are needed to navigate to resources represented in the search result page. As is known, a search result page is generated by a search engine in response to a query. The search result page includes search results and can include other content, such as ads, knowledge panels, short answers, other types of rich results, links to limit the search to a particular resource type (e.g., images, travel, shopping, news, videos, etc.). Each search result corresponds to a resource available via a network, e.g., via a URL/URI/etc. The resources were determined to be responsive to the query by the search engine. The search result includes a link to its corresponding resource. The search result can include additional information, such as a title, a snippet (text obtained from the content of the resource), an image associated with the resource, etc., or other information relevant to the resource and/or the query, as determined by the search engine. The browser displays the search result page in the display area. With a conventional browser, when a user interacts with (selects) a search result (or in other words, selects the link to the resource, the link being included in the search result), the browser requests the content of the resource associated with the link and replaces the search result page in the display area with the content of the resource. To return to the search result page to view a different resource, the user must resubmit the query or must select a browser interface control configured to return the user to the previous resource (e.g., a back control). Selection of this back control causes the browser to again render the search result page in the display area, where the user can select a different link to a different resource, which causes the browser to fetch and render the content of the different resource. This back-and-forth between the search result page and the resources represented in the search result page is inefficient for the computing device and the user. For example, the computing device expends resources (battery, processing power, and potentially network bandwidth for re-fetching) to re-render the search result page several times as the user navigates to the resources represented by the search results. In addition, the user must perform an extra interaction with the browser to accomplish the navigation because the search results are not maintained during navigation of the content.
- At least one technical solution to the technical problems described above is that search results can be maintained (persist) within a search result area of the browser while the user navigates to resources represented by the search result. Thus, the content of the resource is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser in a separate display area while the search results are displayed. At least one technical effect of this technical solution is that the computing device on which the browser executes performs fewer renderings of the search results. Search results within a search result area and webpage content within a display area can be simultaneously displayed within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser). This technical solution has the technical effect of reducing the number of interactions a user has with the browser to navigate the different resources represented by the search results. Put another way, because search results for a query persist in the search result area, interactions with the back control of a browser are eliminated.
- In some implementations, a search result area can be integrated as part of the browser so that the search result area may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by a third party or the owner of the webpage content. This can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of a webpage or other resource. Accordingly, the technical problem of spoofing search results can be obviated by the technical solution of integrating a search result area within the browser as described above. The technical effect of integration of a search result area within a browser is that spoofing can be prevented.
- As mentioned above, in some implementations, search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) in a search result area even as the content of resources represented by the search results are navigated to and displayed. The content associated with the resources represented by the search results can be displayed within the display area simultaneously within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser) with the search result area. This can be achieved even if only a limited available screen space is available by, e.g., scaling the resolution of the content to be displayed in the display area in case the size of the display area is decreased in order to display the display area and the search result area together within the browser on the limited available screen space. Accordingly, the technical problem of being unable to simultaneously navigate content associated with search results while viewing the search results in a search result area is solved by the technical solution and technical effect described above.
- The implementations described herein enable improved guided human-machine interactions for viewing webpages and other resources on the one side and displaying search results on the other side. The viewing of results of a query and the viewing of webpages represented by the results are done simultaneously by using one user interface only. This saves processing resources and potentially bandwidth (by avoiding additional fetching of a search result page). This also results in fewer interactions of the user with the user interface as the user may easily switch between different resources from the results and view the content of the resource at the same time in the same interface.
- The browsers described herein can be executed within a computing device. For example, the browsers can be executed within a laptop device. In some implementations, the browsers can be executed within a mobile device. or on any other device with limited available screen space. Although many of the implementations shown and described herein are shown in portrait mode, any of the implementations described herein can be rendered in a landscape mode. Likewise, implementations described herein in landscape mode can be rendered in a portrait mode.

FIG. 1A is a diagram that illustrates search results SR1 through SR3 (collectively can be referred to as search results 125) displayed within adisplay area 120 of abrowser 110. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 can be within a tab of thebrowser 110. The search results 125 can be triggered for display in response to a search query. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 can include an indication of thequery 122. The indication of thequery 122 includes the content (e.g., text/image) used as the query. In some implementations, the indication of thequery 122 is a text entry area where the user can provide a new query and trigger a new search. The search results 125 can be included in a search result page. A search result page is a webpage generated by a search engine of a search server in response to a query and typically includes one or more search results. As is understood, the search results, e.g., SR1 through SR3, are each associated with a respective resource, e.g., webpage, file, etc., available over a network. The search query, to which the search results 125 are responsive, can be triggered by a user of, for example, a computing device via a text search, an image search, and/or so forth. A user interface for triggering the search query is not illustrated herein. Although not illustrated inFIG. 1A , there may be additional search results identifying resources responsive to the query included in the search results 125. These may be viewed, for example, by scrolling. - In some implementations, one or more of the search results 125 can include text. In some implementations, one or more of the search results 125 can include images. One or more of the search results 125 include a respective link, i.e., a link to a resource available via a network such as the Internet. The resource is a source of content (e.g., images, webpages, documents, etc.). Any search result that includes a link is actionable. In other words, a search result with a link can be interacted with, e.g., via selection of the link. The interaction with a link of a search result of
search results 125 causes the browser to fetch the content of the resource associated with the link. Because of this, a search result can be referred to as selectable and interaction with a search result is understood to refer to interaction with (e.g., selection of) the link associated with the search result. -
FIG. 1B is a diagram that illustrates a search result area 130 (shown by a dashed box) triggered for display within thebrowser 110. In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can be triggered in response to at least one of the search results 125 being selected (e.g., interacted with). For example, in the example ofFIG. 1B , search result SR1 inFIG. 1A has been selected. Thus, in response to interaction with (e.g., the selection of) search result SR1 inFIG. 1A , the webpage W1 is displayed within thedisplay area 120′ inFIG. 1B . The webpage W1 is the resource associated with the link of SR1 in this example. Also, in response to the selection of the search result SR1 inFIG. 1A , thesearch result area 130 is rendered within thebrowser 110 inFIG. 1B . Accordingly, in response to the selection of search result SR1 inFIG. 1A , as illustrated inFIG. 1B , both the webpage W1 is displayed within thedisplay area 120′ and thesearch result area 130 is rendered within thebrowser 110. Also, in response to the selection of search result SR1 inFIG. 1A , as illustrated inFIG. 1B , both the webpage W1 is displayed within thedisplay area 120′ and the search result indicator SRI′ is displayed within thesearch result area 130 within thebrowser 110. - Consistent with the description above, rendering of the
search result area 130 inFIG. 1B is triggered in response to an interaction with (e.g., selection of) one or more of the search results 125 inFIG. 1A . Rendering of thesearch result area 130 inFIG. 1B can be triggered in response to an interaction with any of the search results 125 inFIG. 1A . For example, rendering of thesearch result area 130 inFIG. 1B can be triggered in response to selection of the search result SR2 inFIG. 1A . - In some implementations, an interaction can include a selection. In some implementations, an interaction and/or selection (or an indication thereof) can be used to trigger an action or result. A user interface element that triggers an action in response to interaction with the element is referred to as an actionable element. The search results 125 are examples of actionable elements.
- As shown in
FIG. 1B , in some implementations, the search results SRI through SR3 ofFIG. 1A can be replaced with search result indicators SRI′ through SR3. In some implementations, the browser can use a template or a DOM model to identifysearch results 125 in the search result page. The search result page can be a cached page or can be re-fetched from the search server. Thesearch result indicators 125′ each correspond to a respective search result of the search results 125. Thesearch result indicators 125′ are also actionable elements. A search result indicator performs the same action when interacted with that its corresponding search result performs. In other words, selection of search result indicator SR1′ causes display of webpage W1, just as selection of search result SR1 causes display of webpage W1. However, a search result indicator occupies much less area within the browser than its corresponding search result. In other words, a search result indicator has a smaller footprint than the search result it corresponds to. The smaller footprint enables the browser to display the search results in thesearch result area 130 concurrently with the webpage W1 in thedisplay area 120. The smaller footprint can be important for a computing device with a limited screen size, such as a mobile phone, smart watch, smart glasses, tablet, etc. Examplesearch result indicators 125′ are discussed in more detail with respect toFIGS. 2A-2C . - In the example of
FIG. 1B , the search results 125 are displayed within thesearch result area 130 as search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′ (collectively referred to assearch result indicators 125′). The search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′ correspond, respectively, with the search results SRI through SR3. The user can use the search results indicators SRI′ through SR3′ to navigate to resources associated with the search results SR1 through SR3. In other words, the search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be, or can include, for example, links associated with search results SRI through SR3. - In some implementations, the search results SRI through SR3 (and search result indicators SRI′ through SR3′) may be a subset of search results surfaced in response to a search query. In some implementations, the search SRI through SR3 (and search result indicators SRI′ through SR3′) can be a rank-ordered (e.g., highest ranked) subset of search results surfaced in response to a search query. In some implementations, one or more of the search results SR1 through SR3 can be prioritized so that the most relevant search results (or a subset thereof) are rendered within the
search result area 130. - Although not shown in
FIG. 1B , in some implementations, the search result indicator SR1′ may not be displayed within thesearch result area 130 because the webpage W1 corresponding to the search result SR1 is displayed. Accordingly, at least the search result associated with the resource (e.g., a webpage) already displayed in thedisplay area 120′ may not be included in thesearch result area 130. This enables other search result indicators to be visible in thesearch result area 130, especially where a size of the screen is limited. - In some implementations, although not shown in
FIG. 1B ,additional search results 125 accessible via scrolling (or otherwise navigating through the display area 120) inFIG. 1A can correspond to additionalsearch result indicators 125′ accessible via scrolling inFIG. 1B . For example, in some implementations, the additional search results can be viewed by scrolling left and right within thesearch result area 130. - As shown in
FIGS. 1A through 1D , the browser includes anaddress bar area 114. An address of the webpage W1 can be illustrated in the address bar area 114 (e.g., input address area 113). Other controls, icons, and/or so forth can be included in theaddress bar area 114. Theaddress bar area 114 can be controlled by and/or associated with the browser 110 (e.g., the browser application). Because theaddress bar area 114 is controlled by thebrowser 110, the webpage W1 and/or a provider of the webpage W1 does not have access to content displayed in theaddress bar area 114 or triggering actions provided by actionable elements of theaddress bar area 114. - Although not shown in
FIG. 1B , in some implementations, thesearch result area 130 is separated from theaddress bar area 114 by a visible separation line between the address bar area and thesearch result area 130. The line can be eliminated (e.g., omitted), for security purposes. When provided, this is a line that a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W1) may not remove (e.g., paint over, scrub out). In other words, when provided, this is a line that is controlled (e.g., provided by, eliminated by) the browser 110 (e.g., browser application), similar to theaddress bar area 114. - As shown in
FIG. 1B , in response to thesearch result area 130 being rendered in response to the search query, the size (e.g., an area) of the display area 120 (shown inFIG. 1A ) is decreased to a size of thedisplay area 120′. In other words, the display area 120 (shown inFIG. 1A ) is decreased in size in response to thesearch result area 130 being displayed to accommodate thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the webpage W1 can be modified (e.g., scaled) in layout to fit (e.g., fit for display) into thedisplay area 120′. According to an implementation, scaling of the webpage W1 is achieved by displaying the webpage W1 in lower resolution so that the webpage W1 is displayed without decreasing the visible area of the webpage W1 within the decreaseddisplay area 120′. This implementation has the technical effect that in addition to the webpage W1 as displayed in thedisplay area 120′ the search results can be displayed in thesearch result area 130 on a, e.g., limited available screen space. In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can overlap with the webpage W1 without modifying the scale of the webpage Wl. Put another way, a visible portion of W1 may decrease because of the decreased visible area of thedisplay area 120′ but a scale of the webpage W1 does not change. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 shown inFIG. 1A can be divided into thedisplay area 120′ and thesearch result area 130 as shown inFIG. 1B . The combined areas of thedisplay area 120′ and thesearch result area 130 shown inFIG. 1B can be the same as the area of thedisplay area 120 as shown inFIG. 1A . In some implementations, the combined areas of thedisplay area 120′ and thesearch result area 130 can be different from (e.g., smaller than, larger than) the area of thedisplay area 120. -
FIG. 1C illustrates content of a webpage W2 rendered indisplay area 120′ within thebrowser 110. The content of the webpage W2 is rendered in thedisplay area 120′ in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search result indicator SR2′ in thesearch result area 130 ofFIG. 1B . The webpage W2 displayed in thedisplay area 120′, in this implementation, replaces the webpage W1 displayed in thedisplay area 120′. - The combination of concurrent display of the
search result area 130 and thedisplay area 120′ can be used to consume (e.g., explore) the search results in thesearch result area 130 with minimal user interactions and reduced computing resource usage. For example, in response to a first search result indicator being selected from thesearch result area 130, first content can be rendered in thedisplay area 120′. In response to a second search result indicator being selected from thesearch result area 130, second content can be rendered in thedisplay area 120′, replacing the first content. This improved search result navigation can occur while the search results (e.g., search result indicator SR1′) are maintained within thesearch result area 130. -
FIG. 1D illustrates content of a webpage W3 rendered in adisplay area 120′ within thebrowser 110. The content of the webpage W3 is rendered in thedisplay area 120′ in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search result indicator SR3′ in thesearch result area 130. The webpage W3 displayed in thedisplay area 120′, in this implementation, replaces the webpage W2 displayed in thedisplay area 120′ ofFIG. 1C . As shown inFIG. 1D , in this example, the positions of the search result indicators are shifted so that the search result indicator SR3′ corresponding with the webpage W3 is more centered within thesearch result area 130. Also, inFIG. 1D , search result indicator SR4′ is displayed because search result indicator SR3′ has shifted position in thesearch result area 130. This shift of position may result in SR1′ not being rendered in thesearch result area 130. In other words, as a result of the interaction of SR3′ ofFIG. 1C , the browser may scroll SR3′ to a position of prominence (centered in the display), causing SR1′ to scroll off the visible portion of the screen and causing SR4′ to scroll onto the visible portion of the screen. - Further to the implementation shown in
FIGS. 1A through 1D , in some implementations, a new resource location (web address) or search can be input intoinput address area 113 of theaddress bar area 114 after thesearch result area 130 and thedisplay area 120′ are defined. In response to the input to theinput address area 113, a different webpage (not shown) can replace the webpage W2 (or other content) in thedisplay area 120′, while maintaining the search result indicators SR′ in thesearch result area 130. In other words, the search result indicators SR′ can be maintained even while navigating within thedisplay area 120′ and using a different web address in theaddress bar area 114 of thebrowser 110. In some implementations, in response to the input to theinput address area 113, the browser may remove thesearch result area 130, returning thedisplay area 120′ to displayarea 120. The content of the resource corresponding to the input to theinput address area 113 may be displayed in thedisplay area 120. Thus, in some implementations, input to theinput address area 113 may cause removal of thesearch result area 130. - In some implementations, a user interface element (e.g., a back control, such as a back button, a back arrow) can be used to remove (e.g., clear, navigate away from) content rendered in the
display area 120′ (e.g., the webpage W2). In other words, user interaction with a back control can trigger removal of thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, removal of (e.g., clearing) thesearch result area 130 automatically returns thedisplay area 120′ to displayarea 120. In some implementations, removal of thesearch result area 130 does not occur until the prior back action returns the user to the search result page. Put another way, using the example ofFIG. 1D , the first interaction with the back control may cause generation of the browser interface illustrated inFIG. 1C , the next interaction with the back control may cause generation of the browser interface illustrated inFIG. 1B , and the next interaction with the back control may cause generation of the browser interface to the interface illustrated inFIG. 1A , removing thesearch result area 130 and returning thedisplay area 120′ to displayarea 120. - Although discussed in the context of webpages W1 through W3, in some implementations, the content rendered in the
display area 120′ may not be a webpage. As discussed herein, the content may be associated with any resource accessible via a network. Thus, in some implementations, the content displayed in thedisplay area 120′ can be in an image, a link, a video, text, and/or so forth. - In some implementations, although not shown, the search results 125 can be bookmarked or associated with a bookmark of the
browser 110. In some implementations a finite number of the search results (e.g., top 5) may be bookmarked. -
FIGS. 2A through 2C are diagrams that illustrate variations of thesearch result indicators 125′ displayed in thesearch result area 130. As illustrated inFIGS. 2A through 2C , thesearch result area 130 can include an affordance, or actionable control 131 (a selectable “X” icon) that can be used to close thesearch result area 130.FIG. 2A illustrates a compact mode,FIG. 2B illustrates a normal mode, andFIG. 2C illustrates an information mode. - As shown in
FIG. 2A , thesearch result area 130 illustrates at least search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′. The search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′ are represented by icons. In the example ofFIG. 2A , the icons are circles, but any icons can be used. The open circle represents the current search result being selected. Put another way, the open circle represents the search result that corresponds to the content currently displayed in thedisplay area 120′. The closed circles represent search results that are not selected, or in other words search results not associated with the content currently displayed in thedisplay area 120′. - As shown in
FIG. 2B , thesearch result area 130 illustrates textual search result indicators SR1′ and SR2′. In the example ofFIG. 2B the text for a search result indicator represents minimal text used to identify the resource associated with the search result. In the example ofFIG. 2B , the search result indicators SR1′ and SR2′ include a portion of the domain of the website addresses (e.g., a portion of the uniform resource locators (URLs)). The website addresses represent identifiers of the resources associated with the search result indicators SRI′ and SR2′. The portion of the domain used as text for the search result indicators may be sufficient to differentiate SR1 from SR2. Some implementations may use other text from the search results, e.g., document title, an image thumbnail, etc. to identify the resource corresponding to the search result. - As shown in
FIG. 2C , thesearch result area 130 illustrates informational search result indicators SR1′ and SR2′. The informational textual search result indicators can include the textual search result indicators (or image thumbnail) plus some additional information about the resource. In the example ofFIG. 2C , the search result indicators SR1′ and SR2′ include information about websites as well as website addresses. - The search result indicators in the
search result area 130 inFIG. 2A are compact as compared with the search result indicators shown inFIGS. 2B and 2C . The search result indicators in thesearch result area 130 inFIG. 2C are in an information dense form. - Although not shown, the
search result area 130 may be switched between one or more of the modes shown inFIGS. 2A through 2C . For example, upon selection of thesearch result area 130 in the compact mode shown inFIG. 2A , thesearch result area 130 can be transformed to, for example, thesearch result area 130 in the normal mode. Selection of thesearch result area 130 in the compact mode can demonstrate interest in more information that is illustrated in the normal mode. - The location and/or shape of the
search result area 130 can be different than shown inFIGS. 1B through 1D . In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can be smaller in size than shown. In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can be included along a different side of the browser 110 (e.g., along a bottom portion, along a top portion, along the left side, and/or so forth). For example, thesearch result area 130 can be at a bottom location within thebrowser 110, can be above theaddress bar area 114, can be on a side of the browser 110 (e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 7C and 7D ), and/or so forth. In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can float above (e.g., can be rendered in a window above) thedisplay area 120 so that thedisplay area 120 inFIG. 1A is not decreased in size to the area of thedisplay area 120′ shown inFIG. 1B . In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 can be a different shape (e.g., a circular shape) rather than a square or rectangular shape. As shown inFIGS. 1B through 1D , the search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′ are arranged horizontally within thesearch result area 130 and can be navigated along a horizontal direction. In some implementations, the search result indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be arranged within thesearch result area 130 in a different orientation (e.g., vertically and navigated along a vertical direction). - In the implementation shown in
FIGS. 3A through 3C , rendering of thesearch result area 130 is triggered in response to one or more interactions with a webpage. In the example ofFIGS. 3A through 3C the interaction is detection of a scrolling pattern. A scrolling pattern defines one or more scrolling inputs that meet a criterion or criteria. The criterion can include an attribute of the scrolling input. For example, a criterion in a scrolling pattern can be a scroll down input that has at least a certain velocity, that meets a distance threshold (e.g., halfway through the content, within a specified distance of the end of the content, etc.), etc. A criterion in a scrolling pattern can specify an order of scrolling actions, e.g., a scroll down followed by a scroll up. A scrolling pattern can combine multiple criteria, e.g., a scroll down to at least a particular threshold, followed by a scroll up of high velocity. The scrolling pattern can be device dependent. The scrolling pattern can be, or can partially be, defined by and/or changed by a user, e.g., as part of a user preference. - As shown in
FIG. 3A , search results 125 are displayed within thedisplay area 120 of thebrowser 110, similar toFIG. 1A . In response to selection of the search result SR1, webpage W1 is displayed indisplay area 120 as shown inFIG. 3B . However, in the example ofFIG. 3A , selection of the search result SR1 does not trigger display of thesearch result area 130. Instead, in the example ofFIG. 3A and 3B , thesearch result area 130 is rendered in response to an interaction with the webpage Wl. In the example ofFIG. 3B the interaction is defined by detection of a scroll pattern. In some implementations, the scroll pattern may be detection of a scroll down action, as represented by the arrow A inFIG. 3B . A scroll down action occurs when content not initially displayed is scrolled into view. Although referred to as “down” it is understood that any direction that moves content not initially displayed into view corresponds to a scroll down. A scroll up action is in a direction opposite of a scroll down action. In the example ofFIG. 3B , thesearch result area 130 can be displayed (as illustrated inFIG. 3C ) in response to detection of the scroll pattern. A scroll pattern that includes the existence of a scroll down action may represent a user demonstrating interest in the webpage W1 associated with the search result SR1, e.g., by scrolling down to review the content. - In some implementations, scroll pattern may include detection of a scroll down action followed by a scroll up action having a threshold velocity. For example, in such implementations the browser may render the
search result area 130 in response to the user demonstrating disinterest in the webpage W1 associated with the search result SR1. Disinterested may be demonstrated by the user scrolling down to view the content followed by a scroll up occurring at a much faster rate, e.g., at least a threshold velocity. This interaction may indicate the user did not find the content satisfactory and the user is likely to return to the search result page and select another search result. In this example, the browser may anticipate the return to the search results page (e.g., via the browser's back control) and may trigger display ofsearch result area 130 automatically. Triggering thesearch result area 130 in response to a scroll pattern can save the user from navigating back to the search result page and allow the user to navigate through the search results via thesearch result area 130. In this example, in response to scrolling down (arrow A) within the webpage W1 thesearch result area 130 may not be rendered until the system detects scrolling back up (arrow B) after scrolling down. Thus, thesearch result area 130 may be rendered, e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 3C , in response to detecting a scroll pattern of a scroll down action followed by a scroll up action. - As previously discussed, the scroll pattern can also specify attributes of the scroll actions (e.g., the scroll up action and/or the scroll down action). For example, in some implementations, the scroll pattern may trigger display of the
search result area 130 when the user has performed a first scroll action (e.g., scrolled down (arrow A)) to a certain threshold (e.g., halfway down the content, 1/3 of the way down the content, etc.) before the performing the second scroll action (e.g., a scroll up (arrow B)) completes the scroll action and triggers display of thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the browser may require a scroll speed threshold to be met, e.g., faster scrolling in either direction satisfying the scroll pattern criteria. - In some implementations, the
search result area 130 may be rendered after more than one search result of the search results 125 is selected. This implementation is illustrated inFIGS. 4A through 4D . For example, search results 125 are displayed within thedisplay area 120 of thebrowser 110 as shown inFIG. 4A , similar toFIG. 1A . In response to selection of the search result SR1, webpage W1 is displayed indisplay area 120 as shown inFIG. 4B . A user may navigate back (e.g., via selection of a back control) to the search results as shown inFIG. 4C and the user may select the search result SR2. In response to selection of the search result SR2, thesearch result area 130 and the webpage W2 associated with the search result SR2 may be rendered as shown inFIG. 4D . Accordingly, thesearch result area 130 can be displayed in response to a user demonstrating interest in additional search results SR. In some implementations, instead of navigating back to the search results as shown inFIG. 4C , the user interaction with the back control while viewing webpage W1 (e.g., inFIG. 4B ) may trigger display of thesearch result area 130 and content of webpage W1 (e.g., similar toFIG. 1B or 3C ). Thus, interaction with a back control can trigger display of thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the trigger of thesearch result area 130 also depends on the target of the back control, or in other words, what content /resource is to be displayed as a result of the selection of (interaction with) the back control. If the target is a search result page the browser may, instead of navigating back to the search result page, trigger display of thesearch result area 130. - In some implementations, interaction with (e.g., selection of) a link A1 within a webpage W1 while the
search result area 130 is shown (as shown inFIG. 5A ) can result in thesearch result area 130 being closed (as shown inFIG. 5B ). Put another way, selection of any actionable element within the content displayed in thedisplay area 120′ may trigger removal of thesearch result area 130. Thus, the webpage WA1, which is associated with the link A1 inFIG. 5A can be rendered within thedisplay area 120. Although not shown, in some implementations, thesearch result area 130 is not closed in response to interaction with a link Al within the webpage W1 and opening of the webpage WA1. -
FIG. 6 illustrates a security feature associated with the implementations described herein. As shown inFIG. 6 , theaddress bar area 114 of thebrowser 110 and thesearch result area 130 are part of a contiguous area. Put another way, the browser can render thesearch result area 130 as part of the browser-controlledaddress bar area 114. This contiguous area (e.g., combinedaddress bar area 114 and search result area 130) can be referred to as abrowser search area 135. Thebrowser search area 135 is illustrated inFIG. 6 by the gray color that is contiguous between theaddress bar area 114 and thesearch result area 130. This implementation shown and described in connection withFIG. 6 can be combined with any of the implementations described above, for example, in connection withFIGS. 1A through 5B . - The
search result area 130 can be integrated as part of the browser 110 (e.g., address bar area 114) as thebrowser search area 135 so that thesearch result area 130 may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by, for example, a third party or the owner of the content of the webpage W1 content. Because thesearch result area 130 is part of the application of thebrowser 110, the integration of thesearch result area 130 would be difficult to imitate. In some implementations, no clear separation (e.g., no separate line exists between thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114. Because thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114 are contiguous, any background or theme applied to theaddress bar area 114 would flow into (and would be contiguous with) the search result area 130 (as illustrated by the gray area). The contiguous background would be difficult for a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W1) to imitate within an application of thebrowser 110. Moreover, thebrowser search area 135 can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search engine in response to a query from search results that can be inserted or manipulated by a third party or by the provider of the webpage. - The combining of the
search result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114 can be an indicator of the authenticity of the content in thesearch result area 130. When thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114 are combined, it signifies that the browser 110 (or provider of the browser 110) is providing thesearch result indicators 125′ in thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, when a separating line is present between thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114, results in thesearch result area 130 may be provided by an untrusted provider (e.g., a third party). - In
FIG. 6 , thedisplay area 120′ is shown as being adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof). In some implementations, thedisplay area 120′ (as shown inFIG. 1B , for example) can be included in thebrowser 110 adjacent to the browser search area 135 (or a portion thereof). -
FIGS. 7A through 7D illustrate a search result area for a browser executing on a device with a larger screen. The example ofFIG. 7A through 7D also illustrates the security feature described inFIG. 6 . Because the screen is larger than the screen illustrated in the prior figures, the search result page returned in response to thequery 122 can include more search results (e.g., search results SR1 through SR5) and may include additional elements, such as knowledge panel KP, sponsored area SA (e.g., a sponsored link or advertisement), etc. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 can include an indication of thequery 122. In some implementations, the indication of thequery 122 is a text entry area where the user can provide a new query (e.g., modifying or overwriting the current query) and trigger a new search. In some implementations, selection of a search result, such as SR1 ofFIG. 7A , results in display of webpage W1 in adisplay area 120 of the browser, as illustrated inFIG. 7B . In the example ofFIG. 7A and 7B , the search results 125 and the webpage W1 are opened in the same browser tab, i.e.,browser tab 112. This functionality is similar toFIG. 4B . In one implementation, interaction with a back control, e.g., backcontrol 716, triggers the rendering of thesearch result area 130, as illustrated inFIG. 7C . - The
search result area 130 ofFIG. 7C is contiguous withaddress bar area 114. Thus, as inFIG. 6 , thesearch result area 130 and theaddress bar area 114 are referred to asbrowser search area 135. Because the screen ofFIG. 7C is larger than that ofFIG. 6 , thesearch result area 130 is larger. Thus, in some implementations, thesearch result indicators 125′ (i.e., SR1′ through SR5′) can be the same as or substantially the same as the search results 125 (i.e., SR1 through SR5). In some implementations, thesearch result indicators 125′ ofFIG. 7C can include a portion of the information from the search results 125 ofFIG. 7A . In some implementations, the portion may include text portions but lack image portions. In some implementations the portion can be a title portion. In some implementations the search result indicator may include a title from the search result but lack a snippet from the search result. The search result indicators for thesearch result area 130 of a screen with larger area (e.g., the screen represented inFIG. 7C ) can include less text and/or images than the search results, but more than the search result indicators for a screen with limited area. In some implementations, thesearch result indicators 125′ may be similar to the informational search result indicators ofFIG. 2C . As with the other figures described herein, a search result indicator has the same identification of (link to) a resource that its corresponding search result has and selection of a search result indicator in thesearch result area 130 causes the browser to display the content of the resource associated with the selected search result in thedisplay area 120′. Thus, for example, selection of SR4 inFIG. 7C causes display of content associated with website W4 in thedisplay area 120′, as illustrated inFIG. 7D . In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 may include other elements from the search result page, e.g., knowledge panel KP (illustrated inFIG. 7C ) and/or sponsored area SA (not illustrated inFIG. 7C ). In some implementations, the browser may extract information from the search result page and determine what information to include in thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the search server may communicate which elements to include in the search result area to the browser. - In some implementations, the
search result area 130 may include search result navigation controls, such asprevious control 717 andnext control 718. In some implementations, the browser may be configured to ensure that use of theprevious control 717 and the next control 718 (or other navigation controls in the search result area 130) do not result in navigation away from the search domain. In some implementations, thesearch result area 130 may display the identifier (e.g., the URL) from which the content of thesearch result area 130 is obtained. This may provide an indication that the content of the side panel is not spoofed. In some implementations, the browser may be configured to only communicate with a known search server when a navigation request is initiated in the search result area (requests to view a target of a search result are loaded in thedisplay area 120′ and do not constitute navigation within thesearch result area 130. In other words, the browser may be configured to only send messages to a known domain for a search engine identified to the browser, e.g., a search configuration in user settings, when the message is triggered by navigation controls interacted with in thesearch result area 130. In some implementations, the browser may use an address pattern (e.g., a URL pattern) that is specified, e.g., as a search configuration to determine whether navigation occurs in thesearch result area 130 or thedisplay area 120′. For example, when a requested resource does not match the address pattern navigation occurs in thedisplay area 120′. - In some implementations, similar to
FIGS. 1A and 1B , selection of the search result SRI inFIG. 7A can trigger display of thesearch result area 130 and the content of webpage W1 in thedisplay area 120′, e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 7C . In other words, in some implementations, interaction with a search result on a search result page may trigger display of thesearch result area 130. In some implementations (not shown), the user may expressly open (trigger display of) thesearch result area 130. For example, if a user performs an alternate selection (e.g., right-click, long-press, long touch, two finger touch, etc.) on a search result (e.g., SRI ofFIG. 7A ) the browser may render a menu of actions. The alternate selection can be any gesture or action that is not the default gesture/action for a link. A default gesture/action causes the browser to navigate to (open) the webpage associated with the link in thedisplay area 120. The menu of actions may be a pop-up menu. The menu of actions may include actionable elements for performing various actions using the link associated with the search result. For example, the actions can include opening the webpage W1 in a new browser tab. The actions can include opening the webpage W1 in a new browser instance (also called a new browser window). The actions can include copying the link to a clipboard, sharing the link etc. In some implementations, the actions can include a persistent search action. The persistent search action is an action that causes rendering of thesearch result area 130 and opening the webpage W1 in thedisplay area 120′. In other words, one of the actions can be a persistent search action that triggers display of thesearch result area 130 and causes the browser to open the content of the webpage W1, e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 7C . -
FIG. 8 illustrates asystem 800 including acomputing system 802 and asearch server 840 configured for implementing the concepts and various implementations shown and described herein. Thecomputing system 802 can be a computing device with a limited screen size, such as a smartphone, a smart watch, smart (e.g., A/R or V/R glasses), a tablet, etc. Thecomputing system 802 can be a computing device with a larger screen size, such as a desktop computer, a laptop, a netbook, a notebook, a tablet, a smart TV, a game console with a browser, etc. In general, thecomputing system 802 can represent any computing device that executes a browser. As shown inFIG. 8 , thecomputing system 802 is configured to communicate with thesearch server 840 and/or a resource provider 810 (e.g., a web server) via anetwork 850. Thecomputing system 802 includes at least abrowser manager 820 and asearch result manager 823. In some implementations, thebrowser manager 820 is configured to manage resource content, such as webpage content, provided by the resource provider 810 (e.g., a web server). In some implementations, thebrowser manager 820 is configured to operate as one ofseveral applications 828 executed via an operating system (O/S) 829. Thebrowser manager 820 can be configured to implement portions of the user interface, search results, windows, browser areas, and/or so forth, as described in connection with the implementations described herein. - As shown in
FIG. 8 , thecomputing system 802 includes several hardware components including acommunication module 861, one ormore cameras 862, amemory 863, a central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) 864, one or more input devices 867 (e.g., touch screen, mouse, stylus, microphone, keyboard, etc.), and one or more output devices 868 (screen, speaker, vibrator, light emitter, etc.). The hardware components can be used to facilitate operation of thebrowser manager 820, thesearch result manager 823, and/or so forth of thecomputing system 802. - The
browser manager 820 includes a user interface (UI)generator 821 configured to generate and/or manage the various user interface elements of a browser such asbrowser 110 as shown and described herein. For example, theUI generator 821 can generate UI elements including the various windows in thebrowser 110 such as thedisplay area 120, thesearch result area 130, shown in at leastFIGS. 1A through 1C , and/or thebrowser search area 135 shown at least inFIGS. 6 and 7A through 7D . - The
browser manager 820 includes atab manager 822 configured to generate and/or manage the various tabs (e.g., tab 112) of a browser such asbrowser 110. Thebrowser manager 820 may be configured to, amongst other things, provide/perform the actions associated with actionable controls, such as links in the search results 125 (andsearch result indicators 125′),back control 716,actionable control 131,previous control 717, and/ornext control 718. Thetab manager 822 can also be configured to provide the menu of actions and cause performance of an action selected from the menu of actions. - The
browser manager 820 includes asearch result manager 823 configured to generate and/or manage content rendering such as content in thesearch result area 130, including thesearch result indicators 125′ (as shown in at leastFIG. 1B, 1C, 2A-2C, 3C, 4D, 6, 7C and other figures). Thesearch result manager 823 can also be configured to determine when to trigger display of thesearch result area 130. Put another way, thesearch result manager 823 can be configured to determine what events trigger rendering of thesearch result area 130 and whether the triggering event has occurred. Triggering events can include any of those discussed herein, such as interaction with a search result on a search result page, selection of an action from a menu of actions, interaction with a resource that was displayed in response to selection of a search result (e.g., certain scrolling patterns, selection of a back control, selection of a back control that has a search result page as the target), etc. Thebrowser manager 820 can be configured to generate and/or manage content rendering associated with a webpage W1 in the display area 120 (includingdisplay area 120′), shown inFIGS. 1A, 1B, 7A, 7C , and other figures. The webpage W1 content can be provided to thecomputing system 802 by theresource provider 810. Thebrowser manager 820 and/or thesearch result manager 823 can be configured to implement one or both of the processes, or portions of the processes, described in connection withFIGS. 9 and 10 . - As shown in
FIG. 8 , session data 827 (which can be stored in memory 863 (not shown)) can be managed as, or by, one of theapplications 828. Thesession data 827 can include data related to one or more browser sessions. Theapplication information 826 can include information related to the various applications operating within and/or that can be executed by the O/S 829. - As shown in
FIG. 8 , thecommunication module 861 can be configured to facilitate communication with theresource provider 810 and/orsearch server 840 via thenetwork 850 via one or more communication protocols. Thecamera 862 can be used for capturing one or more images, thememory 863 can be used for storing information associated with thebrowser manager 820 and/orsearch result manager 823,other applications 828, O/S 829, etc. The CPU/GPU 864 can be used for processing information and/or images associated with thebrowser manager 820 and/orsearch result manager 823. Thecomputing system 802 also includes one ormore output devices 868 such as communication ports, speakers, displays, and/or so forth. The functionality described in this application can be implemented based on one ormore policies 865 and/orpreferences 866 stored in thememory 863. -
FIG. 8 illustrates some aspects of thesearch server 840. For example, thesearch server 840 includes one ormore processors 846 and one ormore memory devices 848. Thesearch server 840 includes asearch engine 844 configured to receive a request for a search (a query), from thecomputing system 802. Thesearch engine 844 may be used to provide a search result page for a given query. A query can be a word, a phrase, multiple words, an image, a media file, etc., as is known. Thesearch engine 844 is configured to search one or more data repositories for resources responsive to the query. Specifically, thesearch engine 844 may use an index of webpages, an index of images, an index of products, an entity repository, a news index, etc., to determine the content of the search result page. The search result page includes one or more search results, where each search result corresponds to a resource responsive to the query. Each search result includes a link to its respective resource. In some implementations, thesearch engine 844 can add additional elements to the search result page, such as ads, sponsored links, rich elements (knowledge panels, short answers, mini-apps, carousels, navigation links, etc.) to the search result page. -
FIG. 9 is a flowchart that illustrates anexample method 900 of performing at least some of the concepts described herein in the various figures. Many elements of themethod 900 can be implemented by the system shown in at leastFIG. 8 . In particular, themethod 900 can be performed by a browser, (e.g., browser manager 820) of acomputing system 802. Theexample method 900 is an example of triggering display of the search result area (search result area 130) in response to interaction with a search result included in content of a search result page. Atstep 902, the system may cause display of a search result page within a display area of a browser. The search result page includes search results (i.e., a first search result, a second search result, etc.) that are responsive to a query. The search result page is generated by a search engine in response to the query and returned to the browser that initiated the search request. Atstep 904, the system may receive a selection of the first search result (e.g., search result SR1 inFIG. 1A and others). Because a search result includes a link to its respective resource, the search result is selectable, or in other words an actionable element. - In response to selection of the first search result (step 906), the system may, at
step 908, cause display of a webpage (or other resource) identified by the first search result. The resource identified by the search result, e.g., as the target of the link of the search result, is referred to as the search result target. The system causes display of the webpage in a display area of the browser. In addition to causing display of the webpage in the display area, atstep 910 the system causes display of a first search result indicator and a second search result indicator in a search result area of the browser. The search result area is displayed concurrently with the display area. In other words, the content of the search result area (e.g., the first search result indicator and the second search result indicator) is visible with the content of the display area (e.g., the content of the webpage). The search result indicators each correspond to a respective search result in the search result page. In other words, the first search result indicator corresponds to the first search result, the second search result indicator corresponds to the second search result, etc. The correspondence means that selection of the first search result indicator causes display of the same resource (e.g., webpage) that selection of the first result causes. - At
step 912, the system may receive a selection of the second search request indicator. In response to the selection of the second search request indicator, atstep 914, the system causes display of the webpage identified by (corresponding to) the second search result identifier in the display area. The display of the webpage corresponding to the second search result identifier occurs without navigating away from thesearch result area 130. Thus, the user is able to navigate through the search results (represented by the search result indicators) more efficiently (with fewer interactions with the browser) and with fewer rendering tasks performed by the browser (e.g., because the search results do not need to be re-rendered to select a different search result target). -
FIG. 10 is a flowchart that illustrates an example method 1000 of performing at least some of the concepts described herein in the various figures. Many elements of the method 1000 can be implemented by the system shown in at leastFIG. 8 . In particular, the method 1000 can be performed by a browser, (e.g., browser manager 820) of acomputing system 802. The example method 1000 is an example of triggering display of the search result area (search result area 130) in response to interaction with a search result target. Atstep 1002, the system may cause display of a search result page within a display area of a browser. The search result page includes search results (i.e., a first search result, a second search result, etc.) that are responsive to a query. The search result page is generated by a search engine in response to the query and returned to the browser that initiated the search request. Atstep 1004, the system may receive a selection of the first search result (e.g., search result SRI inFIG. 7A and others). Because a search result includes a link to its respective resource (it's target), the search result is selectable, or in other words an actionable element. In response to selection of the first search result, atstep 1006 the system causes display of the resource (e.g., webpage) identified by the first search result (i.e., the target resource) within the display area of the browser. - The system may receive an interaction with the display of the resource. In some implementations, the interaction can be selection of a back control. The back control is a control configured to, when interacted with (e.g., when selected), cause the browser to render content for a resource that was displayed immediately prior to the current resource. In the example of method 1000, this is the search result page that includes the first search result and the second search result. Some implementations may determine that the prior resource is a search result page (i.e., the back control target is a search result page) and change the default behavior. For example, when the back control target is a search result page, instead of re-rendering the search result page in the display area, the system may instead trigger display of the search result area. The search result area includes search result indicators corresponding to search results of the back control target (i.e., the search result page). In some implementations, the search result page is cached. In some implementations, the search result page is re-fetched (re-requested) from the search server. In some implementations, the interaction can be identification of a scroll pattern that triggers display of the search result area. Scroll patterns are discussed in more detail with respect to
FIGS. 3A to 3C . - In response to the interaction (step 1008), trigger display of the search result display area. Triggering display of the search result display area in response to interaction with the webpage can include, at
step 1010, decreasing a size of the display area of the browser. This reduction in size makes room for the search result area. As discussed above, in some implementations, the reduction in size may make less content of the webpage visible. In some implementations, the reduction in size may cause the content of the webpage to be resized, or in other words the content of the webpage can also be resized. Atstep 1012, the system may cause display of the search result area, which includes a first search result indicator and a second search result indicator. The first search result indicator corresponds to the first search result (e.g., that was displayed as part of the search result page. The second search result indicator corresponds to the second search result. The search result area is displayed within the browser but outside of the display area. - At
step 1014, the system may receive a selection of the second search request indicator. In response to the selection of the second search request indicator, atstep 1016, the system causes display of the webpage identified by (corresponding to) the second search result identifier in the display area. The display of the webpage corresponding to the second search result identifier occurs without navigating away from the search result area. Thus, the user is able to navigate through the search results (represented by the search result indicators) more efficiently (with fewer interactions with the browser) and with fewer rendering tasks performed by the browser (e.g., because the search results do not need to be re-rendered to select a different search result target). In some implementations, the search result area can be removed in response to an express action to close the search result area (e.g., selection of actionable control 131), in response to selection of a link in the display area that causes the browser to navigate to (display) another resource in the display area etc. -

The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be examples only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the implementations described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 2000 includes aprocessor 2002,memory 2004, astorage device 2006, a high-speed controller 2008 connecting tomemory 2004 and high-speed expansion ports 2010, and a low-speed controller 2012 connecting to lowspeed expansion port 2014 andstorage device 2006. Theprocessor 2002 can be a semiconductor-based processor. Thememory 2004 can be a semiconductor-based memory. Each of thecomponents processor 2002 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 2000, including instructions stored in thememory 2004 or on thestorage device 2006 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 2016 coupled to high-speed controller 2008. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 2000 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 2004 stores information within thecomputing device 2000. In one implementation, thememory 2004 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 2004 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 2004 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk. - The
storage device 2006 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 2000. In one implementation, thestorage device 2006 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 2004, thestorage device 2006, or memory onprocessor 2002. - The high-
speed controller 2008 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 2000, while the low-speed controller 2012 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is an example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 2008 is coupled tomemory 2004, display 2016 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 2010, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 2012 is coupled tostorage device 2006 and lowspeed expansion port 2014. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The
computing device 2000 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as astandard server 2020, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 2024. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 2022. Alternatively, components fromcomputing device 2000 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 2050. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device multiple computing devices -
Computing device 2050 includes aprocessor 2052,memory 2064, an input/output device such as adisplay 2054, acommunication interface 2066, and atransceiver 2068, among other components. Thedevice 2050 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 2052 can execute instructions within thecomputing device 2050, including instructions stored in thememory 2064. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 2050, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 2050, and wireless communication bydevice 2050. -
Processor 2052 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 2058 anddisplay interface 2056 coupled to adisplay 2054. Thedisplay 2054 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 2056 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 2054 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 2058 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 2052. In addition, anexternal interface 2062 may be provide in communication withprocessor 2052, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 2050 with other devices.External interface 2062 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used. - The
memory 2064 stores information within thecomputing device 2050. Thememory 2064 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 2074 may also be provided and connected todevice 2050 throughexpansion interface 2072, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 2074 may provide extra storage space fordevice 2050, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 2050. Specifically,expansion memory 2074 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 2074 may be provided as a security module fordevice 2050, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 2050. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above.
