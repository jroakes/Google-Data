- the prompt component 406 provides a user the set of DRM options (e.g., determined using the options component 402 ), information associated with respective DRM options (e.g., determined using the data component 404 ), and prompts the user to select zero or more of the DRM options.
- the information associated with a first DRM option can indicate that a first supported DRM solution transmits a unique identifier associated with the user and/or client device to a DRM server (e.g., privacy policy), requires root access (e.g., set of permissions required), and will enable access for a first subset of content (e.g., content limitations).
- the activation component 408 installs, executes, or otherwise employs DRM options selected by the user (e.g., using the prompt component 406 ). For instance, the activation component 408 can enable a first DRM option selected by the user and/or disable a set of DRM options not selected by the user. In addition, the activation component 408 can inform the content source of the user selections. For instance, the activation component 408 can communicate the zero or more DRM options selected by the user (e.g., via an active DRM message) to the content source. It is to be appreciated that although the options component 402 , data component 404 , prompt component 406 , and activation component 408 are illustrated as being included in the DRM options component 304 , such implementation is not so limited.

Abstract
Description
- This disclosure generally relates to systems and methods that facilitate enhanced user control for content protection solutions.
- The Internet and media enabled portable computing devices have dramatically altered the processes for generating and consuming media content. Presently, users can consume media content virtually anywhere at any time, as long as they have access for a media capable device with an Internet connection. The convenience of being able to view media content via the Internet, essentially on demand, has resulted in explosive growth of Internet media consumption. Internet media traffic is currently approaching a majority of consumer Internet traffic, and the rate of demand is projected to continue increasing.
- The explosive growth of Internet media traffic is at least partially attributable to the inherent portability of digital media content, and simplicity of accurate reproduction. However, these characteristics also make protecting the rights of digital media content owners challenging. Millions of people around the world have the capability to consume and produce digital media content, and popular online services can receive tens of hours worth of newly uploaded content every minute.
- A technique that been commonly employed by online services to protect media content is requiring consumers to employ a content protection or digital rights management solution that controls consumption and/or usage of the media content. However, content protection and/or digital rights management solutions can have far reaching permissions, and impact portions of a computing system that the user may not expect or understand. Typically, users have little knowledge or control over the invasiveness of a content protection or digital rights management solution required by a content provider.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate any scope of particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
- According to an aspect of the subject innovation, systems and methods for enhanced user control for content protection solutions are disclosed. An options component determines or infers a set of digital rights management solutions supported by a content source (supported digital right management solutions), and a data component determines or infers information associated with respective supported digital rights management solutions. The set of digital rights management solutions can further be those supported by a client device. A prompt component provides a user a set of digital rights management options based at least in part on the set of digital rights management solutions supported by a content source and the information, and enables the user to select zero or more of the digital rights management options. The content source can enable access for a subset of associated content based at least in part one the selections of the user.
- The following description and the annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

FIG. 9 is a block diagram representing an exemplary non-limiting networked environment in which the various embodiments can be implemented; and -
FIG. 10 is a block diagram representing an exemplary non-limiting computing system or operating environment in which the various embodiments may be implemented. - The innovation is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this innovation. It may be evident, however, that the innovation can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the innovation.
- It is to be appreciated that in accordance with one or more implementations described in this disclosure, users can opt-in or opt-out of providing personal information, demographic information, location information, proprietary information, sensitive information, or the like in connection with data gathering aspects. Moreover, one or more implementations described herein can provide for anonymizing collected, received, or transmitted data.
- Online services often require consumers to employ a content protection or digital rights management (DRM) solution in order to control consumption and/or usage of media content. In one example, a client device can include one or more DRM solutions which can be available, for example, to a browser (or other client software) of the client device. The DRM solutions can be, for example, pre-installed with an operating system of the client device, installed as part of the browser (or other client software), or otherwise obtained. In such a scenario, a user may not be aware that the DRM solutions are installed on the client device and/or may not be aware how installation of the DRM solutions on the client device affect the client device and/or user experience.
- To that end, techniques for enhancing user control for content protection solutions are presented. For example, information associated with different content protection solutions (e.g., type(s) of media content and/or catalog(s) of media content available to a user for each content protection solution, etc.) can be provided to a user. As such, a user can select a particular content protection solution based at least in part on the information associated with the different protection solutions. One non-limiting implementation of this disclosure provides for accurate and efficient enhanced user control for content protection solutions. More particularly, in accordance with an embodiment, an options component determines or infers a set of digital rights management solutions supported by a content source, a data component determines or infers information associated with respective digital rights management solutions included in the set of digital rights management solutions supported by the content source, and a prompt component provides to a user, based at least in part on the set of digital rights management solutions, a set of digital rights management options and the associated information, and enables the user to select zero or more of the digital rights management options.
- Turning now to
FIG. 1 , illustrated is anexample system 100 for enhanced user control for content protection solutions in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure.System 100 includes acontent source 102. The content source 102 (e.g., content provider, server, website, etc.) publishes, streams, or otherwise provides media content (content) to client devices (e.g., client device 106). For example, in one implementation, thecontent source 102 streams content included in a set ofcontent 104 to a client device (e.g., user device) 106, e.g., using a network connection. The set ofcontent 104 can include but is not limited to videos, music, electronic books (e-books), video games, websites, and/or articles. In addition, respective content in the set ofcontent 104 may be characterized based in part on ownership rights of the content. For instance, the characterizations can include but are not limited to open content 108 (e.g., user-generated content, license free content, etc.), and/or restricted content 110 (e.g., copyright protected content, etc.). It is to be appreciated that although the set ofcontent 104 is illustrated as being included in thecontent source 102 such implementation is not so limited. For example, the set ofcontent 104 can be included in a different location, and thecontent source 102 can access the set ofcontent 104, e.g., using a network connection. - The
content source 102 controls, restricts, or otherwise manages access by users (e.g., user 118) to content included in the set ofcontent 104 based in part on a set of digital rights management (DRM) solutions employed by aclient device 106 and/or amedia component 120. For example, in one implementation, thecontent source 102 accepts or supports a set of DRM solutions 112 (supported DRM solutions) (e.g.,DRM 112A-C), and enables access for subsets of thecontent 104 for respective supportedDRM solutions 112. For instance, thecontent source 102 can enable access for a first subset of the restrictedcontent 110, where afirst DRM solution 112A is employed by theclient device 106 and/ormedia component 120, and thecontent source 102 can enable access for a second subset of the restrictedcontent 110, where asecond DRM solution 112B is employed. - The
DRM solutions 112 control reproduction and/or use (e.g., viewing, copying, sharing, printing, modifying, etc.) of associated content. For example, in one implementation, thecontent source 102 provides respective content in the set of restrictedcontent 110 to theuser 118 as a set of encrypted data (file, etc.), and thefirst DRM solution 112A provides theuser 118 and/or content source 102 a key for decrypting the set of encrypted data. Aspects of the invention are not limited to a quantity of DRM solutions supported by thecontent source 102, and/or employed by theclient device 106 and/ormedia component 120. For example, X DRM solutions can be supported and/or employed, where X is a positive integer. In addition, it is to be appreciated that although theDRM solutions 112 are illustrated as stand-alone components, such implementation is not so limited. For example, theDRM solutions 112 can be included in thecontent source 102, theclient device 106, and/or in another location where thecontent source 102 and/orclient device 106 can communicate with the DRM, e.g., using a network connection. - The
client device 106 can include but is not limited to a smart phone, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, a portable music player, a video game system, an electronic reader (e-reader), a global positioning system (GPS), a set-top box, and/or a television. Theclient device 106 includes amedia component 120. Themedia component 120 provides for display, presentation, or what is referred to for the purposes of this disclosure as playback or play of media content via theclient device 106. Themedia component 120 can include but is not limited to an Internet browser (browser), a media player, an operating system, and/or an application (app). For example, in one implementation, themedia component 120 receives encrypted content (e.g., restricted content 110) streamed from thecontent source 102, and receives a key associated with the encrypted content from aDRM 112 and/or thecontent source 102. Themedia component 120 decrypts and/or decodes the encrypted content using the associated key with theDRM 112, and plays the decrypted (and/or possibly decoded) content via theclient device 106. - A set of DRM options are presented to the
user 118 based in part on the set of supportedDRM solutions 112. For example, in one embodiment, if acontent source 102 requires use of a supportedDRM solution 112, themedia component 120 provides the client device 106 a set of DRM options based in part on the set of supportedDRM solutions 112, and a set of information related to the respective DRM options. As an additional or alternative example, in one embodiment, themedia component 120 provides the user 118 a set of DRM options based on a subset of the supported DRM solutions 112 (e.g., supported DRM options) that are allowed by theclient device 106 and/ormedia component 120. For instance, theuser 118 may set, select, or otherwise predetermine a set of DRM solutions (e.g., default DRM solutions) that are allowed by the client device 106 (allowed DRM solutions). Providing theuser 118 the set of DRM options and related information can include but is not limited to prompting the user to select zero or more of the supportedDRM solutions 112, and/or a subset of features (e.g., levels, etc.) associated with respective supportedDRM solutions 112. The information related to respective DRM solutions can include but is not limited to an invasiveness measurement, a set of security policies and/or implications, a set of privacy policies, a set of limitations (content qualities, etc.), a set of compatibility data, and/or a set of permissions required for respective supported DRM solutions. It is to be appreciated that although themedia component 120 is illustrated as being included in theclient device 106; such implementation is not so limited. For instance, themedia component 120 can be included in thecontent source 102, a cloud server, and/or can be a stand-alone component that theclient device 106 can access, e.g., using a network connection. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a non-limiting implementation of asystem 200 with anexample content source 102 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Generally, thecontent source 102 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference toFIG. 10 . As discussed, thecontent source 102 provides media content (content) to client devices (e.g., client device 106). For example, in one implementation, thecontent source 102 streams content included in a set ofcontent 104 to aclient device 106. Thecontent source 102 manages access for thecontent 104 based in part on a set of digital rights management (DRM) solutions employed by amedia component 120 associated with theclient device 106. For example, in one implementation, the set ofcontent 104 can include content characterized asopen content 108, and/or restrictedcontent 110. Thecontent source 102 enables access for respective content characterized as restrictedcontent 110 based in part on a corresponding DRM solution being employed by themedia component 120. Thecontent source 102 inFIG. 2 includes asupport component 202, averification component 204, and alibrary component 206. - The
support component 202 notifies or informs media players (e.g., media component 120) of a set of DRM solutions 112 (e.g.,DRM 112A-112C) supported (supported DRM solutions) by thecontent source 102, and/or a set of access rights corresponding to respective supportedDRM solutions 112. For example, in one implementation, thesupport component 202 can initiate communication of a list of supported DRM solutions (e.g.,DRM 112A-C) 120 and associated access rights to themedia component 120, when themedia component 120 accesses or connects with thecontent source 102 and/or content included in the set ofcontent 104. The access rights can include but are not limited to content limitations, quality limitations, (e.g., high definition, standard definition, etc.), and/or device limitations. The content limitations specify, identify, or otherwise indicate subsets of thecontent 104 that thecontent source 102 enables access for based in part on theDRM solutions 112 employed by themedia component 120. The quality limitations indicate qualities (e.g., standard definition (SD), high definition (HD), 3-Dimensional (3D), higher frame rate, etc.) of thecontent 104 for which thecontent source 102 enables access, based in part on theDRM solutions 112 employed by themedia component 120. The device limitations indicate devices (e.g., mobile phone A, etc.) and/or a set of predetermined device types (e.g., laptop, desktop, etc.) for which thecontent source 102 enables access based in part on theDRM solutions 112 employed by themedia component 120. Additionally or alternatively, thesupport component 202 compares a set of supported DRM solutions against a set of DRM solutions allowed (e.g., installed, supported, selected, configured, etc.) by theclient device 106 and/or media component 120 (allowed DRM solutions, default DRM solutions, or preset DRM solutions). - As discussed, the
user 118 can select a supportedDRM solution 112 and/or a subset of features associated with a supportedDRM solution 112 for employment by theclient device 106 and/ormedia component 120. For instance, theuser 118 may select a first supportedDRM solution 112A, because thecontent source 102, in response to selection of the first supportedDRM solution 112A, enables access for a subset of the restrictedcontent 110 that theuser 118 desires to consume. Additionally or alternatively, theuser 118 may predetermine a set of DRM solutions 112 (e.g., a set of default DRM solutions 112) allowed for theclient device 106 and/or media component 120 (allowed DRM solutions 112), and thesupport component 202 can select one or more of the allowed DRM solutions 112 (e.g., select from the predetermined set ofDRM solutions 112 chosen by the user 118) for provisioning ofcontent 104 based in part on a set of selection criteria. The selection criteria can include but is not limited to a ranking, a hierarchy, and/or correspondence to a supportedDRM solution 112. Theverification component 204 confirms, validates, or otherwise verifies that a supportedDRM solution 112 is active or employed on theclient device 106. For example, in one implementation, theverification component 204 can acquire, obtain, or otherwise receive an active DRM verifier (e.g., indicator, etc.) from theclient device 106 and/or corresponding supportedDRM solution 112. - The
library component 206 provides, allows, or otherwise enables, based in part on supportedDRM solutions 112 employed by themedia component 120, access for subsets of thecontent 104. For instance, where a first supportedDRM solution 112A is employed, thelibrary component 206 can enable access for a first subset of the restrictedcontent 110. As an additional or alternative example, where a second supportedDRM solution 112B is employed, thelibrary component 206 can enable access for a first quality (e.g., 1080p) of the restrictedcontent 110. As yet another example, where a third supportedDRM solution 112C is employed, thelibrary component 206 can enable access for the set of restrictedcontent 110 for one or more predetermined device types. It is to be appreciated that although the set ofcontent 104 is illustrated as being included in adata store 220 such implementation is not so limited. For example, the set ofcontent 104 can be included in thecontent source 102, and/or different locations where thecontent source 102 can access the set ofcontent 104, e.g., using a network connection. -
FIG. 3 illustrates a non-limiting implementation of asystem 300 with anexample media component 120 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Generally, themedia component 120 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference toFIG. 10 . As discussed, themedia component 120 provides for playback or play of media content via aclient device 106. Themedia component 120 can include but is not limited to an Internet browser (browser), a media player, an operating system, and/or an application (app). For example, in one implementation, themedia component 120 receives encrypted content (e.g., restricted content 110) streamed from thecontent source 102, and receives a key from a corresponding supportedDRM solution 112 and/or thecontent source 102. Themedia component 120 decodes the encrypted content using the key, and plays the decrypted content via theclient device 106. Themedia component 120 provides the user 118 a set of DRM options based in part on a set of supportedDRM solutions 112, a set of allowedDRM solutions 112, and/or a set of information related torespective DRM solutions 112. Themedia component 120 inFIG. 3 includes aninput component 302, a digital rights management options component 304 (DRM options component 304), aplayback component 306, and aninterface component 308. - The
input component 302 obtains, acquires, or otherwise receives input from auser 118. The inputs can include explicit user inputs (e.g., configuration selections, question/answer, etc.) such as from mouse selections, keyboard entries, touch screen selections, and/or speech. For example, in one implementation, theinput component 302 detects keyboard and/or mouse commands entered by theuser 118, via theclient device 106, in response to a DRM selection prompt (discussed in greater detail with reference toFIG. 6 ). For instance, the inputs can instruct themedia component 120 to activate or employ a supportedDRM solution 112. As an additional or alternative example, theuser 118 can select a set or predetermine (e.g., via a preferences menu or control panel) a set of DRM solutions 112 (e.g., a set of default DRM solutions 112) to be allowed and/or employed by theclient device 106 and/or media component 120 (allowed DRM solutions) via theinput component 302. For instance, theuser 118 can set the DRM solutions (e.g., the default DRM solutions) as preferences. Furthermore, theuser 118 can be provided with, for example, a description of one or more outcomes associated with a particular DRM option via theDRM options component 304. - The
DRM options component 304 provides theuser 118 information associated with respective DRM options, and prompts theuser 118 to select zero or more of the DRM options (discussed in greater detail with reference toFIG. 4 ). For example, in one implementation, the DRM options include subsets of features associated with supportedDRM solutions 112. For instance, a first subset of features can be determined based on a set of user preferences and/orclient device 106 settings. The information can include but is not limited to an invasiveness measurement, a set of security policies and/or implications, a set of privacy policies, a set of limitations (e.g., content limitations, quality limitations, and/or device limitations), a set of compatibility data, and/or a set of permissions required for respective supported DRM solutions (e.g., root access, etc.). The invasiveness measurement can include but is not limited to a grade, a rank, and/or a numerical score of the invasiveness of a DRM solution. The set of privacy policies can include but are not limited to policies associated with a DRM solution regarding user and/or client device information (e.g., account, unique identifier, etc.) sharing and/or transmission. The set of compatibility data can include but is not limited to data regarding compatibility of respective DRM solutions with other content sources, and/or compatibility of respective DRM solutions with theclient device 106. The information associated with respective DRM options can be based on data obtained from a server (e.g.,content source 102 or content provider) and/or determined by the client device and/ormedia component 120. - The
playback component 306 provides for playback of enabled content via theclient device 106. The enabled content can include but is not limited to content included in the set ofcontent 104 that the content source has enabled access based on the set of DRM solutions employed by themedia component 120. For example, in one implementation, theuser 118 can select an Internet video included in a set of enabled content to stream (e.g., using the input component 302), and theplayback component 306 provides for displaying the streaming Internet video to theclient device 106. Aspects of the invention are not limited to a particular display of the content, and the display can be adapted based on theclient device 106 and/or content. As discussed, themedia component 120 can decode encrypted restrictedcontent 110 using a key provided from an associatedDRM solution 112 and/or thecontent source 102. - The
interface component 308 includes any suitable and/or necessary adapters, connectors, channels, communication paths, etc. to enable themedia component 120 to communicate with any suitable operating, search, data feed, and/or database system(s). Moreover, theinterface component 308 provides various adapters, connectors, channels, communication paths, etc., that provide for interaction with themedia component 120. For example, theinterface component 308 can facilitate communication with thecontent source 102 and/or the supportedDRM solutions 112. - Turning now to
FIG. 4 , illustrated is an example digital rights management component (DRM options component 304) in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. As discussed, theDRM options component 304 provides a user (e.g., user 118) information associated with respective DRM options, and prompts the user to select zero or more of the DRM options. TheDRM options component 304 inFIG. 4 includes anoptions component 402, adata component 404, aprompt component 406, and anactivation component 408. Theoptions component 402 determines or infers a set of DRM solutions (e.g., DRM solutions 112) supported by a content source. For example, in one implementation, theoptions component 402 obtains, acquires, or otherwise receives a set or list of supported DRM solutions (e.g., from the content source). As an additional or alternative example, theoptions component 402 determines or infers a set of supported DRM solutions based on a set of support criteria. The set of support criteria can include but is not limited to a format of media content associated with the content source (content format), a type of encryption employed for content associated with the content source (encryption type), and/or an identity of the content source. For instance, theoptions component 402 can inspect content associated with the content source, determine an encryption type for the content, and based on the encryption type determine a set of supported DRM solutions. - The
data component 404 determines or infers information associated with respective supported DRM solutions. The information can include but is not limited to an invasiveness measurement, a set of security policies and/or implications, a set of privacy policies, a set of limitations, a set of compatibility data, and/or a set of permissions required for respective supported DRM solutions. For example, in one implementation, thedata component 404 receives the information associated with a supported DRM solution from a content source and/or the supported DRM solution. As an additional or alternative example, in one implementation, thedata component 404 determines or infers the information based on a set of information criteria. The set of information criteria can include but is not limited to an identity of a DRM, a DRM type, files associated with a DRM, and/or execution of the DRM on the client device. For example, in one implementation, thedata component 404 can determine information associated with a supported DRM solution based on a set of installation or executable files associated with the DRM. For instance, thedata component 404 can determine that the supported DRM solution requires root access (e.g., set of permissions required) based on a set of executable files associated with the DRM. In one example, thedata component 404 can determine one or more permissions required by a set of sandbox permissions and/or a set of application programming interfaces (APIs). For example, thedata component 404 can determine a supported DRM solution (and/or an allowed DRM solution) by examining and/or acquiring information (e.g., data) from a set of sandbox permissions and/or a set of APIs. - The
prompt component 406 provides a user the set of DRM options (e.g., determined using the options component 402), information associated with respective DRM options (e.g., determined using the data component 404), and prompts the user to select zero or more of the DRM options. For instance, the information associated with a first DRM option can indicate that a first supported DRM solution transmits a unique identifier associated with the user and/or client device to a DRM server (e.g., privacy policy), requires root access (e.g., set of permissions required), and will enable access for a first subset of content (e.g., content limitations). - The
activation component 408 installs, executes, or otherwise employs DRM options selected by the user (e.g., using the prompt component 406). For instance, theactivation component 408 can enable a first DRM option selected by the user and/or disable a set of DRM options not selected by the user. In addition, theactivation component 408 can inform the content source of the user selections. For instance, theactivation component 408 can communicate the zero or more DRM options selected by the user (e.g., via an active DRM message) to the content source. It is to be appreciated that although theoptions component 402,data component 404,prompt component 406, andactivation component 408 are illustrated as being included in theDRM options component 304, such implementation is not so limited. For example, theoptions component 402,data component 404,prompt component 406, and/oractivation component 408 can be maintained in a different location, and theDRM options component 304 can access theoptions component 402,data component 404,prompt component 406, and/oractivation component 408, e.g., using a network connection. -
FIG. 5 illustrates anexample system 500 that employs anintelligence component 502 that facilitates enhanced user control for content protection solutions in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. For example, all or portions of theoptions component 402,data component 404,prompt component 406, and/oractivation component 408 are operatively coupled tointelligence component 502. Additionally or alternatively, all or portions ofintelligence component 502 may be included in one or more components described in this disclosure. Theintelligence component 502 can provide for or aid in various inferences or determinations. For example, in one implementation, theintelligence component 502 facilitates inferring supported DRM solutions for a content source and/or information associated with respective supported DRM solutions. As discussed, thedata component 404 determines or infers sets of data or information associated with respective DRM solutions based on a set of information criteria. Theintelligence component 502 can infer or determine additional information criteria. - Accordingly, in order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described in this disclosure,
intelligence component 502 examines the entirety or a subset of the data available and provides for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, client, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. - Such inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines . . . ) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
- A classifier can be a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, X2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used in this disclosure also is inclusive of statistical regression that is used to develop models of priority.
- Referring to
FIG. 6 , illustrated is asystem 600 that provides a non-limiting example of auser interface 602 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Theinterface 602 can include a media player 605 (e.g., media component 120) included in anInternet browser 604. Themedia player 605 includes a set of digital rights management (DRM) options 606. As discussed, the DRM options can include supported DRM solutions (e.g.,DRM options 606A-C), and/or a subset of features associated with supported DRM options (e.g.,DRM options 606D-E). For example, the set of DRM options 606 can be obtained, acquired, or otherwise received from a content source (e.g., using the options component 402) and/or determined by the media player 605 (e.g., media component 120). As an additional or alternative example, the set of DRM options 606 are determined or inferred based on a set of support criteria (e.g., using the options component 402). The set of support criteria can include but is not limited to a content format, an encryption type, and/or an identity of the content source. - The
media player 605 also includes sets of information 608 (e.g. 608A-C) associated with respective DRM options 606. The sets of information 608 can include but are not limited to an invasiveness measurement, a set of security policies and/or implications, a set of privacy policies, a set of limitations, a set of compatibility data, and/or a set of permissions required for respective DRM options 606. The sets of information 608 are obtained, acquired, or otherwise received from the content source supported DRM solutions, and/ormedia player 605. As an additional or alternative example, in one implementation, the sets of information 608 are determined or inferred based on a set of information criteria. The set of information criteria can include but is not limited to an identity of a DRM, a DRM type, files associated with a DRM, and/or execution of the DRM on theclient device 106. - A user (e.g., user 118) can choose, activate, or otherwise select zero or more of the DRM options 606. For instance, the user may select a
second DRM option 606B, because the user desires to consume restricted content, but does not desire to employ a DRM solution that requires root access (e.g., DRM solution A). The user may also select afifth DRM option 606E, because the fifth DRM option enables access for HD content for a subset of content associated with the content source (e.g.,information 608E), but does not require root access. Themedia player 605 also includes aselect button 610 that will implement the user selections, and a cancelbutton 612 that will activate none of the DRM options 606. For instance, upon viewing the information 608 associated with the respective supported DRM options 606, the user can select not to select a DRM solution and/or consume content from the content source using the cancelbutton 612. It is to be appreciated that aspects of the innovation are not limited to an implementation or display of themedia player 605. For example, themedia player 605 can be included in or associated with a stand-alone media player, and/or an application. In addition, the display can be adapted based on a device and/or themedia player 605. -
FIGS. 7-9 illustrate various methodologies in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, the disclosed subject matter is not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. Additionally, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies disclosed in this disclosure are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers or other computing devices. - Referring now to
FIG. 7 , illustrated is anexample methodology 700 for enhanced user control for content protection solutions in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Atreference numeral 702, a media player determines, is provided, or is otherwise notified of a set of supported digital rights management (DRM) solutions (e.g., using the support component 202). For example, in one implementation, the media player can be provided with (or otherwise notified of) a set or list of supported DRM solutions supported by a content source. The set or list of supported DRM solutions can be obtained, acquired, or otherwise received from the content source. In one example, the set or list of supported DRM solutions can be determined or inferred based on a set of support criteria. The set of support criteria can include, but is not limited to, a content format, an encryption type, a configuration of theclient device 106, and/or an identity of the content source. Atreference numeral 704, a set of access rights corresponding to the respective supported DRM solutions are provided to the media player (e.g., using the support component 202). The access rights can include but are not limited to content limitations, quality limitations, and/or device limitations. The content limitations specify, identify, or otherwise indicate subsets of the content associated with a content source for which the content source enables access based in part on employment of respective DRM solutions. The quality limitations indicate content qualities (e.g., standard definition (SD), high definition (HD), etc.) for which the content source enables access based in part on employment of respective DRM solutions. The device limitations indicate devices (e.g., mobile phone A, etc.) and/or a set of predetermined device types (e.g., laptop, desktop, etc.) for which the content source enables access based in part on employment of respective DRM solutions. - At
reference numeral 706, zero or more selections of DRM options based on the supported DRM solutions are obtained, acquired, or otherwise received by the content source (e.g., using the verification component 204). For example, in one implementation, an active DRM indicator is received from a media player and/or a supported DRM solution. Atreference numeral 708, access for a subset of content associated with the content source is enabled (e.g., using the library component 206). For instance, access for a first subset of restricted content can be enabled, where the media player employs and/or a user selects a first supported DRM solution. As an additional or alternative example, access for a first quality of content (e.g., high definition, etc.) can be enabled, where the media player employs and/or a user selects a second supported DRM solution. As yet another example, access for a set of content for one or more predetermined device types can be enabled, where the media player employs and/or a user selects a third DRM solution. -
FIG. 8 illustrates anexample methodology 800 for enhanced user control for content protection solutions in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Atreference numeral 802, a set of DRM solutions supported by a content source (supported DRM solutions) are determined or inferred (e.g., using the options component 402). For example, in one implementation, a set or list of supported DRM solutions supported by the content source are obtained, acquired, or otherwise received from the content source. As an additional or alternative example, a set of supported DRM solutions are determined or inferred based on a set of support criteria. The set of support criteria can include but is not limited to a content format, an encryption type, a configuration of theclient device 106, and/or an identity of the content source. - At
reference numeral 804, information associated with the respective supported DRM options is determined or inferred (e.g., using the data component 404). The information can include but is not limited to a set of security policies and/or implications, a set of privacy policies, a set of limitations, a set of compatibility data, and/or a set of permissions required for respective supported DRM solutions. For example, in one implementation, information associated with respective supported DRM solutions is received from the content source. As an additional or alternative example, in one implementation, the data component determines or infers the sets of data or information based on a set of data criteria. The set of data criteria can include but is not limited to an identity of a DRM solution, a DRM solution type, files associated with a DRM solution, and/or execution of the DRM solution on the client device. For example, in one implementation, thedata component 404 can determine the information based on a set of installation files associated with a DRM solution. - At
reference numeral 806, a user is provided a set of DRM options based on the set of supported DRM solutions, and information associated with the respective supported DRM options (e.g., using the prompt component 406). The set of DRM options can include but is not limited to employing a supported DRM solution, and/or employing a subset of features associated with a supported DRM solution. For instance, a first supported DRM solution may have a set of X DRM features (or levels) that provide different levels of access for content provided by a content source, where X is a positive integer. Atreference numeral 808, the user is prompted to select zero or more of the DRM options (e.g., using the prompt component 406). - At
reference numeral 810, DRM options selected by the user are employed to facilitate consumption of media content from the content source (e.g., using the activation component 408). For instance, a first DRM option selected by the user can be employed and/or a set of DRM options not selected by the user can be disabled. In addition, the content source can be informed of the DRM options selected by the user. For instance, the zero or more DRM options selected by the user can be communicated to the content source. - One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the various embodiments described herein can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment, and can be connected to any kind of data store where media may be found.

The distributed computing environment comprises computing objects 910, 912, etc. and computing objects ordevices applications devices applications support component 202,verification component 204,library component 206, and/ormedia component 120. - Each
computing object devices devices communications network 940, either directly or indirectly. Even though illustrated as a single element inFIG. 9 ,network 940 may comprise other computing objects and computing devices that provide services to the system ofFIG. 9 , and/or may represent multiple interconnected networks, which are not shown. Eachcomputing object devices applications - There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems can be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks, though any network infrastructure can be used for exemplary communications made incident to the systems as described in various embodiments.
- Thus, a host of network topologies and network infrastructures, such as client/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures, can be employed. The “client” is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. A client can be a process, e.g., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program or process. The client may be or use a process that utilizes the requested service without having to “know” any working details about the other program or the service itself.
- In a client/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the illustration of
FIG. 9 , as a non-limiting example, computing objects ordevices objects devices devices - A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet or wireless network infrastructures. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server.
- In a network environment in which the communications network/
bus 940 is the Internet, for example, the computing objects 910, 912, etc. can be Web servers with which the client computing objects ordevices Objects devices - As mentioned, advantageously, the techniques described herein can be applied to any device suitable for implementing various embodiments described herein.

- The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, this matter disclosed herein is not limited by such examples. In addition, any aspect or design described herein as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs, nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms “includes,” “has,” “contains,” and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, for the avoidance of doubt, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprising” as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements. As used in this application, the term “or” is intended to mean an inclusive “or” rather than an exclusive “or”. That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, “X employs A or B” is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then “X employs A or B” is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. In addition, the articles “a” and “an” as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean “one or more” unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.
- Computing devices typically include a variety of media, which can include computer-readable storage media. Computer-readable storage media can be any available storage media that can be accessed by the computer, is typically of a non-transitory nature, and can include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable storage media can be implemented in connection with any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, program modules, structured data, or unstructured data. Computer-readable storage media can include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or other tangible and/or non-transitory media which can be used to store desired information. Computer-readable storage media can be accessed by one or more local or remote computing devices, e.g., via access requests, queries or other data retrieval protocols, for a variety of operations with respect to the information stored by the medium.
- As mentioned, the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. As used herein, the terms “component,” “system” and the like are likewise intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on computer and the computer can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Further, a component can come in the form of specially designed hardware; generalized hardware made specialized by the execution of software thereon that enables the hardware to perform specific function (e.g., coding and/or decoding); software stored on a computer readable medium; or a combination thereof.
- The aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components. It can be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and according to various permutations and combinations of the foregoing. Sub-components can also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components (hierarchical). Additionally, it is to be noted that one or more components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality or divided into several separate sub-components, and that any one or more middle layers, such as a management layer, may be provided to communicatively couple to such sub-components in order to provide integrated functionality. Any components described herein may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein but generally known by those of skill in the art.
- In addition to the various embodiments described herein, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments can be used or modifications and additions can be made to the described embodiment(s) for performing the same or equivalent function of the corresponding embodiment(s) without deviating there from. Still further, multiple processing chips or multiple devices can share the performance of one or more functions described herein, and similarly, storage can be effected across a plurality of devices.
