Embodiment
This disclosed system and method can move and come based on for example the analysis of search log being discerned inadequate content distributed (for example, based on web issue).Can analyze search inquiry from search log to find the relation between the search inquiry.For example, relevant search inquiry can be with such as the relevant kind (species) of the genus (genus) of theme.Search inquiry is associated as can promote relevant with theme discerns topic corpus based on the Query Result of relevant search inquiry.To the analysis of topic corpus for example can promote to the identification of theme associated content quality.Also can analyze search inquiry and confirm the popularity of particular topic, as can for example obtaining based on the search inquiry sum that has received for theme.The comparison search popularity can provide following with the quality of the content that among topic corpus, finds and confirm: promptly based on the popularity of the search inquiry that for example is associated with theme, content is inadequate.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram that comprises the network environment 100 of statistics collection and analytic system.Statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be from search engine 120 statistics collection amounts.Search engine can for example receive inquiry from one or more computing equipment 130a-c through network 140.Search inquiry can be analyzed and compared with page index storage 150.Analysis about 150 pairs of inquiries of page index storage can for example draw information retrieval (IR) score value.This information retrieval score can be measured the degree of correlation of document (for example, webpage) to search inquiry.
Can analyze to rank by node rank engine 160 and found the document relevant with search inquiry.Should be understood that in some instances, can off-line execution node rank and store.Then, can be through node rank engine 160 retrieval node rank from the storage of node rank.The node rank can be based on the prestige (reputation) of the number of nodes that for example is linked to present node and those nodes.At the United States Patent (USP) 6th of the exercise question that for example is incorporated in this by reference for " Method forNode Ranking in a Linked Database (being used for method) " in the node rank of the database that links; The node rank has been described in 285, No. 999.
Can node rank and IR score value be made up to confirm to appear to the searchers result's order.Search engine 120 and can collect such as other services of those query with permissions and not distribute and to distribute insufficient inquiry.Do not distribute inquiry and for example can comprise that search engine can not find any inquiry of related content.Distribute insufficient inquiry and for example can comprise that demand to content exceeds the supply in topic corpus, found or any inquiry of quality.Search engine can filter alternatively, classifies and assemble with other such services does not distribute and distributes insufficient inquiry.For example make it possible to search for any theme and the result of search is provided to its user based on the universal search engine of the Internet.Inquiry for example can be based on text, and can the result be provided with the form of the tabulation that is associated with webpage.For some inquiries, return several results and/or only low-qualityer result.Search engine can be collected inquiry in the warehouse of distributing insufficient inquiry.
The collection of such data only is not limited to the universal search engine based on the Internet, such as search engine 120.Can operate and be used to handle inquiry and return results or any system of service is provided can be enough.For example, the help feature request text of many software programs, return results.These software programs can be collected above-mentioned information.
In one embodiment, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be collected about just being submitted to the information inquiring of search engine 120.For example, when search engine 120 was submitted in inquiry, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can receive inquiry.The analysis that statistics collection and analysis engine 110 also can be carried out search inquiry can be grouped together in the theme to discern which inquiry.For example, the genus for the kind of being described by search inquiry can be described in theme.Search engine 120 can provide the page based on classification with interactive searching.In another embodiment, can come the note inquiry with the most specific classification that is associated with inquiry.In another embodiment, search engine 110 can be mapped to classification (taxonomy) with the one group of character string that comprises search inquiry.These class categories can be calculated and be associated with the inquiry of being stored.In other embodiments, inquiry can be gathered in the classification, to be used for being stored in data storage.In such embodiment, inquiring about self possibly not be stored in the data storage based on the storage of classification, perhaps by the inquiry group that can possibly be associated with classification or theme with identification by cluster.
The quality that statistics collection and analysis engine 110 also can be confirmed and the degree of correlation (for example, IR score value) of the document that search inquiry (for example, topic corpus) is associated is associated with Query Result with identification.In some instances, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be with the combinations of the degree of correlation and prestige (for example, the node rank), with confirm with inquire about the quality that the topic corpus that is associated is associated.In some instances, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 for example can comprise the comparer that can the quality of the popularity of search and topic corpus be made comparisons.Such comparison can be used for for example confirming whether said theme is distributed by topic corpus deficiently.
Except insufficient inquiry of distributing of in inquiry system, importing, it is can be by statistics collection and analysis engine 110 collected and analyze about other related datas of the information of distributing insufficient theme that intention or the help of illustrating inquiry provides.Characteristic direct associated with the query such as language distribution, geographic distribution, population distribution and time distribute also can be collected by statistics collection and analysis engine 110.The inquiry that is associated with the time distribution can be for example to indicate as follows: inquiry is popular in a few days, one day some time in particular holiday, a week.In some embodiments, also can collect enquiry frequency, and for example when inquiry can note during from multiple source with inquire about the source that is associated.Like this, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be configured to collect the various information of analyzing content quality and/or popularity that can be used in.
In some instances, search engine 120 can be notified the searchers based on search log: for example than the theme of similar popularity, the quality that is associated with said topic corpus is lower.Search engine 120 can from the searchers to the interest of exercise question infer the searchers to this exercise question interested and searchers thereby possibly have the more information that can be included in the topic corpus.Search engine 120 can use notice to invite the searchers to provide extra content to be used for being included in topic corpus.The notice of utilizing Search Results to offer the searchers for example can assist in ensuring that with ratio suggested subject like the demand class of theme.
Fig. 2 comprises the block diagram that is used for to the network environment 200 of the topic distribution engine 210 of content maker 220,230,240 suggested subject.Statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be discerned field (area) (for example, theme) with insufficient content and these fields are conveyed to topic distribution engine 210.Topic distribution engine 210 can provide the theme that comprises the field of being discerned to content maker 220,230,240.In one embodiment, topic suggestions can be provided for the content maker 220,230,240 that has about the knowledge of the theme of being advised.For example, distributing inadequate physical culture theme can be proposed to sports-related publisher.
Content maker 220,230,240 can comprise and is used to create the various different mechanisms about the extra content of topic corpus.For example, content maker 220,230,240 can comprise web publisher 220.Web publisher 220 can be the commercial enterprise that for example moves for consumer's content creating.Web publisher 220 for example can move based on ad sales model 222.In this model, web publisher can create the content that can on related web site, freely obtain.Then, web publisher can collect visitor statistics and sell the advertising space on the related web site based on the number of visitors of watching the website to the advertiser.
As an alternative, web publisher 220 can move on based on the model of subscribing 224.For example, web publisher 220 can be to user's sell subscriptions with the online access of exchange to the content of web publisher's establishment.Such web publisher can comprise for example newspaper website, encyclopaedical website, dictionary/thesaurus websites etc.
Though there is the motivation of creating webpage in web publisher 220, web publisher 220 can not recognize the demand for particular type of information continually, and thereby does not know to make that which information is obtainable.Search supplier (for example, the search engine 120 of Fig. 1) has for the visit of various information request widely and also can measure the availability of accordingly result.Statistics collection and analytic system 110 can collect wherein and can find the instance of less quality search results in one period time limit, and topic suggestions engine 210 can need more information to searchers's suggestion.The search supplier has the motivation that provides to statistics collection engine 110 and topic distribution engine 210, because search supplier's purpose provides high-quality information to keep user satisfaction and the loyalty for the search supplier.When not having high-quality content, it is discontented to the search supplier that the user may become.
If the search supplier comprises publisher-incentive system, then search for the supplier and have extra motivation and encourage extra content.For example; If the searchers has expressed the interest (can infer out from the inquiry of input) to theme, then search for the supplier and possibly be able to ask the searchers to issue webpage through research theme (off-line and/or online) and based on said research content creating about said theme.
If the search supplier comprises publisher-incentive system, then the searchers can receive added advantage.Publisher-incentive system also can operate come through after issue with extra content with compare the high-quality information of encouraging about the inquiry of theme and/or the node rank that is associated with document.For example; Publisher-incentive system can be according to the demand of distributing insufficient theme is provided with award; Wherein have higher award, and have still less award, thereby the publisher-incentive system of development is provided for insufficient theme of distributing of low demand for the insufficient theme of distributing of high requirements.
Content maker 220,230,240 also can comprise user's (contribution) website 230 of contributing.For example, the user's contribution sites such as dimension base (wiki) website makes the user of broad range can create with content distributed.For example, user's contribution sites 230 can be created foundation pile (stub) article 235 based on the suggestion from the user.For example, stub article 235 can be operated to invite extra submission from other users that possibly have about the knowledge of the exercise question except the knowledge that is had by those users that create stub article 235.In some embodiments, topic distribution engine 210 can provide article suggestions to user's contribution sites 230 based on statistics collection and analysis engine 110.Then, user's contribution sites 230 can generate stub article 235 based on said article suggestions, to be included in user's contribution sites 230.Comprising that stub article 235 also can be operated comes to come to notify inadequate content to the searchers with the similar frequency of the frequency of search for.
Content maker 220,230,240 also can comprise automated content maker 240.For example, the automated content maker can be operated and will be provided to the single page from the gathering 245 of the content of a plurality of websites.For example, automated content maker 240 can and generate the single document that comprises the content of being duplicated from a plurality of website reproducting contents.In one embodiment, automated content maker 240 can be configured to only from the specified sites reproducting content.This can make automated content maker 240 only have the sites/users reproducting content of permission from automated content maker 240.For example, automated content maker 240 also can be provided to the gathering 245 of the link of the content that relates to particular topic.Automated content maker 240 can make up to be provided for creating the stub information of fresh content with web publisher or user's contribution sites 230.
In some embodiments, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be crossed over a plurality of language and confirm content quality.In such embodiment, topic distribution engine 210 can provide the quality that is associated with result from various language.Quality results can be relatively poor in language-specific to the quality of content maker 220,230,240 indication topic corpus, and relatively more abundant in other language.Such information can be generated the extra content that topic corpus wherein is confirmed as the language-specific with poor quality by content maker 220,230,240 usefulness.
Topic distribution engine 210 also can provide topic suggestions through various interface.For example, topic distribution engine 210 can use the tabulation that the theme of approval additional documents is provided such as the informant's of wikipedia web interface.
As an alternative, the search that themes as that search supplier (for example, search engine 120) can pass through to be advised provides independent service, thereby needing to be provided for the search engine (for example, distributing insufficient topic search engine 250) of the theme of extraneous information.Distributing insufficient topic search engine 250 can use existing search engine technique to search for through the collection of distributing insufficient theme and related data.Such search engine 250 can promote to hope to add the visit of the publisher of extra content to theme, if because there is coupling publisher's any result to the inquiry of distributing insufficient theme, then provide about distributing the information of insufficient theme to the publisher.For example, hope to utilize and distribute insufficient topic search engine 250 and confirm whether theme is fully distributed the searchers who distributes insufficient theme submission content.
In some instances, inquiry is widened and can be used in combination with distributing insufficient topic search engine 250, with based on distribute data that insufficient theme is associated and discern and distribute insufficient theme.For example, if the language of search inquiry with relevant with the language of distributing the data that insufficient theme is associated, then inquiry is widened and can be shown and distribute insufficient theme.In some instances, inquiry widen also can be used to limit particular holiday period for example to distributing the demonstration number of times of insufficient theme.In some embodiments, distributing insufficient topic search engine 250 can more allow inquiry to widen than typical search engine, because the searchers who has about kinds of information just had at least some information about belonging to originally.For example, the people with knowledge of specific football player and/or football statistic has some knowledge about football, even those knowledge possibly be confined to that football player or statistic.
If a plurality of to distribute insufficient theme relevant with search, then search engine 250 can to coupling distribute insufficient topics ranking, with the rank order display result that descends and as required brachymemma tabulate.Various ranking functions all are fine.For example, insufficient theme of distributing of matching inquiry can be by rank De Genggao better.More insufficient theme of distributing of frequent requests can be by rank De Genggao.
Topic distribution engine 210 also can provide topic suggestions with various forms.In one embodiment, topic distribution engine 210 can be resequenced to theme based on which theme is the most popular.In another embodiment, topic distribution engine 210 can be come theme is resequenced based on the maximum difference that which theme has between popularity and the content quality.Also can use the extended formatting scheme.
In other embodiments, topic distribution engine 210 can also comprise related data or other relevant informations such as importance that is associated with theme or the interested geographic zone that is associated with theme.Such data and/or other related datas can help the publisher to pay close attention to those fields of hoping content content is provided.
Fig. 3 is the block diagram of data stream that the system of the content that is used for discerning insufficient issue is shown.With the mode of example, show issue based on web.Other distribution form are fine.Searchers 130 sends inquiry to search engine 120.Search engine 120 based on document to the degree of correlation (IR score value) of search inquiry and the node rank that is associated with document and respond inquiry.The combination score value that is associated with the node rank of IR score value and document can be used to evaluate the quality for the result of search.Such information can be given statistics collection and analysis engine 110 by communication.In some embodiments; System for example can follow the tracks of various user behaviors; Whether click result, customer inspection such as the user and click how long the result has spent, whether the user tallies or recommend this website etc., and evaluate the quality of search based on the behavior of being followed the tracks of.
Statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be collected and analysis and consult information.Can analysis and consult information be associated will inquire about with classification (for example, theme).Inquiry can be relative to each other based on the general character in Search Results, search terms or any other common factor.In addition, the search inquiry that can basis be associated of statistics collection and the analysis engine gathering degree of correlation 310 confirming to be associated with Search Results with theme with assemble rank 315.For example, statistics collection and analysis engine 110 can be carried out statistical 320, with the popularity of theme relatively and aggregate quality for the result of the search of theme, thereby confirm whether topic corpus 355 fully distributes theme.Can be for example according to volumes of searches, based on for the quality of the Search Results of this theme with definite for relatively making of the quality of the Search Results of other themes with similar popularity.Also can use and be used for confirming whether topic corpus fully distributes other modes of theme.
Statistics collection can be communicated by letter to topic distribution engine 210 with analysis engine 110 and had the theme of insufficient content.For example, topic distribution engine 210 can be to content maker (for example, online publisher 335) the distribution theme of the knowledge with this theme.In some embodiments, main body distribution engine 210 can be distributed theme based on distributing insufficient topic search engine, and it can be so that the theme that content maker (for example, publisher, user etc.) search content maker is familiar with.As an example, if the content maker is familiar with network management, then the content maker can use and distribute insufficient topic search engine and search for the distribute insufficient theme relevant with network management.
For example, topic distribution engine 210 can be distributed inadequate degree 325 based on theme and comes theme is resequenced.For example, main body distributed inadequate degree can be based on the difference between the quality of the popularity of theme and Search Results.As an alternative, theme distributed inadequate degree can be based on the popularity of the search relevant or based on the inverse of the quality that is associated with the Search Results that is associated with theme with theme, or confirm through some other.
In another embodiment, topic distribution engine 210 can be sold the information about theme 330.For example, if web publisher's sale advertising or reservation, the visitor who then increases webpage possibly increase income.Based on the increase of such income, can web publisher be sold in the theme that attract more visitors.Can use the other system of distribution theme.
Online publisher 335 can use any suitable dissemination system to receive the theme of being advised.Among other things, online publisher 335 can comprise web publisher 340 based on advertisement, based on the web publisher 345 of user's submission and/or web publisher 350 automatically.For example, online publisher can provide extra content for topic corpus 355.For example, can encourage web publisher that extra content is provided through publisher-incentive system.Likewise, can be by encouraging the publisher that extra content is provided to the motivation of extra advertisement or subscription sales.
Topic corpus 355 can comprise all documents relevant with the search that relates to designated key.For example, online topic corpus 355 comprises the rank 360 and the degree of correlation 365 for each document in the topic corpus 355.The rank of document and the degree of correlation can be combined forming index, and search engine 120 uses these index to come Search Results classify (sort).Can extra content be carried out index based on the rank and the degree of correlation of fresh content, and extra content can compare to confirm whether extra content has increased the quality for the Search Results of designated key with the index of existing content.In some embodiments, online publisher can be provided for the award of the content of the quality rank of adding increase and theme associated content.
Fig. 4 illustrates to be used for assembling and to be identified as by the block diagram of the data stream of the system of the relevant web content of insufficient theme of distributing.In some instances, the content of between a plurality of documents, propagating possibly cause low-qualityer Search Results.In such instance, can be examined and edit to be included in individual address or website from the content of document.In Fig. 4, for example, assemble engine 410 and can operate the information that is included in the topic corpus 355 of collecting.Then, assembling engine 410 can assemble collected information and generate aggregation site 420.For example, this aggregation site 420 can be included in the link that is included in each document in the topic corpus 355.In one embodiment, aggregation site 420 can comprise the content of duplicating from topic corpus 355.In other embodiments, assembling engine 410 can be so that the user can edit the information of being assembled or aggregation site 420 to generate the fresh content relevant with theme.Such embodiment can be so that web publisher and/or individual consumer research theme and the content relevant with theme is provided more effectively.
Fig. 5 is the process flow diagram that the exemplary method that is used to discern inadequate web content is shown.In the stage 500, collect searching statistical.For example, can collect searching statistical through collecting engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).For example, collecting engine can be integrated in the search engine (for example, the search engine 120 of Fig. 1).Searching statistical can comprise the information about search inquiry, for example comprises search string, to the refining of search string, result, the degree of correlation, rank etc.In one embodiment, searching statistical is relevant with on-line search.In another embodiment, searching statistical can be relevant with the search that is provided by software program, and said software program for example comprises " help " characteristic, intranet searching engine, user and distributes site search engine etc.
In the stage 510, can inquiry be associated with theme.For example, can pass through analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110) will inquire about with theme and be associated.In some instances, analysis engine can be the part of search engine (for example, the search engine 120 of Fig. 1).Analysis engine can be for example obtained theme through the result that uses common terminology in the search inquiry, analyze search inquiry with refining of finding that general character, analysis be associated with search inquiry etc.
In the stage 520, can the quality and the searching statistical of topic corpus be compared.For example, can carry out the quality of topic corpus and the comparison of searching statistical by analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).For example, can be based on the quality that obtains topic corpus from the result's of the search inquiry that is associated with theme index.For example, can and be found the rank of the document relevant to obtain index based on the degree of correlation of document and search inquiry with search inquiry.For example; Said comparison can have the quality that compares topic corpus between the theme of similar popularity; Thereby confirm that the quality of topic corpus satisfies, exceeds or is lower than desired quality rank (for example, threshold value) for the theme with given popularity.
In the stage 530, can be based on relatively discerning theme.For example, can come the mark theme by analysis engine (analysis engine 110 of Fig. 1).Can satisfy, exceed or being lower than the desired quality that is associated with the theme with similar search statistics comes the mark theme based on the topic corpus that is associated with theme.In some embodiments, the theme of institute's mark can be considered to distribute inadequate.For example, distributing insufficient theme can be following theme: based on the searching statistical that is associated with theme, its related content is inadequate.Like this, the popular theme with insufficient content can be distinguished in the theme of being discerned, thereby invite content maker (for example, the content maker 220,230,240) that extra content is provided.
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram that the exemplary method that is used to discern inadequate web content is shown.In the stage 600, receive searching request.For example, can pass through search engine (for example, the search engine 120 of Fig. 1) and receive searching request.For example, searching request can comprise the search inquiry of discerning theme.
In the stage 610, confirm the quality of Search Results.For example, can confirm quality by search engine (for example, the search engine 120 of Fig. 1).As stated, can the rank of relevant document obtains the quality of Search Results based on document and the degree of correlation of search inquiry with search inquiry.The degree of correlation of document and rank can be combined to form index.For example, index can provide the quality index that is associated with Search Results.
In the stage 620, confirm whether the quality of Search Results is lower.For example, can make confirming of stage 620 by search engine (search engine 120 of Fig. 1).For example, whether search engine can compare to confirm the quality that is associated with Search Results said quality and threshold quality lower.Whether as an alternative, search engine can be collected the statistics that is associated with search inquiry, and lower with the quality of relatively coming to confirm said Search Results of the quality of the Query Result with similar search statistics based on the quality of Search Results.
If Search Results is not low-quality, then return Search Results to the searchers in stage 630.For example, can use network (for example, the network 140 of Fig. 1) to return Search Results by search engine (for example, the search engine 120 of Fig. 1).Can come Search Results is sorted based on the quality index that is associated with each document that comprises Search Results.
Yet,, notify the searchers in the stage 640 if Search Results is low-quality.For example, can use network (for example, the network 140 of Fig. 1) to notify the searchers by search engine (for example, the topic distribution engine 210 of the search engine 120 of Fig. 1 or Fig. 2).Search engine can produce low-qualityer result and notify the searchers through the result who is associated with search to searchers's notice.
In the stage 650, the invitation of adding content is provided.For example, can this invitation be provided by distribution engine (for example, the topic distribution engine 210 of Fig. 2).In such embodiment, invitation can be followed notice.For example, invitation can be invited the searchers to study this theme and extra content is provided, or based on searchers's existing knowledge extra content is provided based on the knowledge that is obtained.
Fig. 7 is the process flow diagram that the exemplary method that is used to discern inadequate web content is shown.In the stage 700, can retrieve the statistics that is associated with first theme.For example, can come retrieval statistics by statistics collection engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).For example, refining etc. of the search inquiry that the statistics of being retrieved can comprise search inquiry, Search Results, the time and date information that is associated with search inquiry, take place during search sessions.Such data can be used to limit the popularity of theme, identification theme, the seasonal demand of identification theme etc.
In the stage 710, obtain the quality that is associated with theme.For example, can obtain the quality that is associated with theme by analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).For example, can obtain quality based on the degree of correlation that is associated with the document that satisfies the search inquiry relevant and the gathering of rank with said theme.In other examples, for example, can advance rate through some the rate of refining is obtained quality Search Results.Also can use other information that are used to obtain the quality that is associated with topic corpus.
In the stage 720, the quality of the topic corpus that will be associated with theme and the volumes of searches that is associated with theme are relatively.For example, can carry out said comparison by analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).Can be based on for example making comparison about the corpus quality (for example, will expect what corpus quality) of other corpus with similar search amount based on given volumes of searches.As an alternative, can be based on for example making comparison about the volumes of searches (for example, will expect what volumes of searches) of other themes with similar corpus quality based on given corpus quality.
In the stage 730, make volumes of searches and whether surpass confirming of (outweigh) topic corpus.For example, can make definite by analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110 for example use comparer).For example, based on the comparison of corpus quality (for example, quality index) with volumes of searches (for example, popularity), volumes of searches surpasses topic corpus.Can use and be used for confirming whether volumes of searches surpasses other modes of topic corpus.
If search surpasses content, then be marked as and distribute inadequate and by index at stages 740 theme.For example, can come the mark theme and with its index by analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).In some instances, theme is marked as to be distributed inadequately, distributes in insufficient subject search index thereby prepare theme is included in.For example, theme can be distributed inadequate degree (for example, based on the quality of theme associated content) to write down theme by content by index.Theme can be identified to write down the degree (for example, based on the volumes of searches that is associated with theme) that theme is required as an alternative or extraly.
In the stage 750, retrieve next theme.For example, can retrieve next theme by analysis engine (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110).For example, can be from theme memory scan theme.As stated, theme can be for example based on the inquiry cluster.Can duplication stages 720,730-740 finishes until process.
In another embodiment, the system and method here can be used to discern the content of over-served (over-serve).For example, have than content based on the much higher quality index that is associated with Search Results of the popularity of theme expection.For example, web publisher can be by the content of notified of over-served so that web publisher avoids creating extra content into such theme.
In other embodiments, can use the identification of the theme of distributing insufficient/over-served by publisher's (for example, such as offline publishers of printing the publisher) of other types.Such publisher can use the identification of the theme of distributing insufficient/over-served to locate the popular theme of not distributed by online content.For example, if search " the Miller moral. the Fillmore biography " and only obtain several results, but then such publisher's expectability agency is about the Miller moral. the books of Fillmore life.
In other embodiments, when searching products, the identification of distributing the theme of insufficient/over-served can help to assess the interest to product.For example, if statistics collection and analytic system (for example, the statistics collection of Fig. 1 and analysis engine 110) confirm for the search such as the product of " purple crocodile belt " it is to distribute inadequately, then the retailer possibly consider to supply such product.
