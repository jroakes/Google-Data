In another example, if applied in network performance test data illustrate the stand-by period of 900 milliseconds of connecting, and have found for using identical mobile device 450 to configure in step 5002, position, with the matched data of the production performance data of connection type, the Samsung GalaxySIII mobile device 450 of operation 2.1 version such as on the SprintCDMA mobile network of the western Windsor of New Jersey, the prediction made about the stand-by period that connects that then can configure for the mobile device 450 for other positions and connection type, the identical Samsung configuration such as run on the AT & TGSM mobile network of the Dublin of California.Specifically, if production performance data illustrate, Samsung is configured, network performance between the Sprint of western Windsor of New Jersey and the AT & T of the Dublin of California be 1:1 ratio, then performance prediction service device 200 also can be 300 milliseconds for the connection prediction latency time for setting up Test Application in AT & T-network.
In another example, the parameter determination result that estimated performance can comprise for applied in network performance test data distributes (such as, histogram).Then this distribution can be used to modified Mobile solution parameter prediction result together with matched data.
In another example, as using substituting of linear properties function, non-linear behaviour function can be used to calculated performance prediction.As diagram, if test performance is exp (X) individual unit, or the index of X is used to the nonlinear function of simulated performance, and the production performance matched is exp (Y) individual unit, and alternative mobile device 450 has the production performance of exp (2Y) individual unit, then as a result, to alternative mobile device 450 type, the test performance predicted is exp (2X) individual unit.
In another example, if memory performance test data illustrates that the session for 5% there occurs the termination of storer deficiency, wherein, operating system closes the application using multi-memory, and the matched data that have found in step 5002 for the production performance data using identical mobile device 450 to configure, such as run the Samsung GalaxySIII mobile device 450 of 2.1 versions, then can make for other mobile devices 450 prediction stopping generation about storer deficiency, such as, run the HTCEvo4G mobile device 450 of Android operation system 2.1 version.Specifically, if production performance data illustrate that the session number percent that storer deficiency stops between Samsung and HTC configuration is 1:2 ratio, then for the Test Application in HTC configuration, performance prediction service device 200 can predict that the session of 10% storer deficiency will occur and stops.
In another example, if memory performance test data illustrates that the storer that the session of 10% occurs to be sent by operating system is warned (such as, warning application took multi-memory), and the matched data that have found in step 5002 for the production performance data using identical mobile device 450 to configure, such as run the mobile device 450 of the Samsung GalaxySIII of 2.1 versions, then can make the prediction of storer warning generation for the configuration of other mobile devices 450, such as, run the HTCEvo4G mobile device 450 of Android operation system 2.1 version.Specifically, if production performance data illustrate that the session number percent of storer warning between Samsung and HTC configuration is 1:2 ratio, then can will there is storer warning for the session of the Test Application prediction 20% in HTC configuration in performance prediction service device 200.

According to above-mentioned example, for the specific environment of not concrete test in test group or Equipments Setting estimated performance parameter (such as, for the network error rate of at least part of network error rate prediction HTC type of mobile device based on observing, for Samsung equipment).
In other examples, at least in part based on different performance parameter, estimated performance parameter (such as, be based in part on the average peak storer observed and use, forecast memory stops frequency).By obtaining the performance data observed of certain type being used for Test Application, and it is matched with the performance data for the production of the identical type applied, can performance prediction be made, then be based upon the performance of the production application matched and the another type data-speculative Test Application of collecting at least in part.Such as, if test data indicates the average peak storer used, but do not indicate the session number percent that there is storer and stop, and production data indicates the average peak storer used and both the session number percent with storer termination, then by test data and production data being matched, can predict that the storer of test data stops number percent.Specifically, if the average peak that Test Application has average 110MB uses, and the session that the coupling production application that the average peak also with 110MB uses has 5% experienced by storer and stops, then Test Application the predicted session that it has 5% can experienced by storer and stops.Optionally, for specific handset kind or operating system version, such prediction can be carried out.
In another example, utilize multiple types of data to mate between test data and production data, can make prediction.Such as, not only use peak memory, and the session number percent with storer warning also can be used to mate with production data, and prediction has the session number percent that storer stops.
According to an embodiment, use other mode collecting test data except performance library.Such as, the Instruments of apple can be used to gather average peak storer or other performance metrics for Test Application.In this case, the production data that test data can gather with utility storehouse matches.
