BACKGROUND
-
This description relates to online content, and more particularly, to methods and systems for annotating online content with offline interaction data.
-
At least some online content (i.e., advertising content presented to consumers with online publications or online applications) is associated with an online content provider such as an online advertiser. At least some such online content providers are also associated with a physical location (or locations) such as a physical store. Consumers may also interact with such physical locations in several different ways. Consumers may visit the physical locations to view goods and services (i.e., to browse). Consumers may also visit the physical locations to purchase goods and services (i.e., to buy products). Consumers may also document their experiences with such physical locations by reviewing physical locations. All such interactions may be referred to as “offline store interactions” or “offline interactions.”
-
Online users (including online users that did not make an offline interaction with a physical location of an online content provider) may benefit from offline interaction data and offline interaction conversion data.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE
-
The following detailed description of implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the claims.
-
The subject matter described herein relates generally to online content, and more particularly, to methods and systems for annotating online content with offline interaction data.
-
The system described herein is configured to improve online content (e.g., advertisements) provided to online users (e.g., consumers) by annotating the online content to include data related to physical locations (e.g., physical stores) of online content providers such as “offline interaction data” and “offline interaction conversion data”, described below.
-
At least some online content (i.e., advertising content presented to consumers with online publications or online applications) is associated with an online content provider such as an online advertiser. At least some online content may be annotated to include information related to the online content provider including, for example, a user rating of the online content provider, a rating of the popularity of the online content provider on social media, and an expert rating for the online content provider. Online content may be annotated by a number of entities involved in serving and displaying online content. In some examples, annotations may be provided by online content providers, online content networks (e.g., ad networks), or any other suitable service. Such annotations may be used by online content providers to distinguish their content from other online content and attract more online user views, user traffic, and user interaction due to such annotations. Online users may determine whether to interact with or transact at an online content provider's website based on information indicated in such annotations. For example, online users may be more inclined to purchase from an online content provider that has had success in social media as indicated by annotations. Accordingly, annotations may be provided in order to allow online users to distinguish the qualities and characteristics of online content and associated merchants.
-
At least some such online content providers are also associated with a physical location (or locations) such as a physical store. Consumers may also interact with such physical locations in several different ways. Consumers may visit the physical locations to view goods and services (i.e., to browse). Consumers may also visit the physical locations to purchase goods and services (i.e., to buy products). Consumers may also document their experiences with such physical locations by reviewing physical locations. All such interactions may be referred to as “offline store interactions” or “offline interactions.”
-
In at least some examples, online users may view online content from an online content provider and subsequently engage in offline interactions at a physical location (e.g., a physical store) associated with the same online content provider. Using methods described herein, offline interactions (e.g., visiting, browsing, purchasing) may be associated with the initial viewing of online content. Accordingly, the systems described herein may determine information related to offline interaction (“offline interaction data”). The system may also determine information related to offline interactions made by online users at a physical location of an online content provider after such online users viewed or interacted with online content for the online content provider. Such information may be referred to as “offline interaction conversion data” as it reflects the amount of online users that have a “conversion” activity of an offline interaction. In other words, “offline interaction conversion data” represents “offline interaction data” associated with previous user interaction with online content.
-
Online users (including online users that did not make an offline interaction with a physical location of an online content provider) may benefit from offline interaction data and offline interaction conversion data. Such data may provide useful indications to online users about the popularity, reliability, quality, and desirability of making offline interactions at physical locations associated with online content providers. Alternately, offline interaction data may also indicate that the online content provider is generally popular, reliable and of high quality and desirability in their online presence (e.g., at an online content provider website or an online content provider application).
-
The systems and methods described herein provide such information to online users by annotating online content with offline interaction data and offline interaction conversion data. More specifically, in the example embodiment, the systems and methods are implemented by a content annotating computing device configured to: (i) receiving a set of content interaction data based on an online interaction between an online user and a first online content item, (ii) identify at least one physical location associated with the online content provider, (iii) determine a set of offline interaction conversion data based on the set of content interaction data and a set of offline interaction data, (iv) receive a second online content item associated with the online content provider, and (v) annotate the second online content item based at least partially on the set of offline interaction conversion data and the set of offline interaction data.
-
In the example embodiment, a user (i.e., an online user) navigates to a first online content item (e.g., an advertisement). The first online content item may be displayed, and made visible to the user, on a user computing device (e.g., a mobile telephone computing device) in any suitable online location including, for example, an online publication (e.g., a webpage or an article), an online search tool (e.g., Google™ search) or an online application (e.g., a social game). Alternately phrased, the first online content item is served to a user computing device by an online content provider. The first online content item may include messages describing goods and services offered by the online content provider.
-
In some examples, the first online content item may include offers related to interactions with physical locations (e.g., physical stores) of the online content provider. For example, the first online content item may include offers such as promotions, discounts, coupons, and rebates that may be available to the online user if the online user visits such a physical location. In other examples, the first online content item may include offers for specific products (i.e., goods or services) that are available for sale. The first online content item may specifically identify a stock keeping unit (“SKU”) or a plurality of SKUs associated with such products.
-
The first online content item may be configured to receive interactions from the online user. Accordingly, the online user may interact with the first online content item in any suitable manner including, for example, viewing the first online content item, and clicking on the first online content item. Such interactions may be referred to as “online interactions.” In the example embodiment, the first online content item is further configured to detect, store, and communicate such online interactions. For example, detected online interactions may be stored as “a set of content interaction data”, stored, and provided to systems including the content annotating computing device, an online content provider system, and an online content network. Accordingly, in the example embodiment, the content annotating computing device receives a set of content interaction data related to the online interaction. In a first example, the set of content interaction data indicates that online user viewed and clicked on an online advertisement for Merchant A.
-
In the example embodiment, the set of content interaction data includes a plurality of identifiers that describe content interaction between the online user and the first online content item. The set of content interaction data includes a first identifier identifying the online user. The first identifier may include any suitable form of identification of the online user including, for example, an account number associated with the online user and the online content provider (e.g., “Merchant A” in the first example), an email address, a name, and an alphanumeric string representing the online user. In an example embodiment, the first identifier does not include personally identifiable information.
-
The set of content interaction data may also include a second identifier identifying the first online content item. The second identifier may identify, for example, the specific first online content item, products associated with the first online content item (e.g., specific SKUs), and the conditions in which it was presented including the date, time, format, and context (i.e., the online publication, online application, search result, or other context) in which the first online content was presented.
-
The set of content interaction data may also include a third identifier associated with the online content provider. The third identifier therefore would identify “Merchant A” in the first example.
-
In some examples, the set of content interaction data may also include a fourth identifier that specifies the interaction between the online user and the first online content item. For example, the fourth identifier may specify a type of interaction (e.g., a click, a view, or any other suitable interaction) and parameters of such an interaction (e.g., a duration of viewing or interaction). In additional examples, the set of content interaction data may also include a fifth identifier that identifies a location or geography associated with the online user. As described herein, the fifth identifier may be used to identify a physical location associated with the online content provider and the online user.
-
In some examples, the first online content item may be associated with a “qualifying action” that defines a minimum set of interactions by the online user. In such examples, the first online content item may be configured to provide the set of content interaction data only when the qualifying action is satisfied (i.e., the minimum set of interactions is received by the online user.) In one example, the qualifying action may be a click of the first online content item and in a second example, the qualifying action may be a minimum viewing duration of the first online content item. Accordingly, in such examples when an online user does not cause a qualifying action with the first online content item, the set of content interaction data may not be received by the content annotating computing device.
-
Content annotating computing device also identifies at least one physical location associated with the online content provider that provided the first online content item. In one example, the content annotating computing device may identify the at least one physical location using the third identifier (identifying the online content provider) in the set of content interaction data. In the first example, the third identifier identifies “Merchant A” as the online content provider. Accordingly, in that example, the content annotating computing device identifies at least one physical location associated with Merchant A. Content annotating computing device may use a variety of methods to identify at least one physical location associated with the online content provider. In one example, the content annotating computing device receives a list of physical locations associated with each online content provider and stores the list of physical locations (associated with the online content provider) in a content provider directory. Accordingly, in this example, the content annotating computing device may query the content provider directory to determine the at least one physical locations. In a second example, content annotating computing device may use an internet querying service (e.g., a search engine) to identify the at least one physical location associated with the online content provider. The at least one physical location may be identified in any suitable manner including, for example, location name, location street address, and location latitude and longitude. In some examples, the content annotating computing device identifies a “local” physical location that is determined to be local to the online user. For example, the content annotating computing device may use the fifth identifier of the set of content interaction data to identify a location associated with the online user and then find the physical location (or locations) of the online content provider that is most proximate to the online user location.

As described above and herein, in some embodiments, the content annotating computing device may store user computing device identifiers, user identifiers, geographic identifiers associated with users, and transaction and shopping data associated with users, without including sensitive personal information, also known as personally identifiable information or PII, in order to ensure the privacy of individuals associated with the stored data. Personally identifiable information may include any information capable of identifying an individual. For privacy and security reasons, personally identifiable information may be withheld and only secondary identifiers may be used. For example, data received by the content annotating computing device may identify user “John Smith” as user “ZYX123” without any method of determining the actual name of user “ZYX123”. In some examples where privacy and security can otherwise be ensured (e.g., via encryption and storage security), or where individuals consent, personally identifiable information may be received and used by the content annotating computing device. In such examples, personally identifiable information may be needed to reports about groups of online users. In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about individuals including online users merchants, or may make use of such personal information, the individuals may be provided with an opportunity to control whether such information is collected or to control whether and/or how such information is used. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, an individual's identity may be processed so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the individual, or an individual's geographic location may be generalized where location data is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of an individual cannot be determined.
-
Content annotating computing device receives a set of offline interaction data describing interactions made by users (including the online user) at physical locations of the online content provider. The set of offline interaction data may accordingly be segmented into two categories of data. A first category is data related to interactions between online users and the physical locations of the online content provider. A second category is data related to interactions between “general consumers” (i.e. users not associated with the set of content interaction data) and the physical locations of the online content provider. As described below, each category of data may information useful in annotating online content.
-
As described above, the first category of the set of offline interaction data represents interactions between online users and the physical locations of the online content provider. This category of the set of offline interaction data therefore corresponds to the first identifier of the set of content interaction data (identifying the online user) and the third identifier of the set of content interaction data (identifying the online content provider).
-
In either category of the set of offline interaction data, the set of offline interaction data describes offline interaction characteristics including the length of a user visit, the time of a user visit, purchases made by a user, and promotions participated in by the user. In one example, the set of offline interaction data describes the physical location of the offline interaction, the duration of time that the online user was at the physical location, and any transactions made at the physical location. In at least one example, the transaction data (and therefore the set of offline interaction data) may include, for example, product stock keeping units (“SKUs”) of products purchased by the online user, product names of products purchased by the online user, product categories of products purchased by the online user, purchase prices of products purchased by the online user, and promotions or incentives associated with the products purchased by the online user.
-
The set of offline interaction data may be received from any suitable computing device. In one example, the set of offline interaction data may be received from a store computing device (i.e., a computing device at or otherwise associated with a physical location of the online content provider). In such an example, the set of offline interaction data may be received from the store computing device upon interaction with the user computing device. In one example, the store computing device may be in communication with wireless networks or wireless beacons that may detect the presence of a user computing device based on wireless communication. Accordingly, the store computing device may receive information regarding the presence of a user computing device and be capable of transmitting such information to the content annotating computing device. Further, the store computing device may detect the presence of a user or user computing device at a point-of-sale (POS) terminal when a user makes a purchase or other transaction.
-
Alternately, the set of offline interaction data may be received directly by the user computing device. As described below, in one embodiment the user computing device includes location services which may identify when a user is physically present at the physical location of the online content provider. Accordingly, the user computing device may receive information regarding the user's movement to the physical location of a store, the user's physical presence in the physical location (and the duration of the user's physical presence), and purchases and transactions made by the user. Purchase and transaction information may identify purchases made by the user, returns made by the user, and promotional programs participated in by the user. Depending upon the user computing device's particular settings and attributes, some or all of such information may be detected by user computing device and provided to the content annotating computing device. Content annotating computing device may compare a user identifier associated with the user computing device to the first identifier of the set of content interaction data to determine whether the user computing device is associated with a user that previously interacted with the first online content item. If the user computing device is associated with a user that previously interacted with the first online content item, the received set of offline interaction data may be determined to be in the first category of the set of offline interaction data. Alternately, if the user computing device is not associated with a user that previously interacted with the first online content item, the received set of offline interaction data may be determined to be in the second category of the set of offline interaction data.
-
Content annotating computing device determines a set of offline interaction conversion data based on the set of content interaction data and the set of offline interaction data. Determining the set of offline interaction conversion data represents determining metrics that may be useful to other online users. In one example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total of actual offline visits and offline purchases made by online users that previously viewed the first online content item. Further, the total of actual offline visits and purchases made by such online users may be further determined for the merchant, generally, or for each physical location of the merchant. Such determined metrics may be referred to as “offline visit rates” and “offline purchase rates”. In some examples, the offline purchase rates may be determined as a total of transactions or a total currency value of transactions. In other examples, an average currency value per transaction or an average currency value per visit may be determined. Further, after determining an “offline visit rate” and “offline purchase rates”, the content annotating computing system determines a visit-purchase rate based on the determined offline visit rate and the offline purchase rate. In the example embodiment, the “visit-purchase rate” is the “offline purchase rate” divided by the “offline visit rate.”
-
In a second example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category and second category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total of actual offline visits and offline purchases made by all users, or “aggregate users” (including online users and general consumers). Further, the total of actual offline visits and purchases made by such aggregate users may be further determined for the merchant, generally, or for each physical location of the merchant. Such determined metrics may be referred to as “aggregate user total visits” and “aggregate user total purchases”. In some examples, the total of aggregate user offline purchases may be determined as a total of aggregate user transactions or a total currency value of aggregate user transactions. In other examples, an average currency value per aggregate user transaction or an average currency value per aggregate user visit may be determined.
-
In a third example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total average time of visit by online users that previously viewed the first online content item.
-
In a fourth example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category and second category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total average time of visit by aggregate users or only general consumers.
-
In a fifth example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total percentage of online users that purchased a particular product that was advertised in the first online content item (based on SKU information in the set of offline interaction data and the set of content interaction data) after interacting with the first online content item. Accordingly, such a “product purchase rate” is the percentage of online users that interacted with the first online content item and subsequently purchased an advertised product in the first online content item.
-
In a sixth example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total percentage of online users that purchased a particular product that was advertised in the first online content item (based on SKU information in the set of offline interaction data and the set of content interaction data) broken down based on the type of interaction that categories of online users had with the first online content item. For example, the content annotating computing device may separately determine a purchase rate for the product for users that clicked on the online content item, users that viewed the online content item, and users that otherwise interacted with the online content item.
-
In a seventh example, the content annotating computing device determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total percentage of online users that visited a physical store broken down based on the type of interaction that categories of online users had with the first online content item. For example, the content annotating computing device may separately determine a visit rate for the product for users that clicked on the online content item, users that viewed the online content item, and users that otherwise interacted with the online content item.
-
In many examples, such metrics as described in the above examples may be determined in real-time or near real-time manners. Real-time or near real-time metrics, as used in annotations, may substantially help to inform online users of the present popularity of a particular online content provider (or a specific physical location of the online content provider).
-
In at least some examples, the first category of the set of offline interaction data is filtered based on a conversion window associated with the first online content item. For example, the first online content item may be configured such that events that occur past a particular duration of user interaction will not be considered. In the example embodiment, such a conversion window may be thirty days. In such an example, if the set of offline interaction data reflects offline interactions taking place more than thirty days after the online user interacted with the first online content item, the set of offline interaction data may not be used for analysis and annotation as described herein as part of the first category. However, the information may be regarded as general consumer data and used for those purposes.
-
In some examples, the content annotating computing device may further determine the popularity of a particular online content provider by comparing the set of offline interaction conversion data for a plurality of online content providers. For example, within a similar category of online content items, it may be possible to rank the set of offline interaction conversion data to determine that a particular online content provider is relatively more popular or successful based on the set of offline interaction conversion data. For example, metrics such as the visit rate, purchase rate, or visit-purchase rates may be used to rank online content providers generally or within particular product categories. Such rankings may be referred to as “merchant indexes”, “merchant rankings”, “online content provider indexes” or “online content provider rankings”. Further, such merchant rankings may be used to identify the highest-ranked (within at least one metric) online content provider.
-
In other examples, the content annotating computing device may also determine the popularity of online content providers normalized based on the nearby populations (e.g., within a city, state, demographic metropolitan area (“DMA”), or zip code). For example, certain physical locations (stores) associated with online content providers may have a substantially larger or smaller addressable market than others (i.e., because the store is near to or far from a large urban center) and thus raw numbers on the popularity of such a physical location may skew data for that physical location or for the online content provider, generally. Accordingly, in many examples, the content annotating computing device may discount the impact of skewing effects on merchant indexes. In one example, the impact of variant population bases may be discounted by ranking metrics divided by the nearby population (e.g., the population within 10 miles) in order to normalize the distortion caused by population variance. In a second example, the impact of variant numbers of physical locations for each online content provider may be discounted for merchant indexes by ranking metrics divided by the number of physical locations for each online content provider. In a third example, individual physical locations for online content providers may be compared to determine local merchant indexes (i.e., rankings of individual stores of online content providers within a particular area.) Generally, the content annotating computing device may identify demographic characteristics associated with a physical location of an online content provider or the online content provider, generally, and use such demographic characteristics to scale offline interaction conversion data.
-
Content annotating computing device may also receive information related to online visits and online purchases (“online conversion data”) for the online content provider associated with the first online content item. In some examples, as described below, it may be valuable to provide annotations that incorporate both online and offline interaction conversion data. Accordingly, receiving such online conversion data may be useful to provide integrated annotations reflecting online and offline interaction conversion data (the combination of which may be referred to as “integrated conversion data”). Such integrated conversion data may be used for rankings to provide “integrated merchant indexes” reflecting comparisons of various online content providers using online and offline interaction conversion data.
-
Content annotating computing device also receives a second online content item associated with the online content provider and annotates the second online content item based at least partially on the set of offline interaction conversion data and the set of offline interaction data. More specifically, the content annotating computing device identifies that the second online content item is associated with the same online content provider as the first online content item based on an identifier (“second online content item provider identifier”). Upon such a determination, the content annotating computing device identifies a plurality of offline interaction data, a plurality of online interaction data, a plurality of online interaction conversion data, and a plurality of offline interaction conversion data associated with the identified online content provider. Accordingly, the content annotating computing device substantially identifies or retrieves information determined above including, for example, merchant indexes. Content annotating computing device is further configured to annotate the second online content item with such retrieved information (i.e., the plurality of offline interaction data, the plurality of online interaction data, the plurality of online interaction conversion data, and the plurality of offline interaction conversion data associated with the identified online content provider.) Annotation may include representing any or all of the retrieved information described above within the second online content item, or alternately phrased, editing the second online content item to include some or all of the retrieved information described above. In at least several embodiments, the second online content item is annotated to include the plurality of offline interaction conversion data.
-
In some examples, the annotations may include annotations based on determined offline visit rates or offline purchase rates, as defined above and determined by the content annotating computing device. For example, the second online content item may be annotated (or edited) to include information for a particular online content provider to state, “80,000 people who viewed this ad visited stores of this merchant yesterday.” Alternately, such an annotation may be location-centric and may state, “750 people who viewed this ad visited the store near you in Anytown Mall.” Alternately, the annotation may reflect offline purchase rates and state, “40,000 people who viewed this ad made purchases yesterday”
-
In a second example, the second online content item may be annotated by the content annotating computing device to reflect merchant indexes, as described above and determined by the content annotating computing device. Accordingly, such an annotation may indicate a ranking or index (e.g., between 0-10) to communicate the popularity of a particular store or a particular online content provider.
-
In a third example, the second online content item may be annotated to reflect integrated conversion data (the combination of online and offline interaction conversion data.) In such cases, the content annotating computing device may include online purchases in creating an annotation such as the merchant index annotation described above.
-
In a fourth example, the second online content item may be associated with a particular product associated with a particular stock keeping unit (“SKU”). In such examples, the content annotating computing device may annotate the second online content item to reflect the purchase of products indicated in the second online content item. In such scenarios, the second online content item may be annotated to say, for instance “100 people purchased this item yesterday” or “1,000 people purchased items in this category yesterday”.
-
In a fifth example, the second online content item may be annotated by the content annotating computing device with the visit-purchase rate (determined as the “offline purchase rate” divided by the “offline visit rate”.)
-
In other examples, any metric described above may be used to annotate the second online content item. Further, such metrics may be normalized for a particular region or to discount the impact of larger population bases or numbers of stores, as described above.
-
In some examples, annotations may be described with a standard structure of five components. A first component is an interaction type that distinguishes between visits and purchases. A second component is a value metric (indicating, for example, the number of visits or purchases.) A third component is a category, identifying whether the interaction is associated with a particular product, a category of products, or all products. A fourth component is a geography identifier that identifies the area described by the annotation. For example, the fourth component may identify the annotation as being associated with nationwide offline interactions or regional offline interactions. A fifth component is a time range identifying the time period associated with the offline interactions such as the past day, two days, or week.
-
Annotation may include representing any or all of the retrieved information described above within the second online content item, or alternately phrased, editing second online content item to include some or all of the retrieved information described above. In at least several embodiments, second online content item is annotated to include offline interaction conversion data.
-
Accordingly, content annotating computing device annotates second online content item to generate annotated second online content item. Second online content item may be served to user device directly by content annotating computing device or via any suitable intermediary system including data processing systems.
-

As described herein, computing device 200 facilitates the presentation of content from one or more publishers, along with one or more sets of sponsored content, for example ads, to a user. Computing device 200 may perform these and other operations in response to processor 204 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 206. A computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave. The software instructions may be read into memory 206 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 210, or from another device via communication interface 216. The software instructions contained in memory 206 may cause processor 204 to perform processes described herein. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the subject matter herein. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the subject matter disclosed herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
-
The computing device 200 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a rack server system. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer. Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing device 200, and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 200 communicating with each other.
-
The processor 204 can execute instructions within the computing device 200, including instructions stored in the main memory 206. The processor may be implemented as chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of the device 200, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by device 200, and wireless communication by device 200.
-
Computing device 200 includes a processor 204, main memory 206, ROM 208, an input device 212, an output device such as a display 214, a communication interface 216, among other components including, for example, a receiver and a transceiver. The device 200 may also be provided with a storage device 210, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of the components are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate.
-
Computing device 200 may communicate wirelessly through communication interface 216, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. Communication interface 216 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, a GPS (Global Positioning system) receiver module may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data to device 200, which may be used as appropriate by applications running on device 200.

FIG. 3 is an example data flowchart of annotating online content with offline interaction data and offline interaction conversion data using the computing device of FIG. 2 in the online content environment shown in FIG. 1 .
-
In the example embodiment, a user 301 (i.e., an online user) uses a user computing device 303 to navigate to a first online content item 310 (e.g., an advertisement). First online content item 310 may be displayed, and made visible to user 301, on user computing device 303 (e.g., a mobile telephone computing device) in any suitable online location including, for example, an online publication (e.g., a webpage or an article), an online search tool (e.g., Google™ search) or an online application (e.g., a social game). Alternately phrased, first online content item 310 is served to a user computing device 303 by an AMS 106 (shown in FIG. 1 ), and, more specifically, data processing system 116. As described in FIG. 1 , although data processing system 112 (shown in FIG. 1 ) may directly or indirectly generate, and/or maintain online content (such as first online content item 310), data processing systems 116 typically serve such online content to user computing devices 303. First online content item 310 may include messages describing goods and services offered by online content provider 102 (shown in FIG. 1 ).
-
In some examples, first online content item 310 may include offers related to interactions with physical locations 350 (e.g., physical stores) of online content provider 102. For example, first online content item 310 may include offers such as promotions, discounts, coupons, and rebates that may be available to online user 301 if online user 301 visits such a physical location 350. In other examples, first online content item 310 may include offers for specific products (i.e., goods or services) that are available for sale. First online content item 310 may specifically identify a stock keeping unit (“SKU”) or a plurality of SKUs associated with such products.
-
First online content item 310 may be configured to receive interactions from user computing device 303 based on the actions of online user 301. Accordingly, online user 301 may use user computing device 303 to interact with first online content item 310 in any suitable manner including, for example, viewing first online content item 310, and clicking on first online content item 310. Such interactions may be referred to as “online interactions.” In the example embodiment, the first online content item 310 is further configured to detect, store, and communicate such online interactions. For example, detected online interactions may be stored as “a set of content interaction data” 320, stored, and provided to systems including a content annotating computing device 330, data processing systems 112, 114, and 116 (shown in FIG. 1 ). As described herein, content annotating computing device 330 may include characteristics of computing device 200 as described in FIG. 2 . Further, content annotating computing device 330 may be included within data processing system 116 or in communication with data processing system 116 and used in the serving of online content such as first online content item 310 and second online content item 370.
-
Accordingly, in the example embodiment, content annotating computing device 330 receives a set of content interaction data 320 related to the online interaction between user computing device 303 and first online content item 310, based on the actions of user 301 using user computing device 303. In a first example, set of content interaction data 320 indicates that online user 301 viewed and clicked on an online advertisement for Merchant A.
-
In the example embodiment, set of content interaction data 320 includes a plurality of identifiers that describe content interaction between the online user and the first online content item. Set of content interaction data 320 includes a first identifier identifying online user 301 and/or user computing device 303. The first identifier may include any suitable form of identification of online user 301 and/or user computing device 303 including, for example, an account number associated with online user 301 (and/or user computing device 303) and online content provider 102 (e.g., “Merchant A” in the first example), an email address, a name, and an alphanumeric string representing online user 301 and/or user computing device 303. In an example embodiment, the first identifier does not include personally identifiable information.
-
Set of content interaction data 320 may also include a second identifier identifying first online content item 310. The second identifier may identify, for example, the specific first online content item 310, products associated with first online content item 310 (e.g., specific SKUs), and the conditions in which it was presented including the date, time, format, and context (i.e., the online publication, online application, search result, or other context) in which first online content item 310 was presented.
-
Set of content interaction data 320 may also include a third identifier associated with online content provider 102. The third identifier therefore would identify “Merchant A” in the first example.
-
In some examples, set of content interaction data 320 may also include a fourth identifier that specifies the interaction between online user 301 (received by user computing device 303) and first online content item 310. For example, the fourth identifier may specify a type of interaction (e.g., a click, a view, or any other suitable interaction) and parameters of such an interaction (e.g., a duration of viewing or interaction). In additional examples, set of content interaction data 320 may also include a fifth identifier that identifies a location or geography associated with online user 301 and/or user computing device 303. As described herein, the fifth identifier may be used to identify a physical location 350 associated with both online content provider 102 and online user 301 such as the physical location 350 of online content provider 102 nearest to online user 301.
-
In some examples, first online content item 310 may be associated with a “qualifying action” that defines a minimum set of interactions by online user 301. In such examples, first online content item 310 may be configured to provide set of content interaction data 320 only when the qualifying action is satisfied (i.e., the minimum set of interactions is received by user computing device 303 based on the actions of online user 301.) In one example, the qualifying action may be a click of first online content item 310 and in a second example, the qualifying action may be a minimum viewing duration of first online content item 310. Accordingly, in such examples when online user 301 does not cause a qualifying action with first online content item 310, set of content interaction data 320 may not be received by content annotating computing device 330.
-
Content annotating computing device 330 also identifies at least one physical location (such as physical location 350) associated with online content provider 102 that created or provided first online content item 310. In one example, content annotating computing device 330 may identify at least one physical location using the third identifier (identifying online content provider 102) in set of content interaction data 320. In the first example, the third identifier identifies “Merchant A” as online content provider 102. Accordingly, in that example, content annotating computing device 330 identifies at least one physical location 350 associated with Merchant A. Content annotating computing device 330 may use a variety of methods to identify at least one physical location 350 associated with online content provider 102. In one example, content annotating computing device 330 receives a list of physical locations 350 associated with each online content provider 102 and stores the list of physical locations 350 (stored with references to associated online content providers 102) in a content provider directory (not shown). Accordingly, in this example, content annotating computing device 330 may query the content provider directory to determine the at least one physical location 350. In a second example, content annotating computing device 330 may use an internet querying service (e.g., a search engine) to identify the at least one physical location 350 associated with online content provider 102. The at least one physical location 350 may be identified in any suitable manner including, for example, location name, location street address, and location latitude and longitude. In some examples, content annotating computing device 330 identifies a “local” physical location 350 that is determined to be local to online user 301 and/or user computing device 303. For example, content annotating computing device 330 may use the fifth identifier of set of content interaction data 320 to identify a location associated with online user 301 (and/or user computing device 303) and then find the physical location 350 (or locations) of online content provider 102 that is most proximate to the location of online user 301 and/or user computing device 303.
-
As described above and herein, in some embodiments, content annotating computing device 330 may store user computing device identifiers, user identifiers, geographic identifiers associated with online users 301 and user computing devices 303, and transaction and shopping data associated with users, without including sensitive personal information, also known as personally identifiable information or PII, in order to ensure the privacy of individuals associated with the stored data. Personally identifiable information may include any information capable of identifying an individual. For privacy and security reasons, personally identifiable information may be withheld and only secondary identifiers may be used. For example, data received by content annotating computing device 330 may identify user “John Smith” as user “ZYX123” without any method of determining the actual name of user “ZYX123”. In some examples where privacy and security can otherwise be ensured (e.g., via encryption and storage security), or where individuals consent, personally identifiable information may be received and used by content annotating computing device 330. In such examples, personally identifiable information may be needed to reports about groups of online users. In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about individuals including online users merchants, or may make use of such personal information, the individuals may be provided with an opportunity to control whether such information is collected or to control whether and/or how such information is used. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, an individual's identity may be processed so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the individual, or an individual's geographic location may be generalized where location data is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of an individual cannot be determined.
-
Content annotating computing device 330 receives a set of offline interaction data 340 describing interactions made by users (including online user 301) at physical locations 350 of online content provider 102. Set of offline interaction data 340 may accordingly be segmented into two categories of data. A first category is data related to interactions between online users 301 and physical locations 350 of online content provider 102. A second category is data related to interactions between “general consumers” (i.e. users not associated with the set of content interaction data and not shown) and physical locations 350 of online content provider 102. As described below, each category of data may information useful in annotating online content.
-
As described above, the first category of set of offline interaction data 340 represents interactions between online users 301 and physical locations 350 of online content provider 102. This category of set of offline interaction data 340 therefore corresponds to the first identifier of the set of content interaction data 320 (identifying online user 301) and the third identifier of set of content interaction data 320 (identifying online content provider 102).
-
In either category of set of offline interaction data 340, the set of offline interaction data 340 describes offline interaction characteristics including the length of a user visit, the time of a user visit, purchases made by a user, and promotions participated in by the user. In one example, set of offline interaction data 340 describes the physical location 350 of the offline interaction, the duration of time that online user 301 was at physical location 350, and any transactions made at physical location 350. In at least one example, the transaction data (and therefore the set of offline interaction data) may include, for example, product stock keeping units (“SKUs”) of products purchased by online user 301, product names of products purchased by the online user, product categories of products purchased by the online user, purchase prices of products purchased by the online user, and promotions or incentives associated with the products purchased by online user 301.
-
The set of offline interaction data may be received from any suitable computing device. In one example, set of offline interaction data 340 may be received from a store computing device 351 (i.e., a computing device at or otherwise associated with a physical location of the online content provider). In such an example, set of offline interaction data 340 may be received from store computing device 351 upon interaction with user computing device 303. In one example, store computing device 351 may be in communication with wireless networks or wireless beacons that may detect the presence of user computing device 303 based on wireless communication. Accordingly, store computing device 351 may receive information regarding the presence of a user computing device 303 and be capable of transmitting such information to content annotating computing device 330. Further, store computing device 351 may detect the presence of user 301 or user computing device 303 at a point-of-sale (POS) terminal when user 301 makes a purchase or other transaction.
-
Alternately, set of offline interaction data 340 may be received directly by user computing device 303. As described below, in one embodiment user computing device 303 includes location services which may identify when a user computing device 303 (and therefore user 301) is physically present at physical location 350 of online content provider 102. Accordingly, user computing device 303 may receive information regarding the movement of user computing device 303 to physical location 350 of a store, the presence of user computing device 303 in physical location 350 (and the duration of the physical presence of user computing device 303), and purchases and transactions made by user 301. Purchase and transaction information may identify purchases made by user 301, returns made by user 301, and promotional programs participated in by user 301. Depending upon the particular settings and attributes of user computing device 303, some or all of such information may be detected by user computing device 303 and provided to content annotating computing device 330. Content annotating computing device 330 may compare a user identifier associated with user computing device 303 to the first identifier of the set of content interaction data 320 to determine whether user computing device 303 is associated with a user 301 that previously interacted with first online content item 310. If user computing device 303 is associated with a user 301 that previously interacted with first online content item 310, received set of offline interaction data 340 may be determined to be in the first category of set of offline interaction data 340. Alternately, if user computing device 303 is not associated with a user 301 that previously interacted with first online content item 310, received set of offline interaction data 340 may be determined to be in the second category of set of offline interaction data 340.
-
Content annotating computing device 330 determines a set of offline interaction conversion data 360 based on set of content interaction data 320 and set of offline interaction data 340. Determining set of offline interaction conversion data 360 represents determining metrics that may be useful to other online users 301 and used to annotate second online content item 370. In one example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data 340 from the first category of sets of offline interaction data 340) a total of actual offline visits and offline purchases made by online users 301 that previously viewed first online content item 310. Further, the total of actual offline visits and purchases made by such online users may be further determined for the merchant, generally, or for each physical location of the merchant. Such determined metrics may be referred to as “offline visit rates” and “offline purchase rates”. In some examples, the offline purchase rates may be determined as a total of transactions or a total currency value of transactions. In other examples, an average currency value per transaction or an average currency value per visit may be determined. Further, after determining an “offline visit rate” and “offline purchase rates”, the content annotating computing system determines a visit-purchase rate based on the determined offline visit rate and the offline purchase rate. In the example embodiment, the “visit-purchase rate” is the “offline purchase rate” divided by the “offline visit rate.”
-
In a second example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category and second category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total of actual offline visits and offline purchases made by all users, or “aggregate users” (including online users and general consumers). Further, the total of actual offline visits and purchases made by such aggregate users may be further determined for the merchant, generally, or for each physical location of the merchant. Such determined metrics may be referred to as “aggregate user total visits” and “aggregate user total purchases”. In some examples, the total of aggregate user offline purchases may be determined as a total of aggregate user transactions or a total currency value of aggregate user transactions. In other examples, an average currency value per aggregate user transaction or an average currency value per aggregate user visit may be determined.
-
In a third example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total average time of visit by online users that previously viewed the first online content item.
-
In a fourth example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category and second category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total average time of visit by aggregate users or only general consumers.
-
In a fifth example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total percentage of online users that purchased a particular product that was advertised in the first online content item (based on SKU information in the set of offline interaction data and the set of content interaction data) after interacting with the first online content item. Accordingly, such a “product purchase rate” is the percentage of online users that interacted with the first online content item and subsequently purchased an advertised product in the first online content item.
-
In a sixth example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total percentage of online users that purchased a particular product that was advertised in the first online content item (based on SKU information in the set of offline interaction data and the set of content interaction data) broken down based on the type of interaction that categories of online users had with the first online content item. For example, content annotating computing device 330 may separately determine a purchase rate for the product for users that clicked on the online content item, users that viewed the online content item, and users that otherwise interacted with the online content item.
-
In a seventh example, content annotating computing device 330 determines (based on a plurality of received sets of offline interaction data from the first category of the sets of offline interaction data) a total percentage of online users that visited a physical store broken down based on the type of interaction that categories of online users had with the first online content item. For example, content annotating computing device 330 may separately determine a visit rate for the product for users that clicked on the online content item, users that viewed the online content item, and users that otherwise interacted with the online content item.
-
In many examples, such metrics as described in the above examples may be determined in real-time or near real-time manners. Real-time or near real-time metrics, as used in annotations, may substantially help to inform online users of the present popularity of a particular online content provider (or a specific physical location of the online content provider).
-
In at least some examples, the first category of the set of offline interaction data is filtered based on a conversion window associated with the first online content item. For example, the first online content item may be configured such that events that occur past a particular duration of user interaction will not be considered. In the example embodiment, such a conversion window may be thirty days. In such an example, if the set of offline interaction data reflects offline interactions taking place more than thirty days after the online user interacted with the first online content item, the set of offline interaction data may not be used for analysis and annotation as described herein as part of the first category. However, the information may be regarded as general consumer data and used for those purposes.
-
In some examples, content annotating computing device 330 may further determine the popularity of a particular online content provider by comparing the set of offline interaction conversion data for a plurality of online content providers. For example, within a similar category of online content items, it may be possible to rank the set of offline interaction conversion data to determine that a particular online content provider is relatively more popular or successful based on the set of offline interaction conversion data. For example, metrics such as the visit rate, purchase rate, or visit-purchase rates may be used to rank online content providers generally or within particular product categories. Such rankings may be referred to as “merchant indexes”, “merchant rankings”, “online content provider indexes” or “online content provider rankings”. Further, such merchant rankings may be used to identify the highest-ranked (within at least one metric) online content provider.
-
In other examples, content annotating computing device 330 may also determine the popularity of online content providers normalized based on the nearby populations (e.g., within a city, state, demographic metropolitan area (“DMA”), or zip code). For example, certain physical locations (stores) associated with online content providers may have a substantially larger or smaller addressable market than others (i.e., because the store is near to or far from a large urban center) and thus raw numbers on the popularity of such a physical location may skew data for that physical location or for the online content provider, generally. Accordingly, in many examples, content annotating computing device 330 may discount the impact of skewing effects on merchant indexes. In one example, the impact of variant population bases may be discounted by ranking metrics divided by the nearby population (e.g., the population within 10 miles) in order to normalize the distortion caused by population variance. In a second example, the impact of variant numbers of physical locations for each online content provider may be discounted for merchant indexes by ranking metrics divided by the number of physical locations for each online content provider. In a third example, individual physical locations for online content providers may be compared to determine local merchant indexes (i.e., rankings of individual stores of online content providers within a particular area.) Generally, content annotating computing device 330 may identify demographic characteristics associated with a physical location of an online content provider or the online content provider, generally, and use such demographic characteristics to scale offline interaction conversion data.
-
Content annotating computing device 330 may also receive information related to online visits and online purchases (“online conversion data”) for the online content provider associated with the first online content item. In some examples, as described below, it may be valuable to provide annotations that incorporate both online and offline interaction conversion data. Accordingly, receiving such online conversion data may be useful to provide integrated annotations reflecting online and offline interaction conversion data (the combination of which may be referred to as “integrated conversion data”). Such integrated conversion data may be used for rankings to provide “integrated merchant indexes” reflecting comparisons of various online content providers using online and offline interaction conversion data.
-
Content annotating computing device 330 also receives a second online content item 370 associated with online content provider 102 and annotates second online content item 370 based at least partially on set of offline interaction conversion data 360 and set of offline interaction data 340. More specifically, content annotating computing device 330 identifies that second online content item 370 is associated with the same online content provider as the first online content item based on an identifier (“second online content item provider identifier”). Upon such a determination, content annotating computing device 330 identifies a plurality of offline interaction data, a plurality of online interaction data, a plurality of online interaction conversion data, and a plurality of offline interaction conversion data associated with the identified online content provider. Accordingly, content annotating computing device 330 substantially identifies or retrieves information determined above including, for example, merchant indexes. Content annotating computing device 330 is further configured to annotate second online content item 370 with such retrieved information (i.e., the plurality of offline interaction data, the plurality of online interaction data, the plurality of online interaction conversion data, and the plurality of offline interaction conversion data associated with the identified online content provider.) Annotation may include representing any or all of the retrieved information described above within the second online content item, or alternately phrased, editing second online content item 370 to include some or all of the retrieved information described above. In at least several embodiments, second online content item 370 is annotated to include offline interaction conversion data 360.
-
Accordingly, content annotating computing device 330 annotates second online content item 370 to generate annotated second online content item 380. Annotated second online content item 380 may be served to user computing device 303 directly by content annotating computing device 330 or via any suitable intermediary system including data processing systems 112, 114, and 116.
-
In some examples, the annotations may include annotations based on determined offline visit rates or offline purchase rates, as defined above and determined by the content annotating computing device. For example, the second online content item may be annotated (or edited) to include information for a particular online content provider to state, “80,000 people who viewed this ad visited stores of this merchant yesterday.” Alternately, such an annotation may be location-centric and may state, “750 people who viewed this ad visited the store near you in Anytown Mall.” Alternately, the annotation may reflect offline purchase rates and state, “40,000 people who viewed this ad made purchases yesterday”
-
In a second example, the second online content item may be annotated by content annotating computing device 330 to reflect merchant indexes, as described above and determined by content annotating computing device 330. Accordingly, such an annotation may indicate a ranking or index (e.g., between 0-10) to communicate the popularity of a particular store or a particular online content provider.
-
In a third example, the second online content item may be annotated to reflect integrated conversion data (the combination of online and offline interaction conversion data.) In such cases, content annotating computing device 330 may include online purchases in creating an annotation such as the merchant index annotation described above.
-
In a fourth example, the second online content item may be associated with a particular product associated with a particular stock keeping unit (“SKU”). In such examples, content annotating computing device 330 may annotate the second online content item to reflect the purchase of products indicated in the second online content item. In such scenarios, the second online content item may be annotated to say, for instance “100 people purchased this item yesterday” or “1,000 people purchased items in this category yesterday”.
-
In a fifth example, the second online content item may be annotated by content annotating computing device 330 with the visit-purchase rate (determined as the “offline purchase rate” divided by the “offline visit rate”.)
-
In other examples, any metric described above may be used to annotate the second online content item. Further, such metrics may be normalized for a particular region or to discount the impact of larger population bases or numbers of stores, as described above.
-
In some examples, annotations may be described with a standard structure of five components. A first component is an interaction type that distinguishes between visits and purchases. A second component is a value metric (indicating, for example, the number of visits or purchases.) A third component is a category, identifying whether the interaction is associated with a particular product, a category of products, or all products. A fourth component is a geography identifier that identifies the area described by the annotation. For example, the fourth component may identify the annotation as being associated with nationwide offline interactions or regional offline interactions. A fifth component is a time range identifying the time period associated with the offline interactions such as the past day, two days, or week.
-
FIG. 4 is an example method 400 of annotating online content with offline interaction data and offline interaction conversion data using the online content environment of FIG. 1 . Method 400 is performed by content annotating computing device 330 (shown in FIG. 3 ).
-
Content annotating computing device 330 receives 410 a set of content interaction data based on an online interaction between an online user and a first online content item. Receiving 410 represents content annotating computing device 330 receiving set of content interaction data 320 based on interactions between user computing device 303 (controlled by online user 301) and first online content item 310 (all shown in FIG. 3 ).
-
Content annotating computing device 330 also identifies 420 at least one physical location associated with the online content provider. Identifying 420 represents content annotating computing device 330 processing set of content interaction data 320 to identify an online content provider 102 (shown in FIG. 1 ) associated with first online content item 310 and further processing content interaction data 320 to identify at least one physical location 350 (shown in FIG. 3 ) associated with first online content item 310 and online content provider 102.

FIG. 6 is a first illustrative example of online content 610 received by content annotating computing device 330 (shown in FIG. 3 ). Online content 610 may represent any online content that may be annotated by content annotating computing device 330 including, for example, second online content item 370. As described herein, content such as online content 610 may be associated with an online content provider 102 (shown in FIG. 1 ) and associated with physical locations 350 (shown in FIG. 3 ) associated with online content provider 102. Online content 610 may include standard components of online content items including, for example, a headline 612, a link 614, a description 616, and online interaction annotation 618. However, online content 610 received by content annotating computing device 330 does not include annotations related to offline interactions.
-
Online content 610 may be processed using the systems and methods described herein and further associated with offline interaction data 340 (shown in FIG. 3 ) that may be used to annotate online content 610.
-
FIG. 7 is a second illustrative example of annotated online content 710 generated by content annotating computing device 330 (shown in FIG. 3 ) annotating online content 610 (shown in FIG. 6 ). Accordingly, online content 710 includes annotations 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, and 770. As described herein, annotations 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, and 770 may be generated by content annotating computing device 330 processing offline interaction data 340 to determine offline interaction conversion data 360. Further, annotations 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, and 770 may include content interaction data 320, online conversion data 325, offline interaction data 340, and offline interaction conversion data 360.
-
Annotations 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, and 770 represent various versions of annotations that may be rendered by content annotating computing device 330. For example, annotations 720 and 730 reflect purchase rates and visit rates for an online content provider 102 (in this case, XYZ Shoes). Further, as described above, many annotations may be described with a standard structure of five components. A first component is an interaction type that distinguishes between visits and purchases. In the case of annotation 720, the interaction type is “purchase” or “transaction” while in annotation 730, the interaction type is “visit”. A second component is a value metric (indicating, for example, the number of visits or purchases.) In the case of annotation 720, the value metric is 40,000 while in the case of annotation 730, the value metric is 500,000. A third component is a category, identifying whether the interaction is associated with a particular product, a category of products, or all products. In the cases of annotations 720, the category is “shoes” while in the case of annotation 730, the category is “all” since the visits may related to any category. A fourth component is a geography identifier that identifies the area described by the annotation. For example, the fourth component may identify the annotation as being associated with nationwide offline interactions or regional offline interactions. In the cases of annotations 720, 730, and 760, the geography identifier is “national” while in the cases of annotations 740, 750, and 770, the geography identifier is “Anytown”. A fifth component is a time range identifying the time period associated with the offline interactions such as the past day, two days, or week. In the case of annotation 720, the time range is the past day while in the case of annotation 730, the time range is the past week.

FIG. 8 is a third illustrative example of online content 810 received by content annotating computing device 330 (shown in FIG. 3 ). Online content 810 may represent any online content that may be annotated by content annotating computing device 330 including, for example, second online content item 370. As described herein, content such as online content 810 may be associated with an online content provider 102 (shown in FIG. 1 ) and associated with physical locations 350 (shown in FIG. 3 ) associated with online content provider 102.
-
In contrast to online content 610, online content 810 is product focused and therefore may be annotated with product specific annotations as shown in FIG. 9 . Online content 810 may include standard components of online content items including, for example, a product image 812, a headline 814, a link 816, a description 818, and online interaction annotation 820. However, online content 810 received by content annotating computing device 330 does not include annotations related to offline interactions.
-
Online content 810 may be processed using the systems and methods described herein and further associated with offline interaction data 340 (shown in FIG. 3 ) that may be used to annotate online content 810.
-
FIG. 9 is a fourth illustrative example of annotated online content 910 generated by content annotating computing device 330 (shown in FIG. 3 ) annotating the online content 810 (shown in FIG. 8 ).
