Description
- This specification relates to advertising over multiple media channels.
- The Internet enables access to a wide variety of content items, e.g., video and/or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, news articles, etc. Such access to these content items enables opportunities for targeted advertising. For example, advertisements can be provided with search results in response to a search query provided by a user; provided for web pages of online publishers that have content related to the advertisement; or provided in response to a specific request from a user, such as when a user requests information for particular products or services.
- Additionally, with the advent of multi-media channel coordination, advertising can be coordinated over different media channel types. As used in this specification, a media channel type is a specific medium, or specific sub-portion of a specific medium, that is used in reaching an intended audience. For example, television, radio and the Internet are each different media channel types. Additionally, advertisements are delivered over the Internet through different sub-portions, e.g., such as mobile search, desktop search, desktop browsing, each of which are likewise different media channel types.
- When designing an advertising campaign, the designer usually has a specific goal that the advertising campaign is intended to achieve. For example, a particular advertising campaign may be designed to increase brand recognition; another advertising campaign may be designed to sell products and services; another advertising campaign may be designed to reengage with customers. Each of these advertising campaigns, accordingly, will have different types of advertisements to achieve the different types of goals for which they are designed. Other types of goals are possible, such as driving offline (in-store) sales, increasing ROI (Return On Investment), increasing traffic, increasing the number of conversions, and increasing emotional engagement with a brand, etc.
- However, with many different media channel types to choose from, designing an advertising campaign for a particular goal can be difficult. For example, to increase brand recognition, an advertiser may need to decide which media channel type(s) to use to deliver advertisements. For example, the advertiser may need to decide, when configuring a campaign, whether to choose a subset of media channel types or choose all media channel types. For example, the advertiser may include a single media channel type in a campaign or may “bundle”, for example, a desktop search media type and a mobile search media type, into a search-related campaign. As another example, the advertiser may include all available media channel types in a single campaign. Furthermore, when particular media channel types are selected, the advertiser may have multiple different types of advertising formats that can be used for advertisements. Thus, making an informed decision as to the selection media channel types, the format of advertisements, and the selection of other parameters can be a daunting task.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include displaying in the display device of the data processing apparatus a goal interface that comprises at least two goal selection input options, each of the goal selection input options corresponding to a respective advertising campaign goal for an advertising campaign of an advertising entity and being selectable by a user of the data processing apparatus, receiving a selection of one of the goal selection input options, and displaying, in the display device, a channel recommendation interface that includes a set of channel recommendations that are selected, in part, based on the respective advertising campaign goal corresponding to the selected one of the goal selection input options, the set including at least one recommendation for one or more advertising channels. In some variations, wherein the recommendation is for at least two advertising channels, each advertising channel being a particular media channel type for use in providing advertisements for the advertising campaign, and each media channel type that is recommended is different from the media channel type of at least one other advertising channel recommended in the set. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include receiving, from a client device, a selection of one of a plurality of goal selection input options, each of the goal selection input options corresponding to a respective advertising campaign goal for an advertising campaign of an advertising entity and being selectable by a user of the client device, the selection defining a selected goal; determining, based in part on the selected goal, a set of channel recommendations comprising at least one recommendation for advertising channels, each advertising channel comprising a particular media channel type for use in providing advertisements for the advertising campaign, and each media channel type being different from at least one other media channel type of the recommended advertising channels in the set; and providing, in response to the selected goal, data for displaying the set of channel recommendations at the client device. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. One or more advertising campaigns can be automatically developed for an advertiser based on one or more advertising campaign goals selected by the advertiser. One or more advertising channels and default campaign data can be recommended to an advertiser based on one or more advertising campaign goals selected by the advertiser. An advertiser can view information for running advertising campaigns grouped according to previously selected advertising campaign goals. One or more advertisement formats can be recommended to an advertiser based on one or more advertising campaign goals selected by the advertiser. Relevant insights into best practices for and utility of media channels can be shown to an advertiser based on one or more advertising campaign goals selected by the advertiser. Relevant information relating to media channels (e.g., number of users available to be reached, frequency of reaching users, number of available impressions, number of web pages, number of search queries) can be shown to an advertiser based on one or more advertising campaign goals selected by the advertiser.

-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exampleonline advertising environment 100. Theonline advertising environment 100 utilizes anadvertising management system 102 to facilitate the sale and purchase of online advertising opportunities between publishers and advertisers. - The
online advertising environment 100 includes acomputer network 104, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectingpublishers 106, user client devices 108,advertisers 110, and theadvertising management system 102. Theadvertising management system 102 further has access to anadvertising content store 124, acampaign data store 126, and acampaign statistics store 128. - Each
publisher 106 is associated with one or more publisher websites (e.g., eachrespective publisher 106 can be an entity that manages and/or owns one or more websites). Each publisher website can have one or more webpage resources associated with a domain name, and can be hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements. - User client devices 108 are electronic devices that are under the control of users. A user client device 108 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the
network 104. - The
advertising management system 102 facilitates the sale and purchase of advertising opportunities betweenpublishers 106 andadvertisers 110. Theadvertising management system 102 includes components, such as amanagement system 116, agoal manager system 118, anadvertising serving system 120, and areporting system 122. An advertiser can create an advertising campaign using tools provided by themanagement system 116, or can create an advertising campaign using tools provided by thegoal manager 118. - The
management system 116 provides user interfaces for advertisers to define advertising campaigns and ad groups, submit advertising content, and specify various targeting and/or ad placement criteria for the advertising content in each advertising campaign and/or ad group. The advertising content is stored in theadvertising content store 124 and the targeting and ad placement criteria are stored in thecampaign data store 126. For each ad group or campaign, the advertisers can also specify bids for ad slots associated with particular keywords through the interface provided by themanagement system 116. Advertisers' bids, budgets, as well as other campaign related preferences are also stored in thecampaign data store 126. - An account management tool can be employed by an advertiser to create and manage a large number of online advertising campaigns for various products and services that the advertiser offers. The account management tool can be made available to the advertiser either through an online interface provided by the
management system 116 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at an advertiser's client device. The online interface and/or the locally executed account management software application can be used for downloading existing account data from themanagement system 116 and for uploading new and/or modified account data to themanagement system 116. - The advertiser can create and manage multiple advertising campaigns using the account management tool offered by the
management system 116. The advertiser can further specify multiple ad groups under each ad campaign, and specify respective advertisements, budgets, keywords, and other targeting and/or ad placement criteria for each of the ad groups. Typically, the advertising account can be abstracted into a hierarchical structure. For example, the advertising account can include one or more ad campaigns, each ad campaign can include one or more ad groups, and each ad group can include one or more advertisements and keywords. - An advertising campaign is defined by campaign level advertising parameters. The campaign level advertising parameters include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing ads, a budget for the ad campaign, start and end dates for the ad campaign, a schedule for ad placements, a targeted language, and targeted geographical locations. Other campaign level advertising parameters includes, for example, a payment scheme such as a cost-per-click (CPC), cost per thousand impressions (CPM), cost-per-action (CPA), and so on.
- The ad campaign includes one or more ad groups. An ad group contains one or more advertisements, which target a particular set of keywords, ad placements, or both. Ad groups under the same campaign can share the same campaign level advertising parameters, but have tailored specifications for particular ad group level advertising parameters, such as keywords, bids for keywords, budget, and so on.
- Different ad groups are created to have more focused targeting on different product lines or services. For example, different sets of keywords specific to the different product lines or services can be used for the different ad groups. Sometimes, different ad groups can also target different market segments and/or demographic characteristics. Keywords specific for the different market segments and/or demographic characteristics can be included in the different ad groups.
- An ad group is defined by ad group level advertising parameters. The ad group level advertising parameters include, for example, an ad group name, and various bids for different ad placement opportunities (e.g., automatic placement, advertiser managed placement, etc.) or outcomes (e.g., clicks, impressions, conversions). An ad group name can be one or more terms that the advertiser can use to concisely capture a topic or subject matter that the ad group is targeting. For example, a car dealership can create a different ad group for each type of vehicles it carries, and may further create a different ad group for each model of vehicles it carries. Examples of the ad group themes that the car dealership can use include, for example, “sports car,” “sedan,” “truck,” “hybrid,” and so on.
- One or more keywords and advertisements are specified for each ad group. The keywords are typically terms that are relevant to the product or services that the advertiser wishes to promote for the ad group. Each keyword can include one or more terms. For example, the car dealership may include “automobile”, “sports car,” “V-6 engine,” “four-wheel drive,” “fuel efficiency,” and so on as keywords for its ad groups and ad campaigns. The advertiser can also specify whether exact match of keywords are required for ad placements on the content network.
- In addition to keywords, for each ad group, a number of advertisements for selection by the ad server when an advertising opportunity becomes available that matches the budget, ad schedule, maximum bids, keywords, and other targeting criteria are specified. Different types of ads can be included in an ad group, such as a text ad, an image ad, a local business ad, a mobile ad, and so on.
- Other aspects of the ad group can be defined in terms of various advertising parameters and specified by advertiser-entered values or default values for those various advertising parameters. After all the required advertising parameters for each level and aspect of the ad campaign(s) are specified, the advertising campaign data (e.g., data including the campaign structure and the advertising parameters on each level within the campaign structure) are uploaded to the
management system 116, and the data are stored in thecampaign data store 126. The advertising campaign can be created and activated according to the advertising campaign data specified by the advertiser. - In some implementations, an advertiser can create an advertising campaign using the
goal manager 118. Thegoal manager 118 can provide a set of user interfaces for developing an advertising campaign. The user interfaces can include, for example, a goal interface, a channel recommendation interface, a campaign development interface, and an advertisement development interface. - The goal interface can include two or more goal selection input options which allow an
advertiser 110 to select one or more advertising campaign goals for an advertising campaign. Advertising campaign goals can include, for example, brand recognition, sales, and customer re-engagement. Rather than the advertiser manually creating various advertising campaigns and associated campaign parameters, thegoal manager 118 can recommend advertising channels, advertising campaigns, and associated campaign parameters, based on the advertiser's selected goal(s). For example, the channel recommendation interface includes a set of channel recommendations for advertising channels that are selected, by thegoal manager 118, in part, based on the selected goal(s). Each advertising channel can be of a particular media channel type for use in providing advertisements for the advertising campaign. - The campaign development interface includes default campaign data selected by the
goal manager 118 which defines one or more advertising campaigns for theadvertiser 110. The default campaign data can be selected, in part, based on the set of channel recommendations. The default campaign data can include default campaign values for a plurality of campaign parameters that define a default advertising campaign strategy for theadvertiser 110. Campaign parameters can include, for example, one or more budgets, one or more ad groups, one or more targeting keywords, and one or more bids. The advertisement development interface includes a set of advertisement format recommendations that are selected, by thegoal manager 118, in part, based on a recommended advertising channel and a selected goal. The set of advertising format recommendations can include one or more recommended advertising formats for an advertisement to be provided over a particular recommended advertising channel. Theadvertiser 110 can review the recommended advertising campaigns and associated parameters and advertisements, and can start the recommended campaigns. - Referring now to the
publishers 106, for some of thepublishers 106, arespective publisher 106 can correspond to a particular media channel type. For example, inFIG. 1 , there are n media channel types shows, and each channel type has a corresponding set ofpublishers 106,advertisers 110, and user devices 108 that send and receive data of the particular media channel type. For example, the publishers 106-1 can publish content on a video media channel, the publishers 106-2 can publish content on one or more mobile channels, and the publishers 106-n can publish content on one or more desktop channels. The publishers 106-1 . . . 106-n can, for example, include a sameparticular publisher 106, if, for example, the particular publisher entity publishes content on different media channels. Likewise, the advertisers 110-1 . . . 110-n and user devices 108-1 . . . 108-n can include the same particular advertisers and user devices when the advertiser entity advertises on different media channels and the user device receives data for the articular media channel (e.g., a desktop search channel that shows ads with search results and a targeted content channel that shows ads that are contextually matched to a publisher web page). - The
advertising management system 102 provides an interface forpublishers 106 to specify ad slots available on the publisher's online properties. For example, thepublishers 106 can specify the cost, type, dimensions, and targeting criteria (e.g., keywords associated with the content of the online properties) for each ad slot. A publisher management server (not shown) can provide scripts or references to scripts to thepublishers 106 according to the specifications of the ad slots. Eachpublisher 106 can insert instructions into its webpages or content items (e.g., RSS feeds, social networks, videos, etc.). When the webpages and content items are downloaded to user client devices 108, the instructions are executed to generate one or more ad requests to theadvertising management system 102. Theadvertising serving system 120 of theadvertising management system 102 responds to the ad requests by sending advertisements to the requesting user client device 108 for insertion into appropriate ad slots in the publisher's webpages or content items as rendered on the requesting user client device 108. The advertisements can include embedded links to landing pages (e.g., webpages on the advertisers' websites 110) that a user is directed to when the user clicks on the advertisements presented on the publisher's webpages or in the content items. - The ad requests are optionally associated with user characteristics (e.g., user's age, gender, income, language preferences, and so on) and advertising context (e.g., keywords associated with webpage content, location, local time of ad request, and so on). In some implementations, the ad requests can be associated explicit user characteristics or inferred characteristics associated with a browser, cookie identifier, data indexed by a cookie identifier, etc.
- In some implementations, various user privacy measures are implemented to remove personally identifiable information from the user characteristics data. The
advertising serving system 120 can select advertisements from theadvertising content store 124 for each ad request based on a match between an advertiser's campaign criteria in thecampaign data store 126 and the user characteristics and advertising context associated with the ad request. - The advertisements provided after a successful match, and optionally user responses (e.g., click-throughs, conversions, and so on) to the advertisements, can be tracked by various tracking mechanisms (e.g., tracking cookies, pixel callbacks, etc.), sent back to the
advertising management system 102, and stored in thecampaign statistics store 128. The tracking is enabled by various user opt-in processes. Thereporting system 122 provides user interfaces for advertisers and publishers to review reports on the campaign statistics in various formats. Performance of particular keywords, ad groups, and campaigns can be measured based on various performance metrics, such as cost per action (e.g., click or conversion), conversion length (e.g., number of clicks between initial impression and conversion), and so on. - The
goal manager 118 can provide one or more interfaces that allow theadvertiser 110 to manage and view reports for started campaigns. For example, thegoal manager 118 can provide a campaign summary interface. The campaign summary interface includes two or more goal categories, each of which respectively correspond to one of the goal selection inputs included in the goal interface and a corresponding advertising campaign goal. For each of the goal categories, the campaign summary interface can include a listing of one or more advertising campaigns grouped according to the goal category, where each of the advertising campaigns in the listing is a campaign that is defined to achieve the respective advertising campaign goal that corresponds to the goal category. Each listing may be grouped, for example, according to a media channel type to which an advertising campaign corresponds. Each listing can include campaign parameter values and campaign statistics for each of the advertising campaigns that correspond to a respective media channel type. The campaign statistics can be accessed, for example, from thecampaign statistics store 128. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample user interface 200 for developing an advertising campaign. A user, such as an advertiser, can, for example, select alink - As an example, a small-to-medium business, as compared to a large business, can have different needs, a different level of knowledge of marketing and advertising, and a different willingness and ability to invest in advertising and marketing. Accordingly, different workflows for advertising campaign creation can be provided for different types of businesses. Workflows for advertising campaign creation for other types of businesses other than small-to-medium businesses, large businesses, and search engine marketers can be provided.
- Although in the example of
FIG. 2 , user-selectable links FIG. 2 , in response to selection of thelink - For example,
FIG. 3 illustrates anexample user interface 300. Theuser interface 300 includes aworkflow user interface 301 for developing one or more advertising campaigns. Theworkflow user interface 301 includes tabs, such astabs tab 302 a, which corresponds to a step for entering details for a business, can be an initial tab which is selected by default when theuser interface 300 is displayed. In response to selection of thetab 302 a, anexample goal interface 303 for defining one or more advertising campaign goals can be displayed in theuser interface 300. Thegoal interface 303 can be provided, for example, by thegoal manager 118 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . - The
goal interface 303 includes goalselection input options goal selection inputs goal selection inputs goal selection inputs goal interface 303 can include goal selection inputs for a goal of driving traffic to a website or a goal of generating leads. - In some implementations, a user can select one or more of the
goal selection inputs goal selection input 305 corresponding to a goal of sales is shown as selected. In some implementations, the user can select one but not more than one of thegoal selection inputs goal selection inputs - In addition to selecting one or more goals, a user can provide information about a business for which to advertise. For example, the user can provide a business name using a
control 308 and can provide a business location using a control 310. If the business has multiple locations, the user can select alink 312 to provide information for the multiple locations. - As another example, the user can provide a business type, using a
control 314. The user can select alink 316 to browse a predefined list of business types and can select one or more business types from the predefined list. One or more business type suggestions can be displayed in a suggested business types list 318. For example, one or more business types can be suggested based on a business name provided using thecontrol 308. As another example, one or more business types can be suggested based on results of querying a business directory using a business name provided using thecontrol 308 and/or a location provided using the control 310. The user can select one or more suggested business types in the suggested business types list 318. In some implementations, a business type is included in (e.g., automatically entered into) thecontrol 314 in response to selection of a business type included in the suggested business types list 318. In some implementations, the suggested business types list 318 can be populated based on one or more provided product and service keywords. - For example, the user can provide one or more keywords that describe an offered product or service using a control 320. The user can select a
link 322 to display a “merchant center” interface from which the user can select one or more products and services, such as by browsing a directory of predefined product and service categories. The user can select one or more suggested products or services from a suggested products andservices list 324. The suggested products and services list 324 can be populated, for example, based on a business type provided using thecontrol 314 and/or on a product or service keyword provided using the control 320. The keywords provided using the control 320 can correspond to a subset of products or services offered by the business. For example, the advertiser may want to create one or more advertising campaigns that focus on a subset of products or services, and may create one or more other advertising campaigns to focus on other offered products or services. - The
goal manager 118 can recommend an advertising strategy based, in part, on the one or more selected goals and on the entered business name, business type, and product and service information. The user can view a user interface which presents the recommended advertising strategy by selecting thetab 302 b. - For example,
FIG. 4 illustrates an examplechannel recommendation interface 400 for displaying a set of channel recommendations. The set of channel recommendations includes recommendations for recommendedadvertising channels advertising channels advertising channel 404 is a mobile search media channel type, and the recommendedadvertising channel 406 is a desktop browsing media channel type. - For each of the recommended
advertising channels search advertising channel 404,advertising campaigns 412, 414, and 416 for mobile searches for dessert shops, mobile searches for dessert shops by users who are proximate to the business, and mobile searches for products and services offered by the business, respectively, are recommended. As yet another example, for the desktopbrowsing advertising channel 406, an advertising campaign 418 for desktop browsing for dessert shops is recommended. - The
goal manager 118 can recommend the recommendedadvertising channels goal manager 118. The recommendedadvertising channels advertising channels advertising channels campaign statistics store 128 described above with respect toFIG. 1 , may indicate that there are more searches for the business, the business type, or products and services offered by the business being performed on the recommendedadvertising channels advertising channels goal manager 118. - For each of the respective recommended advertising campaigns 408-418, a respective recommended budget 420-430 can be displayed. For example, as indicated by the budget 420, a daily budget of two hundred dollars is recommended for the recommended advertising campaign 408. The amount of each of the budgets 420-430 can be based, for example, on an advertiser-provided total budget and on estimates for each of the respective advertising campaigns 408-418 which each estimate an impact that a respective advertising campaign 408-418 may have towards meeting the selected advertising campaign goal(s). For example, the
budget 426 of five hundred dollars daily for the recommendedadvertising campaign 414 may be higher than the two hundred dollar daily budget 420 for the recommended advertising campaign 408 based on the recommendedadvertising campaign 414 having a higher estimated impact towards achieving the selected advertising goal(s) than the recommended advertising campaign 408. As another example, the budgets 420-430 may be based, in part, on a general difference in cost for advertising for some or all of the corresponding recommendedadvertising campaign channels - For each of the respective recommended advertising campaigns 408-418, corresponding respective recommendation details 432-442 are displayed which provide, among other information, one or more reasons for why the respective recommended advertising campaign 408-418 is recommended to obtain the advertising campaign goal(s) selected by the user. For example, the recommendation details 432 describe that the recommended advertising campaign 408 can be used to satisfy a recommendation to show advertisements on general queries related to the business to obtain new customers for the business. The recommendation details 432 also describe that, historically, there have been approximately eighty thousand desktop search queries by customers, for dessert shops, per day. As another example, the recommendation details 438 describe that the recommended
advertising campaign 414 can be used to satisfy a recommendation to show advertisements to customers close to the business on general queries related to the business to obtain new customers that are located near the business. The recommendation details 438 also describe that, historically, there have been approximately twelve hundred mobile search queries by customers, for dessert shops, per day, within five miles of the business. - Some or all of the recommendation details 432-442 can include a link to more detailed information. For example, the recommendation details 434 includes a
link 444 to search insights associated with the recommended advertising campaign 410. For example, auser interface 500 illustrated inFIG. 5 includessearch insights 502 that are displayed in response to selection of thelink 444. Thesearch insights 502 include alist 504 of top search terms that include one or more keywords related to products and services offered by the business. Thesearch insights 502 also include agraph 506 which illustrates historical counts of searches for the search terms included in thelist 504. - Returning to
FIG. 4 , the user can select atab 446 to display a campaign development interface for building the recommended advertising campaigns 408-418 using the recommendedadvertising channels FIG. 6 illustrates an examplecampaign development interface 600 which includes default campaign data defining one or more advertising campaigns for the advertiser. Thecampaign development interface 600 can include, for example, default campaign data which defines each of the recommended advertising campaigns 408-418. For example, default campaign data for anadvertising campaign 601, of a desktop searchmedia channel type 602, which corresponds to the recommended advertising campaign 408, is displayed in anarea 603, and default campaign data for anadvertising campaign 604, of a desktop searchmedia channel type 605, which corresponds to the recommended advertising campaign 410, is displayed in anarea 606. The user can use ascroll control 608 to scroll to view default campaign data associated with the recommended advertising campaigns 412-418. - The default campaign data displayed in the
areas advertising campaigns advertising campaigns advertising channels - The plurality of campaign parameters can include, for example, a
budget 610, settings 612, one ormore advertising groups 614, targetingkeywords 616, and bids 618. For example, adefault campaign value 620 defines a budget of two hundred dollars and adefault campaign value 622 defines a location of the United States and a language of English, for theadvertising campaign 601. Similarly, adefault campaign value 624 defines a budget of five hundred dollars and adefault campaign value 626 defines a location of the United States and a language of English, for theadvertising campaign 604. - A strategy for each of the
advertising campaigns advertising campaign 601. As another example, advertising groups 636-644, corresponding to cupcake, holiday cupcake, cupcake book, show cupcake, and cupcake baking, respectively, can be created for theadvertising campaign 604. - For each of the advertising groups 628-644, a set of targeting keywords is defined (e.g., corresponding to the parameter 616). For example, targeting
keywords 646 associated with theadvertising group 628 for theadvertising campaign 601 include bakery, dessert bakery, pastry stores, bakery names, and bakery boxes. As another example, targetingkeywords 648 associated with theadvertising group 638 for theadvertising campaign 604 include wedding cupcake, Halloween cupcake, and Christmas cupcake. For each of the advertising groups 628-644, a bid amount can be defined (e.g., corresponding to the parameter 618). For example, as shown, a bid amount of two dollars is defined for each of the advertising groups 628-644. - A total
daily budget 650 is displayed which, in some implementations, is the sum of the budgets for each of the recommended advertising campaigns. In some implementations, one or more advertising campaigns can share a budget.Estimates 652 are displayed which include cost and performance estimates based, for example, on the current total budget and on current default campaign values. For example, theestimates 652 include adaily click estimate 654, a daily users estimate 656, and adaily cost estimate 658. In some implementations, the user can edit the default campaign values 620-648 and can select acontrol 660 to update the totaldaily budget 650 and theestimates 652. - The particular parameters that are selected to define an advertising campaign can be selected based, in part, on a media channel type associated with a recommended advertising channel. For example, for some media channel types, such as desktop search, the
advertising groups parameter 614 and the targetingkeywords parameter 616 can be selected. For other media channel types, other parameters can be selected to define an advertising campaign, such as a list of recommended publisher websites on which advertisements are to be placed. As another example, one or more user lists to be targeted can be displayed, where targeting a displayed user list is identified as suitable for meeting the advertiser's selected goal(s). - The user can select a
tab 662 to display an advertisement development interface. For example,FIG. 7 illustrates an exampleadvertisement development interface 700 for displaying a set of advertisement format recommendations, including recommended advertising formats 702-712. The recommended advertising formats 702-712 are selected for an advertising campaign 714 (which corresponds to theadvertising campaigns 601 and 408), in part, based on an advertising channel 716 (which corresponds to theadvertising channels 602 and 402) and on the advertiser's selected goal(s). The recommended advertising formats 702-712 can be used for an advertisement to be provided over theadvertising channel 716. The user can use ascroll control 718 to scroll to view recommended advertisement formats for other recommended advertising campaigns for theadvertising channel 716 and for other recommended advertising channels. - The recommended advertising formats 702-712 can be selected from among multiple advertising formats available for the
advertising channel 716 and can be selected based on the recommended advertising formats 702-712 being more suited to achieving the advertiser's selected goal(s) than other advertising formats available on theadvertising channel 716. Although text advertisement formats are shown, other advertisement formats can be recommended. For example, for a goal of awareness, a video advertisement format, an image advertisement format for display of advertisements on a publisher website, and a search result advertisement format, configured to compare two businesses, can be recommended, if, for example, the recommended advertising channels include video, display advertisements, and one or more search channels, respectively. As another example, for a goal of sales, a mobile advertisement format with click-to-call capability and a mobile location-aware advertisement format can be recommended, if, for example, mobile search and/or mobile browsing are recommended advertising channels. - Each of the recommended advertisement formats 702-712 can be selected based on a corresponding advertising group. For example, the advertising formats 702 and 704 correspond to an advertising group 720 (which corresponds to the advertising group 628), the advertising formats 706 and 708 correspond to an advertising group 722 (which corresponds to the advertising group 623), and the advertising formats 710 and 712 correspond to an advertising group 724 (which corresponds to the advertising group 632).
- The user can select a link to create advertisements for a corresponding advertisement group, in one or more recommended advertising formats. For example, the user can select a
link 726 to be presented with an interface for creating one or more advertisements in either the advertising format 702 or theadvertising format 704. For some recommended advertising formats, such as video advertisement formats and advertising formats that include one or more images, the user can be provided with an interface to upload a video or image, respectively. - The user can select a
tab 726 to display an interface for reviewing details of and for starting recommended advertising campaigns. For example,FIG. 8 illustrates an example user interface 800 for displaying an overview of recommended advertising campaigns. The user interface 800 includes a totaldaily budget 802 and corresponding cost and performance estimates 804 which correspond to the totaldaily budget 650 and theestimates 652, respectively. The user can select a control 806 to accept the totaldaily budget 802 and the corresponding cost and performance estimates 804 or can select a control 808 or a control 810 to increase the totaldaily budget 802 by five hundred or one thousand dollars, respectively. A table 812 documents the effects of selecting the control 806, 808, or 810 (e.g., in respective rows each corresponding to a respective control 806, 808, or 810). As another example, the user can select a control 814 and can enter a budget amount using acontrol 816. A corresponding row in the table 812 (e.g., the bottom row) can be updated to document the effects of setting the totaldaily budget 802 to the amount displayed in thecontrol 816. - A summary of user inputs is displayed in a
settings summary area 818. For example, thesettings summary area 818 can include the user's selected goal(s), and user-provided business information, such as a business web site, a business name, a business type, and offered products or services. Summary information for recommended advertisement campaigns is displayed in acampaign area 820. For example, campaign values for a plurality of campaign parameters (e.g., as described above with respect toFIG. 6 ) can be displayed in thecampaign area 820 for each recommended advertising campaign. For example, thecampaign area 820 includes summary information for a recommended advertising campaign 821 (which corresponds to the recommendedadvertising campaigns 408, 601, and 714). - The user can use a
scroll control 822 to scroll to see additional summary information for the recommendedadvertising campaign 821 or for other recommended advertising campaigns. The user can select a control 824 to finalize creation of and to start each of the recommended advertising campaigns. The user can select acontrol 826 or acontrol 828 to manage started advertising campaigns. Thecontrol 826 can be selected, for example, to display a basic campaign summary interface designed for unsophisticated users who are not very familiar with advertising. Thecontrol 828 can be selected, for example, to display a campaign summary interface designed for users who are familiar with advertising. - For example,
FIG. 9 illustrates an examplecampaign summary interface 900 for managing advertising campaigns. Thecampaign summary interface 900 can display information for one or more campaign projects, where each campaign project can group related advertising campaigns. A campaign project can group advertising campaigns that meet one or more user-specified goals. As illustrated by a label 902, thecampaign summary interface 900 is displaying information for a “campaign project # 1”. The user can select a different campaign project using acontrol 904. - A
statistics area 906 displays information associated with the campaign project. For example, abudget 908 can be displayed, which can be a sum of the budgets of the advertising campaigns included in the campaign project.Statistics - The user can select an
overview tab 916, acampaigns tab 918, anad groups tab 920, a targetingtab 922, anads tab 924, or asettings tab 926 to see information associated with the advertising campaigns included in the campaign project. For example, in response to selection of theoverview tab 916, advertising campaign information grouped by a set ofgoal categories goal category goal selection inputs FIG. 3 ) and to the goal selection input's corresponding advertising campaign goal. For example, thegoal categories - For each of the
goal categories goal category goal category listing 934 groups advertising campaigns associated with thesales goal category 930. The listing 934 groups the advertising campaigns associated with thesales goal category 930 according to a media channel type to which a respective advertising campaign corresponds. For example,advertising campaign groups - The
listing 934 includes astatistics area 942 which can include similar types of information as thestatistics area 906, with thestatistics area 942 including information that is specific to advertising campaigns associated with thegoal category 930. Although onelisting 934 is displayed, a listing can also be displayed for either or both of thegoal categories goal category 928 or thegoal category 932. Information displayed in response to selection of thecampaigns tab 918, thead groups tab 920, the targetingtab 922, or theads tab 924 can be grouped by goal category, similar to the information displayed in response to theoverview tab 916. The user can select thesettings tab 926 to edit settings for a campaign project, such as to edit or add one or more advertising campaign goals. - The user can select an

For example, as shown inFIG. 4 , thegoal manager 118 displays thechannel recommendation interface 400. The set of channel recommendations includes one or more recommendations for advertising channels, where each advertising channel is a particular media channel type for use in providing advertisements for the advertising campaign. Furthermore, each media channel type that is recommended is different from the other media channel types that are recommended in the set. For example, with respect toFIG. 4 , the recommended advertising channel 402 is a desktop search media channel type, the recommendedadvertising channel 404 is a mobile search media channel type, and the recommendedadvertising channel 406 is a desktop browsing media channel type. - The
goal manager 118 displays, in the display device, a campaign development interface that includes default campaign data defining one or more advertising campaigns for the advertiser, where each advertising campaign includes default campaign values for a plurality of campaign parameters, and where the plurality of default campaign values are selected, in part, based on the set of channel recommendations (1110). The default campaign values define a default advertising campaign strategy. For example, as shown inFIG. 6 , thecampaign development interface 600 includes default campaign data defining the advertisement campaigns 601 and 604. Thecampaign development interface 600 includes, among other default campaign values, default campaign values 620-648 for the campaign parameters 610-618. The default campaign values 620-648 are selected, in part, based on the recommendedadvertising channels - The
goal manager 118 displays, in the display device, an advertisement development interface that includes a set of advertisement format recommendations that are selected, in part, based on an advertising channel and selected goal (1112). The set of advertising format recommendations includes one or more recommended advertising formats for an advertisement to be provided over the advertising channel. For example, as shown inFIG. 7 , theadvertisement development interface 700 includes the recommended advertising formats 702-712 that are selected, in part, based on theadvertising channel 716 and on the goals selected using thegoal interface 300. The recommended advertising formats 702-712 can be used for advertisements that are provided over theadvertising channel 716. -
