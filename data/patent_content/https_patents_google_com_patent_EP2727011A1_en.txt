- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 300 for prerendering a web page based upon a predicted navigation event in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. Aspects of the method 300 operate to identify one or more likely navigation destinations from a set of navigation indicators, and then prerender the identified navigation destinations.
- the method 300 may be performed by a computing device, such as the computing device 200, to eliminate delays in the user web browsing experience by prerendering web pages that are identified as likely navigation targets by the user.
- the method 300 may be performed by elements of the browser 206, the navigation prediction module 208, and the prerender module 210 acting together. While aspects of the method 300 are described with respect to the computing device 200, the method 300 may also be performed by the server 104, or any device with hardware and/or software designed to accept instructions .
- the computing device 200 receives one or more indicators of navigational intent.
- Navigational intent may be any action that would tend to indicate that the user will generate a particular network request, such as a request for a particular web page.
- the indicators may provide metrics by which to determine what the particular request will be, such as a confidence value.
- the user may navigate to a certain web page, from which they generally navigate to another certain web page based upon their browsing history, or the user may move his mouse cursor towards a particular hyperlink embedded within a web page.
- the indicator is received from a remote server, such as a search engine that embeds an indicator within search results, indicating that most users that submit a particular search query select a particular search result.
- the computing device 200 attempts to predict the most likely navigation event. In short, the computing device 200 makes a best guess of to where the user is likely to navigate next, based upon the indicator. Methods of performing this prediction are described below. (See Figures 4- 12) .
- the computing device 200 prerenders the content from the predicted next navigation event as determined at stage 304.
- the prerendering process may include storing a prerendered web page within a browser, such as the prerendered web page 218.
- the computing device 200 may prerender a single web page predicted as the most likely navigation event, or the computing device 200 may prerender multiple pages.
- the computing device 200 determines the number of pages to prerender based upon one or more system capabilities of the computing device 200, such as available system resources, available network bandwidth, processor speed, installed memory, and the like. In some aspects, the number of pages to prerender may be configurable in one or more user settings.
- Figure 4 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 400 for predicting a navigation event based on a client navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 400 provides for storing a navigation history for a user, and predicting a next navigation event based upon a navigation history of a particular user.
- the method 400 may be performed by a computing device such as the computing device 200.
- the method 400 may be performed by a navigation prediction module executing on a processor, such as the navigation prediction module 208.
- the computing device 200 tracks a user navigation history.
- the computing device 200 may store records of web pages visited by the user, such as the browsing history commonly maintained in web browsers.
- the browsing history may comprise the URLs of the web pages visited by the user, the order in which the URLs were visited, and the manner in which the user selected the URL (e.g. whether the URL was a clicked hyperlink, typed into an address bar, a redirect operation from another web page, etc.) .
- the computing device 200 determines a most likely navigation event or events based upon the user navigation history.
- the most likely navigation events may be determined by identifying the globally most visited pages for the user, or the navigation events may be associated with one or more current criteria. For example, the computing device 200 may examine the user's navigation history to determine that, when the user is viewing a particular news web page, they almost always select a link to the top news story on that page, or that when the user first opens the browser in the morning, they are likely to navigate to their bank account page to check their daily balance.
- the computing device 200 may employ various rules, heuristics, and filters to determine the most likely navigation event from the user history.
- the computing device 200 may associate each navigation event with a particular confidence value, indicating the likelihood that the user will select each navigation event. These confidence values may then be used to sort the navigation events to determine the most likely navigation event. A method to determine a confidence value for a given navigation event is described further below (See Figure 5 ) . [0053] At stage 406, the computing device 200 reports the most likely navigation event as the predicted navigation event. For example, these predicted most likely navigation event may then be employed by the method described above (See Figure 3) to facilitate prerendering of the web pages associated with the most likely navigation event.
- Figure 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 500 for computing a confidence value for a URL using a user navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 500 is operable to track navigation events input by the user and to maintain a frequency value for each stored event.
- the method 500 may be employed to build a client navigation history as used by the method 400, and stored on the computing device 200 as the client navigation history 212.
- the computing device 200 tracks the selection of a particular URL. For example, the user may type a URL for a news site into the browser, or click a link on a page.
- the computing device 200 may monitor the navigation events using functionality built into the browser 206, through a browser extension such as a plug-in or toolbar, or via a third party application executing in tandem with the browser.
- the computing device 200 increments a frequency value associated with the URL selected at stage 502.
- the computing device 200 may track a frequency value associated with each URL selected by a user.
- the frequency value is a data metric used to rank a number of visits to a particular web site or the number of times a particular navigation event is selected.
- the computing device 200 may increment the frequency value associated with the URL, for example by 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, .5, or any other value.
- the frequency value associated with the URL represents how often the user has selected the particular URL, and thus is an indicator of how likely the user is to select the URL in the future.
- the computing device 200 time decays the stored frequency values for the URLs after a given "sweep interval". Decaying the URL frequency values in this manner allows for current browsing habits to be more heavily weighted than previous browsing habits.
- the computing device 200 may execute the sweep every 30 seconds, every minute, or every 5 minutes during which the user has selected at least one URL.
- the sweep interval may be conducted in response to the selection of at least one URL during a particular sweep interval to ensure that the navigation history values are not decayed below a threshold value during periods where the user is inactive.
- the sweep may decay the stored frequency value associated with the URL by a particular value, such as .99, .5, or 1.0, or by a percentage value, such as 5%, 10%, or 50%.
- the URL may be removed from the list of possible navigation destinations to avoid the list growing too large.
- the frequency values for the URLs may be persisted to a local storage on the computing device 200, or sent to a remote storage such as provided by the server 104.
- the stored frequency values may be used to determine the relative frequency with which the user visits particular web sites.
- the frequency value thus provides a basis from which a confidence value associated with a navigation event leading to each web site may be derived.
- the frequency value itself may be provided as the confidence value.
- the confidence value is determined by comparing a frequency value for a particular web page with the entire user navigation history. For example, the navigation event with the higher frequency value may be associated with a particular percentage confidence value, the second highest frequency value a lower percentage, and the like.
- the confidence value is determined by frequency value by the total number of logged navigation events. For example, the frequency value of a particular URL may be divided by the sum of all frequency values to determine a confidence value.
- a user may be in the process of buying a home, and thus regularly checking financial and banking websites for mortgage rates. During this time, these financial and banking sites would have high values and thus be more likely to be prerendered, thus improving the user experience while searching for a mortgage rate . After completing the home purchase process, the user is likely to lose interest in day to day rate fluctuations, and thus it is no longer optimal to prerender these websites, since the user is unlikely to visit them. As such, providing for a time decay value allows these sites to fall off of the list over time.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 600 for predicting a navigation event based on an aggregate navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 600 is operable to track navigation events voluntarily submitted by users to determine likely navigation patterns.
- the navigation patterns are then analyzed, such as by a server 104, and supplied to the user to facilitate navigation event prediction during the browsing process.
- a server such as the server 104, may send updates to a computing device, such as the computing device 200, as the user browses to different pages, to provide information on which link displayed on a given page is most likely to be selected based on the aggregate navigation history.
- the server 104 receives a set of navigation information comprising a browsing history.
- the browsing history is preferably provided by using an "opt-in/out" method, where the user specifically enables (or disables) reporting functionality to provide elements of their browsing history to the server 104.
- personally identifying data can be anonymized and aggregated before it is stored or used, such that no personal information is stored or accessible.
- a browsing history may be tracked and provided to the server 104 via a browser plug-in or toolbar installed on the user's computing device which tracks the user's browsing history, or by the web browser itself.
- the browsing history may be combined with other received browsing histories to create a set of aggregate data used in a similar manner as the client navigation history described with respect to Figure 4, to predict a likely navigation event.
- the received navigation history may be anonymized to remove any personally identifying information.
- the received navigation history is received with individual URLs and/or transitional URL pairs provided in a hashed data format to remove any personally identifying information prior to transmission to the server 104.
- the server 104 determines a confidence value for each URL on a particular web page, based on the navigation information received at stage 602.
- the server may employ a method similar to that disclosed above with respect to Figure 5 for generating confidence values for URLs on a page, except the navigation events are determined based upon aggregated data instead of specific user data.
- the server 104 may compute confidence values based upon the frequency values derived from the navigation information. In some aspects, confidence values are determined by the percentage of the time that users selected a particular navigation event when they were presented with the choice to select the particular navigation event.
- the transitional URL pairs provide for the determination of a confidence value by dividing a frequency value of a source/destination URL pair by a total number of appearances of the source URL.
- the server may determine navigation events based upon transitions from a first page to a second page, rather than from a pure visit frequency metric.
- the server 104 may maintain an index of web pages and associated URLs and confidence values for each link on the web page, such as in a database. For example, a news site may have five URLs pointing to different news stories.
- the server 104 may receive aggregate data indicating that one of the five news stories is selected 60% of the time, with the other four being selected 10% of the time each. As such, the server 104 would index the page in a database with a 60% likelihood for the first story link, and 10% likelihoods for each of the other four story links .
- the server 104 maintains history data in a confidential manner, such as by converting each URL to a hash value at stage 606.
- the server 104 may provide predicted URL data to a client device without disclosing any personal user data. For example, a user may visit a banking web page that has a particular user name and password login. Depending upon the user, the banking web page may provide URLs to each account the user possesses. Each user accessing the page may have a different set of links provided, depending upon the accounts the user has with the bank.
- the server 104 may provide confidence values that are not associable to links on the page unless the user also possesses access to the same links (e.g., the client can apply the hash function to links they already possess on the currently viewed page to determine if the confidence values apply) .
- the hash value is computed by the computing device 200 prior to sending navigation history data to the server 104. In this manner, the server 104 may receive the navigation history data in the hashed format, without the need to compute a hash value .
- the server 104 transmits the hash values and confidence values associated with the hash values to a client device, such as the computing device 200.
- the transmittal may be in response to a request from the computing device 200 for a particular URL.
- the server 104 may transmit the hash values and confidence values in response to a request for such values from a service executing on the client device 200. For example, when the computing device 200 requests the news web page described above, the server 104 provides the hash values and confidence values for the five story links present on that page.
- the computing device 200 may also request data for particular link hash values by first generating a hash value on the client side, then requesting a confidence value for the particular hash value from the server 104.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 700 for computing a confidence value for navigation events associated with a URL using an aggregate navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 700 serves to compare navigation events from a given URL received from a plurality of users, in order to determine how likely each individual navigation event is .
- the confidence values may be determined in relation to a particular "source" web page, with different confidence values for each URL depending upon the page the user is currently viewing. For example, the confidence values may be used above as described with respect to stage 604 of the method 600 (see Figure 6) .
- the server 104 examines received browsing histories and computes a number of instances for each navigation event as associated with a particular URL.
- the instance value may be a percentage or a raw number .
- the server 104 may determine if the number of visits to the URL exceeds a minimum threshold of statistical significance. For example, five visits to a particular URL may not provide statistically significant data sufficient to reasonably predict a likely navigation event away from the URL. For example, if the number of instances of the event is less than 1000, the server 104 may proceed to stage 710, and not calculate a probability for the event because the sample size is insufficient.
- the server 104 may determine if a minimum number of users have submitted data regarding the URL to provide statistically significant data. For example, the method 700 may require that at least 50 users have provided data in order to compute and store a confidence value for the navigation event. Otherwise the method 700 may proceed to stage 710 and disregard the event until a sufficient number of users have provided data. As above, the threshold value may fluctuate depending upon the size of the dataset .
- the server 104 determines a window size of recent instances.
- the window size refers to the number of latest visits to the URL that will be examined to determine the confidence value, or a length of time to search back through the instances.
- the window size may be determined based on the amount of traffic the URL receives, how often the content of the URL changes. For example, a news website that has constantly changing content might require a small instance window, because links from the regularly changing URL would grow stale. A website with a small amount of traffic would typically require a longer window size in order to gather enough results for statistical significance.
- the window size might be set at 50 instances, 100 instances, 1000 instances, all instances within the last hour, within the last day, within the last week, or the like .
- the server 104 computes the number of times each particular navigation event, such as the next URL visited for the current URL, occurs within the instances defined by the window size determined at stage 710. For example, out of 1000 visits to a news website, a particular article might be selected 600 times, resulting in a confidence value of 60% for navigating to that article from the URL. While the present example primarily relates to determination of a navigation event based upon a number of accesses as a percentage of total navigation events, additional heuristics may also be used to derive the likely event based upon information supplied by the user, such as the previous navigation event (e.g. the website that led to the currently analyzed URL), the time of day (e.g. users are more likely to check news sites when in the morning when they arrive at work), the user's location (e.g. users in a particular geographic region are likely to check sports scores for local teams), or other demographic information.
- the previous navigation event e.g. the website that led to the currently analyzed URL
- the time of day e.g.
- the server 104 optionally compares the confidence values for the navigations events from the URL with a threshold value. If the confidence values do not meet the threshold value, the server 104 may identify a subset of available navigation events, as possible predicted likely navigation events. In this manner the server 104 avoids predicting navigation events when the event does not have a statistically significant likelihood of occurring, thus potentially saving bandwidth on prerender operations on pages that are unlikely to be visited.
- the threshold may be set at a variety of different values, such as 5%, 25%, 50%, or 75%. In some aspects, the threshold may be dynamically altered based upon the number of navigation links present at the URL, the type of URL, the traffic of the URL, the speed at which content changes at the URL, and the like. If the confidence values do not meet the minimum threshold, the server 104 may filter out the possible events that do not meet the minimum threshold.
- the method 700 ends after computing and storing the confidence values for the navigation events associated with the URL.
- Figure 8A is a flow diagram depicting an example method 800 for predicting a navigation event based on an aggregate navigation history using hash values to anonymously manage link data in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 800 provides logic by which a computing device 200 may predict a navigation event based upon data received from a server 104, such as the data generated by the method 700 described with respect to Figure 7.
- the computing device 200 receives a set of data from a remote server 104, the set of data comprising information associated with an aggregate browsing history of a web page.
- This aggregate data may be received in response to a request made by the computing device 200 in response to navigating to a particular web page .
- the aggregate data may represent a collection of data received by a remote server from a plurality of users.
- a web browser plug-in may allow the user to "opt-in/out" of functionality that may send their anonymized navigation history to a remote server.
- the remote server may then collect navigation histories from a plurality of users, stored as an aggregate navigation history, such as described above (see Figure 7) .
- the navigation prediction module 208 may generate a request to the server 104 every time the user navigates to a web page, for the aggregate browsing data associated with that web page. The navigation prediction module 208 may then predict a likely next navigation event using the received data, so as to supply the prerender module with a next page to prerender to improve the browsing experience.
- the computing device 200 associates the received hash values and confidence values with the links present on the current URL.
- the computing device computes a hash value for each link on the current page using the same hash function as used by the server 104 to anonymize the link data.
- the hash value is computed on the computing device prior to sending navigation history data to the server. In such cases, the hash value would match the original computed value determined by the computing device prior to the navigation event being transmitted to the server, rather than a value computed on the server .
- the computing device 200 compares the computed hash values with the received hash values from the server 104. In this manner, the computing device 200 may match the confidence values and hash values received from the server 104 with the links available for the user to select on the currently viewed web page. The confidence values indicate a likelihood that a particular navigation event associated with the hash value will be selected. The computing device 200 may thus map the currently viewable links with the received confidence values.
- the computing device 200 identifies the link or links with the highest confidence value or values as the predicted next navigation event.
- the method 800 ends after predicting the next navigation event .
- Figure 8B is an illustration of an example interface 810 of a web browser employing an example method for predicting a user navigation event based on a navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the illustration depicts a web browser interface 810 displaying a web site and a set of navigation history data 812.
- the web page 810 comprises one or more links 814, 816, 818, 820. These links 814, 816, 818, 820 may be URLs that, when selected by a user, direct the web browser to display a set of content associated with the selected link.
- the navigation history data 812 comprises data associated with the links 814, 816, 818, and two other links, Link E and Link F that are not present for the current user viewing the page.
- the navigation history data 812 may represent an analysis of the individual user's navigation history (See Figures 4-5), or an aggregate navigation history (See Figures 6- 8) .
- the navigation history 812 comprises information about the links 814, 816, 818, and a confidence value associated with each link .
- the navigation history 812 may be used by other aspects of a computing device 200, such as the navigation prediction module 208, to predict the next navigation event.
- Link D 820 does not have any associated data stored in the navigation history 812.
- the lack of data for Link D 820 may be explained in a variety of manners, such as that the chance of selection of Link D 820 is below a threshold value, or that no data has been submitted for Link D 820.
- the navigation history 812 also displays a non-zero chance of selecting two links that are not present, Link E and Link F. These links may have been removed from the web page in an update, or they may not be visible to all users, such as the user currently accessing the page.
- the navigation prediction module 208 identifies Link B 814 as a predicted next navigation event because the confidence value of Link B 814 is greater than the values for Link A 812 and Link C 818.
- Figure 9 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 900 for predicting a navigation event based on data entered within a text field in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 900 when executed by a client device such as the computing device 200, is operable to predict a next navigation event based upon text entry.
- the client device 200 may then predict the next likely navigation event by comparing the entered text with a set of historical navigation data.
- the computing device 200 monitors entry within a text field, such as a URL navigation bar in a web browser, or a query entry field on a search engine page.
- the text entry may comprise a destination, such as a typed URL, a search query to be submitted to a search engine, or other data entered within a web form.
- the computing device 200 predicts a navigation event based upon the entered text. For example, the computing device 200 may compare the entered text with a user browsing history. As the user enters text, the computing device 200 may search the user browsing history to compare the partially entered text with previously visited web pages . For example, the user may enter "www.
- the computing device 200 may predict that the user has begun typing "www.google.com” based upon the user's past visits to www.google.com.
- the user may enter a partial query into a search engine query entry field. As the user enters the query, the browser may begin prerendering a results page for the most likely queries associated with the text that the user has entered.
- the navigation events as identified at stage 906 are provided as the predicted navigation events to be used elsewhere, such as provided by the navigation prediction module 208 and used by the prerender module 210 to prerender the predicted content.
- FIG 10 is an illustration of an example web browser interface 1000 employing an example method for predicting a user navigation event based on data entered within a text field in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the illustration depicts a web browser interface 1000 and a set of links associated with confidence values 1002.
- a web browser associated with the web browser interface 1000 may execute on the computing device 200 as described above.
- the web browser interface 1000 comprises a text entry field 1004.
- the text entry field 1004 is an address bar for entering a URL.
- the text entry field 1004 may be part of a web page, such as a search string entry field on a search engine web site.
- the computing device 200 determines a most likely destination from the entered text. For example, the user may enter the word "Pizza" in the text entry field 1004. Based upon the user's intent to navigate to a page related to Pizza, the system determines there is an 80% chance the user wishes to navigate to "joespizza.com", and a 10% chance to navigate to each of "davespizza.com” or “stevespizza.com”. The percentage values for each link may be determined by a variety of data analysis methods, taking into account factors such as the user's navigation history, an aggregate navigation history, sponsorship from various result web pages, and the like. In the previous example, "joespizza.com” would be identified as the predicted navigation event based upon the fact that it is associated with the highest percentage.
- FIG 11 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 1100 for generating navigation history data used to predict a user navigation event in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 1100 collects data regarding user browsing habits to assist with the prediction of navigation events used in a prerender operation.
- the method 1100 locally stores text that a user enters within a text field to perform navigation operations.
- the text field prompts the user with possible destinations associated with the entered text. For example, if the user begins to type "www. goo" in the text field, the text field may prompt the user with a link to navigate to "www.google.com".
- aspects of the method 1100 track the text that the user entered and whether or not the user selected a particular link in order to assist with the prediction of later link selections based on text entry.
- web browsers typically allow a user to enter text in an address field. Some web browsers display possible destinations in response to text entries within this address field. The possible destinations may be determined by a variety of methods, such as by examining a user's personal browsing history, querying a search engine, using an aggregate browsing history, or any other method of identifying possible destinations based on text input.
- the text entered into a text field such as the text entry field 1004 (see Figure 10) is tracked. For example, the user may enter "www.g" in the text field.
- potential destinations are displayed to the user based on the entered text. For example, the user may be presented with a list of URLs that begin with the letter "G" in response to the text "www.g".
- one of the displayed links may be selected. For example, the user may select a link for one of the websites beginning with the letter "G" if the website to which the user intends to navigate is displayed from among the displayed destinations.
- the text input and the selected destination are stored for later reference.
- This pair of inputs may be saved in a probability map.
- this probability map may be updated for every navigation event.
- the probability map may include data for every text input to the text field, a top selected suggested destination displayed in response to the text input, and a frequency of the number of times the user has selected the top suggested destination and the number of times the user has not selected the top selected destination. The frequency data is thus indexed by the text entry. Such data may be used to determine a probability that the user will visit the displayed top destination when a given set of text is entered into the text field.
- the probability map may also be indexed by a pair of values corresponding to the text entry and the displayed top destination, where the displayed destination is determined based on user browsing history, results received from a search engine, or another method.
- the probability map may also be indexed by a more complex key.
- the key may also contain information as to whether the user explicitly requested a search query (e.g., by prefixing the text entry with '?'), or if the text query is determined to be a search query by other means .
- the user does not select one of the displayed destinations, then at stage 1110 the text input and the fact that the user did not select any of the displayed destinations are saved in the probability map. Additional text input continues to be tracked, such that a text entry of "www. go" is indexed as a different value in the probability map from "www.g" with a corresponding unique probability value associated with displayed results.
- Figure 12 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 1200 for predicting a user navigation event using navigation history data based on text entry within a text field in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 1200 functions to determine a most likely destination based on text input to a text field. Aspects of the method 1200 may utilize probability map data, such as the data captured by the method 1100 as described above (see Figure 11) . Aspects of the method 1200 may predict a particular destination link as a viable prerendering candidate by comparing the probability of a particular destination with a threshold value.
- text input to a text field is tracked to correlate the entered text with a probability map.
- the text entered is correlated to the text entries by which the probability map is indexed.
- the probability map may be consulted to retrieve the counts for the given text input and/or displayed top result.
- the probability of a given website may be determined in response to a text entry by looking up the data associated with the text entry in the probability map.
- the text entry may result in the display of one or more possible destinations, and the text entry and the top displayed possible destination may be used to look up the data within the probability map.
- the probability that the user will select a particular web page may be determined by examining the frequency with which the user has selected the particular page.
- the probability data may include the frequency with which the user has selected a web page in response to a particular text input.
- the probability that the user will select the particular web page may be determined by examining the number of times the user has selected the web page, divided by the sum of the number of times the user has selected the web page, and the number of times the user has not selected the web page.
- a formula for determining a probability of selection of a given displayed link may be determined as :
- P is the probability that the particular page will be selected in response to the text entry. Selected is the number of times the particular page was selected when displayed in response to the text entry. Unselected is the number of times the page was not selected when displayed in response to the text entry .
- the probability value is compared to a threshold value.
- a threshold value may be used in this manner to ensure that the particular page is only preloaded when there is a reasonable likelihood that the user intends to navigate to the particular page. This process saves system resources and bandwidth by not prerendering pages that the user is unlikely to access .
- the particular web page identified by the probability map is prerendered if the probability value exceeds the threshold value.
- the web page may be prerendered when the probability value p exceeds .5, .95, .99, or any other value as determined by the prerender module 210 or configuration settings.
- the threshold value may be configurable by the user, such as by a configuration setting, or dynamically determined based on a system resource level. In some aspects, all destination web pages that have a probability value greater than the threshold value may be prerendered. In some aspects, the decision to prerender a web page may be determined by available system resources, such as memory, processor utilization, network bandwidth, and the like.
- the method 1200 ends.
- the method 1200 may continuously repeat as additional characters are entered and removed from the text entry field. Pages that are prerendered via this process may be discarded as additional characters are entered.
- the systems and methods described above advantageously provide for an improved browsing experience .
- the browser can perform prerender operations to minimize the amount of time users wait for web pages to load.
- Multiple methods to perform the prerender operations provide a flexible and robust system for determining the next navigation event.
