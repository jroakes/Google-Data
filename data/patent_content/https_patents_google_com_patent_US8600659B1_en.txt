Definitions
- the present disclosure generally relates to location based services and, in particular, to identifying points of interest.
- Location based services are often used to identify points of interest near a location. For example a user may search for a point of interest (e.g., a restaurant, gym, or market) near a particular location (e.g., the user's current location). Location based services may also be used to determine a route from a starting location to a destination. However, it may be more convenient for a user to be shown points of interest that are along a route to a destination (e.g., a commute route between work and home) so that a user may go to the points of interest on the way to or from the destination.
- a route to a destination e.g., a commute route between work and home
- a system for identifying points of interest may include an interface module, a route module, a search module, and a rank module.
- the interface module may be configured to receive a request to identify points of interest along a route, the request including a predetermined distance and a search term.
- the route module may be configured to obtain, from a database, a set of nodes along the route.
- the search module may be configured to perform, for each node in the set of nodes, a search for points of interest within the predetermined distance of the node based on the search term.
- the rank module may be configured to prioritize the points of interest identified by the search. After the points of interest are prioritized, the interface module may output the prioritized points of interest.
- a method for identifying points of interest may include receiving a request to identify points of interest along a route, the request including a set of search parameters.
- a set of travel decision nodes along the route may be identified and a search may be performed to identify points of interest based on the set of search parameters, each of the points of interest within a predetermined distance of a travel decision node in the set of travel decision nodes.
- the points of interest identified by the search may be outputted.
- a machine-readable medium including instructions stored therein, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations for identifying points of interest.
- the operations may include receiving a route indication and a set of search parameters, generating a route based on the route indication, identifying a set of nodes along the route, and, for each node in the set of nodes, identifying points of interest that conform to the set of search parameters and are near the node.

- FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a computer system with which any of the clients and servers of FIG. 1 may be implemented.
- systems and methods for identifying points of interest along a route are disclosed. Being able to identify points of interest along a route allows users to find and choose a point of interest to go to while on the way to a destination. For example, a user may easily identify a dry cleaner that is convenient to stop at on the way to work, a gym or market that is convenient to stop at on the way home, a restaurant to stop and eat at that is on the way to a destination, etc. This may be especially helpful for users who take public transportation (e.g., trains, subways, buses, etc.) and would like to identify points of interest at one or more stops along their route.
- the identified points of interest along a route may also be ranked and displayed to a user such that the user may be able to quickly determine the closest or most convenient point of interest to go to.
- FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating a network environment 100 for identifying points of interest along a route, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a client-server network environment 200

- client applications 110 may include, but are not limited to, a mapping application, local search application, or a browser.
- a user interface of the client application 110 may be used by a user to input route parameters by, for example, inputting a starting point and a destination or by selecting a predefined route.
- the user may also input one or more search parameters into the user interface and transmit a search request for points of interest along the route that match those search parameters to the server 115 via the network 150 .
- the network 150 can include, for example, any one or more of a cellular network, a satellite network, a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, the network 150 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.

- the network 150 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.
- the server 115 may be any system or device having a processor, a memory, and communications capability that may be used to identify points of interest along a route.
- the server 115 may be a virtual entity that might refer to a cluster or even multiple clusters of servers.
- the server 115 may include an interface module 120 , a route module 125 , a search module 130 , and a rank module 140 .
- the modules illustrated in FIG. 1 may include software instructions encoded in a medium and executed by a processor, computer hardware components, or a combination of both.
- the modules may each include one or more processors or memories that are used to perform the functions described below.
- the various systems and modules may share one or more processors or memories.
- the interface module 120 may be configured to communicate with other systems (e.g., client devices), servers, and other modules. For example, the interface module may receive a search request for points of interest along a route from a client device 105 .
- the search request may include route parameters and search parameters that may be used to identify points of interest for the user.
- Route parameters may include a starting point and an ending point or a predefined route such as a saved route, favorite route, or frequently used route.
- the search parameters may include one or more search strings, a category of point of interest (e.g., restaurant, market, park, etc.), a desired distance range from the route in which to search (e.g., within 1 mile, within a 15 minute walking distance, etc.), a mode of transportation (e.g., walking, driving, bus, train, any public transportation means, etc.), or any other parameter that may be associated with a point of interest (e.g., low prices, special deals, online reviews, etc.).
- a category of point of interest e.g., restaurant, market, park, etc.
- a desired distance range from the route in which to search e.g., within 1 mile, within a 15 minute walking distance, etc.
- a mode of transportation e.g., walking, driving, bus, train, any public transportation means, etc.
- any other parameter that may be associated with a point of interest e.g., low prices, special deals, online reviews, etc.
- the route module 125 may be configured to identify a route based on the route parameters and obtain a set of nodes along the route that will be used to find points of interest along the route. In the case where a user selects a predefined route, the route module 125 may simply find nodes along the selected route. However, if the routing parameters include a starting point and an ending point instead, the route module 125 may generate one or more routes from the starting point to the ending point based on existing mapping data from a mapping database. In some cases the route module 125 may also need to factor in one or more search parameters in generating the route.
- the route module 125 may need to generate a route from the starting point to the ending point using public transportation pathways in the mapping data (e.g., bus lines, rail lines, etc.). Once the route is generated, the route module 125 may identify nodes along the generated route.
- public transportation pathways e.g., bus lines, rail lines, etc.
- the route module 125 may identify nodes along the route in various ways.
- the nodes may be, for example, a random selection of points along the route, uniformly spaced points along the route, notable points along the route (e.g., freeway exits or interchanges, intersections, landmarks, decision points along the route, etc.), or other points along the route.
- the nodes may be generated by the routing module 125 or predetermined and retrieved from a database.
- the nodes may be public transportation stops (e.g., bus stops, train stations, subway or light rail stops, etc.) that are obtained from a public transportation network database that may include information on public transportation paths, the stops on those paths, and the schedule for the public transportation routes.
- the search module 130 may then perform a search for points of interest near the nodes along the route based on the search parameters.
- the search parameters may include search strings, a category of point of interest, a desired distance range from the route in which to search, a mode of transportation, or any other parameter that may be associated with a point of interest.
- the search parameters may include the search string “gym” and a 15 minute walking distance.
- the search module may search areas that are within 15 minute walking distance a node along the route for points of interest associated with the search term “gym.”
- Each of the search results that are generated may include a target (e.g., a desired point of interest), the node from which the target was found, and the distance between the target and the node.
- the points of interest in the search results generated by the search module 130 may then be ranked by the rank module 140 .
- the points of interest may be ranked based on, for example, the distance between each point of interest and the node from which the point of interest was found.
- a point of interest may also be ranked based on the distance from the point of interest to the route starting point or the route destination.
- a point of interest in the search results may also be ranked based on whether the node from which the point of interest was found is a transition point in a route.
- a transition point in the route may be any location where the route calls for a transition from one mode of transportation to another (e.g., from a bus line to a subway line) or a transition within the same mode of transportation (e.g., from one subway line to another subway line).
- the route is a public transportation route (e.g., a combination of one or more of a bus route, subway route, etc.)
- the points of interest in the search results may also be ranked based on the frequency of service of the public transportation at the node from which the point of interest was found.
- the search results may be transmitted to the client device 105 by the interface module 210 .
- FIG. 2 may help to illustrate an example of nodes and points of interest along a route.
- FIG. 2 is a conceptual representation 200 of a route 205 , in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- the route module 125 may obtain a set of nodes along the route, which may include the starting point 210 and the ending point 215 .
- the route module 125 may query a public transportation network database for subway stops 220 , 225 , and 230 along the route 205 .
- the subway stops 220 , 225 , and 230 may be used by the route module 125 as nodes along the route 205 .
- the search module 130 may search for points of interest in the vicinity of each of the nodes based on the search parameters. For example, the search module 130 may search for markets 250 within a 15 minute walking distance of the route 205 and generate search results that may be ranked by the rank module 140 and transmitted to the client device 105 for display to a user.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a process 300 for identifying points of interest along a route, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. Although the operations in process 300 are shown in a particular order, certain operations may be performed in different orders or at the same time.
- the process 300 may begin at operation 305 , where the interface module 120 may receive a request to identify points of interest along a route from a client device 105 .
- the request may include route parameters that may be used to identify the route on which to base a search for points of interest and search parameters that may be used to perform the search.
- the route module 125 may identify a route on which to base the search for points of interest.
- the route 205 may be selected by the user or generated by the route module 125 based on a starting point 210 and an ending point 215 .
- the route module 125 may obtain mapping information from a mapping database that includes information on a network of navigable pathways that may be used to travel from one location to another.
- the network of navigable pathways may be represented as a graph of nodes and edges, with different weights associated with each edge. The weights may represent a distance, a travel time, or some other cost.
- the route module 125 may use a path finding algorithm (e.g., the Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm) to find an optimal route (e.g., the shortest route, the fastest route, the lowest cost route, the route with the least number of transitions, etc.) on the network of navigable pathways from the starting point 210 to the ending point 215 .
- a path finding algorithm e.g., the Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm
- the interface module 120 may receive a series of GPS signals from a mobile device of the user. Based on the location coordinates of the GPS signals, the route module 125 may identify paths frequently traveled by the user and generate a route for the user based on the frequently traveled paths.
- the route module 125 may obtain a set of nodes along the route at operation 315 .
- the nodes may be a set of points along the route that are selected by the route module 125 for any number of reasons.
- a database containing predefined nodes may also be queried in order to obtain the set of nodes along the route.
- the nodes may be public transportation stops (e.g., bus stops, train stations, subway or light rail stops, etc.) that are obtained from a public transportation network database.
- the search module 130 may perform a search for points of interest near each node based on the search parameters associated with the request. For example the search module 130 may search for all gyms within a mile of one of the nodes along the route or any markets within a 15 minute walking distance of one of the nodes along the route. As will be further illustrated by FIG. 4 , a walking distance for a given time may be the distance along a walkable path in the mapping data that is able to be traveled by walking in a certain period of time.
- FIG. 4 is a conceptual representation 400 of a route 405 , in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- the route 405 may have nodes that include the starting point 410 , the ending point 415 , and subway stops 420 , 425 , and 430 along the route 405 .
- Market 450 may have been found by searching for points of interest near subway stop 420
- market 455 may have been found by searching for points of interest near subway stop 425
- market 460 may have been found by searching for points of interest near ending point 415 .
- the walking distance from a node, subway stop 420 , and market 450 may be the shortest distance on a walkable path between the two locations. In FIG. 4 , this is represented by the walkable route 465 .
- the mapping data may include highway 460 , highway 460 is not included in the walkable route 465 because highway 460 does not allow pedestrian access.
- the walking distance represented by walkable route 465 may be in the form of a distance (e.g., subway stop 420 is 1 kilometer away from the market 450 ) or a time (e.g., it would take 13 minutes to walk from the subway stop 420 to the market 450 , in other words, the subway stop 420 is a 13 minute walking distance away from the market 450 ).
- the rank module 140 may rank the points of interest at operation 325 .
- the points of interest in the search results may be ranked based on any characteristic or combination of characteristics associated with each point of interest. How the points of interest are ranked may also be based on preferences or settings selected by a user.
- the rank module 140 may rank the points of interest by calculating a score for each point of interest.
- the scores may be based on a formula that assigns various weights to various factors or signals.
- f 1 , f 2 , and f 3 are factors (e.g., distance from the point of interest to a node, distance from the point of interest to a route transition point, the degree the point of interest matches the search parameters, point of interest ratings, etc.) and w 1 , w 2 , and w 3 are weights assigned to the factors.
- the relative rank of each point of interest may be based on the score for each point of interest.
- one of the factors that may be used to rank points of interest is the distance from each point of interest to the node from which the point of interest was found or a distance from each point of interest to the starting point or ending point of the route.
- the market 450 may be ranked higher than the market 455 because market 455 is closer to the node from which the market 455 was found (e.g., subway stop 425 ) than market 450 is from the node from which the market 450 was found (e.g., subway stop 420 ).
- market 460 may be ranked higher than market 455 even if they are similar distances from the nodes from which each was found because market 460 is closer to an ending point than market 455 .
- Points of interest near the starting point and ending point of a route may be prioritized over other points of interest in some cases because it may be more convenient for users to stop by a point of interest at the beginning or end of a route.
- a point of interest in the search results may also be ranked based on whether the node from which the point of interest was found is a route transition point.
- a route transition point may be a point in the route where a user changes modes of transportation (e.g., from car to train) or changes paths within the same mode of transportation (e.g., from one subway line to another subway line).
- Points of interest near nodes that are route transition points may be favored over other nodes in some cases because it may be more convenient for a user to stop at a point of interest at the transition point, where the user must transition anyway, rather than having to make a stop at another point in the route.
- FIG. 5 may help to illustrate.
- FIG. 5 is a conceptual representation 400 of a route from a starting point 510 to an ending point 515 , in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology.
- One route may begin with starting point 510 , go through subway stops 520 , 525 , 530 , and end at ending point 515 .
- subway stop 525 may be a route transition point because a user must change from one subway line to another at subway stop 525 .
- points of interest found by searching for points of interest near subway stop 525 may be preferred over other points of interest found from searching other nodes in the route.
- a point of interest in the search results may also be ranked based on the schedule of service of the node from which the point of interest was found. For example, points of interest near nodes with frequent service may be preferred over other points of interest near nodes with less frequent service because, in some cases, it may be more convenient for a user to stop at a point of interest if the public transportation stop has frequent service.
- Service schedules and frequency may be obtained, for example, by querying the public transportation network database.
- FIG. 5 may help to illustrate ranking points of interest based on frequency of service for a node.
- one route begins with starting point 510 , goes through subway stops 520 , 525 , 530 , and end at ending point 515 .
- Another route begins with starting point 510 , goes through subway stop 535 , and ends at ending point 515 .
- subway stop 535 has a scheduled subway car stop, on average, once every 5 minutes and subway stop 520 has a subway car stop, on average, once every 10 minutes, it may be more convenient for a user to stop by a point of interest near subway stop 535 .
- points of interest found near subway stop 535 may be favored over points of interest near subway stop 520 .
- the search results may be formalized and transmitted to a client application 110 to be displayed to a user.
- a search result interface that includes the ranked points of interest (e.g., a ranked list of points of interest or a map interface showing the points of interest) may be generated and transmitted to the client application 110 to be displayed to the user.
- GPS global positioning system
- coordinates may be used.
- one or more other technologies can be used in addition to or instead of GPS to determine location coordinates representing a geographic location.
- location coordinates may be analyzed as discussed herein to identify frequently traveled paths based on mapping data stored in a database and identify points of interest regardless of the technology or technologies used to determine the location coordinates.
- location data may be on an opt-in basis so that data is not collected unless the user has granted permission, with the location data stored and handled in a secure manner.
- steps can be taken to anonymize the location data (e.g., to ensure that the location data cannot be tied to a particular user and/or to a particular device).
