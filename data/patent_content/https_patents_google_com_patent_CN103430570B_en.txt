Jing indicates to lack interest relatively high or lowly to the school including VOD content project, program etc., then can be by VOD content project
Priority adjust up or down.
In another embodiment, each user of social networking system 160 can be distributed to the social activity of himself by ranking
Network friend, for example, generally share navigation interest with particular social network friend based on whether user is aware of him.In some realities
Apply in example, friend's (for example, general character based on navigation interest) of low ranking can result in the low ranking friend as request user
All downloads be rejected.For example, content is distributed to based on by zero or negative priority value, the content can be rejected.Another
In embodiment, the relatively high or low friend of ranking causes to distribute to corresponding higher or lower priority the friend as please
All VOD content projects of user are sought, thus affects that what VOD content project is received download.
In certain embodiments, fine granularity priority can be distributed to more low priority content item.In illustrative reality
Apply in example, it is assumed that than the content item of precedence record, new content item is more received in the social networks friend of user 120
Welcome requested；Naturally, user 120 may more preferred new content item.So in embodiment, when viewer's
During 114 no sufficient spaces of STB record new content item, which can pass through to cover lower priority (example buffered earlier
Such as, it is less popular) content item come create abundance space.
In step 435, in certain embodiments, determined based on the priority in step 430, STB 114 can refuse
Add multicast conversation (for example, no matter whether which has available required storage resource).For example, in certain embodiments,
If content has been allocated zero or negative preferred value, the content is rejected.If content is rejected, the method 400 skips to step
Rapid 490 and terminate.If content is not rejected, method 400 is carried out to step 440.
In step 440, FTP client FTP 130 is determined if with the enough sheets that can be used for storage VOD content project
