Specific embodiment
It is referred in a general way attached drawing, provides the various demonstrative systems that can be used for providing adaptive user interface (UI) and side
Method, adaptive user interface limit transmitted data amount when passing through communication network transmission data packet to realize the interface.Adaptively
User interface includes that (for example, via client terminal device of user) is supplied to any kind of interface of user, wherein can repair
Change one or more UI components comprising different types of content.Different UI components can be used to provide improved user's body
It tests.For example, certain form of UI component can be designed as helping prevent unexpected click on content user's selectable portion and/or
Improved experience (logging in face for example, opening in new interface) is provided in the case where project is by unexpected click.
By transmitted data on network item with realize such adaptive UI may increase significantly for realizing feature and because
This passes through the data volume of network transmission.For example, for realizing improved interface data item usually than do not include enhancing feature
Other data item utilize bigger payload or transmitted data amount.When transmission mass data item is to realize on many devices
Improved interface when, total increased payload may be very big.Therefore, although UI component can improve use in some aspects
Family experience, but larger data item, which is transferred to a large amount of user group, to be reduced the available bandwidth on network and negatively affects
Network efficiency.In some cases, the maintenance cost that may cause network to the influence of network, which increases or negatively affects, to be made
With the experience (for example, delay when due to load webpage or other interfaces increases) of the user of network.In addition, can be used with other
Payload is compared, and the increased data for the client terminal device being transferred on network are needed and used additional on client terminal device
Computing resource (for example, memory resource).
According to various implementations, the system and method for the disclosure provide provides adaptive UI on a communication network.It passes
Defeated system identification can be used for being transferred to multiple data files of client terminal device.Each data file is configured as causing client
Device shows different UI components.Each data file is as one or more data with payload or transmitted data amount
The set of packet is transferred to client terminal device, and payload is different between data file.For example, the first data file can
To cause client terminal device to show basic UI component and can have the first payload.Second data file can cause visitor
Family end device shows the UI of the enhancing with the one or more features different from basic interface, and the second data file can be with
With the second payload for being greater than the first payload.
Transmission system is selected using the attribute of client terminal device and/or the attribute of user associated with client terminal device
It is transferred to the data file of client terminal device.In some implementations, Transmission system determines that user selects unintentionally the use of UI
A possibility that component may be selected in family.For example, transmitting device can obtain the data that instruction user takes the frequency of movement, the movement
Instruction user has selected unintentionally option, such as after selection causes browser to navigate to the project of different web pages, user
Select the frequency of the Back button of browser interface.If user selects the number/high percentage of the Back button in threshold value,
Then this may indicate that user is easy to unexpectedly options when user is desirably maintained in current page rather than navigates to new page
Mesh.In some implementations, possibility can with device-based attribute, such as identification device attribute device identification,
A possibility that attribute instruction user of the device selects unintentionally the user of user interface that component may be selected increase.The attribute of device
It can for example indicate input type associated with device.In this way it is possible to be interacted not analyzing with the device of user
A possibility that user selects unintentionally user's optional content is determined in the case where associated existing information.
In some such implementations, Transmission system selects unintentionally the at user option component of UI based on user
A possibility that and select the data file for being transferred to client terminal device.For example, Transmission system can be in response to determining that user is not intended to
A possibility that component may be selected in middle selection user selects the first number for being configured as realizing the first UI component lower than threshold level
According to item.In some implementations, the first UI component may include user's selectable portion, user's selectable portion in response to
The selection of user and cause the interface (for example, current tab or window of browser application) of client terminal device from current
Page navigation is to new page.Transmission system can be in response to determining that a possibility that user selects unintentionally user that component may be selected is high
The second data item for being configured as realizing the 2nd UI component is selected in threshold level.Second data item can have than the first number
According to the higher transmission payload of item, and the 2nd UI component may include feature, and this feature is designed to for being easy to mistake
Ground selects the user of the item in UI to improve user experience.For example, in some implementations, the 2nd UI component includes that user is optional
Part is selected, when user's selectable portion is selected, causes the interface of client terminal device to be opened and is wherein showing new login
The new interface (for example, new browser options card or window) of the page, and current page is retained in current interface (example
Such as, current tab/window).In some implementations, user's selectable portion of second contact surface component can additionally or
Checking assembly alternatively is provided in selection, such as requiring user's checking, he/her intends options and navigates to new page.Cause
This, in some implementations, the second data item of higher payload is transferred to the visitor that desired user benefits from UI enhancing
Family end device.
In some implementations, Transmission system can having based on client terminal device/user attribute and data file
Effect loads the two to select the data file for being transferred to client terminal device.For example, it is contemplated that the data available item being wherein used for transmission
Comprising the first elementary item with 100kB payload, the Section 2 with 300kB payload and there is 2MB payload
Section 3 example.Transmission system can choose Section 2 to be used for transmission client terminal device, in the client terminal device
User is confirmed as the middle equally likely possibility with the optional component of user for selecting UI unintentionally.Transmission system can be configured as
Section 3 is not selected, because additional 1.7MB needed for transmission Section 3 cannot be because of the increased use between second and Section 3
Family experience improves and rationalizes.
The adaptive UI feature of the disclosure allows Transmission system reducing the data volume by communication network transmission to realize
In the case where the user interface on client terminal device, UI enhancing is provided to various users.When desired UI component is beneficial
(for example, when desired UI component enhances user experience in a meaningful way), Transmission system can be transmitted with higher effectively
The data item of load, and when prospective earnings are lower (for example, when user experience is less likely by related to higher payload
When the UI component of connection meaningfully enhances) the different data item with lower payload can be transmitted.In this way, it passes
Defeated system can balance to different user and provide the technical costs of UI component of enhancing and associated with the UI component of the enhancing
Technology income.
The system being discussed herein is collected and/or utilized the personal information about user or can use personal information
The case where, chance can be provided a user with control whether there is or not can collect personal information (for example, about user social networks,
Social activity movement or activity, the preference of user, user current location etc. information) program or feature, or with control whether with/
Or how from content server receive may with user more related content.In addition, certain data may store or use it

Fig. 2 is to be used for transmission data file according to illustrative implementation to realize the UI component on client terminal device
Process 200 flow chart.With reference to both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the identification of Transmission system 108 can be used for being transferred to client terminal device 104
Data file 112 (205).Each data file 112 is transferred to client terminal device as the set of one or more data packets
104, and each set of data packet has payload or data volume.For example, in some implementations, data file
112 can be used as Internet protocol (IP) packet transmits on the internet.In some implementations, data file 112 can be each
It is transmitted from as single data packet.In some implementations, some or all of data files 112 can be divided into multiple data
Packet is to be used for transmission client terminal device 104 (for example, having the data file 112 of the payload higher than some threshold value can be with
It is among multiple data packets).In some implementations, database 110 can store the effective of each data file 112
The instruction and data file 112 of load, and Transmission system 108 can determine data available by inquiry database 110
The payload of file 112.Each data file 112 is configured as that client terminal device 104 is caused to show in interface 130 accordingly
UI component.In some implementations, it is understood that there may be client terminal device 104 can be sent to which data file 112
Limitation；For example, particular data file 112 can have associated attribute, designation date file 112 can only be transmitted
To client terminal device 104 and/or the user with certain attributes or characteristic is (for example, particular data file 112 can be restricted to
It is only used for mobile client end device rather than desktop computer).
Transmission system 108 can determine client terminal device and/or the attribute (210) of user.In some implementations, should
Attribute can indicate a possibility that user selects unintentionally user's selectable portion at such as interface at interface 130.For example, attribute
It can indicate that user selects the Back button or is configured as navigating to previous page after the link that selection navigates to new page
Other interface elements in face frequency (for example, be represented as selection " returns " number and non-selected " return " number or
The absolute value or ratio of the sum for the example checked/navigated between the page).In some implementations, which may include
Time component；For example, the attribute can indicate that user selects " return " to press after navigating to new page in threshold amount of time
The frequency of button.In some implementations, which can indicate a possibility that user's selectable portion of user selection interface
(for example, user will select the user of UI component optional if presenting the UI component generated using particular data file 112
A possibility that selecting part such as clicks the inline linking in UI component).In some implementations, which can indicate
A possibility that user will utilize special characteristic associated with certain data files 112 or benefit from it.For example, the attribute can be with
Indicate the frequency for the video that user's viewing is presented in UI (for example, user is to be intended to click view when video is presented in UI
Frequency does not still click video typically to be activated).If particular data file 112 causes client terminal device 104 to generate packet
The UI component of the video containing insertion, then the data file 112 can include significant bigger than not including the UI component of insertion video
Payload.In such an example, in some implementations, if attribute instruction user may select video or completely
Video is watched, although then the very big Transmission system 108 of payload still can choose data file 112, and if attribute indicates
The unlikely viewing video of user or the sub-fraction that may only watch video may not then select data file 112.One
In a little implementations, which can indicate that user shares the possibility of specific UI component or content related with specific UI component
Property.For example, the attribute can be based on work of the user to the frequency, user of content selection " sharing " option on social media network
The quantity of message etc. that jump degree, user are transmitted via messaging service to other users.
Transmission system 108 can be in response to attribute and/or the payload of data file and from data available file 112
Select data file 112 for transmission to client terminal device 104 (215).In some implementations, Transmission system 108 in response to
The attribute and select data file 112.In some implementations, Transmission system 108 can be in response to having the first characteristic
Attribute and select the first data file with the first payload, and can be selected in response to the attribute with the second characteristic
Select the second data file with the second payload (for example, being greater than the first payload).For example, in some implementations
In, which can indicate that user's selection has a possibility that user's selectable portion of UI component at interface.Show such
Example in, according to some implementations, Transmission system 108 in response to instruction user select UI component user's selectable portion can
Energy property is less than or equal to the attribute of threshold value and selects first data file with lower payload (for example, causing client
Device 104 shows the relatively small data file of more basic UI component), and Transmission system 108 selects UI in response to instruction user
A possibility that user's selectable portion of component, selects to have greater than the attribute of threshold value more higher than the first data file effective
Second data file of load is (for example, cause client terminal device show with being not present in the UI component of the first data file
One or more features UI component larger data file, be such as configured as in new interface open login page and will
Current page is retained in the UI component in current interface).
In some implementations, Transmission system 108 is selected in response to payload associated with the data file
Data file 112.For example, in some implementations, Transmission system 108 can determine be transferred to client terminal device 104 can
It include three data files with data file 112, and Transmission system 108 can choose the data text with minimum payload
Part is used for transmission.In various implementations, Transmission system 108 can be used alone payload or make in conjunction with other factors
For selecting data file 112.
In some implementations, Transmission system 108 is in response to attribute associated with the data file 112 and effectively negative
It carries the two and selects data file 112.In some such implementations, Transmission system 108 can be in response to having first
The attribute of feature and select the first data file and the first data file that there is the first payload, in response to second feature
Attribute and select the second data file and the second data file that there is the second payload greater than the first payload, and
Third data file is selected in response to the attribute with third feature and third data file has greater than the second payload
Third payload.For example, in some implementations, if attribute instruction user selects the user of UI component that portion may be selected
A possibility that dividing is less than or equal to first threshold, then Transmission system 108 can choose with the first lesser payload (example
Such as, less than or equal to the payload of the first payload threshold value) the first data file.If attribute indicates that user selects UI
A possibility that user's selectable portion of component, is greater than first threshold but is less than or equal to second threshold, then Transmission system 108 can
To select the second data item of the second payload for having greater than the first payload (for example, Transmission system 108 can choose
With greater than the first payload threshold value and less than or equal to the data item of the payload of the second payload threshold value).If
Attribute indicates that a possibility that user selects user's selectable portion of UI component is greater than second threshold, then Transmission system 108 can be with
Select the third data item for the third payload for having greater than the second payload (for example, Transmission system 108 can choose tool
There is the data item of the payload greater than the second payload threshold value).Although providing about two payload threshold values and two
This example of a attribute thresholds, but can be come with various implementations using any number of threshold value.
Transmission system 108 causes selected data item 112 to be transferred to client terminal device 104 (220).In some realizations
In mode, selected data item 112 is transferred to client terminal device 104 by Transmission system 108 itself.In some implementations
In, data (for example, order) is sent another system by Transmission system 108, is such as configured as mentioning to client terminal device 104
For the Content Management System of data file 112, which is used by another system to transmit selected data item
112。
In some implementations, Transmission system 108, which can be configured as, selectively provides adaptive UI, this is adaptive
UI has the UI component for being designed to improve the user experience for tending to the specific type behavior for user interface, specific type
The behavior such as unexpectedly selectable portion of selection interface.Fig. 3 is the process according to the process 300 of illustrative implementation
Figure, the process 300 be used for selected unintentionally in response to user UI user's selectable portion a possibility that instruction and transmit number
According to file to realize the UI component on client terminal device.With reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, Transmission system 108 can identify be transferred to it is specific
The data available file 112 (305) of client terminal device 104.Data file is configured as that the display of client terminal device 104 is caused to have
The different corresponding UI components of different characteristic.In the implementation shown in, some UI components include to be designed to improve tendency
In the feature of the user experience for the user's selectable portion for selecting user interface unintentionally.For example, a data file can draw
Rise client terminal device 104 display have user's selectable portion UI component, cause when select user's selectable portion and
The login page of UI component liaison appears in the interface different from the active interface of UI component appearance (for example, browser application
The different browsers tabs or browser window of program).Original UI in some such implementations, in active interface
Component can be replaced with new UI component.For example, new UI component can provide selectable portion (for example, button), this be may be selected
Part allows user to share original UI component with other users (for example, via messaging service and/or social media service)
Or content (for example, the particular login page links, the login page of such as original UI component) related with original UI component.?
In another example, data file can cause the display of client terminal device 104 to have the UI component of user's selectable portion, select
Interface assembly when selecting user's selectable portion in activation active interface, the interface assembly require user in client terminal device
104 navigate to new page confirms that user intends to leave the new page in current page to active interface before.UI component wherein
In the implementation replaced by another UI component, another UI is can be used in application program (for example, browser application)
Component replaces a UI component, and original UI component can be used new UI component and replace itself (for example, by transmitting data
To Transmission system 108 or another system, system is caused to return to (one or more) data packet with new UI component, the new UI
Component is for replacing original UI component by any of original UI component or application program) or any other method can
A UI component is replaced to be used to another UI component.
Transmission system 108 determines the attribute for a possibility that instruction user selects unintentionally user's selectable portion of UI
(310).One of a variety of methods can be used or a variety of determine attribute.In some implementations, it can be based on coming from
The input of user determines attribute；For example, user can provide whether user feels that he or she is easy to never, seldom, once in a while, frequently
The instruction that the experience such as numerous are surprisingly clicked.In some implementations, the category can be additionally or alternatively determined in an automatic fashion
Property.It is, for example, possible to use indicate the data of historical act associated with user and/or client terminal device 104 to determine attribute.
Historical act data may include instruction user and the Back button or selection selected to be configured as navigating to new page in selection
The data of the frequency of other interface elements of preceding page are navigate to after link (for example, being represented as time of selection " return "
Several absolute values or ratio with the sum of the number or example checked/navigated between the page of non-selected " return ").?
In some implementations, which may include time component；For example, the attribute can indicate user navigate to new page it
The frequency of the Back button is selected in threshold amount of time afterwards.
Transmission system 108 can determine whether attribute indicates that user selects unintentionally the possibility of user's selectable portion of UI
Property be greater than threshold value possibility (315).For example, in some implementations, Transmission system 108 can determine that historical act data are
No instruction user selects the Back button or navigates back in other ways in selection user's option and after navigating to new page
The percentage of time of the first page is higher than threshold percentage (for example, being greater than 1 15).If possible property is less than or waits
In threshold value, then Transmission system 108 can choose the first data file with first (for example, smaller) payload for transmission to
Client terminal device (320).First data file causes client terminal device 104 to show the first UI component of such as basic module, is somebody's turn to do
Basic module will be designed to improve the one or more features omission for being easy to the user experience of options unintentionally.For example,
In some implementations, the first UI component may include user's selectable portion, cause when selecting user's selectable portion
Application program (for example, browser application) is from the new page (example in the active interface that current page navigates to application program
Such as, active browser tabs/window).
If possible property is greater than threshold value, then Transmission system 108 can choose the text of the second data with the second payload
Part is for transmission to client terminal device (320).Second payload can be greater than the payload of the first data file.Second data
File causes client terminal device 104 to show the 2nd UI component, and the 2nd UI component, which may include to be designed to improve, to be easy to be not intended to
The one or more features of the user experience of middle options.For example, in some implementations, the 2nd UI component may include use
Family selectable portion, cause when selecting user's selectable portion application program (for example, browser application) be in
The different interface in the first interface (for example, active browser tabs/window) of existing UI component is (for example, new browser options
Card/window) in open login page.In such implementation, in the case where selection is mistake, then the first interface retains
In parent page, therefore user does not need to click the Back button to continue to check parent page.In some implementations,
Select the 2nd UI component user's selectable portion when can cause application program display notice, notice request user after
Continuous navigation confirms that he or she wishes to navigate to new page before leaving current page to new page.Once data file has been selected,
Transmission system 108 just causes selected data file to be transferred to client terminal device 104 (330).
In the various implementations being discussed above, data file may include any kind of content and/or be configured
To realize any various features.In some implementations, the different data file with different payloads can be related to phase
Same or different theme, but include different types of content.For example, first item can have minimum payload and only comprising text
This, Section 2 can have the second small payload and include low-resolution image, and Section 3 can have bigger than Section 2
Payload and include high-definition picture, Section 4 can have Maximum Payload and include insertion video etc..One
In a little implementations, different data file can be additionally or alternatively different in the feature realized by corresponding UI component, all
The movement such as occurred in user's selectable portion of user and component interaction or selection component.For example, some data item can be with
The generation in the current interface of application program is caused to act (for example, current browser tabs/window is caused to be led from first page
Navigate to second page), and other data item can cause in different interfaces generation movement (for example, cause with work as front window
Second page is opened in the different browser window/tabs of mouth/tabs).In some implementations, some data item cause
Login page appears in different interfaces and adds UI component or replaces selected UI component using new UI component.One
In a little such implementations, new UI component, which may include user, may be selected component, which, which may be selected component, allows user
With other users via messaging service (for example, text message, Email or other messaging services), social media
Service and/or can be shared by other type of service of its sharing contents the UI component that had previously shown or with previously showed
The related content of UI component (for example, the link of the particular login page, login page of such as original UI component).In some realizations
In mode, new UI component may include the message for the UI component for thanking user's selection previously to show.
