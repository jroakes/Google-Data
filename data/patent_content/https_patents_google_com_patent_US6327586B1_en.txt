Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to data analysis, and specifically to a system, method and computer program product for automating the collection and analysis of data. More specifically, the present invention provides an automated tool for defining research requirements, collecting, managing and analyzing data, building relationships between data items, and for generating reports based on data from a variety of sources.
- a major problem with these stand-alone tools is that the analyst is forced to manually manipulate the data between the use of each tool. Additionally, using the conventional method, the analyst is required to have a thorough understanding of Boolean logic and a database query language, such as Standard Query Language (SQL), to gain access to the stored data. It has been estimated that using these conventional methods, analysts can spend up to ninety percent of their time searching, collecting, and organizing information. This leaves a mere five to ten percent of an analyst's time for performing actual analysis of data.
- SQL Standard Query Language
- the present invention provides a complete end-to-end data management and analysis tool based on four phases of the intelligence process used to perform research on data.
- the present invention increases research efficiency by providing automated data analysis that allows analysts to spend more time on data analysis and less time on data management.
- the present invention accomplishes this by providing a single environment where users can perform knowledge management and knowledge production of data.
- the knowledge management feature of the present invention allows users to quickly and efficiently cull through large quantities of data, so that items that are of interest, quickly and efficiently emerge to the surface. Once the items of interest are determined, only those data items associated with the items of interest are saved in a repository. These items are saved in the repository along with related tags so that users can leverage off their associative style of thinking and work more efficiently at retrieving data.
- the knowledge production features of the present invention allow users not only to extract patterns from the data but also to visualize the data so that new patterns and relationships can easily be recorded.
- the present invention provides a unique set of automation tools to assist the user in conducting research. This is accomplished using a methodology based on four phases for conducting research, namely, the Requirements phase, the Collection phase, the Analysis phase and the Reporting phase.
- the Requirements phase is where the user records the objectives for the research project.
- the requirements may be referred to by the user at any time during the remaining research phases to serve as a focal point for the collection and interpretation of data.
- the requirements entered by the user can be used to automatically perform database searches to compile data for the research project.
- users define items of interest in a Personal Dictionary.
- the items of interest are organized by user-defined or pre-defined categories.
- the Collection phase is used to filter out relevant data items from irrelevant data.
- the relevant data is stored in a repository.
- the present invention provides the user with a set of automation tools to assist in the collection process. Specifically, the present invention automatically searches for the items of interest and associated aliases stored in the Personal Dictionary.
- automation tools are provided that allow the user to quickly and efficiently determine the relevancy of documents based on the occurrences of the items of interest. This is accomplished in part, by providing the user with interactive visualization displays that model document contents according to the defined items of interest.
- the present invention provides an efficient means for quickly scanning large volumes of information to determine their relevancy with respect to the current research project.
- the items that are determined to be relevant are automatically saved into a repository associated with the research project. These items are tagged with descriptive user created pointers to facilitate future retrieval of those items.
- the Analysis phase is where the collected information from the Collection phase is analyzed, compared, related, and understood in terms of the items of interest from the Personal Dictionary.
- the analyst reviews the collected items and extracts patterns and relationships. Relationships between data items are recorded and automatically maintained by the present invention.
- knowledge is added to any item or relationship between items by written comments that are automatically associated with the corresponding data items and maintained by the present invention.
- the present invention provides the user with relationship diagrams that graphically depict the relationships between any two items of interest. These relationship diagrams are selectable by the user in terms of their “degree of separation”. That is, the present invention provides a mechanism that allows users to display direct relationships between two items of interest, as well as indirect, distant relationships. In this fashion, users are instantly presented with distant relationships between items of interest that may never have been known to exist.
- the Dissemination or Reporting phase is used to assist the analyst in creating reports of a research project. Specifically, summaries and conclusions are captured to be included in the finished reports. Documents are “bookmarked” during the Analysis phase so that they are can be instantly retrieved and included in the final report(s). During the Reporting phase, analysts document their analyses, conclusions and recommendations.

- the analysis process of the present invention comprises four phases referred to herein as; the Requirements phase 102 ; the Collection phase 104 ; the Analysis phase 106 ; and the Dissemination phase 108 .
- the Requirements phase 102 is used to capture and document initial questions to be answered, or issues to be followed, during a particular research project.
- the Requirements phase 102 documents requirements that are the focal point for the collection and the interpretation of information.
- the Requirements phase 102 accepts requirements from a user (also referred to herein as “analyst” and/or “researcher”), such as strategic company goals and specific manager requests. These requirements allow the analyst to focus during the Collection phase 104 and to determine how events are interpreted during the Analysis phase 106 .
- the Requirements phase 102 can also be used to define requirements for an automated search provided by an embodiment of the present invention.
- the Collection phase 104 directs the searching of internal and external data sources and filters them to extract relevant information therefrom, according to the recorded requirements entered during the Requirements phase 102 . Once information is retrieved, the analyst typically reviews the collected information to ensure that the retrieved items contain relevant pieces of information.
- the retrieved items that are determined to be relevant are automatically saved into a repository associated with the research project.
- the items that are saved in the repository are tagged with descriptive user created pointers to facilitate future retrieval of those items.
- the Collection phase 104 processes text and other files from a variety of sources. These sources include the Internet, other databases, scanners, word processors, news services, research services and the like.
- the files used with the present invention can be in any format including text, audio, video, and graphic file formats.
- the text and other files are manually compiled by the user and stored on their computer system. Typically this is accomplished using one or more external tools such as scanners, word processors, Internet browsers, Internet search engines and the like.
- the present invention filters them during the Collection phase 104 , by separating relevant data from irrelevant data.
- the present invention provides a means to compile data for the user based on the requirements entered during the Requirements phase 102 .
- the present invention communicates with one or more external or internal data sources, such as the Internet, database files, files in the users directories, etc. Once these results are compiled they are used in the Collection phase 102 and filtered for relevant data items, as described above.
- the Analysis phase 106 is where the collected information from the Collection phase 104 is analyzed, compared, related, visualized, and understood in terms of the requirements entered during the Requirements phase 102 .
- the analyst typically reviews the collected items and extracts patterns and relationships therefrom. In this fashion, the analyst creates meaning to the data items as they relate back to the requirements entered during the Requirements phase 102 . Relationships between data items are recorded for later analysis and/or insertion into a final report.
- users can also add knowledge to any data item by adding written comments. These comments are automatically associated with the corresponding data items and are automatically maintained by the present invention.
- the Dissemination or Reporting phase 108 is used to assist the analyst in creating reports of a research project. Specifically, summaries and conclusions are captured to be included in the finished reports. During the Reporting phase 108 , analysts document their analyses, conclusions, and recommendations.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart depicting the overall process that can be used to define requirements, collect, manage and analyze data, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the process begins with step 202 , where a user creates a requirement set that defines the basis for the research being conducted.
- step 204 requirements are added to the requirement set created in step 204 . This step continues until all of the requirements have been added into the requirement set.
- step 206 the collection and filtering of data are performed.
- the present invention provides several valuable tools that assist the user during the Collection phase 104 so that large quantities of data can be quickly and efficiently compiled, viewed and filtered according to the user specified requirements from steps 202 and 204 .

- the user can record one or more aliases 1208 for each item of interest.
- the aliases are recognized in the text files and are treated as being equivalent to the associated item of interest by the present invention.
- “District of Columbia” may be a defined alias for “Washington D.C.” Accordingly, if both terms are found in a single document, for example, the present invention reports that two occurrences of the defined item of interest “Washington D.C.” are contained in the document. In this fashion, items of interest are recognized in the documents even though they are not referred to by their formal title.
- Personal Dictionaries can be shared through the import and export feature of the present invention (see 1210 and 1212 ). Items can be entered into the Personal Dictionary directly from the Personal Dictionary screen 1200 , by manually selecting a category in 1204 , entering a name in 1206 , and providing any aliases in 1208 .
- the present invention provides a convenient way to add items of interest to the Personal Dictionary while reviewing text in the text window 1102 . This is accomplished by highlighting any word in the text window 1102 and clicking the Add button 1108 (see FIG. 11 ). When this occurs the user is presented with add item window shown in FIG. 13, so that the user can add a new category or select a category from the Category pull-down 1304 . The name of the newly added item of interest is automatically displayed in the Name field 1302 , where it can be edited if necessary.

- the present invention provides a means for presenting the relationships between any two items of interest in a fast and efficient manner. Relationships that are difficult to discover, quickly emerge to the surface using the techniques provided by the present invention.
- the present invention accomplishes this task by performing an exhaustive search of the repository to display all of the paths between any two items of interest. A method that can be used to implement this artificial intelligence aspect of the present invention is described below.
- the Dissemination phase 108 typically begins in one of two ways.
- the first way begins when the analysis is complete. However, for lengthy research projects, this may not be the most efficient means.
- the second and preferred method for creating reports is to establish a report shell at the beginning of the Analysis Phase 106 . In this fashion, items are identified and bookmarked for inclusion in the final report as they are discovered during the Analysis phase 106 .
- the present invention provides this capability by allowing the user to create a report during the Analysis Phase 106 . This is preferably accomplished by defining a title for the report using a dialog box such as the one shown in FIG. 25 . Once this is accomplished, a title screen is displayed in the Reports/Create window, as shown in FIG. 26 . Note that once a report is defined in this manner, the name of the report 2702 is shown on the Analysis/Browse window as shown in FIG. 27 . In addition, a bookmarking icon 2704 is displayed. Thus, when the analysts identifies an item that they would like to have included in a report, they simply drag the selected item to the bookmarking icon 2702 .
- FIG. 28 items that have been bookmarked are displayed on the Report/Create window 2600 in the Marked List 2802 .
- These items can be used in several ways.
- FIG. 29 shows the result of a user dragging the item 2904 into the report area 2804 .
- the name of the item 2902 is displayed in the report area 2804 .
- the original text is displayed in a text window, as shown by FIG. 30 .
- the display in FIG. 30 allows the user to search the text for items in the Personal Dictionary or on any other string. As indicated by FIG. 30, this is accomplished by using the Find What entry box 3002 and the Find button 3004 . Text from this display can also be copied and pasted directly into the report using the copy button 3006 .
- the results of copying a section from the text window in FIG. 30, to the report window 2902 is shown in FIG. 31 .
- the present invention provides tools that assist the user in formatting the report and delivering it to another user.
- the user can select a report type that is to be used to generate the report.
- the report type is provided by a report template, which defines a format for the report.
- a typical implementation of the present invention provides many template reports that can be selected by the user.
- the user selects a method in which to deliver the report.
- the analyst can print the report, send it via E-Mail, or save it to disk in a variety of formats.
- the screen in FIG. 33 shows a typical Report/Deliver screen that can be used to implement this feature of the present invention.
- the present invention preferably provides several ways to customize and maintain the system.
- a Category Manager is provided that allows the user to modify the requirement set structure.
- An example of a Category Manager window is shown in FIG. 34 . This allows the user to add 3404 or delete 3406 any of the categories 3412 .
- the user can add 3408 or delete 3410 , any fields 3402 associated with the categories 3412 .
- Another feature of the present invention allows the user to determine what has changed in the repository from a given date. This feature is described with reference to the “What's New” screen shown if FIG. 35 .
- the user enters a date at 3502 .
- the find button 3504 is depressed, new items that were added since the date entered in 3692 are displayed in the New Items list area 3506 .
- FIG. 36 depicts database tables that can be used to implement the present invention.
- the Relation table 3602 is used to store relationships that are established between items of interest. Specifically, one entry is associated with each relationship between two items of interest.
- the Requirements table 3604 is used to store the requirements entered during the Requirements Phase 102 .
- the Report table 3608 is used to store information pertaining to the Dissemination Phase 108 .
- the research table 3606 is used to store information pertaining to the data items saved in the repository during the Collection Phase 104 .
- the user defined category tables 3610 are used to store information about each category defined by the user. Note that in a typical implementation, users can define their own categories or use pre-defined categories provided by a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the dictionary table 3612 is used to store information pertaining to the Personal Dictionary.
- the Category table 3612 is used to store a list of valid categories defined for the current research project.
- table 1 A list of fields that can be used to implement the database tables shown in FIG. 36 is presented in table 1 below. Note that the names of the fields listed below are generally descriptive of the type of information stored therein, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Based on the description provided herein and the names of the fields below, the use of these fields should be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s). As such, a detailed description of each of these fields is not provided herein.
- the fields in table 1 and the associated data tables shown in FIG. 37 represent one example of a means to implement the database management features of the present invention. Many other variations are possible and would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).
- FIG. 37 is a chart that is useful for describing a method that can be used for searching the database and finding the paths between any two items of interest. This method can be used to implement the relationship diagrams shown in FIG. 24 . It should be noted that an algorithm used to implement this feature of the present invention is preferably accomplished using a deterministic programming environment that employs automatic backtracking on failure of a pre-condition.
- This method is preferably performed in response to user action. Specifically, this method is performed in response to a user selecting two items in which the present invention is directed to find the paths between. This can be accomplished, for example, with the screen presented in FIG. 23 .
- the present invention extracts all of the records in the Relation database table 3602 and writes the information into a flat text file.
- the flat text file is then read into an internal database structure that is specific to the deterministic programming environment. This table can be viewed as shown in FIG. 37 .
- the method selects a related record, for example, COFFEE 3704 .
- This relationship is compared to the second selected item, TEA 2706 and found not to match.
- the method selects a related record to COFFEE 3704 .
- the related record is TEA 3706 .
- the method attempts to select another record related to COFFEE.
- there are no other items related to COFFEE 3704 and thus the method fails.
- the method selects the next related record for RAINBOW PLANTATION 3703 .
- the next related record for RAINBOW PLANTATION 3703 is MACADAMIA 3708 .
- the method continues as described above, where the method compares the relationship with the second item, namely TEA. In this case, a match is not found.
- the method attempts to select another related record to MACADAMIA 3708 and fails, because there are no related records to MACADAMIA 3708 in this example.
- the method selects the next related record for RAINBOW PLANTATION 3702 .
- the next related record is CAPTAIN COOK 3710 .
- the main method of the present invention then opens and reads the found paths file and creates a matrix of information for each path.
- This information is preferably retrieved from the Relation 3602 and the User Defined Category tables 3610 .
- a database query is created to read the Relation table 3614 an extract the “ISA” field information.
- the “ISA” field holds the relationship name between two items. For example, in FIG. 24, screen 2302 , the relationship name between RAINBOW 2304 and TEA 2306 is “GROWS”. This is the relationship name that is stored in the ISA field.
- the method paints an icon representing the end nodes, writes a label for the node, paints a line connecting the nodes, and writes a label containing the ISA value.
- An example of this initial view for a relationship diagram 2402 is shown in FIG. 24 .
- the flowchart in FIG. 38 depicts a process that can be used to implement the interactive data visualization display that is based on the movement of icons representing database records, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- Step 3802 represents a step where a user selects an item from the Item List box, such as the TROPICAL ISLAND item 1706 in FIG. 17 . This is typically accomplished by placing the mouse pointer over the item 1706 and depressing the left mouse button. The selected item 1706 is highlighted to indicate that it is selected.
- the process determines the category identification number for the item that is to appear in the center of the display 1712 . Specifically, the process reads the text of the highlighted item from the Item List box 1702 , and constructs a database query to read from the table of the selected item 1706 . In this example, a database query is directed to the Research table 3606 , because the selected item 1702 is a research item.
- the database query is executed and ‘ID’ of the selected item 1706 is returned. Typically this is then saved in a global variable, such as CENTER_ID.
- step 3808 the process retrieves the names of the related items by joining the Relation table 3602 with the User Defined Category tables 3610 . Specifically, using the retrieved ID from step 3806 , two additional SQL queries are constructed for each user defined category listed in the Category table 3614 to read from the Relation table 3602 .
- This query results in retrieving a count of the relationships for the selected item 1706 organized by category 1714 - 1720 .
- the icon representing the category (such as 1714 - 1720 ) is displayed, along with the count and the connecting lines.
- Step 3812 represents an action by the user, wherein the user selects one of the displayed category icons ( 1714 - 1720 ). This is typically accomplished by pointing the mouse to the category icon and depressing the left mouse button. In this example, the Product icon 1720 is selected. Next, the user drags the icon representing the Product category, back to the Item List box 1702 .
- step 3814 the process retrieves the names of the related items by joining the Relation table 3602 with the User Defined Category tables 3610 .
- This step can be implemented as follows. Using the CENTER_ID global variable as described above, and the category name, another database query is constructed.
- the database query is designed to retrieve all the related items from the Relation table 3607 , organized in alphabetical order.
- the list of retrieved names is then displayed in the Item List area 1706 , as indicated by step 3816 .
- the process can repeat itself, depending on user action.
- FIG. 39 is a flowchart depicting a process that can be used to implement a visual representation for modeling document contents, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It is noted that this method is similar to the first 5 steps ( 3802 - 3810 ) of the method presented in FIG. 38 .
- Step 3902 represents a step where a user selects an item from the Item List box, such as the TROPICAL ISLAND item 1706 in FIG. 17 . This is typically accomplished by placing the mouse pointer over the item 1706 and depressing the left mouse button. The selected item 1706 is highlighted indicating that is selected.
- an item from the Item List box such as the TROPICAL ISLAND item 1706 in FIG. 17 . This is typically accomplished by placing the mouse pointer over the item 1706 and depressing the left mouse button. The selected item 1706 is highlighted indicating that is selected.
- the process determines the category identification number for the item that is to appear in the center of the display 1712 . Specifically, the process reads the text of the highlighted item from the Item List box 1702 and constructs a database query to read from the table of the selected item 1706 . In this example, a database query is directed to the Research table 3606 , because the selected item 1702 is a research item.
- the database query is executed and ‘ID’ of the selected item 1706 is returned. Typically this is then saved in a global variable, such as CENTER_ID.
- step 3908 the process retrieves the names of the related items by joining the Relation table 3602 with the User defined Category tables 3610 . Specifically, using the retrieved ID from step 3906 , two additional SQL queries are constructed for each category in the Category table 3614 to read from the Relation table 3602 .
- This query results in retrieving a count of the relationships for the selected item 1706 organized by category 1714 - 1720 .
- the icon representing the category (such as 1714 - 1720 ) is displayed, along with the count and the connecting lines. The process then ends as indicated by FIG. 39 .
- FIG. 40 is a flowchart depicting a process that can be used for locating and identifying items of interest in documents based on a list of items of interest.
- the items of interest include aliases for each item as described above.
- the method performs a search through the document and locates and displays occurrences of the found items and any aliases.
- this process begins with the creation of a personal dictionary, as described above.
- the dictionary allows the user to enter aliases in addition to the proper name.
- control passes to step 4004 .
- step 4004 the process extracts all of the aliases from the dictionary in response to a user request. This is typically implemented by the user clicking the SCAN button 1502 as shown in FIG. 15 .
- the method extracts all of the aliases from the dictionary by for example, performing an SQL query as follows: “SELECT*FROM DICTIONARY ORDER BY NAME.”
- step 4006 for each alias (including the proper name of the item), a string search is performed in the target text. Accordingly, for each word in the extracted list from step 4004 , a string match is performed. If a match is found, the alias that was found is temporarily stored in an internal variable list.
- step 4008 the method displays the found matches in the item found list 1504 .
- the process then ends as indicated by FIG. 40 .
- FIG. 41 is a flowchart depicting a process that can be used for marking database items used for reporting purposes. This process is launched by the user moving icons representing database items to a special marking icon, as described above.
- step 4102 the user creates a new report shell in the Report/Create window shown in FIG. 28 .
- step 4104 this also causes a BOOKMARKING icon to be displayed on the Analysis/Browse window, such as 2704 in FIG. 27 .
- control passes to step 4106 .
- Step 4106 represents a step where the user selects an item for book-marking from the Item List box, such as 2904 in FIG. 29 .
- the selected item 2904 is highlighted indicating its selection.
- the user then drags the selected item 2904 into the report area 2804 .
- step 4108 is processed.
- the process reads the text of the highlighted item 2904 for the Item List box and constructs an database query to read from the selected items' table.
- step 4110 the name and ID is saved in the Report table 3608 .
- an SQL insert query is constructed to write the item ID and the report name into the REPORT table 3608 .
- step 4112 the process retrieves the related item names for a report when the Report/Create window is displayed.
- FIG. 28 shows an example of a Marked List 2802 that is displayed as a result of this step.
- the process creates a database query to generate the list in 2802 .
