Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and systems for advertising.
- embodiments of the present invention relate generally to methods and systems for members in a member network to create and disseminate advertisement to other members in the network.
- Online advertising and search engines are ubiquitous on the Internet and World Wide Web. Online advertising in such forms as banner advertisement and pop-up advertisement include links that implore viewers to click on the advertisement and be directed to a linked website for further information on the advertised products or services.
- Online advertising in such forms as banner advertisement and pop-up advertisement include links that implore viewers to click on the advertisement and be directed to a linked website for further information on the advertised products or services.
- the relative ease with which online advertising can be done and the large audience available on Internet have spawned advertisement spamming. As consequences, Internet users are turned away by the constant bombardment of advertisement, and the advertisement become less effective in attracting an audience to advertised products and services.
- Conventional websites such as those hosted on OrkutTM, FriendsterTM, TribeTM, or other websites, allow users to form member networks.
- the member networks on conventional websites allow members of each member network to communicate with each other and list announcements associated with the member network.
- a conventional member network does not have provisions allowing its members to create and effectively target advertisement to other network members.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for member-created advertisement in a member network.
- a method comprising: receiving a request to create an advertisement from a first user, wherein the first user is from a network of associated users; receiving advertisement content for the advertisement; receiving a selection of a category of one or more users from the network of associated users as a target for the advertisement, wherein the category of one or more users comprises at least a second user; generating the advertisement based on the advertisement content; and providing the advertisement to at least the second user.

- Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for creating and disseminating member-created advertisements in a member network to better target advertisement audience within the member network.
- the method begins with a member network site receiving a request from one of its members to create and disseminate advertisements to other members in the member network.
- the member network site provides the requesting member with means to create the advertisement, including options to choose in creating an advertisement for a particular category and field entries for the requesting member to input advertisement content.
- the member network site also allows the requesting member to choose the advertisement audience based on the member's profile within the member network, particularly, the member's association and/or nexus with other members in the network as can be gathered from the member's profile.
- the created advertisement is then presented to the chosen advertisement audience via advertisement displays within or separate from each member profile of the chosen advertisement audience, or via advertisement displays in e-mails to the chosen advertisement audience.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which embodiments of the present invention can operate.
- the present invention may operate, and be embodied, in other systems as well.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 includes multiple client devices 102 a - n with users 112 a - 112 n in communication with a member network site 160 over a network 106 .
- the network 106 can be a wired or wireless network. Further, it can be a public network, e.g., the Internet, or a private data network, e.g., a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). Moreover, methods according to the present invention may operate within a single computer.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- Each of the client devices 102 a - n includes a memory 108 , which can be a computer-readable medium (CRM), such as a random access memory (RAM), coupled to a processor 110 .

- a member network site 160 is also coupled to the network 106 .
- the member network site 160 shown includes a member network database 170 and a server device 162 executing a member network engine application program, also known as a member network engine 168 .
- the member network engine 168 allows users, such as user 112 a , to interact with and participate in a member network.
- a member network can refer to a network connecting entities, such as people or organizations, by a set of relationships, such as social relationships like friendship, co-working, or information exchange.
- a member network can refer to a computer application or data connecting such entities by such social relationships. Examples of member networks include Orkut.com and Friendster.com.
- Member networks can comprise any of a variety of suitable arrangements.
- An entity or member of a member network can have a profile and that profile can represent the member in the member network.
- the member network can facilitate interaction between member profiles and allow associations or relationships between member profiles.
- Associations between member profiles can be one or more of a variety of types, such as friend, co-worker, family member, business associate, common-interest association, and common-geography association. Associations can also include intermediary relationships, such as friend of a friend, and degree of separation relationships, such as three degrees away.
- Associations between member profiles can be reciprocal associations. For example, a first member can invite another member to become associated with the first member and the other member can accept or reject the invitation. A member can also categorize or weigh the association with other member profiles, such as, for example, by assigning a level to the association. For example, for a friendship-type association, the member can assign a level, such as acquaintance, friend, good friend, and best friend, to the associations between the member's profile and other member profiles. In one embodiment, the member network engine 168 can determine the type of association between member profiles, including, in some embodiments, the degree of separation of the association and the corresponding weight or level of the association.
- the server device 162 shown includes a processor 164 coupled to a CRM 166 .
- the server device 162 is in communication with a member network database 170 .
- Server device 162 depicted as a single computer system, may be implemented as a network of computer processors. Examples of the server device 162 are servers, mainframe computers, networked computers, a processor-based device, and similar types of systems and devices.
- the server processor 164 can be any of a number of suitable computer processors, such as processors from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. and Motorola Corporation of Schaumburg, Ill.
- Memory 166 in the server device 162 contains a member network engine application program, also known as a member network engine 168 .
- a member network can include profiles that can be associated with other profiles. Each profile may represent a member and a member can be, for example, a person, an organization, a business, a corporation, a community, a fictitious person, or other entity. Each profile can contain entries, and each entry can include information associated with a profile.
- Examples of entries for a person profile can include information regarding relationship status, birth date, age, children, ethnicity, religion, political view, sense of humor, sexual orientation, fashion preferences, smoking habits, drinking habits, pets, hometown location, passions, sports, activities, favorite books, music, television, or movie preferences, favorite cuisines, email addresses, location information, IM name, phone number, address, skills, career, or any other information describing, identifying, or otherwise associated with a profile.
- Entries for a business profile can include market sector, customer base, location, supplier information, net profits, net worth, number of employees, stock performance, or other types of information associated with the business profile.
- entries within a profile can include associations with other profiles.
- Associations between profiles within a member network can include, for example, friendships, business relationships, acquaintances, community or group associations, activity partner associations, common interest associations, common characteristic associations, or any other suitable type of relationship connection (e.g., social relationship connection).
- Members can set up new associations or join existing associations in the member network as desired. For example, a member can set up a “Computer Science community” for those members who are interested or work in the computer science field. Likewise, a member can join an existing “Baseball community” if the member is interested in baseball and/or sport in general.
- Associations between profiles can also have various levels. For example, friendship levels can include, for example, a “haven't met” level, an “acquaintance” level, a “friend” level, a “good friend” level, a “best friend” level, and other suitable levels.
- a degree of separation based on associations between profiles can also be determined. For example, a degree of separation can be determined based on the fewest number of associations between two profiles. Thus, if profile A is a friend of profile B, and profile B is a friend of profile C, there can be a degree of separation of two (2) between profiles A and C.
- a degree of separation can be type-specific or type-neutral. Type specific degrees of separation only count relationships of a certain type. Thus, for example, in the case above where A is a friend of B, and B is a friend of C, there is a friendship degree separation of two, even if A is directly associated with C by a business association, which would otherwise produce a degree of type-neutral separation of one (1).
- Member 166 also contains an advertisement-creation application program, also known as an advertisement-creation engine 169 , that allows members of the member network to create and disseminate advertisements to other members in the member network.
- the member network engine 162 receives a request to create an advertisement from a user, such as user 112 a , as entered to a corresponding client device, such as client device 102 a .
- the request is sent to the advertisement-creation engine 169 , which then requests advertisement content from the user 112 a in order to create the advertisement.
- the advertisement-creation engine 169 also interacts with the member network engine 168 to retrieve the user's 112 a member profile from a member network database 170 (which is further described below), present user 112 a with associations and/or nexuses between the user 112 a and other members in the member network based on the member profile for selection of advertisement audience, and receive the selected advertisement audience from the user 112 a .
- the member network engine 169 can then create the advertisement based on advertisement content input by the user 112 a and provide the advertisement to the selected advertisement audience also based on an audience selection by the user 112 a.
- Server device 162 also provides access to storage elements, such as a member network storage element, in the example shown in FIG. 1 , a member network database 170 .
- the member network database 170 can be used to store profiles of members in a member network and to store communities within the member network as created by the member-network engine 168 .
- Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs. Other similar types of data storage devices can be accessed by the server device 162 .
- the member network engine 168 can receive data comprising the profiles and created associations from the member-network database 170 and can also send data comprising created associations and profiles to the member network database 170 for storage.
- the member-network database 170 may be physically attached or otherwise in communication with the member-network engine 168 by way of a network or other connection.
- server device 162 may include a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to help explain the member networks and methods illustrated in subsequent figures.
- FIG. 2 shows a diagram of a member network 200 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the member network 200 is illustrated with a graph comprising vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 and edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 .
- the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 comprise profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, respectively. Each profile can represent a member profile of a member of the member network 200 .
- the exemplary network 200 shown in FIG. 2 has seven associated users or members.
- a member can be an entity such as, for example, a person, an organization, a business, a corporation, a community, a fictitious person, or other suitable entity.
- Each member profile can contain entries, and each entry can comprise information associated with a profile.
- a person's member profile can contain: personal information, such as relationship status, birth date, age, children, ethnicity, religion, political view, sense of humor, sexual orientation, fashion preferences, smoking habits, drinking habits, pets, hometown location, passions, sports, activities, favorite books or music, television, or movie preferences, and favorite cuisines; contact information, such as email addresses, location information, instant messenger name, telephone numbers, and address; professional information, such as job title, employer, and skills; educational information, such as schools attended and degrees obtained, and any other suitable information describing, identifying, or otherwise associated with a person.
- a business' member profile can, for example, contain a description of the business, and information about its market sector, customer base, location, suppliers, net profits, net worth, number of employees, stock performance, contact information, and other types of suitable information associated with the business.
- a member profile can also contain rating information associated with the member.
- the member can be rated or scored by other members of the member network 200 in specific categories, such as humor, intelligence, fashion, trustworthiness, sexiness, and coolness.
- a member's category ratings can be contained in the member's profile.
- a member can have fans. Fans can be other members who have indicated that they are “fans” of the member. Rating information can also include the number of fans of a member and identifiers of the fans. Rating information can also include the rate at which a member accumulated ratings or fans and how recently the member has been rated or acquired fans.
- a member profile can also contain membership information associated with the member.
- Membership information can include information about a member's login patterns to the member network, such as the frequency that the member logs in to the member network and the member's most recent login to the member network.
- Membership information can also include information about the rate and frequency that a member profile gains associations to other member profiles.
- a member profile may contain consumer information. Consumer information may include: the frequency, patterns, types, or number of purchases the member makes; information about which advertisers or sponsors the member has accessed, patronized, or used; and/or information about a member's behavior, e.g., areas of the member network and/or other articles that the member previously accessed and viewed.
- a member profile may comprise data stored in memory.
- the profile in addition to comprising data about the member, can also comprise data relating to others.
- a member profile can contain an identification of associations or virtual links with other member profiles.
- a member profile includes an identification of association(s) to which the member belongs.
- a member profile can indicate that the member belongs to the Computer Science community.
- membership information can include a classification of the member based on the member's various associations. For example, the member can be classified as a “sports fan” because the member belongs to the Baseball community.
- a member profile may comprise a hyperlink associated with another member's profile. In one such association, the other member's profile may contain a reciprocal hyperlink associated with the first member's profile.
- a member's profile may also contain information excerpted from another associated member's profile, such as a thumbnail image of the associated member, his or her age, marital status, and location, as well as an indication of the number of members with which the associated member is associated.
- a member's profile may comprise a list of other members' profiles with which the member wishes to be associated.
- An association may be designated manually or automatically.
- a member may designate associated members manually by selecting other profiles and indicating an association that can be recorded in the member's profile.
- an association between two profiles may comprise an association automatically generated in response to a predetermined number of common entries, aspects, or elements in the two members' profiles.
- a member profile may be associated with all of the other member profiles comprising a predetermined number or percentage of common entries, such as interests, hobbies, likes, dislikes, employers and/or habits.
- Associations between profiles within a member network can be of a single type or can be multiple types and can include, for example, friendship associations, business associations, family associations, community associations, school associations, or any other suitable type of link between profiles. Associations can further be weighted to represent the strength of the association. For example, a friendship association can be weighted more than a school association. Each type of association can have various levels with different weights associated with each level. For example, a friendship association can be classified according to which of a plurality of friendship association levels it belongs to. In one embodiment, a friendship association may be assigned a level by the member from a list of levels comprising: a best friend, a good friend, a regular friend, an acquaintance, and a friend the member has not met.
- the edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 shown comprise associations between profiles of members.
- the member network 200 comprises a plurality of differing types of associations represented by edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 .
- the types of associations shown in FIG. 2 for illustration purposes are business associations, activity partner associations, friendship associations, community associations, and common characteristic associations.
- Common characteristic associations may include, for example, associations based on some characteristic, such as attending the same high school or being from the same hometown, and can indicate a lower level of significance than another type of association, such as a friendship association.
- edge 220 and edge 222 each comprise an association between profile A at vertex 202 and profile D at vertex 208 .
- the edge 220 represents a business association
- the edge 222 represents a friendship association.
- Profile A is also associated with profile E by a common characteristic association comprising edge 218 .
- the association between profile A and profile E may be more attenuated than the association between profile A and D, but the association can still be represented by the member network depicted in FIG. 2 .
- Each member represented by the profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G comprising the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 , respectively, for purposes of illustration, comprises a person.
- Other types of members can be in member network 200 .
- communities, special interest groups, organizations, political parties, universities, and legal persons, such as corporations and business partnerships may be members of the member network 200 .
- the associations 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 illustrated in FIG. 2 comprise bi-directional associations.
- An association between two profiles may comprise a bi-directional association when both parties to the association are associated with each other.
- profile A is associated with profile D
- profile D is also associated with profile A.
- profiles A and D will not be bi-directionally associated with each other until both profiles consent to such an association.
- profile A may invite profile D to be associated therewith, and the bi-directional association occurs upon profile D's acceptance of such invitation.
- the invitation may include sending an email or other message to profile D indicating that profile A has requested an association with profile D.
- Directed associations can associate a first profile with a second profile while not requiring the second profile to be associated with the first profile.
- profile A can be associated by a friendship association with profile B, and profile B can be unassociated with profile A, or profile B can be associated with profile A through a different type of association, such as a business association.
- a display of profile A's friends would include profile B, but a display of profile B's friends would not include profile A.
- a degree of separation can be determined for associated profiles.
- a degree of separation between two profiles can be determined by the fewest number of edges of a certain type separating the associated profiles.
- a type-specific degree of separation may be determined.
- a type-specific degree of separation comprises a degree of separation determined based on one particular type of association. For example, a profile A has a friend association degree of separation of two from profile E. The fewest number of friendship associations between profile A and profile E is two—the friendship association comprising edge 222 between profiles A and D and the friendship association comprising edge 234 between profiles D and E.
- the degree of friendship separation determined according to one aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, is two.
- a common characteristic degree of separation can be determined by determining the fewest number of common characteristic associations separating profile A and profile E.
- the common characteristic association degree of separation is one.
- the common characteristic in this example can be that profile A attended the same high school as profile E.
- a common characteristic association may be selected by profiles A and E to represent that they are associated in some fashion, but to not create a close association such as with a friendship association.
- the degree of separation may be determined by use of a weighting factor assigned to each association. For example, close friendships can be weighted higher than more distant friendships. According to certain aspects of embodiments using a weighting factor, a higher weighting factor for an association can reduce the degree of separation between profiles and lower weighting factors can increase the degree of separation. This can be accomplished, for example, by establishing an inverse relationship between each associations and a corresponding weighting factor prior to summing the associations. Thus, highly weighted associations would contribute less to the resulting sum than lower weighted associations.
- the method begins with a member network site receiving a request to create an advertisement from one of the members (hereinafter, “first member”) of a member network.
- the member network site also receives advertisement content for the advertisement to be created.
- the received advertisement content can include advertisement content that is specific to a category selection for the advertisement.
- the advertisement content can be received as input from a predetermined field of entry, wherein text and/or graphic content can be entered or imported.
- the first member further provides the member network site with a targeted member or members (hereinafter, “second member(s)”) in the member network to whom the advertisement is intended. Consequently, the member network site generates the advertisement, based on the advertisement content, and provides the advertisement to the second member(s).
- the advertisement can be displayed within or separate from a profile of the second member(s); for the later, a link to the advertisement can be provided from within the second member(s)' profile.
- the advertisement can also be sent via e-mail to the second member(s).
- the advertisement can be provided to the second member(s) based on a category selection for viewing by the second member(s), a selection of an association between the first member and the second member(s), or in general a profile of the first user as maintained by the network.
- the member network engine can also charge a fee to the first user for enabling the first user to create and disseminate the advertisement to the second member(s).
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary method that enable members in a member network to create and disseminate advertisements to targeted member(s) within the network.
- the exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.

- the user 112 a has an option to create one or more advertisements, whereby such option can be presented to the user 112 a on the home page 400 (not shown) or anywhere within the user's 112 a member profile for selection.
- the user 112 a is presented with further options to create each advertisement and input advertisement content.
- one of the options is a category selection for each advertisement.
- advertisement categories include, but are not limited to: help-wanted advertisements, job-seeking advertisements, personal advertisements, product advertisements, and service advertisements.
- the advertisement categories are predetermined as desired by, e.g., the administrator of the member network or any entity authorized to do so.
- the user 112 a can create new categories.
- a help-wanted advertisement can include, among other fields: a position field for the user 112 a to input the position of employment available, such as a clerk, a chef, an IT professional; a location field for the user 112 a to input a location, such as a store, an address, or a locality, where the input position is available; a work experience field for the user 112 a to input the desired or required experience for the available position.
- the user 112 a upon selection of a category, can be presented with a blank page wherein the user 112 a can input advertising text and/or graphics for the advertisement content.
- the user 112 a can input such advertisement content directly or import them from other files and/or databases.
- the user 112 a upon selection of a category, can be presented with one or more fields of entry and blank areas where the user 112 a can input additional text and/or graphics for the advertisement content.
- the advertisement-creation engine 169 receives the selected advertisement options and advertisement content provided by the user 112 a .
- the advertisement-creation engine 169 provides the user 11 a with options to target a particular audience, i.e., one or more other members in the member network 200 .
- the advertisement-creation engine 169 can interact with the member network engine 168 to retrieve the user's 112 a member profile from the member network database 170 , generate a list of all associations and/or nexuses between the user's 112 a and other members in the member network 200 , and provide such list to the user 112 a so that the user 112 a can target individual member(s) and/or group(s) of individual members that are associated with or have a nexus with the user 112 a .
- the user 112 a may be provided with a pull-down menu for selecting the targeted audience, wherein the menu includes the aforementioned list. Examples of possible selections in the list include:
- the advertisement-creation engine 169 receives the advertisement audience selection from the user 112 a .
- the advertisement-creation engine 169 creates the advertisement based on the selected advertisement options and advertisement content received at 340 and presents the advertisement to the targeted audience.
- the advertisement can be displayed on the home page or landing page of each targeted member.
- FIG. 5 depicts a home page 500 with a displayed advertisement 550 .
- the targeted member can access other pages of his/her profiles using various available tabs 410 .
- the targeted member can access other pages for personal settings at links 420 .

- FIG. 6 shows an advertisement 650 that can be displayed in the communities page 600 of the targeted member as accessible from the communities tab at 510 in FIG. 5 .
- an “Advertisement” tab 512 can be in the menu bar, or an “Advertisement” link 522 can be included with other navigational links, to organize in one place within the member profile all advertisements that are sent and displayed to the targeted member. While FIG. 5 illustrates both an Advertisement tab 512 and an Advertisement link 522 , it will be understood that either an Advertisement tab 512 or an Advertisement link 522 or both can be used.
- an advertisement area outside of or separate from a member profile such as an advertisement bulletin board or web site, can be set up within the member network 200 to display advertisements posted by members of the member network 200 .
- the targeted member then can be provided with a link to such area from a tab 510 or a link 520 in the member profile, whereby the targeted member can be directed to, for example, a web page of advertisements specifically targeted to such member.
- the advertisement can be displayed in an e-mail and sent to the targeted member.
- each member in the member network 200 has options to filter incoming advertisements for viewing based on desired categories and criteria for each category, just as an advertisement creator is able to create an advertisement for a particular category with particular criteria as described earlier.
- a member can filter advertisements based on any associations possible within the member network or information entered in the member profile, such as: a particular level of association; a particular degree of association; particular community, communities, association, or associations available within the member network; and particular entries in the member profile.
- the user 112 a can also receive advertisements from other network members, wherein the user 112 a can be provided with a pull-down menu (or other known means for selection) to filter incoming advertisements so as to view only those advertisements from a particular association (e.g., a friendship or business association); from a particular level or degree of a particular association (e.g., a best-friend association or a two-degree of business association); from a “baseball community” to which the user 112 a belongs, in which the user 112 a is interested, or with which the user 112 a is affiliated in some way (e.g., one of the user's 112 a listed hobby in his/her member profile is baseball).
- a particular association e.g., a friendship or business association
- a particular level or degree of a particular association e.g., a best-friend association or a two-degree of business association
- baseball community to which the user 112 a belongs, in which the user 112 a is interested, or
- each advertisement can include a picture or any other form of identification identifying the sender of the advertisement.
- Each advertisement can also include a link to the sender's member profile, sender's e-mail address, or any other sender's information.
- Each advertisement can also include a link to the sender's web site or a more detailed advertisement page to further elaborate on the advertisement.
- the identification of the advertisement sender can help prevent advertisement spamming. For example, a member that receives an advertisement can identify the sender to determine whether the member knows the sender.
- the member can report the advertisement spamming to the administrator of the member network 200 and/or sever the underlying relationship or association with the advertisement sender that allows such advertisement to be sent. For example, if the member has a friendship connection with the advertisement sender, the member can sever such friendship connection, by directly removing the sender's name from the friendship list in the member profile in the case of one-degree of friendship or asking another friend to remove the sender's name from the friend's friendship list in the case of two or more degrees of friendship (alternatively, severing the friendship association with the another friend).
- member-created advertisements can provide financial opportunities to member network sites that provide for such advertisements.
- a member network site can charge an advertisement sender on a click-through basis (e.g., a flat fee for each click-through of a displayed advertisement), a current-use basis (e.g., a flat fee based on the number of members to which an advertisement is sent), or any other basis known or will be known in the art.
- a click-through basis e.g., a flat fee for each click-through of a displayed advertisement
- a current-use basis e.g., a flat fee based on the number of members to which an advertisement is sent
- member-created advertisement of the present invention enable members of a member network to create and effectively target advertisement to other network members and enhance the display of such advertisement in a more obvious manner to attract the viewing of such advertisement by targeted members.
