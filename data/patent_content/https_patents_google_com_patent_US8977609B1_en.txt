- FIG. 4 illustrates an example process 400 by which a set of search results based on a time specification and a geographical indication may be provided.
- a server receives a query.
- the query may be entered on a client computing device (e.g., client computing device 136 ) and provided to the server via a network.
- the query may include text, image(s), audio, or video.
- the query includes the text, “spring break drinks served of Jamaica.”
- the server determines a time specification based at least in part on the received query. For example, if the query includes the text, “spring break drinks served in Jamaica,” the time specification may be “spring break.” “Spring break” is a topical time specification as the time specification is less strictly defined based on a subject or an activity. Alternatively, the time specification can correspond to a time when the query was entered at the client computing device or a time when the query was received at the server. For example, a query for “coffee shop” entered at 2 AM on Tuesday morning may be associated with the time specification 2 AM on Tuesday morning.
- the server determines a geographical indication based at least in part on the received query. For example, if the query includes the text, “spring break drinks served in Jamaica,” the geographical indication may be “Jamaica.” Alternatively, if the geographic location of the client computing device is known to the server, the geographical indication may correspond to the geographic location of the client computing device. For example, if a query for “coffee shop” is provided from a client computing device in Los Angeles, Calif., the geographical indication of “Los Angeles, Calif.,” may be associated with the query.
- the user of the client computing device must affirmatively provide permission to share the location of the client computing device and a user interface element on the client computing device (e.g., a blue dot indicating location tracking) indicates that the geographic location of the client computing device is being transmitted over a network.
- a user interface element on the client computing device e.g., a blue dot indicating location tracking
- the server provides a set of search results responsive to the received query, the determined time specification, and the determined geographical indication.
- the set of search results includes an advertisement.
- the advertisement is chosen based on a combination of the determined geographical indication and the determined time specification.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example interface 500 for providing search results including an advertisement chosen based on a geographical indication and a time specification.
- the interface 500 may be provided via an application executing on a client computing device (e.g., client computing device 136 ), for example, a browser or a special purpose application executing on a mobile phone or tablet computer. As shown, the interface 500 includes an input region 502 and a search results region 506 .
- a client computing device e.g., client computing device 136
- the interface 500 includes an input region 502 and a search results region 506 .

- the search results region 506 includes search results 508 , 510 , and 512 . While three search results 508 , 510 , and 512 are illustrated, the subject technology may be implemented with any number of search results.
- the search results include an advertisement 508 and generic search results 510 and 512 .
- the advertisement 508 may be illustrated differently from the generic search result 510 and 512 . As shown, there are dashed lines around the advertisement 508 , while there are solid liens around the generic search results 510 and 512 . In alternative implementations, the advertisement 508 may be in a different color (e.g., yellow) or in a different position of the interface 500 (e.g., at the right hand side) than the generic search results 510 and 512 .
- the advertisement 508 is chosen based on a geographical indication (“Lake Tahoe”) and a time specification (“summer,” which includes the month of July) in the query entered in the input box 504 . However, as shown, the advertisement 508 does not include the word “summer.” Instead, the advertisement 508 includes the word “July,” which is a month in the summer and, thus, corresponds to the time specification “summer” in the query entered in input box 504 .
- the generic search result 510 similarly includes the words “June,” “July,” and “August,” but not the word “summer.” However, the generic search result 512 includes the word “summer.”

- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code).
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- Some implementations include electronic components, for example microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media).
- computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks.
- CD-ROM compact discs
- CD-R recordable compact discs
- the computer-readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations.
- Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, for example is produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter.
- ASICs application specific integrated circuits
- FPGAs field programmable gate arrays
- integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
- the terms “computer”, “server”, “processor”, and “memory” all refer to electronic or other technological devices. These terms exclude people or groups of people.
- display or displaying means displaying on an electronic device.
- computer readable medium and “computer readable media” are entirely restricted to tangible, physical objects that store information in a form that is readable by a computer. These terms exclude any wireless signals, wired download signals, and any other ephemeral signals.
- implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used
- the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network.
- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the Internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device).
- client device e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device.
- Data generated at the client device e.g., a result of the user interaction
- any specific order or hierarchy of steps or blocks in the processes disclosed is an illustration of example approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of steps or blocks in the processes may be rearranged, or that all illustrated steps or blocks be performed. Some of the steps or blocks may be performed simultaneously. For example, in certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components illustrated above should not be understood as requiring such separation, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- a phrase, for example, an “aspect” does not imply that the aspect is essential to the subject technology or that the aspect applies to all configurations of the subject technology.
- a disclosure relating to an aspect may apply to all configurations, or one or more configurations.
- a phrase, for example, an aspect may refer to one or more aspects and vice versa.
- a phrase, for example, a “configuration” does not imply that such configuration is essential to the subject technology or that such configuration applies to all configurations of the subject technology.
- a disclosure relating to a configuration may apply to all configurations, or one or more configurations.
- a phrase, for example, a configuration may refer to one or more configurations and vice versa.
