Definitions
- This document generally describes allocating offline advertising inventory to offline advertising campaigns such as those appearing on television, radio and in print.
- Advertisements can be included in various forms of offline media.
- offline ads such as broadcast on radio
- Offline media providers such as radio stations and newspapers, can make advertising inventory available to advertisers. Advertising inventory can include advertising spots (e.g., 30-second time slots in a radio broadcast or parts of a newspaper page) and can be allocated to advertising campaigns. Allocating can include scheduling and reserving the spot for a particular campaign.
- An advertising campaign can be a comprehensive advertising plan that consists of a series of messages published or broadcast in a variety of media over a specific time frame.
- Advertisers can create campaigns that center on a single theme or idea, such as to promote a product or service.
- the campaign messages sometimes called “creatives,” can be media content such as recorded audio or video.
- the campaign messages can be referred to generically as advertisement messages or simply as advertisements.
- advertising inventory can be allocated to an offline advertising campaign based on comparing the campaign to other offline advertising campaigns.
- the described subject matter in this specification can be a computer-implemented method of allocating offline advertising, the method including receiving an offer price for audience-member responses for an offline advertising campaign and campaign information describing the offline advertising campaign; comparing the received campaign information to one or more other advertising campaigns to determine a portion of offline advertising inventory to allocate to the offline advertising campaign; and allocating the determined portion of advertising inventory to the offline advertising campaign.
- Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the received campaign information can include price, target audience and category details of an advertising offering of the offline advertising campaign.
- the received campaign information can include a past response rate for the offline advertising campaign.
- the received campaign information can include an estimated number of audience members.
- the audience-member responses can include mobile device responses. Comparing can include predicting a number of the audience-member responses based on the campaign information. Comparing the campaign information to other advertising campaigns can include using similar information for the other advertising campaigns as the campaign information.
- Some implementations can include comparing the offer price to offer prices of the other advertising campaigns so that the determined portion is favorable for the offline advertising campaign when either the offer price compares favorably to the offer prices of the other advertising campaigns or the campaign information compares favorably to the other advertising campaigns.
- the determined portion being favorable can include being beneficial to an objective relating to the offline advertising campaign.
- Some implementations can include providing updates, relating to the allocating, through a user interface in substantially real time.
- Some implementations can include broadcasting an advertisement from the offline advertising campaign to an audience.
- Some implementations can include receiving an amount of audience member responses to the broadcast advertisement and charging for the broadcasting based on the amount and the offer price.
- the offline advertising can be conducted using one or more of broadcast radio, television or a newspaper.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an exemplary overview of offline advertising.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram showing allocation of offline advertising inventory.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of a system for allocating offline advertising inventory.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram showing exemplary data that can be included in campaign information.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a process for allocating offline advertising inventory.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing a process for allocating offline advertising inventory.
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document.
- Offline advertising can refer to advertising taking place through media channels other than the World Wide Web (e.g., advertising on radio and television stations, in newspapers, or through mail or email).
- An advertiser can provide campaign information and offer to pay a particular amount for each response generated by a campaign (e.g., making a purchase online or in a store, requesting additional information over the phone, visiting a retail store or website, sending a text message).
- campaigns advertisements can be, e.g., broadcast or displayed according to the allocation. For example, a 30-second slot in a radio station's morning drive program can be allocated to a campaign advertising an upcoming television show. When the broadcast time arrives for the 30-second slot, a campaign advertisement giving the TV show's premise and program information can be broadcast.
- Inventory can be allocated to ongoing campaigns with historical data detailing the campaign's past performance or new campaigns without historical data.
- Campaign performance can be measured, e.g., as a response rate.
- a response rate can be the number of people out of a total number of audience members receiving a campaign message that are influenced to respond by the message.
- the response can include making a purchase, visiting a business or using a service.
- These responsive acts can be performed, e.g., in person, online (e.g., via the Internet or other packet-switched data network) or over the phone.
- the acts can be tracked so that providers of advertising inventory (e.g., broadcasters) or advertisers (e.g., companies with advertising campaigns) are able to monitor campaign response rates.
- Allocating advertising inventory to campaigns without performance histories can include using what is known about a campaign to predict how well the campaign will perform. For example, a product being advertised through a campaign may be known to be very popular. Knowing what product will be advertised and that the product is popular can enable a prediction to made that the campaign will perform well relative to other campaigns advertising less popular products.
- Advertising inventory can be also be allocated to campaigns having historical performance data. Based on the historical data and other campaign information a prediction can be made regarding how well the campaign will perform given a potential inventory allocation. A quality assessment can be established based on the prediction and other factors. A campaign having a high quality assessment can be preferred in allocating inventory over a campaign having a low quality assessment.
- a campaign having a high quality assessment and a relatively low offer amount per response can receive a similar allocation preference to a campaign having a low quality assessment and a relatively high offer amount per response. Both campaigns can generate the same amount of revenue for the broadcaster. For example, a campaign predicted to receive 1,000 responses at $1 per response can generate the same amount as a campaign predicted to receive 250 response at $4 per response. Many other factors can be used to determine the allocation besides the offer amount and response rates such as the effective cost per thousand impressions (CPM), calculated based on an estimate of the size of the audience and total revenue expected, market saturation, product type and other factors.
- CPM effective cost per thousand impressions
- a low risk advertising solution can be created for advertisers in which no charge is made for advertising that generates no responses. Smaller advertisers with small advertising budgets who find it difficult and risky to buy offline advertising can try offline advertising with little or no risk. Broadcasters can also maximize the value of advertising inventory when the inventory is allocated either to campaigns that are likely to generate many responses or campaigns offering a relatively high amount per response. Advertisers can be required to continually improve their advertising campaigns to be more effective or raise the amount of the response offer. The approach in offline media selling can create new incentives for advertisers to make their campaigns perform better than other campaigns. Better performing campaigns can pay less per response.
- the described subject matter may also provide for one or more of the following potential benefits.
- An advertiser can know a campaign's relative performance in an advertising marketplace by the cost per response. The increased competition can improve the overall value of the inventory available. Advertisers lacking the ability to track the performance of their campaigns can gain awareness of which portion of their budget is producing the best results.
- a method including charging for responses can provide an advertiser performance tracking of the campaign. Performance tracking can provide information that enables advertisers to improve the return on their budgets and effectively allocate the budgets.

- the advertisement 414 is a message addressed to an advertiser's objective.
- the advertisement 414 can be in many different types of media.
- the advertisement 414 can be a print advertisement, radio advertisement or television advertisement.
- the advertisement 414 can influence an audience to respond, provide information or both.
- the product 416 is something being offered by an advertiser.
- the product 416 can be a product for sale such as a car or television.
- the product 416 can also be a service such as dental or travel services.
- the predicted responses 420 are the number of responses expected to a campaign 416 .
- the predicted responses 420 can be a number (e.g., 2,000 sales in response to the campaign 416 ).
- the predicted responses 420 can also be a rate (e.g., 1% of the listening audience will respond to the campaign 416 ).
- the number of predicted responses 420 can be determined when expressed as a rate using information on the audience size the campaign 416 may reach.
- an advertising system can received campaign information 412 , such as a product price 402 , a target audience 404 , product category 406 , past response rate 408 and estimated audience members 410 .
- the campaign information 412 can be used to predicted the number of responses 420 to the campaign. For example, if a campaign has a product with a very high relative product price 402 , the system can expect a lower number of responses to the campaign 416 .
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a process 500 for allocating offline advertising inventory.
- An advertising system implementing the process 500 can receive information from various advertising campaigns and then determine how to allocate the advertising inventory available to the system to the campaigns.
- the process 500 receives an offer price for responses and campaign information.
- the offer price can be a price per response. For example, an advertiser can offer $1.00 per product sold in response to a campaign.
- the process 500 also receives campaign information discussed in more detail above.
- the process 500 compares the campaign information from a given advertising campaign to other advertising campaigns.
- part of the campaign information can be a past response rate for the campaign.
- the process 500 can determine which campaigns are likely to receive the best response rates in the future by comparing the past response rates.
- the process 500 determines what portion of inventory to allocation to a campaign. The determination can be based on the comparing, at 504 , by the process 500 . Determining what portion to allocate can include considering how profitable each of several potential allocations will be. The determining can also take into account other factors such as saturation of markets and the potential of campaigns to improve over time.
- the process 500 allocates the portion of inventory to the campaign.
- Allocating the portion can include assigning the portion to the campaign. In this manner, the process 500 can avoid allocating inventory to more than one campaign.
- inventory can be allocated to one campaign (e.g., one radio advertisement can play at a particular time).
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing a process 600 for allocating offline advertising inventory.
- Advertising inventory can be in demand.
- advertisers can, e.g., offer to pay more or create ads that generate more responses relative to other advertisers. Having such a favorable allocation can facilitate an advertiser's reaching campaign objectives.
- an allocation not being favorable to an advertiser can involve a campaign not receiving any allocation or a small allocation of inventory. For example, an advertiser can offer to pay less for given inventory than the inventory is worth or than other advertisers are willing to pay. In such a situation, the advertiser's campaign may receive no allocation of inventory.
- Advertising campaigns can produce many responses.
- the value a media provider receives for broadcasting the campaign's advertisements will depend on the number of responses to the campaign.
- the media provider can receive a higher amount per response.
- the process 600 compares an advertising campaign's response rate to the response rate of other campaigns.
- the process 600 can use the response rate as an indication of what response rate to expect for subsequent allocations of advertising inventory. Based on the comparison, at 602 , the process 600 can estimate which campaigns will receive the most responses.
- the process 600 can also compare other factors besides response rates such as market saturation (e.g., to avoid playing too many advertisements for car dealerships) and the target audience (e.g., giving preference to advertisers targeting the media provider's particular audience).
- the process 600 determines whether the response rate is relatively high or not based on the comparison, at 602 . If the response rate is relatively high, the process 600 can continue by allocating inventory to the campaign. For example, the process 600 , at 610 , can schedule the campaign ads to play or appear in a particular time slot of a media provider. The process 600 , at 612 , can broadcast the ads or provide the ads to a media provider for broadcast (e.g., to be played on a radio station).
- the process 600 can determine that the campaign does not have a relatively high response rate compared to other advertising campaigns. In this case, the process 600 continues, at 606 , by comparing the campaign's offer price per response to the offer prices of other advertisers. The process 600 , at 608 , can determine whether the offer price is relatively high and continue, at 610 , by scheduling the campaigns ads. If the offer price is not relatively high, the process 600 can end without allocating advertising inventory to the campaign.
- the process 600 is an example to demonstrate using both response rates and offer prices in allocating offline advertising inventory.
- the process 600 can also be implemented so that response rates and response offer prices are considered simultaneously in determining an allocation rather than sequentially, as shown.

Abstract
A computer-implemented method of allocating offline advertising, the method including receiving an offer price for audience-member responses for an offline advertising campaign and campaign information describing the offline advertising campaign, comparing the received campaign information to one or more other advertising campaigns to determine a portion of offline advertising inventory to allocate to the offline advertising campaign, and allocating the determined portion of advertising inventory to the offline advertising campaign.
Description
- This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/348,260, filed Jan. 2, 2009, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- This document generally describes allocating offline advertising inventory to offline advertising campaigns such as those appearing on television, radio and in print.
- Advertisements can be included in various forms of offline media. For example, offline ads, such as broadcast on radio, can be a powerful way for advertisers to reach an audience. Members of the audience can be influenced, e.g., to make purchases, investigate products or use services that are advertised. Offline media providers, such as radio stations and newspapers, can make advertising inventory available to advertisers. Advertising inventory can include advertising spots (e.g., 30-second time slots in a radio broadcast or parts of a newspaper page) and can be allocated to advertising campaigns. Allocating can include scheduling and reserving the spot for a particular campaign. An advertising campaign can be a comprehensive advertising plan that consists of a series of messages published or broadcast in a variety of media over a specific time frame. Advertisers can create campaigns that center on a single theme or idea, such as to promote a product or service. The campaign messages, sometimes called “creatives,” can be media content such as recorded audio or video. The campaign messages can be referred to generically as advertisement messages or simply as advertisements.
- This document describes techniques for allocating offline advertising inventory. In general, advertising inventory can be allocated to an offline advertising campaign based on comparing the campaign to other offline advertising campaigns.
- In one implementation, the described subject matter in this specification can be a computer-implemented method of allocating offline advertising, the method including receiving an offer price for audience-member responses for an offline advertising campaign and campaign information describing the offline advertising campaign; comparing the received campaign information to one or more other advertising campaigns to determine a portion of offline advertising inventory to allocate to the offline advertising campaign; and allocating the determined portion of advertising inventory to the offline advertising campaign. Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- These and other implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The received campaign information can include price, target audience and category details of an advertising offering of the offline advertising campaign. The received campaign information can include a past response rate for the offline advertising campaign. The received campaign information can include an estimated number of audience members. The audience-member responses can include mobile device responses. Comparing can include predicting a number of the audience-member responses based on the campaign information. Comparing the campaign information to other advertising campaigns can include using similar information for the other advertising campaigns as the campaign information.
- These and other implementations can also optionally include one or more of the following features. Some implementations can include comparing the offer price to offer prices of the other advertising campaigns so that the determined portion is favorable for the offline advertising campaign when either the offer price compares favorably to the offer prices of the other advertising campaigns or the campaign information compares favorably to the other advertising campaigns. The determined portion being favorable can include being beneficial to an objective relating to the offline advertising campaign. Some implementations can include providing updates, relating to the allocating, through a user interface in substantially real time. Some implementations can include broadcasting an advertisement from the offline advertising campaign to an audience. Some implementations can include receiving an amount of audience member responses to the broadcast advertisement and charging for the broadcasting based on the amount and the offer price. The offline advertising can be conducted using one or more of broadcast radio, television or a newspaper.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- In general, this document describes allocating offline advertising inventory. Offline advertising can refer to advertising taking place through media channels other than the World Wide Web (e.g., advertising on radio and television stations, in newspapers, or through mail or email). An advertiser can provide campaign information and offer to pay a particular amount for each response generated by a campaign (e.g., making a purchase online or in a store, requesting additional information over the phone, visiting a retail store or website, sending a text message). Because the demand for particular advertising inventory may exceed available inventory, decisions can be made regarding how to allocate the available inventory to the campaigns. When inventory is allocated to a campaign, campaigns advertisements can be, e.g., broadcast or displayed according to the allocation. For example, a 30-second slot in a radio station's morning drive program can be allocated to a campaign advertising an upcoming television show. When the broadcast time arrives for the 30-second slot, a campaign advertisement giving the TV show's premise and program information can be broadcast.
- Inventory can be allocated to ongoing campaigns with historical data detailing the campaign's past performance or new campaigns without historical data. Campaign performance can be measured, e.g., as a response rate. A response rate can be the number of people out of a total number of audience members receiving a campaign message that are influenced to respond by the message. The response can include making a purchase, visiting a business or using a service. These responsive acts can be performed, e.g., in person, online (e.g., via the Internet or other packet-switched data network) or over the phone. The acts can be tracked so that providers of advertising inventory (e.g., broadcasters) or advertisers (e.g., companies with advertising campaigns) are able to monitor campaign response rates.
- Allocating advertising inventory to campaigns without performance histories can include using what is known about a campaign to predict how well the campaign will perform. For example, a product being advertised through a campaign may be known to be very popular. Knowing what product will be advertised and that the product is popular can enable a prediction to made that the campaign will perform well relative to other campaigns advertising less popular products.
- Advertising inventory can be also be allocated to campaigns having historical performance data. Based on the historical data and other campaign information a prediction can be made regarding how well the campaign will perform given a potential inventory allocation. A quality assessment can be established based on the prediction and other factors. A campaign having a high quality assessment can be preferred in allocating inventory over a campaign having a low quality assessment.
- Furthermore, a campaign having a high quality assessment and a relatively low offer amount per response can receive a similar allocation preference to a campaign having a low quality assessment and a relatively high offer amount per response. Both campaigns can generate the same amount of revenue for the broadcaster. For example, a campaign predicted to receive 1,000 responses at $1 per response can generate the same amount as a campaign predicted to receive 250 response at $4 per response. Many other factors can be used to determine the allocation besides the offer amount and response rates such as the effective cost per thousand impressions (CPM), calculated based on an estimate of the size of the audience and total revenue expected, market saturation, product type and other factors.
- Advantageously, the described subject matter may provide for one or more of the following potential benefits. A low risk advertising solution can be created for advertisers in which no charge is made for advertising that generates no responses. Smaller advertisers with small advertising budgets who find it difficult and risky to buy offline advertising can try offline advertising with little or no risk. Broadcasters can also maximize the value of advertising inventory when the inventory is allocated either to campaigns that are likely to generate many responses or campaigns offering a relatively high amount per response. Advertisers can be required to continually improve their advertising campaigns to be more effective or raise the amount of the response offer. The approach in offline media selling can create new incentives for advertisers to make their campaigns perform better than other campaigns. Better performing campaigns can pay less per response.
- The described subject matter may also provide for one or more of the following potential benefits. An advertiser can know a campaign's relative performance in an advertising marketplace by the cost per response. The increased competition can improve the overall value of the inventory available. Advertisers lacking the ability to track the performance of their campaigns can gain awareness of which portion of their budget is producing the best results. A method including charging for responses can provide an advertiser performance tracking of the campaign. Performance tracking can provide information that enables advertisers to improve the return on their budgets and effectively allocate the budgets.

FIG. 1 is a diagram 100 showing an exemplary overview of offline advertising. To achieve an advertising objective (e.g., selling a product) an advertiser, or the advertiser's agent, can create advertisements as part of an advertising campaign. The advertisement can be broadcast by a radio station to a large audience. Some portion of the audience can respond to the advertisement by, e.g., making a phone call. The responses can be tracked and the advertiser can be charged based on the responses. - The advertiser 104 is an entity having an advertising objective. The advertising objective can be to influence people to respond, such as to buy a product, use a service or finding out more about a product or service. The advertiser 104 can be an individual, group or company that, e.g., wants to sell a product. The advertiser 104 can also be an advertising agency that represents and creates advertising campaigns for others.
- The advertiser 104 can have an advertising campaign including an
advertisement 108. Theadvertisement 108 can include a message designed to further the advertiser's 104 objectives. For example, theadvertisement 108 can be an audio recording of actors describing the beneficial aspects of a product. Theadvertisement 108 can also be print media or other offline advertisement. The advertiser 104 can communicate with anadvertising system 102. - The
advertising system 102 allocates advertising inventory to an advertising campaign. Theadvertising system 102 can be a computer system including, e.g., one or more computing platforms, storage devices, user interfaces and network connections. Theadvertising system 102 can include a system or a connection to a system for charging advertisers. Theadvertising system 102 can store a receivedadvertisement 108 and the communicate theadvertisement 110 to abroadcast entity 112. Theadvertising system 102 can include a database where advertising media is stored. - The
broadcast entity 112 communicates with an audience. Thebroadcast entity 112 can be a radio station with terrestrial broadcast equipment. Thebroadcast entity 112 can also include satellite broadcast equipment. Thebroadcast entity 112 can also be, e.g., a newspaper publisher or television broadcast station. Thebroadcast entity 112 can transmit a broadcast 114. - The broadcast 114 is a message that can be received. The broadcast 114 can be signals transmitted through the air or over wires, or a palpable product. The signals can be radio signals communicating audio and other content. The signals can also be television signals sent through the air or over cable communicating audiovisual content. The palpable product can be a newspaper or other printed material.
- A
radio 116 deciphers and makes transmitted content perceptible. Theradio 116 can be an FM (frequency modulation) radio. Theradio 116 can also be a satellite radio. Theradio 116 can decipher analog or digital radio signals. Theradio 116 can include an amplifier and speaker to make content audible. - The audible content can include a message conveyed 118. The message conveyed 118 is an attempt to communicate and can include, e.g., speech, music and sound effects that convey the message 118. The message conveyed 118 can attempt to influence an audience 120.
- The audience 120 is a group of people. The audience 120 can be located within a particular geographic region (e.g., a city or part of a city) or widely distributed (e.g., across a state, country or planet). The audience 120 can be include many subgroups and individuals. The audience 120 can correspond to one or more metropolitan areas, designated market areas, cities or zip codes. A designated market area (DMA) can be an area used by a media research group to identify broadcast stations whose broadcast signals reach specific geographic areas and attract the most viewers. A DMA may not overlap other DMAs.
- A
listener response 122 is a response performed by a member of the audience 120. Theresponse 122 can include making a purchase, using a service, or otherwise responding. For example, theresponse 122 can be dialing a phone number, sending a SMS (short message service) message from a mobile device, sending an email, visiting a website, visiting a store, etc. - The mobile phone 124 is an electronic device used for mobile voice or data communication. The communication can be via a network of base stations (e.g., cell sites). The mobile phone 124 can support many services such as SMS for text messaging, email, and packet switching for access to the Internet.
- The
listener response information 126 is information about a response performed. Theinformation 126 can include, e.g., a date and time a telephone call was made to a tracked telephone number, an SMS message was sent, or a tracked URL (uniform resource locator) was requested. - In operation, the advertiser 104 provides the
advertisement 108 to theadvertising system 102. The receivedadvertisement 108 can be associated with an advertising campaign. Theadvertising system 102 can allocate advertising inventory for campaign. At the time or place indicated by the allocation, theadvertisement 110 can be transmitted to abroadcast entity 112 for broadcast. Thebroadcast entity 112 can transmit the broadcast 114 to aradio 116. Theradio 116 can play the broadcast 114 so it is audible to the audience 120. Through theradio 116, the advertiser's 104 message 118 is conveyed to the audience 120. Some listeners in the audience 120 on receiving the conveyed message 118 can be influenced to respond 122. Thelistener response 122 can involve the use a device such as a mobile phone 124 to send an SMS message, email or make a phone call. When theresponse 122 is performed on the device 124,listener response information 126 is transmitted to theadvertising system 102 for tracking. Based on thelistener response information 126, such as the number of phone calls received, theadvertising system 102 charges the advertiser 104 for the advertising. -

FIG. 4 is a diagram 400 showing the data that can be included in campaign information. When an advertiser requests advertising inventory, information about the advertiser's campaign can be used to predict the number of responses the campaign might expect. The information can be provided by the advertiser, calculated based on other data or provided by third parties. - The
campaign 416 is an advertising campaign. Thecampaign 416 can represent an advertiser's effort to accomplish a particular business objective. For example, thecampaign 416 can provide the public with information about a new business that will soon be opening. An advertiser can have multiple campaigns and acampaign 416 can be shared by multiple advertisers. - The
campaign information 412 is information describing an advertising campaign. Thecampaign information 412 can come from different sources, such as the advertiser or third parties (e.g., a broadcast ratings entity). Thecampaign information 412 can allow a system to predict how the campaign will be received by an audience. Thecampaign information 412 can include details of one or more of price, target audience and category details of an advertising offering, such as theproduct 418, of thecampaign 416. Thecampaign information 412 can also include target demographics, product markets (e.g., metropolitan area, DMA, city, zip), time sensitivity of advertising messages, special promotions (e.g., expressed as an advantage over the currently available base product by percentage), historical performance, historical and current performance of similar campaigns (e.g., comparing thecampaign information 412 with campaign information of other campaigns such as the potential target audience similarity), trend data and general consumer behavior (e.g., with respect to other media forms such as online, print, TV, radio), market size and market-related information, cyclical nature of offering (e.g., school supplies during fall), hours of operation (e.g., for a call center for phone based responses, or retail store hours), production quality (e.g., audio or video quality) of an advertisement, such as anadvertisement 414, differing appeal based on time of day of a broadcast, and content components (e.g., gender of a voice, number of voices, celebrity voice, music, background music) of an advertisement, such asadvertisement 414. - The
advertisement 414 is a message addressed to an advertiser's objective. Theadvertisement 414 can be in many different types of media. For example, theadvertisement 414 can be a print advertisement, radio advertisement or television advertisement. Theadvertisement 414 can influence an audience to respond, provide information or both. - The
product 416 is something being offered by an advertiser. Theproduct 416 can be a product for sale such as a car or television. Theproduct 416 can also be a service such as dental or travel services. - The predicted responses 420 are the number of responses expected to a
campaign 416. For example, the predicted responses 420 can be a number (e.g., 2,000 sales in response to the campaign 416). The predicted responses 420 can also be a rate (e.g., 1% of the listening audience will respond to the campaign 416). The number of predicted responses 420 can be determined when expressed as a rate using information on the audience size thecampaign 416 may reach. - In operation, an advertising system can received
campaign information 412, such as a product price 402, a target audience 404, product category 406, past response rate 408 and estimated audience members 410. Thecampaign information 412 can be used to predicted the number of responses 420 to the campaign. For example, if a campaign has a product with a very high relative product price 402, the system can expect a lower number of responses to thecampaign 416. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing aprocess 500 for allocating offline advertising inventory. An advertising system implementing theprocess 500 can receive information from various advertising campaigns and then determine how to allocate the advertising inventory available to the system to the campaigns. - The
process 500, at 502, receives an offer price for responses and campaign information. The offer price can be a price per response. For example, an advertiser can offer $1.00 per product sold in response to a campaign. Theprocess 500, at 502, also receives campaign information discussed in more detail above. - The
process 500, at 504, compares the campaign information from a given advertising campaign to other advertising campaigns. For example, part of the campaign information can be a past response rate for the campaign. Theprocess 500 can determine which campaigns are likely to receive the best response rates in the future by comparing the past response rates. - The
process 500, at 506, determines what portion of inventory to allocation to a campaign. The determination can be based on the comparing, at 504, by theprocess 500. Determining what portion to allocate can include considering how profitable each of several potential allocations will be. The determining can also take into account other factors such as saturation of markets and the potential of campaigns to improve over time. - The
process 500, at 508, allocates the portion of inventory to the campaign. Allocating the portion can include assigning the portion to the campaign. In this manner, theprocess 500 can avoid allocating inventory to more than one campaign. In general, inventory can be allocated to one campaign (e.g., one radio advertisement can play at a particular time). -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing aprocess 600 for allocating offline advertising inventory. Advertising inventory can be in demand. To be allocated desired inventory, advertisers can, e.g., offer to pay more or create ads that generate more responses relative to other advertisers. Having such a favorable allocation can facilitate an advertiser's reaching campaign objectives. On the other hand, an allocation not being favorable to an advertiser can involve a campaign not receiving any allocation or a small allocation of inventory. For example, an advertiser can offer to pay less for given inventory than the inventory is worth or than other advertisers are willing to pay. In such a situation, the advertiser's campaign may receive no allocation of inventory. - Advertising campaigns can produce many responses. In a scenario in which an advertiser is charged per response, the value a media provider receives for broadcasting the campaign's advertisements will depend on the number of responses to the campaign. To achieve comparable value for a given portion of inventory from an advertiser expected to receive relatively few responses, the media provider can receive a higher amount per response.
- The
process 600, at 602, compares an advertising campaign's response rate to the response rate of other campaigns. Theprocess 600 can use the response rate as an indication of what response rate to expect for subsequent allocations of advertising inventory. Based on the comparison, at 602, theprocess 600 can estimate which campaigns will receive the most responses. At 602, theprocess 600 can also compare other factors besides response rates such as market saturation (e.g., to avoid playing too many advertisements for car dealerships) and the target audience (e.g., giving preference to advertisers targeting the media provider's particular audience). - The
process 600, at 604, determines whether the response rate is relatively high or not based on the comparison, at 602. If the response rate is relatively high, theprocess 600 can continue by allocating inventory to the campaign. For example, theprocess 600, at 610, can schedule the campaign ads to play or appear in a particular time slot of a media provider. Theprocess 600, at 612, can broadcast the ads or provide the ads to a media provider for broadcast (e.g., to be played on a radio station). - The
process 600, at 604, can determine that the campaign does not have a relatively high response rate compared to other advertising campaigns. In this case, theprocess 600 continues, at 606, by comparing the campaign's offer price per response to the offer prices of other advertisers. Theprocess 600, at 608, can determine whether the offer price is relatively high and continue, at 610, by scheduling the campaigns ads. If the offer price is not relatively high, theprocess 600 can end without allocating advertising inventory to the campaign. - The
process 600 is an example to demonstrate using both response rates and offer prices in allocating offline advertising inventory. Theprocess 600 can also be implemented so that response rates and response offer prices are considered simultaneously in determining an allocation rather than sequentially, as shown. -

Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- Although a few implementations have been described in detail above, other modifications are possible. Moreover, other mechanisms for allocating offline advertising may be used. In addition, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. Other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed from, the described systems. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
