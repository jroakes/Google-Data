- the content associator module 108 may utilize one or more third party applications 202 , the NLP parser 218 , the sentiment analysis module 220 , the image analyzer 222 , the movement analyzer 224 and the heuristics engine 216 to analyze and parse text included in media content items 104 as well as analyze moving image frames of the media content items 104 to automatically generate content associations and/or automatically select content associations stored in the content association store 118 .
- an NLP parser 218 may be combined with a sentiment analysis module 220 and may be relied upon to analyze images and/or audiovisual content to determine a sentiment of the media content items 104 .
- an image analyzer 222 and a movement analyzer 224 may be used to detect and/or classify a sequence of images depicting a face smiling.
- a heuristics engine 216 may include a rule that automatically associates a media content item 104 having a sequence of images that have been analyzed to detect a smile with a “#happy” content association from the content association store 118 as the media content item 104 is stored within the media content store 106 in the media content management system 100 .
- an NLP parser 218 may parse text strings included in the images and determine a match to the word “AWESOME.” Additionally, the NLP parser 218 may interpret the smile to mean a positive sentiment.
- a sentiment analysis module 220 may indicate that the word “AWESOME” is associated with a strong positive sentiment, and a heuristics engine 216 may include a rule that automatically associates the “#happy” content association (and/or other positive content associations) with media content items 104 that have a strong positive sentiment.
- a search interface module 120 may manage search requests and/or search queries for media content items 104 in the media content management system 100 received from user devices 102 , in an embodiment.
- a search query may be received at the search interface module 120 and processed by a search router rules engine 206 , in one embodiment.
- a search interface module 120 may receive a request for a collection from a user device 102 based on a content association, such as “#HAPPY,” “#RUDE,” “#FOMO,” and so forth as a result of a selection of an animated key or a text search.
- the search interface module 120 may communicate the search query to the search router rules engine 206 to process the request, in an embodiment.
- a content association management module 214 may manage one or more content associations associated with each media content item 104 in the media content management system 100 .
- Content associations may be associated with media content items 104 through the content association management module 214 through various interfaces, such as user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs may be used to receive, access, and store data from media content sources 124 , third party applications 202 (and/or websites), and user devices 102 .
- the content association management module 214 may manage how content associations are associated with the media content items 104 through various procurement methods, in one embodiment.
- a dynamic keyboard interface module 208 may manage interface communications between the media content management system 100 and user devices 102 .
- the dynamic keyboard interface 122 as illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B , may include a menu selection element that enables the searching user to view trending media content on the media content management system 100 .
- “Trending” media content may include frequently viewed and/or frequently shared content by users of the media content management system 100 .
- the dynamic keyboard interface module 208 may receive the request for trending media content and retrieve media content items 104 from the media content store 106 that have the highest number of shares in the past hour, for example.
- the dynamic keyboard interface module 208 may then, through the dynamic keyboard presentation module 212 , provide the retrieved trending media content items to the dynamic keyboard interface 122 through the dynamic keyboard application 130 , in one embodiment.
- the dynamic keyboard presentation module 212 may determine how the media content items are presented and in what order, for example. In one embodiment, if no media content items 104 satisfy a search query or request from a user device, the dynamic keyboard interface module 208 may, in conjunction or in coordination with the search interface module 120 and search router rules engine 206 , deliver other media content items 104 that are popular or have been shared.
- content items may be selected by the dynamic keyboard interface module 208 from third party applications 202 (or websites), such as TUMBLR, to be included in the search results or animated keys of the dynamic keyboard interface 122 .
- a heuristics engine 216 may include one or more heuristics rules to determine one or more outcomes.
- the content associator module 108 may use the heuristics engine 216 to determine a ranking of candidate content associations for a media content item 104 based on the attributes of the media content item 104 .
- Certain attributes may have various heuristic rules associated with them, such as visual movements (e.g., detected smiles may be associated with a “#HAPPY” content association), visual characteristics (e.g., blinking text may indicate an importance of the text string, or a hashtag symbol may indicate a particular content association), content sources, characters included in the media content item, and other attributes.
- heuristic rules may be generated by administrators to automatically generate content associations for content items based on attributes, in one embodiment.
- heuristic rules may also use ranges of parameters for various attributes. For example, thirty selections of a media content item 104 for sharing by a particular user may be used in a heuristic rule to present the same media content item in response to a search query from the particular user where there are few search results.
- the range here may be defined as a threshold number of shares, for example.
- a sentiment analysis module 220 may provide analysis of various text received by the media content management system 100 to determine whether the text exhibits positive, negative, or neutral connotations. This information may be used by various modules to efficiently translate a search query to extract the expressive intent of the searching user. For example, a dictionary of terms may be used, in multiple languages, to determine whether text may be determined to have positive, negative, or neutral connotations.
- the sentiment analysis module 220 may, in one embodiment, use various third party applications 202 to perform this analysis.
- the search router rules engine 206 may provide one or more collections of media content items 104 based on the connotations of the search query, for example.
- FIG. 2B is a high-level block diagram of a system for categorizing procured content for performing search in a media content management system, according to an embodiment.
- a content association management module 214 may include a metadata analyzer module 240 , a user interface module 242 , a content association selection module 244 , and an association relating module 246 , in one embodiment.
- a metadata analyzer module 240 may generate one or more content associations based on the attributes of the media content items 104 . For example, media content items 104 from the movie, “Toy Story,” may be automatically content associated in the collection “Toy Story” based on a movie metadata attribute associated with the media content items 104 . In one embodiment, administrators of the media content source 124 may associate one or metadata attributes to the media content items 104 .
- Metadata attributes may be stored in various ways in the source files of the media content items 104 , such as header content associations within the source files, as well as other files associated with the source files, such as XML files describing content items being procured in batches by the media content system 100 .
- the metadata analyzer module 240 may parse through the metadata associated with media content items 104 and automatically generate and/or select content associations from the content association store 118 based on one or more rules, in one embodiment. As illustrated in FIG. 2B , the content association store 118 may store association-attribute relationships 250 , such that attributes have been associated with content associations. In this way, the metadata analyzer module 240 may automatically assign a content association to a media content item 104 based on the association-attribute relationships 250 stored in the content association store 118 .
- Metadata attributes that may be analyzed by the metadata analyzer module 240 includes an Internet Protocol (IP) address of the mobile device or user device used by a searching user or curating user.
- IP Internet Protocol
- An IP address may provide an indication of a geographic location of a user, including country of origin.
- GPS Global Position System
- a Global Position System (GPS) of a mobile device may include a current geographic location of the user.
- GPS Global Position System
- Another metadata attribute that may be analyzed by the metadata analyzer module 240 includes the one or more languages selected by the viewing user. In this way, language preference may help inform searching intent, curating intent, or both.

- language and country of origin may be a metadata attribute that may be determined by a metadata analyzer module 240 .
- a user interface module 242 may provide one or more user interfaces for a user device 102 , such as a computer or mobile device, to select one or more content associations for procured media content items 104 .
- a curating user may be given the ability to assign one or more content associations from the content association store 118 to media content items 104 .
- the content association management module 214 enables manual selection of content associations for categorizing the procured media content items 104 .
- a content association selection module 244 may provide one or more content associations from the content association store 118 in one or more user interfaces provided by the user interface module 242 , according to an embodiment.
- the content association selection module 244 may present predicted content associations based on the content association-attribute associations 250 stored in the content association store 118 for selection and/or confirmation by a curating user operating a user device 102 .
- a media content item 104 may have a genre attribute of comedy based on pre-populated information from the media content source 124 . Because the “comedy” attribute may be associated with a “#HAPPY” content association, the media content item 104 may have been assigned the “#HAPPY” content association by the metadata analyzer module 240 , in one embodiment.
- the content association selection module 244 may present the “#HAPPY” content association along with other related content associations in a user interface provided by the user interface module 242 for a curating user to assign or revoke content associations associated with the associated content item 104 .
- the association-attribute associations 250 stored in the content association store 118 may include content associations that are related to other content associations, in one embodiment. For example, a “#HAPPY” content association may be related to a “LOL” and a “LMAO” content association because both LOL and LMAO include a “laughing” interpretation. As a result, other content associations may be presented for selection by a curating user, in one embodiment.
- media content items may be preprocessed 252 before being stored in the media content store 106 .
- This enables the media content items 104 to be retrieved quickly and rendered seamlessly in the dynamic keyboard interface 122 on a user device 102 .
- Pre-processing of media content items 252 may include reducing pixel count, modifying resolution definition, and other file size reduction techniques.
- the dynamic keyboard presentation module 212 may be used to perform this pre-processing of media content items 252 , in one embodiment.
- pre-processing of media content items 252 enables a dynamic keyboard interface 122 , presented to a user on a user device 102 b , to render at least two renderings of at least two media content items in animation and to display them concurrently in the dynamic keyboard interface 122 .
- An association relating module 246 may relate content associations to media content items 104 in the media content store 106 .
- Content associations may be associated to content items automatically by a metadata analyzer module 240 (or other modules in the media content management system 100 ) or the content associations may be associated as a result of a selection of content associations received through a user interface provided by the user interface module 242 .
- item-association relationships 254 are stored in the media content store 106 .
- Each content item may have a content identifier and each content association may have a content association identifier such that the item-association relationships 254 may be stored in the media content store 106 .
- a content item (“item”) may be related to one or more associations (“ass′n”), and the item-association relationships 254 are stored in the media content store 106 , for example.
- FIG. 2C is a high-level block diagram of a system for composing a composite content item in a media content management system, according to an embodiment.
- a composer interface 264 may be provided on a user device 102 that enables a viewing user to search media content items 104 and select two or more content items to generate a composite content item. As illustrated, two content items have been selected in the composer interface 264 to create a composite content item 266 having the combined attributes of the two selected content items. For example, a viewing user may search for “No” through a search interface, described in more detail later.
- a first selected content item may have been associated with content associations of “No” and “Chandler” while a second selected content item may have been associated with content associations of “No” and “Taylor.”
- the composite content item 266 may include the content associations “No,” “Chandler,” and “Taylor.”
- the composite content item 266 may be received by a composer interface module 262 and stored by the composite item module 260 as a media content item 104 in the media content store 106 . As further illustrated in FIG.
- a composite item module 260 may operate in conjunction with, or include, a metadata analyzer module 240 , a content association selection module 244 , and an association relating module 246 that operate similarly as described above, in addition to a composer interface module 262 .
- a composite content item 266 may be associated with an expressive statement that conveys a different meaning than the individual content items included in the composite content item 266 .
- a first content item 104 with the character “Chandler” expressing the statement, “No,” may convey a particular meaning to most users of the media content management system 100 .
- a curating user of the media content management system 100 may associate other content associations with that particular content item 104 , such as “#cool” and “FRIENDS.”
- the second content item 104 depicting a celebrity, TAYLOR LAUTNER may evoke a separate and different meaning from the first content item 104 depicting the character “CHANDLER” from the television show, FRIENDS.
- the second content item 104 may be content associated, automatically or manually, with a content association of “cool” and/or “famous,” for example, in addition to the shared content association of “No.”
- the combination of the two media content items presents information different than each of the media content items presented separately.
- the expressive statement presented by the composite content item 266 may be a simple conglomeration of the content associations associated with the individual content items included in the composite content item 266 .
- an expressive statement that is different from the content associations included in the individual content items may be extracted or otherwise interpreted from the composite content item 266 . This expressive statement, as stored by the associated content associations associated with the composite content item 266 , will be used in correlating a searching user's intent to relevant content items, as described herein.

- a content associator module 108 may include a content associating algorithm 406 for automatically selecting a content association 402 for a media content item 104 .
- the content associator module 108 may further include a content association selector 408 for selecting the content association 402 from the content association store 118 .
- the content associator module 108 may operate in conjunction with or include an image analyzer 222 , a movement analyzer 224 , and a heuristics engine 216 to aide in automatically selecting a content association 402 for a media content item 104 .
- An image analyzer 222 may include computer vision techniques that recognize facial features, such as a face, eyes, a mouth smiling, a mouth frowning, and so forth. An image analyzer 222 may further include other computer vision techniques and/or pattern recognition algorithms to create baseline training sets for recognizing these facial characteristics. Similarly, a movement analyzer 224 may include computer vision techniques and/or pattern recognition algorithms, as well as machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques to recognize crying, laughing, falling, and other actions that may be modeled in similar ways. A movement analyzer 224 may also include eye-tracking functionality to identify a location of eyes within a set of images or an animated image.
- the eye-tracking functionality of the movement analyzer 224 may be used in conjunction with one or more other modules in the media content management system 100 to generate a new media content item 104 , such as rendering a pair of sunglasses onto the animated set of images over the detected eyes within the images, for example.

- a partner may publish a stand-alone application that utilizes a media content management system 100 through application programming interfaces used to access the search router rules engine 206 and/or other modules described herein.
- a stand alone application for NBC UNIVERSAL may specifically present media content items 104 from movies and television shows produced and owned by NBC UNIVERSAL, but that application may use one or more application programming interfaces to present a dynamic keyboard interface 122 .
- a media content management system 100 may boost visibility of content associations based on paid advertising, partnerships, sponsored ads, and so forth.
- FIG. 6 is a high-level block diagram of a system for performing search to implement animated inputs in a dynamic interface, according to some examples.
- a search router rules engine 206 may include a query analyzer 602 , an intent extractor 604 , an intent matcher 606 , and a machine learning module 608 .
- a query analyzer 602 may breakdown received text and/or picture into overlapping windows, in one embodiment. For example, a searching user may enter the search term “happy birthday” as a query.
- the query analyzer 602 may breakdown the query into words and partial words that overlap, such as “ha,” “happy,” “birth,” “birthday,” “happy birth,” and “happy birthday.”
- the query analyzer 602 may provide the words and partial words to the search interface module 120 for searching in the media content store 106 based on the words and partial words on the content associations of the associated media content items, in one embodiment.
- the query analyzer 602 may provide the words and partial words to the intent extractor 604 .
- the intent extractor 604 may have previously mapped or extracted intent from the query “happy birthday” to include an intent to celebrate a birthday.
- the term “happy birthday” may specifically be mapped only to content items having birthday elements, such as a cake, candles, the text string “happy birthday,” a party, a person blowing out candles, and the like.
- the intent extractor 604 may further provide the words and partial words to a natural language processing (NLP) parser 218 to derive meaning and/or intent from the search terms.
- NLP natural language processing
- An NLP parser 218 may be particularly useful, in one embodiment, where a search term is unrecognized.
- the intent extractor 604 may extract the intent of the searching user wishing to celebrate something happy based on the word “happy” being included in the search query. If, on the other hand, “muertos” is included in a dictionary or text strings included as metadata attributes of content items, then the NLP parser 218 may be relied upon to present content items associated with both the “happy” and “muertos” content associations.
- An intent matcher 606 may, in one embodiment, be used in the search router rules engine 206 to match an intent of a searching user to one or more content associations in a content association store 118 .
- the term “happy” included in the search query “happy dia de los muertos” may cause the search query to be matched by the intent matcher 606 to a “#happy” content association for further queries.
- the term “muertos” may be matched to a “dead” content association and a “Halloween” content association, in one embodiment. Because “dia de los muertos” is not directly related to Halloween, but is actually a Mexican holiday occurring on November 1, some content items may not be presented.
- An intent matcher 606 may adjust the matches, in one embodiment, between search phrases and content associations, in one embodiment. The matches may be stored in the content association store 118 , in one embodiment.
- the intent matcher 606 may, in conjunction with a machine learning module 608 , analyze user feedback, such as selecting content items having both a “Halloween” attribute and a “skull” attribute when those items are presented in search results in response to the “happy dia de los muertos” search query. As a result, the intent matcher 606 may generate a new match between the search phrase “happy dia de los muertos” and content items having both the “Halloween” and “skull” content associations. In one embodiment, the intent matcher 606 may determine a likelihood score of intent match based on probabilistic methods and/or machine learning for each match. This score may be stored in the content association store 118 for each intent match. These scores may be further based on statistical inference algorithms as provided by the NLP parser 218 and machine learning module 608 .
- a machine learning module 608 may use various machine learning methods, such as supervised and unsupervised learning methods, Bayesian knowledge base, Bayesian network, nearest neighbor, random walk, and other methods to determine various outcomes based on received training data and received user feedback (based on whether viewing users selected/shared content items presented in a search result set). For example, sometimes a random content item is presented along with the content items having a certain attribute, such as the “#happy” content association.

Abstract
Description
- Various embodiments relate generally to electrical and electronic hardware, computer software, wired and wireless network communications, and distributed software applications for enabling users to communicate with each other through graphical, or pictorial, content. More specifically, a system and a method provide for categorizing procured content for performing search to implement, for example, animated inputs in a dynamic interface.
- Conventional techniques for communicating among people have evolved away from mere pen-and-paper implementations as complex and creative messaging have increasingly relied on technological solutions. With the advent of computing devices, people communicate on the Internet in a multitude of ways through a multitude of platforms using a multitude of devices.
- For example, some conventional approaches for communicating between users of mobile devices may simply rely on SMS, messaging through a social networking application, or “texting.” Internet or mobile device users may exchange messages through these various mediums, for example. However, occasionally, users may wish to communicate via media content, such as GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format), or image files that include a static or animated set of images. Users may search the Internet for GIFs, copy them through an operating system's native web browser, and paste the GIFs in various messaging applications. These conventional systems are not well-suited to providing categorized content within a dynamic interface without expending resources or requiring manual intervention.
- While conventional approaches are functional, the usual structures and/or functionalities for discovering and sharing media content are not suited to the increasing technological demands required to optimally share expressive content.
- Thus, what is needed is a solution for effectively identifying content that matches a user's expressive intent without the limitations of conventional techniques.
- Various embodiments or examples (“examples”) of the invention are disclosed in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings:

- A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples, but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives, modifications, and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.
- Communicating with other people in the Internet age has never been easier. People may communicate through various messaging platforms, including, but not limited to, SMS, iMessage, social networking systems such as FACEBOOK and TWITTER, as well as other messaging applications like SNAPCHAT, WECHAT, LINE, and so forth. While text messaging remains the predominate method of communication, more and more pictorial messaging has emerged. Pictorial messaging, or sending messages that include pictorial content, is just emerging as a method of conveying information from one person to another. However, traditional methods of finding a pictorial content item that captures the expressive intent of a communicating person are lacking. One method includes opening a web browser on a user device, such as a mobile phone and searching, via an Internet search engine, for a pictorial content item, such as an animated GIF (Graphical Interchange Format) content item. After browsing through the search results, the communicating user must then copy and paste the content item into the desired messaging platform on the user device. This process is burdensome and not optimized for the user to efficiently locate and identify content items that match the user's expressive intent.
- Other methods of procuring content involve highly manual procedures, such as copying and storing content in a user's personal mobile device or computer. These methods also do not facilitate searching for content based on the expressive intent of the searching user. Further, existing systems and methods do not provide content in a dynamic interface as animated inputs on a user device.

FIG. 1A is a high-level block diagram depicting a mediacontent management system 100, according to some embodiments. The mediacontent management system 100 may receivemedia content items 104 frommedia content sources 124 that are stored in amedia content store 106.FIG. 1A and the other figures use like reference numerals to identify like elements. A letter after a reference numeral, such as “102 a,” indicates that the text refers specifically to the element having that particular reference numeral. A reference numeral in the text without a following letter, such as “102,” refers to any or all of the elements in the figures bearing that reference numeral (e.g., “102” in the text refers to reference numerals “102 a” and/or “102 b” in the figures). Only twouser devices 102 are illustrated inFIG. 1A in order to simplify and clarify the description. Administrators may access the mediacontent management system 100 through a user device 102 (e.g.,user devices - As mentioned above,
media content items 104 may include various types of content, such as animated GIFs (a series of images), a static image, an audio-visual content item/video, as well as composite content items, such as multiple animated GIFs and/or image content.Media content items 104 are received to the mediacontent management system 100 and stored into themedia content store 106. Amedia content item 104 may have one or more attributes, such as content source, dimensions, content branding (e.g., Paramount Pictures, NBC Universal, etc.), characters included in the content, text strings included in the content, and so forth. Attributes may include metadata attributes, in one embodiment. - In the
media content store 106, amedia content item 104 may be stored in associated with a collection, or a grouping ofmedia content items 104. Collections may be generated by administrators of the mediacontent management system 100, in one embodiment. A collection may be automatically generated, in one embodiment, based on one or more attributes shared by themedia content items 104 in the collection. In an embodiment, a content association, or a unique identifier, may be used to denote a collection in the mediacontent management system 100. For example, amedia content item 104 may be “content associated” as part of the “#happy” collection in the mediacontent management system 100. In one embodiment, a user or an administrator may content association themedia content item 104 as part of the “#happy” collection. In another embodiment, themedia content item 104 may be automatically content associated, or have an automatically generated content association associated with themedia content item 104 by acontent associator module 108 using content associations stored in acontent association store 118. In this way, content may be procured and categorized using content associations, such as “#happy,” in the mediacontent management system 100. Individual collections, or set of files, may each be labeled with a content association in the mediacontent management system 100. A particular file may be associated with one or more content associations, in one embodiment. - In one embodiment, a user of the media
content management system 100 may, through auser device 102 a, add content to a mediacontent management system 100. For example, a user may have installed anapplication extension 116 onto theuser device 102 a such that the user can “save” a content item 114 found through browsing aweb page 112 using abrowser 110 on theuser device 102 a. By saving the content item 114 using theapplication extension 116, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) may be stored in association with the content item 114 as an attribute of the content item, in one embodiment. Theapplication extension 116 may, in one embodiment, include a downloadable application that enables a user to browse to a web page and collect media content items presented on the web page. As an example, a web page for a blog may post a particularly interesting content item that may or may not be available on the mediacontent management system 100. Using theapplication extension 116, the user may browse to theweb page 112, access a menu through thebrowser 110, and select an option to save one or more content items 114 that have been presented on theweb page 112. In one embodiment, theapplication extension 116 is a mobile application that enablesmobile browsers 110 to perform this functionality. In other embodiments, theapplication extension 116 may be a browser extension application or applet that may be downloaded through thebrowser 110 on a mobile device or desktop computer. In a further embodiment, theapplication extension 116 may enable users to directly upload content items 114 to themedia content store 106 in the mediacontent management system 100. - In another embodiment, a copy of the content item 114 is stored in the
media content store 106 as part of a user operating theapplication extension 116 described above. In a further embodiment, a link or a URL of the content item 114 is stored in themedia content store 106. In yet another embodiment, a copy of the content item 114 is stored onto theuser device 102 a as part of a “saved” collection, or a user-generated collection on theuser device 102 a. A user may sign into his or her account onvarious user devices 102 such that the collections may be synchronized between theuser devices 102, including user-generated collections such as the “saved” collection. - Content items 114, presented on
web pages 112 or otherwise accessible through web servers, may be procured by administrators of the mediacontent management system 100 in other ways, in an embodiment. For example, content owners, such as movie studios, television studios, brand owners, and other content generators, may partner with administrators of the mediacontent management system 100 such that licensed content may be delivered and stored in themedia content store 106. In such a procurement process, content owners may providemedia content items 104 having pre-populated attributes, as mentioned above. Amedia content source 124, such as a content owner, may include content stores or databases on servers maintained and operated by the third-party sources or websites, for example. As part of the procurement process,content items 104 may be categorized into one or more collections by storing them in association with one or more content associations from thecontent association store 118. In one embodiment, content associations may be automatically generated by thecontent associator module 108 based on attributes of thecontent items 104. In another embodiment, content associations may be selected through one or more user interfaces or through an application programming interface (API). In a further embodiment,media content items 104 may be content associated by users of the mediacontent management system 100 after being stored in themedia content store 106 through one or more user interfaces onuser devices 102. - As further illustrated in
FIG. 1A , adynamic keyboard interface 122 may be provided on auser device 102 b, for example. Adynamic keyboard interface 122 may includemedia content items 104 as well as collections ofmedia content items 104. For example, thedynamic keyboard interface 122 may include a collection ofmedia content items 104 content associated as “#FOMO.” “#FOMO” is an expression in Internet slang, meaning “fear of missing out.” Thus,media content items 104 included in the “#FOMO” collection may be about or include expressive statements about the specific expression “fear of missing out.” One or more expressive statements may, in one embodiment, be extracted and/or otherwise interpreted from amedia content item 104. For example, a curating user may content association amedia content item 104 as “#FOMO” based on images in themedia content item 104 being related to the expression “fear of missing out,” such as a blinking text of “FOMO” in the images, captioned dialog from a movie or television show indicating the character in the images is lonely, has no friends, or otherwise has a fear of missing out on cool events. Through the procurement process, expressive statements may be mapped to content associations in the mediacontent management system 100. These expressive statements may correlate to a user's searching intent in performing a search via animated inputs in the dynamic interface, in one embodiment. - As illustrated in
FIG. 1A , thedynamic keyboard interface 122 may also include other animated keys, or regions of the dynamic keyboard that implement animated inputs. Animated keys of two hands clasped in a handshake, a baby crying, a pair of glasses, a “#happy” content association, and a “#LOL” content association are illustrated as example animated keys, in addition to the “#FOMO” animated key further including a champagne bottle. Though not illustrated, the animated keys may includemedia content items 104 that are rendered in thedynamic keyboard interface 122 as animations, meaning the content may be moving in a constant loop within the keys.Media content items 104 may be preprocessed to enable the animated inputs in the dynamic interface, in one embodiment. - Upon selecting one of the animated keys in the
dynamic keyboard interface 122, theuser device 102 b may communicate with the mediacontent management system 100 through asearch interface module 120. In one embodiment, a user's search history and/or a user's sharing history may be stored as personalized information in apersonalization store 150 for each user of thedynamic keyboard interface 122. Other personalized information may be captured about auser device 102, such as location (via GPS and/or IP Address), language keyboards installed, default language selection, phone information, contact information, messaging applications installed, and so forth. The data included in thepersonalization store 150 may be used as one or more factors by thesearch interface module 120 in determining the search intent of the user, for example. As further illustrated inFIG. 1B , thedynamic keyboard interface 122 may be rendered on theuser device 102 b through adynamic keyboard application 130 installed on theuser device 102 b. Thedynamic keyboard application 130 may install a dynamic keyboard user interface 132 that enables thedynamic keyboard interface 122 to be accessed throughout theuser device 102 b as a third-party keyboard. In this way, a messaging user using amessaging application 140, such as the APPLE IMESSAGE, SMS, texting, or other messaging platform such as FACEBOOK MESSAGER, TWITTER, EMAIL, and the like, may access thedynamic keyboard interface 122 from within themessaging application 140. -
FIG. 1B is a high-level block diagram depicting a process of performing search to implement animated inputs in a dynamic interface, in an embodiment. As further illustrated inFIG. 1B ,media content items 104 are rendered in thedynamic keyboard interface 122 through the dynamic keyboard user interface 132 communicating with thesearch interface module 120. In one embodiment, a set of collections may be selected for display on thedynamic keyboard interface 122. As illustrated inFIG. 1B , thedynamic keyboard interface 122 includes “#PLEASE,” “#HAPPY,” “#RUDE,” and a “#FACEPALM” collections. Although the hashtag symbol (#′) is used in the examples included here, content associations do not necessarily need to start with a hashtag. By selecting an animated key on thedynamic keyboard interface 122, the collection ofmedia content items 104 may be retrieved from themedia content store 106 by thesearch interface module 120 and then rendered by the dynamic keyboard user interface 132 in thedynamic keyboard interface 122. In this way, the searching user is searching the mediacontent management system 100 by using the selected content association, such as “#HAPPY.” The retrieved collection ofmedia content items 104 may be rendered within thedynamic keyboard interface 122. Because the “#HAPPY” collection may be updated and added to in real-time, a searching user may be presented with differentmedia content items 104 as new items are added to the collection. As mentioned above,media content items 104 may be preprocessed to reduce the file size of the content, thus enabling themedia content items 104 to be quickly rendered on thedynamic keyboard interface 122. - A searching user may then select a media content item from the
dynamic keyboard interface 122 by touching or otherwise interacting with the dynamic keyboard user interface 132. The selectedmedia content item 144 may then be transmitted or pasted into themessaging user interface 142 of themessaging application 140. In one embodiment, a selectedmedia content item 144 is selected by clicking, tapping, or touching thedynamic keyboard interface 122 and holding the selectedmedia content item 144 to “copy” the content so that it can be “pasted” into themessaging application 140 through themessaging user interface 142. This copy and paste method may take advantage of the operating system of theuser device 102, in one embodiment, such that the selectedmedia content item 144 is not stored permanently onto theuser device 102. In another embodiment, a searching user may search for media content through a search field on thedynamic keyboard interface 122, described further herein. In this way,media content items 104 may be shared through any messaging platform available on the user's device. Personalized information may also be captured, as mentioned above, in thepersonalization store 150 through thesearch interface module 120, for example. In at least some embodiments, adynamic keyboard interface 122 can be implemented as a GIF keyboard, as produced by RIFFSY, INC. of San Francisco, Calif. -
FIG. 2A is a network diagram of a system for categorizing procured content for performing search in a media content management system, showing a block diagram of the media content management system, according to an embodiment. The system environment includes one ormore user devices 102,media content sources 124, third-party applications 202, the mediacontent management system 100, and anetwork 204. In alternative configurations, different and/or additional modules can be included in the system. - The
user devices 102 may include one or more computing devices that can receive user input and can transmit and receive data via thenetwork 204. In one embodiment, theuser device 102 is a conventional computer system executing, for example, a Microsoft Windows-compatible operating system (OS), Apple OS X, and/or a Linux distribution. In another embodiment, theuser device 102 can be a device having computer functionality, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile telephone, smart-phone, wearable device, etc. Theuser device 102 is configured to communicate vianetwork 204. Theuser device 102 can execute an application, for example, a browser application that allows a user of theuser device 102 to interact with the mediacontent management system 100. In another embodiment, theuser device 102 interacts with the mediacontent management system 100 through an application programming interface (API) that runs on the native operating system of theuser device 102, such as iOS and ANDROID. - In one embodiment, the
network 204 uses standard communications technologies and/or protocols. Thus, thenetwork 204 can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), 3G, 4G, CDMA, digital subscriber line (DSL), etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on thenetwork 204 can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), the User Dacontent associationram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and the file transfer protocol (FTP). The data exchanged over thenetwork 204 can be represented using technologies and/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML) and the extensible markup language (XML). In addition, all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), and Internet Protocol security (IPsec). -
FIG. 2A contains a block diagram of themedia content management 100. The mediacontent management system 100 includes amedia content store 106, acontent association store 118, apersonalization store 150, asearch interface module 120, acontent associator module 108, a dynamickeyboard interface module 208, aweb server 210, a dynamickeyboard presentation module 212, a contentassociation management module 214, asentiment analysis module 220, animage analyzer module 222, amovement analyzer 224, a natural language processing (NLP)parser 218, aheuristics engine 216, and a searchrouter rules engine 206. In other embodiments, the mediacontent management system 100 may include additional, fewer, or different modules for various applications. Conventional components such as network interfaces, security functions, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system. - The
web server 210 links the mediacontent management system 100 via thenetwork 204 to one ormore user devices 102; theweb server 210 serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, Flash, XML, and so forth. Theweb server 210 may provide the functionality of receiving and routing messages between the mediacontent management system 100 and theuser devices 102, for example, instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS (short message service) messages, or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. The user can send a request to theweb server 210 to upload information, for example, images or media content are stored in themedia content store 106. Additionally, theweb server 210 may provide API functionality to send data directly to native user device operating systems, such as iOS, ANDROID, webOS, and RIM. - A
content associator module 108 may automatically generate one or more content associations for amedia content item 104 in the mediacontent management system 100 based on the attributes of themedia content item 104. For example, machine learning techniques may be used by thecontent associator module 108 to determine relationships betweenmedia content items 104 and content associations stored in thecontent association store 118. In one embodiment, thecontent associator module 108 may identify one or more content sources, such as movie studios, movies, television studios, television shows, actors, genres, and so forth. In another embodiment, thecontent associator module 108 may automatically generate a content association for amedia content item 104 based on an analysis of the image frames within themedia content item 104. In yet another embodiment, thecontent associator module 108 may use one or more computer vision techniques and other image processing methods through variousthird party applications 202 to analyze the image frames within themedia content item 104 to automatically generate one or more content associations to be associated with the content item. In one embodiment, thecontent associator module 108 may utilize one or morethird party applications 202, theNLP parser 218, thesentiment analysis module 220, theimage analyzer 222, themovement analyzer 224 and theheuristics engine 216 to analyze and parse text included inmedia content items 104 as well as analyze moving image frames of themedia content items 104 to automatically generate content associations and/or automatically select content associations stored in thecontent association store 118. In another embodiment, anNLP parser 218 may be combined with asentiment analysis module 220 and may be relied upon to analyze images and/or audiovisual content to determine a sentiment of themedia content items 104. For example, animage analyzer 222 and amovement analyzer 224 may be used to detect and/or classify a sequence of images depicting a face smiling. Aheuristics engine 216 may include a rule that automatically associates amedia content item 104 having a sequence of images that have been analyzed to detect a smile with a “#happy” content association from thecontent association store 118 as themedia content item 104 is stored within themedia content store 106 in the mediacontent management system 100. Alternatively, or in addition to this analysis, anNLP parser 218 may parse text strings included in the images and determine a match to the word “AWESOME.” Additionally, theNLP parser 218 may interpret the smile to mean a positive sentiment. Asentiment analysis module 220 may indicate that the word “AWESOME” is associated with a strong positive sentiment, and aheuristics engine 216 may include a rule that automatically associates the “#happy” content association (and/or other positive content associations) withmedia content items 104 that have a strong positive sentiment. - A
search interface module 120 may manage search requests and/or search queries formedia content items 104 in the mediacontent management system 100 received fromuser devices 102, in an embodiment. A search query may be received at thesearch interface module 120 and processed by a searchrouter rules engine 206, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, asearch interface module 120 may receive a request for a collection from auser device 102 based on a content association, such as “#HAPPY,” “#RUDE,” “#FOMO,” and so forth as a result of a selection of an animated key or a text search. Thesearch interface module 120 may communicate the search query to the searchrouter rules engine 206 to process the request, in an embodiment. - A content
association management module 214 may manage one or more content associations associated with eachmedia content item 104 in the mediacontent management system 100. Content associations may be associated withmedia content items 104 through the contentassociation management module 214 through various interfaces, such as user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs may be used to receive, access, and store data frommedia content sources 124, third party applications 202 (and/or websites), anduser devices 102. The contentassociation management module 214 may manage how content associations are associated with themedia content items 104 through various procurement methods, in one embodiment. - A dynamic
keyboard interface module 208 may manage interface communications between the mediacontent management system 100 anduser devices 102. For example, thedynamic keyboard interface 122, as illustrated inFIGS. 1A and 1B , may include a menu selection element that enables the searching user to view trending media content on the mediacontent management system 100. “Trending” media content may include frequently viewed and/or frequently shared content by users of the mediacontent management system 100. The dynamickeyboard interface module 208 may receive the request for trending media content and retrievemedia content items 104 from themedia content store 106 that have the highest number of shares in the past hour, for example. The dynamickeyboard interface module 208 may then, through the dynamickeyboard presentation module 212, provide the retrieved trending media content items to thedynamic keyboard interface 122 through thedynamic keyboard application 130, in one embodiment. The dynamickeyboard presentation module 212 may determine how the media content items are presented and in what order, for example. In one embodiment, if nomedia content items 104 satisfy a search query or request from a user device, the dynamickeyboard interface module 208 may, in conjunction or in coordination with thesearch interface module 120 and searchrouter rules engine 206, deliver othermedia content items 104 that are popular or have been shared. In one embodiment, content items may be selected by the dynamickeyboard interface module 208 from third party applications 202 (or websites), such as TUMBLR, to be included in the search results or animated keys of thedynamic keyboard interface 122. - A
heuristics engine 216 may include one or more heuristics rules to determine one or more outcomes. For example, thecontent associator module 108 may use theheuristics engine 216 to determine a ranking of candidate content associations for amedia content item 104 based on the attributes of themedia content item 104. Certain attributes may have various heuristic rules associated with them, such as visual movements (e.g., detected smiles may be associated with a “#HAPPY” content association), visual characteristics (e.g., blinking text may indicate an importance of the text string, or a hashtag symbol may indicate a particular content association), content sources, characters included in the media content item, and other attributes. Various heuristic rules may be generated by administrators to automatically generate content associations for content items based on attributes, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, heuristic rules may also use ranges of parameters for various attributes. For example, thirty selections of amedia content item 104 for sharing by a particular user may be used in a heuristic rule to present the same media content item in response to a search query from the particular user where there are few search results. The range here may be defined as a threshold number of shares, for example. - A
sentiment analysis module 220 may provide analysis of various text received by the mediacontent management system 100 to determine whether the text exhibits positive, negative, or neutral connotations. This information may be used by various modules to efficiently translate a search query to extract the expressive intent of the searching user. For example, a dictionary of terms may be used, in multiple languages, to determine whether text may be determined to have positive, negative, or neutral connotations. Thesentiment analysis module 220 may, in one embodiment, use variousthird party applications 202 to perform this analysis. Using thesentiment analysis module 220, the searchrouter rules engine 206 may provide one or more collections ofmedia content items 104 based on the connotations of the search query, for example. -
FIG. 2B is a high-level block diagram of a system for categorizing procured content for performing search in a media content management system, according to an embodiment. A contentassociation management module 214 may include ametadata analyzer module 240, auser interface module 242, a contentassociation selection module 244, and anassociation relating module 246, in one embodiment. - As
media content items 104 having one or more attributes are received in the mediacontent management system 100 from amedia content source 124, ametadata analyzer module 240 may generate one or more content associations based on the attributes of themedia content items 104. For example,media content items 104 from the movie, “Toy Story,” may be automatically content associated in the collection “Toy Story” based on a movie metadata attribute associated with themedia content items 104. In one embodiment, administrators of themedia content source 124 may associate one or metadata attributes to themedia content items 104. Metadata attributes may be stored in various ways in the source files of themedia content items 104, such as header content associations within the source files, as well as other files associated with the source files, such as XML files describing content items being procured in batches by themedia content system 100. - The
metadata analyzer module 240 may parse through the metadata associated withmedia content items 104 and automatically generate and/or select content associations from thecontent association store 118 based on one or more rules, in one embodiment. As illustrated inFIG. 2B , thecontent association store 118 may store association-attribute relationships 250, such that attributes have been associated with content associations. In this way, themetadata analyzer module 240 may automatically assign a content association to amedia content item 104 based on the association-attribute relationships 250 stored in thecontent association store 118. - Other metadata attributes that may be analyzed by the
metadata analyzer module 240 includes an Internet Protocol (IP) address of the mobile device or user device used by a searching user or curating user. An IP address may provide an indication of a geographic location of a user, including country of origin. Alternatively, a Global Position System (GPS) of a mobile device may include a current geographic location of the user. As a result, different collections or content associations may be presented to the user based on the predominant language spoken at the geographic location of the user. In another embodiment, another metadata attribute that may be analyzed by themetadata analyzer module 240 includes the one or more languages selected by the viewing user. In this way, language preference may help inform searching intent, curating intent, or both. A word in French, for example, may have a completely different meaning in Indonesian. As a result, language and country of origin may be a metadata attribute that may be determined by ametadata analyzer module 240. - A
user interface module 242 may provide one or more user interfaces for auser device 102, such as a computer or mobile device, to select one or more content associations for procuredmedia content items 104. For example, a curating user may be given the ability to assign one or more content associations from thecontent association store 118 tomedia content items 104. In this way, the contentassociation management module 214 enables manual selection of content associations for categorizing the procuredmedia content items 104. - A content
association selection module 244 may provide one or more content associations from thecontent association store 118 in one or more user interfaces provided by theuser interface module 242, according to an embodiment. In one embodiment the contentassociation selection module 244 may present predicted content associations based on the content association-attribute associations 250 stored in thecontent association store 118 for selection and/or confirmation by a curating user operating auser device 102. For example, amedia content item 104 may have a genre attribute of comedy based on pre-populated information from themedia content source 124. Because the “comedy” attribute may be associated with a “#HAPPY” content association, themedia content item 104 may have been assigned the “#HAPPY” content association by themetadata analyzer module 240, in one embodiment. The contentassociation selection module 244 may present the “#HAPPY” content association along with other related content associations in a user interface provided by theuser interface module 242 for a curating user to assign or revoke content associations associated with the associatedcontent item 104. The association-attribute associations 250 stored in thecontent association store 118 may include content associations that are related to other content associations, in one embodiment. For example, a “#HAPPY” content association may be related to a “LOL” and a “LMAO” content association because both LOL and LMAO include a “laughing” interpretation. As a result, other content associations may be presented for selection by a curating user, in one embodiment. - As part of the procurement process, media content items may be preprocessed 252 before being stored in the
media content store 106. This enables themedia content items 104 to be retrieved quickly and rendered seamlessly in thedynamic keyboard interface 122 on auser device 102. Pre-processing of media content items 252 may include reducing pixel count, modifying resolution definition, and other file size reduction techniques. The dynamickeyboard presentation module 212 may be used to perform this pre-processing of media content items 252, in one embodiment. Beneficially, pre-processing of media content items 252 enables adynamic keyboard interface 122, presented to a user on auser device 102 b, to render at least two renderings of at least two media content items in animation and to display them concurrently in thedynamic keyboard interface 122. - An
association relating module 246 may relate content associations tomedia content items 104 in themedia content store 106. Content associations may be associated to content items automatically by a metadata analyzer module 240 (or other modules in the media content management system 100) or the content associations may be associated as a result of a selection of content associations received through a user interface provided by theuser interface module 242. As illustrated inFIG. 2B , item-association relationships 254 are stored in themedia content store 106. Each content item may have a content identifier and each content association may have a content association identifier such that the item-association relationships 254 may be stored in themedia content store 106. As illustrated inFIG. 2B , a content item (“item”) may be related to one or more associations (“ass′n”), and the item-association relationships 254 are stored in themedia content store 106, for example. -
FIG. 2C is a high-level block diagram of a system for composing a composite content item in a media content management system, according to an embodiment. Acomposer interface 264 may be provided on auser device 102 that enables a viewing user to searchmedia content items 104 and select two or more content items to generate a composite content item. As illustrated, two content items have been selected in thecomposer interface 264 to create acomposite content item 266 having the combined attributes of the two selected content items. For example, a viewing user may search for “No” through a search interface, described in more detail later.Several content items 104 may be retrieved that meet the search term, “No.” A first selected content item may have been associated with content associations of “No” and “Chandler” while a second selected content item may have been associated with content associations of “No” and “Taylor.” As a result, thecomposite content item 266 may include the content associations “No,” “Chandler,” and “Taylor.” Thecomposite content item 266 may be received by acomposer interface module 262 and stored by thecomposite item module 260 as amedia content item 104 in themedia content store 106. As further illustrated inFIG. 2C , acomposite item module 260 may operate in conjunction with, or include, ametadata analyzer module 240, a contentassociation selection module 244, and anassociation relating module 246 that operate similarly as described above, in addition to acomposer interface module 262. - In at least some embodiments, a
composite content item 266 may be associated with an expressive statement that conveys a different meaning than the individual content items included in thecomposite content item 266. Returning to the example above, afirst content item 104 with the character “Chandler” expressing the statement, “No,” may convey a particular meaning to most users of the mediacontent management system 100. A curating user of the mediacontent management system 100 may associate other content associations with thatparticular content item 104, such as “#cool” and “FRIENDS.” Thesecond content item 104 depicting a celebrity, TAYLOR LAUTNER, may evoke a separate and different meaning from thefirst content item 104 depicting the character “CHANDLER” from the television show, FRIENDS. Thesecond content item 104 may be content associated, automatically or manually, with a content association of “cool” and/or “famous,” for example, in addition to the shared content association of “No.” As a result, the combination of the two media content items presents information different than each of the media content items presented separately. In one embodiment, the expressive statement presented by thecomposite content item 266 may be a simple conglomeration of the content associations associated with the individual content items included in thecomposite content item 266. In another embodiment, an expressive statement that is different from the content associations included in the individual content items may be extracted or otherwise interpreted from thecomposite content item 266. This expressive statement, as stored by the associated content associations associated with thecomposite content item 266, will be used in correlating a searching user's intent to relevant content items, as described herein. -
FIGS. 3A-E are example flowcharts of a process for categorizing procured content in a media content management system, according to an embodiment.FIG. 3A illustrates a process for categorizing procured content in the mediacontent management system 100. Media content items are received 300, and each media content item has one or more metadata attributes. Collections, or sets of media content items organized by content associations, are determined 302 to be related with the received media content items based on the one or more metadata attributes. Each uniquely identifiable collection is then stored 304 in a database in the mediacontent management system 100. Collections may be uniquely identifiable based on content associations and content association identifiers, in one embodiment. -
FIG. 3B illustrates an example flowchart of a process for categorizing procured content through a user device, in one embodiment. A web page is received 310 through a browser on a user device. The web page may include one or more media content items. A user interface identifying the one or more media content items on the web page may be provided 312. The user interface may be provided 312 through an application extension operating on the browser. For example, a mediacontent management system 100 may enable users to download an application extension onto their devices that enable the application extension to be linked to the browser on the user device such that a user interface may be provided 312 on the user device. - A selection of a first media content item may be received 314 through the user interface provided by the application extension operating on the browser. The selection may be a user selection through the user interface, such as a click, a touch on a touchscreen, or a gesture on a wearable device, for example. A multitude of attributes may then be determined 316 for the first media content item. As mentioned about, various modules of the
media content system 100 may be used to determine 316 attributes of the first media content item. The first media content item may then be stored 318 in a database based on the plurality of attributes. This may include associating the first media content item to be included in one or more collections based on the determined attributes. -
FIG. 3C illustrates a process for categorizing procured content based on a context associated with the content. A database including a multitude of content associations may be maintained 320. Content associations may be curated by administrators or curating users of the mediacontent management system 100. For example, a pictorial representation of happiness may be an emoji of a smiley face, in one embodiment. This smiley face emoji may be associated with a content association of “#HAPPY,” in one embodiment. In addition, an attribute of smiling or laughing may be curated to be associated with the content association of “#HAPPY” in thecontent association store 118, in an embodiment. In this way, content associations are maintained 320 in a database. - A content item having one or more visual characteristics and one or more attributes may be received 322 by the media
content management system 100. At least one of the one or more visual characteristics and the one or more attributes may be analyzed 324 to determine a context associated with the content item. As mentioned above, a visual characteristic, such as a smile, may be analyzed and determined such that the context of the content may be a happy context. In other embodiment, other attributes, such as a content source or genre of the content item, as identified in metadata attributes, may be analyzed 324 to determine the context of the content item. A content association may then be selected 326 from the maintained database of content associations, where the content association is selected 326 based on the determined context of the content item. The content item is then stored 328 in a database based on the selected content association. In one embodiment, the database is the same maintained database of content associations. In another embodiment, the database where the content item is stored 328 is in a separate content store, such as themedia content store 106. -
FIG. 3D illustrates a flowchart of a process for categorizing procured content based on an expressive statement associated with the content. A database including a multitude of content associations may be maintained 330. A content item may be received 332 where the content item includes one or more visual movements. The one or more visual movements may then be analyzed 334 to determine an expressive statement associated with the content item. Here, the one or more visual movements may include a smile and computer vision techniques may be used to analyze 334 the content and the visual movements to determine the smile. Aheuristics engine 216 may be used to determine that visual movements indicating a smile may correlate with an expressive statement that the content item is about happiness, based on a heuristic rule. - Once an expressive statement is determined through analyzing 334 at least one of the one or more visual movements, a content association is selected 336 based on the expressive statement. In one embodiment, an expressive statement is an attribute associated with content associations in the
content association store 118, stored as content association-attribute associations 250 as described above and illustrated inFIG. 2B . In other embodiments, an expressive statement may be stored as a content association in thecontent association store 118. For example, an expressive statement in the example above may be “happiness” such that the content association associated with the “happiness” expression is the “#HAPPY” content association. In other embodiments the expression “happiness” may be stored as its own “happiness” content association and related, or otherwise associated with the “#HAPPY” content association. Thus, a content association may be selected 336 based on the expressive statement. The content item may then be stored 338 in the database based on the selected content association. In one embodiment, the content item may be stored 338 in a separate content store, such as themedia content store 106. In another embodiment, the content item may be stored 338 in thecontent association store 118. -
FIG. 3E illustrates a process for categorizing procured content in the media content management system, in one embodiment. A database including content associations may be maintained 340. One or more selected content associations may be received 342 from the content associations in association with a media content item. For example, the one or more selected content associations may be received 342 through a user interface provided to a curating user of the mediacontent management system 100 on auser device 102. The one or more selected content associations may be manually selected by the curating user or may include automatically selected content associations based on analysis of the media content item by one or more modules of the mediacontent management system 100, as described herein. The media content item may then be stored 344 in the database based on the one or more selected content associations. -
FIG. 4 is a high-level block diagram of a system for categorizing procured content in a media content management system, according to some examples. Acontent associator module 108 may include acontent associating algorithm 406 for automatically selecting acontent association 402 for amedia content item 104. Thecontent associator module 108 may further include acontent association selector 408 for selecting thecontent association 402 from thecontent association store 118. Thecontent associator module 108 may operate in conjunction with or include animage analyzer 222, amovement analyzer 224, and aheuristics engine 216 to aide in automatically selecting acontent association 402 for amedia content item 104. - An
image analyzer 222 may include computer vision techniques that recognize facial features, such as a face, eyes, a mouth smiling, a mouth frowning, and so forth. Animage analyzer 222 may further include other computer vision techniques and/or pattern recognition algorithms to create baseline training sets for recognizing these facial characteristics. Similarly, amovement analyzer 224 may include computer vision techniques and/or pattern recognition algorithms, as well as machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques to recognize crying, laughing, falling, and other actions that may be modeled in similar ways. Amovement analyzer 224 may also include eye-tracking functionality to identify a location of eyes within a set of images or an animated image. The eye-tracking functionality of themovement analyzer 224 may be used in conjunction with one or more other modules in the mediacontent management system 100 to generate a newmedia content item 104, such as rendering a pair of sunglasses onto the animated set of images over the detected eyes within the images, for example. Other modules may be used to add text tomedia content items 104, such as the phrase “deal with it” to create and/or generate newmedia content items 104. Aheuristics engine 216, as described earlier, may use various rules to arrive at conclusions based on received data. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 4 , amedia content item 104 may include a GIF of a baby crying, for example. Animage analyzer 222 may analyze the frames of the GIF of themedia content item 104 and determine facial characteristics such as a pair of eyes squinting, a mouth open in a frown-like position, and eyebrows raised. Amovement analyzer 224 may identify that themedia content item 104 includes a baby crying based on baseline models of babies crying and other machine learning techniques. - As a result, the
content associator module 108 may select one or more content associations from acontent association store 118, through acontent association selector 408. Thecontent associating algorithm 406 may include one or more heuristic rules from aheuristics engine 216 to automatically generate a content association for amedia content item 104. In this example, a “#sad”content association 402 has been selected for themedia content item 104. As described earlier, content associations may be associated with other content associations, such as a crying content association may be associated with a “#sad”content association 402. In this way, themedia content item 104 of a baby crying may be included in the “#sad”collection 404 based on the automatically generated content association and stored in themedia content store 106. -
FIGS. 5A-B are example flowcharts of a process for categorizing procured content in a media content management system, according to some examples. As illustrated inFIG. 5A , one or more media content items may be received 500 from a content source. For example, a partner or a content owner may send media content items to be received 500 by a mediacontent management system 100. A content association may be automatically generated 502 in associated with the content item. As described above, a content association may be selected from acontent association store 118 and automatically generated 502, or selected. A multitude of attributes may be determined 504 for the media content item, including the automatically generated content association. Attributes may be determined 504, such as metadata attributes including a content source, a website from where the content item originated, dimensions of the content item, genre of movie or television show, characters, as well as text strings included in the content item. The attributes may then be stored 506 in association with the media content item in a collection of a database. -
FIG. 5B further illustrates a flowchart of categorizing procured content in a media content management system, according to an embodiment. A content item having one or more visual characteristics is received 510. The one or more visual characteristics are analyzed 512 to determine an expressive statement provided by the content item. As described above, animage analyzer 222 and/or amovement analyzer 224 may analyze 512 the visual characteristics of the content item. An expressive statement is determined based on theanalysis 512, such as an emotion or emotional state. Actions such as crying and falling may be mapped to a sad or unhappy emotional state, according to various heuristic rules in aheuristics engine 216. Other expressive statements may include other emotions and reactions. Expressive statements may further include discoverable content content associations, such as content associations representing phrases, sayings, idioms, movie quotes, and/or other expressions. - Discoverable content content associations may also include slang, including Internet slang, which may include such shorthand as “LOL,” “FML,” “LMAO,” “NSFW,” “YOLO,” “FOMO,” and so forth. Other discoverable content content associations may include initials of various television shows, such as “AGT” for a television show called “America's Got Talent.” Discoverable content associations may be generated by content owners and/or content sources, in one embodiment, to develop a brand and/or viral messaging. In other embodiments, discoverable content associations, such as the Internet slang mentioned above, may be bid on by competing advertisers and/or partners such that sponsored content items may appear higher in search results, for example. In yet other embodiments, a partner may publish a stand-alone application that utilizes a media
content management system 100 through application programming interfaces used to access the searchrouter rules engine 206 and/or other modules described herein. For example, a stand alone application for NBC UNIVERSAL may specifically presentmedia content items 104 from movies and television shows produced and owned by NBC UNIVERSAL, but that application may use one or more application programming interfaces to present adynamic keyboard interface 122. In a further embodiment, a mediacontent management system 100 may boost visibility of content associations based on paid advertising, partnerships, sponsored ads, and so forth. -
FIG. 6 is a high-level block diagram of a system for performing search to implement animated inputs in a dynamic interface, according to some examples. A searchrouter rules engine 206 may include aquery analyzer 602, anintent extractor 604, anintent matcher 606, and amachine learning module 608. Aquery analyzer 602 may breakdown received text and/or picture into overlapping windows, in one embodiment. For example, a searching user may enter the search term “happy birthday” as a query. Thequery analyzer 602 may breakdown the query into words and partial words that overlap, such as “ha,” “happy,” “birth,” “birthday,” “happy birth,” and “happy birthday.” Thequery analyzer 602 may provide the words and partial words to thesearch interface module 120 for searching in themedia content store 106 based on the words and partial words on the content associations of the associated media content items, in one embodiment. - In another embodiment, the
query analyzer 602 may provide the words and partial words to theintent extractor 604. For example, theintent extractor 604 may have previously mapped or extracted intent from the query “happy birthday” to include an intent to celebrate a birthday. Thus, the term “happy birthday” may specifically be mapped only to content items having birthday elements, such as a cake, candles, the text string “happy birthday,” a party, a person blowing out candles, and the like. Theintent extractor 604 may further provide the words and partial words to a natural language processing (NLP)parser 218 to derive meaning and/or intent from the search terms. AnNLP parser 218 may be particularly useful, in one embodiment, where a search term is unrecognized. For example, if the search term were “happy dia de los muertos” and the terms “dia de los muertos,” Spanish for “day of the dead,” were not included in a dictionary or corpus of learned terms, theintent extractor 604 may extract the intent of the searching user wishing to celebrate something happy based on the word “happy” being included in the search query. If, on the other hand, “muertos” is included in a dictionary or text strings included as metadata attributes of content items, then theNLP parser 218 may be relied upon to present content items associated with both the “happy” and “muertos” content associations. - An
intent matcher 606 may, in one embodiment, be used in the searchrouter rules engine 206 to match an intent of a searching user to one or more content associations in acontent association store 118. Returning to the previous example, the term “happy” included in the search query “happy dia de los muertos” may cause the search query to be matched by theintent matcher 606 to a “#happy” content association for further queries. The term “muertos” may be matched to a “dead” content association and a “Halloween” content association, in one embodiment. Because “dia de los muertos” is not directly related to Halloween, but is actually a Mexican holiday occurring on November 1, some content items may not be presented. Anintent matcher 606 may adjust the matches, in one embodiment, between search phrases and content associations, in one embodiment. The matches may be stored in thecontent association store 118, in one embodiment. - In another embodiment, the
intent matcher 606 may, in conjunction with amachine learning module 608, analyze user feedback, such as selecting content items having both a “Halloween” attribute and a “skull” attribute when those items are presented in search results in response to the “happy dia de los muertos” search query. As a result, theintent matcher 606 may generate a new match between the search phrase “happy dia de los muertos” and content items having both the “Halloween” and “skull” content associations. In one embodiment, theintent matcher 606 may determine a likelihood score of intent match based on probabilistic methods and/or machine learning for each match. This score may be stored in thecontent association store 118 for each intent match. These scores may be further based on statistical inference algorithms as provided by theNLP parser 218 andmachine learning module 608. - A
machine learning module 608 may use various machine learning methods, such as supervised and unsupervised learning methods, Bayesian knowledge base, Bayesian network, nearest neighbor, random walk, and other methods to determine various outcomes based on received training data and received user feedback (based on whether viewing users selected/shared content items presented in a search result set). For example, sometimes a random content item is presented along with the content items having a certain attribute, such as the “#happy” content association. Other times, the same content item may be presented randomly among search results for a different content association, such as “dog.” The randomly presented content item may not be associated with either the “#happy” content association or the “dog” content association, but searching and/or viewing users may frequently select and share the randomly presented content item. As a result, amachine learning module 608 may determine that the randomly presented content item is selected 80% of the time overall, 70% of the time when presented with content associated as “#happy,” and 60% of the time when presented with content associated as “dog.” Themachine learning module 608 may be used to further automate the process and create a heuristic rule to automatically present the content item when a search query includes both terms “#happy” and “dog,” as well as when a search query includes one of the terms. In one embodiment, amachine learning module 608 may associate, or relate, a content association to a content item based on the content item being selected among search results having a common attribute over a threshold percentage of time, such as 50%. Correlations such as these may also require administrator approval through a user interface, in accordance with at least one embodiment. - A search
router rules engine 206 may further include rules for processing search queries to optimize processing time and to include search results even where no direct match exists in the mediacontent management system 100. For example, the searchrouter rules engine 206 may operate in conjunction with asentiment analysis module 220, animage analyzer 222, and/or amovement analyzer 224 to analyze content items in themedia content store 106 that do not have associated attributes. Asentiment analysis module 220 may be used to process words, partial words, and search queries to determine whether the intent includes positive, negative, or neutral connotations. Animage analyzer 222 may be similarly used to process received images received as search queries to extract an intent of the searching user. For example, if the image is a photo captured by a mobile device directly sent as a query, the photo may be analyzed by theimage analyzer 222 to detect visual characteristics, such as facial expressions and activities occurring in the photo. Further, amovement analyzer 224 may be used to detect actions, behaviors, and patterns of movement, such as laughing, crying, falling, shaking hands, first bumping, chest thumping, eye rolling, hair flipping, and so forth. Rules may be included in the searchrouter rules engine 206 to associate identified behaviors, actions, activities, and/or facial expressions to one or more expressive statements that are stored as content associations in thecontent association store 118. These rules may be heuristic rules generated by aheuristics engine 216, in one embodiment. -
FIGS. 7A-D are example flowcharts of a process for performing search to implement animated inputs in a dynamic interface, according to some examples. Media content items may be maintained 700 in a media content system, where each media content item is associated with an expressive intent metadata content association. As described above, an expressive intent metadata content association may be generated based on analysis of the content item, such as by animage analyzer 222,movement analyzer 224,sentiment analysis module 220, and so forth. An expressive intent metadata content association may be associated with a content item maintained 700 in a media content system based on statistical inferences using theNLP parser 218 andmachine learning module 608, in one embodiment. - A search query may be received 702 from a user interface on a user device. The search query may include a pictorial representation of an expression. An expression may include one or more words that describe an expressive intent, for example. An expression may be less than five words, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, an expression may be a standardized list of expressions used within the media
content management system 100. In yet another embodiment, a pictorial representation of an expression may include an emoji. Emoji are ideograms or smileys originally used in Japanese electronic messages and webpages. Emoji may include ASCII emoticons, in one embodiment. Emoji may represent facial expressions, common objects, places, types of weather, animals, and so forth. In one embodiment, a set of emoji may have a standardized set of meanings that may be used in the media content management system by theintent extractor 604 and/orintent matcher 606. In another embodiment, an ASCII emoticon, such as a ‘:(’ sad face, may be an expression. In a further embodiment, the ASCII emoticon ‘:(’ sad face may be mapped to a “sad” expression or “sad” expressive intent metadata content association. - A candidate set of media content items may be determined 704 from the maintained media content items based on the expression received in the search query matching one or more expressive intent metadata content associations associated with media content items in the candidate set. Metadata content associations, or content associations generally, may be stored in the
content association store 118, in one embodiment. An expression extracted from the search query, by anintent extractor 604, may be matched by anintent matcher 606, for example, to one of the content associations in thecontent association store 118. In one embodiment, a pictorial representation of an expression, such as a sad face emoticon ‘:(’ may be weighted more heavily than other terms in the search query. For example, if the search query received 702 included the phrase “working :(” the sad face emoticon be parsed by thequery analyzer 602 and the sadness expression may be extracted by theintent extractor 604.
