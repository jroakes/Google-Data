- This disclosure describes improvements in spectral efficiency for data communicated between a base station and user equipment (UE) in fifth generation new radio (5G NR), sixth generation (6G), or subsequent generations of wireless networks.
- Aspects of control information-based index modulation (CUM) are introduced, which enable a wireless transmitter to convey data to a wireless receiver by implementing modulation of control channel information of a wireless link between the base station and the user equipment.
- a base station may include a control information index modulator (Cl index modulator) that uses control information of downlink communications to convey information in addition to signal constellation data modulated at a physical layer (PHY layer) of the wireless link.
- PHY layer physical layer
- the base station can convey the additional information to a UE without using additional time-frequency resources (e.g., additional resource elements) of a downlink channel.
- additional time-frequency resources e.g., additional resource elements
- This may be used by the base station to increase spectral efficiency of the wireless network when concurrently transmitting small amounts of data to a large number of UEs, such as to many IoT devices.
- a wireless transmitter to convey additional information (e.g., data bits) to a wireless receiver by modulating the information using control information for transmitting communications to the wireless receiver.
- additional information e.g., data bits
- a base station can convey a first portion of information to a UE as a PHY layer signal constellation and convey a second portion of the information by selecting control information of a transmission configuration parameter (e.g., a beam index or antenna port) used to transmit the PHY layer signal constellation to the UE.
- a transmission configuration parameter e.g., a beam index or antenna port
- a control information (Cl) index modulator of the base station may assign or define a control information-based index modulation (CUM) configuration (e.g., Cl codebook or bit overlay) for the UE and notify the UE of the CUM configuration.
- the Cl index modulator may then select, using the CUM configuration of the UE, control information of the transmission configuration parameter based on bit values of the second portion of the information.
- the base station transmits the PHY layer signal constellation to the UE in accordance with the control information (e.g., beam index or antenna port) of the transmission configuration parameter to convey the second portion of the information to the UE.
- the control information used to transmit the PHY layer signal constellation data to the UE can indicate one or more additional bits of information to the UE.
- a beam index e.g., beam identifier (beamID)
- a CUM codebook for the beam space modulation may include a table or bit-overlay in which the base station maps each of the 64 beamIDs to a respective combination of information bits that can be conveyed using the beamID or other control information element.
- the Cl index modulator can convey six additional bits for one transmit beam by selecting one of the 64 beam indices or beamIDs of the CUM configuration (e.g., 000000 to 111111).
- the base station implements binary signaling (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) or binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), values of [0,1]) and the base station has seven bits of data [1101001] pending transmission to the UE.
- binary signaling e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) or binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK)
- the Cl index modulator selects a beamID of the beam space CUM table that corresponds to [101001] (e.g., beamID 41) and sends the signal constellation for [1] using a transmit beam having the beamID 41 to create a seven-bit data message [1101001] for the UE with CUM.
- the transmit beam with the beamID 41 supports communication with the UE, although this is not always the case depending on relative locations of the base station and UE, or other channel conditions.
- the first bit [1] can be decoded by a decoder of the UE, and the six bits modulated with CUM [101001] can be decoded based on the beamID of the communication of the signal constellation of the first bit, to provide the data [1101001] sent by the base station.
- the Cl index modulator may not use CUM when transmitting the signal constellation to the UE.
- the Cl index modulator uses a bit of a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) to indicate to the UE whether CUM is enabled for a slot, subframe, or frame of air interface resources.
- PDCCH physical downlink control channel
- UEs that support CUM may use the modulation scheme intermittently, as directed by the base station using the PDCCH in either a same-slot physical downlink shared data channel (PDSCH), a later-slot PDSCH, or cross-slot PDSCH.
- PDSCH physical downlink shared data channel
- later-slot PDSCH later-slot PDSCH
- cross-slot PDSCH cross-slot PDSCH
- a wireless transmitter modulates a first portion of information for a wireless receiver to provide modulation symbols that correspond to the first portion of the information.
- the wireless transmitter also selects, based on a bit value of a second portion of the information, control information of a transmission configuration parameter by which to transmit the modulation symbols.
- first and second are not used to imply that the first portion of the information is before the second portion in a data set stored in the wireless transmitted to represent the information; although that may be the case, the first portion of the information may alternatively be later in the dataset than the second portion.
- the first and second portions of the information may be interleaved in the stored dataset.
- the base station selects a beam identifier or antenna port parameter to use when transmitting the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver.
- the wireless transmitter then transmits the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver using the transmission configuration parameter to convey the first portion of the information and the second portion of the information to the wireless receiver.
- the wireless transmitter conveys the second portion of the information without using additional time-frequency resources of a downlink channel, which can be useful when concurrently transmitting small amounts of data to many wireless receivers (e.g., IoT devices).

Description
CONTROL INFORMATION-BASED INDEX MODULATION
BACKGROUND
[0001] Various evolving wireless communication systems, such as fifth generation (5G) technologies and sixth generation (6G) technologies, provide network access for many types of devices and services. To enable network access, air interface resources of a wireless network (e.g., wireless spectrum) are partitioned and allocated among the devices connected to the wireless network. As more devices connect to the wireless network, spectral efficiency of the wireless network can become a critical factor in resource allocation. For example, in addition to user centric types of devices (e.g., smart phones), wireless networks are providing connectivity for increasing numbers of Intemet-of-Things (IoT) devices. These IoT devices are often deployed in small areas by industrial, utility, or medical service providers on the scale of thousands of devices, which results in millions of IoT devices that can autonomously connect to and communicate over a wireless network. Oftentimes, the IoT devices communicate small amounts of data (e.g., Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)) at sporadic intervals. As such, there is an opportunity to improve the base station to efficiently allocate wireless network spectrum in a way that supports such a large number of small data transactions, particularly as IoT deployments scale and ever-increasing numbers of IoT devices connect to the wireless network.
SUMMARY
[0002] This document describes techniques and apparatuses for control information-based index modulation, which may be implemented by a base station or a user equipment (UE). In aspects, a wireless transmitter modulates a first portion of information for a wireless receiver to provide modulation symbols that correspond to the first portion of the information. The wireless transmitter also selects, based on a bit value of a second portion of the information, control information of a transmission configuration parameter by which to transmit the modulation symbols. For example, the base station selects a beam identifier or antenna port parameter to use when transmitting the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver. The wireless transmitter then transmits the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver using the transmission configuration parameter to convey the first portion of the information and the second portion of the information to the wireless receiver. By so doing, the wireless transmitter conveys the second portion of the information through control information without using additional time-frequency resources of a communication channel, which can be useful when concurrently transmitting small amounts of data to many wireless receivers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0005] This disclosure describes improvements in spectral efficiency for data communicated between a base station and user equipment (UE) in fifth generation new radio (5G NR), sixth generation (6G), or subsequent generations of wireless networks. Aspects of control information-based index modulation (CUM) are introduced, which enable a wireless transmitter to convey data to a wireless receiver by implementing modulation of control channel information of a wireless link between the base station and the user equipment. For example, a base station may include a control information index modulator (Cl index modulator) that uses control information of downlink communications to convey information in addition to signal constellation data modulated at a physical layer (PHY layer) of the wireless link. By so doing, the base station can convey the additional information to a UE without using additional time-frequency resources (e.g., additional resource elements) of a downlink channel. This may be used by the base station to increase spectral efficiency of the wireless network when concurrently transmitting small amounts of data to a large number of UEs, such as to many IoT devices.
[0006] In contrast with preceding techniques for scheduling transmission resources, which are data agnostic, the aspects described herein enable a wireless transmitter to convey additional information (e.g., data bits) to a wireless receiver by modulating the information using control information for transmitting communications to the wireless receiver. By way of example, a base station can convey a first portion of information to a UE as a PHY layer signal constellation and
convey a second portion of the information by selecting control information of a transmission configuration parameter (e.g., a beam index or antenna port) used to transmit the PHY layer signal constellation to the UE. To do so, a control information (Cl) index modulator of the base station may assign or define a control information-based index modulation (CUM) configuration (e.g., Cl codebook or bit overlay) for the UE and notify the UE of the CUM configuration. The Cl index modulator may then select, using the CUM configuration of the UE, control information of the transmission configuration parameter based on bit values of the second portion of the information. The base station then transmits the PHY layer signal constellation to the UE in accordance with the control information (e.g., beam index or antenna port) of the transmission configuration parameter to convey the second portion of the information to the UE. Thus, the control information used to transmit the PHY layer signal constellation data to the UE can indicate one or more additional bits of information to the UE.
[0007] As an example, consider control information-based index modulation implemented with a beam space of communications between a base station and a user equipment. In aspects, the base station may select, as control information, a beam index (e.g., beam identifier (beamID)) from 64 beam indices (or beamIDs) when transmitting communications to the UE. Thus, a CUM codebook for the beam space modulation may include a table or bit-overlay in which the base station maps each of the 64 beamIDs to a respective combination of information bits that can be conveyed using the beamID or other control information element. In this case, the Cl index modulator can convey six additional bits for one transmit beam by selecting one of the 64 beam indices or beamIDs of the CUM configuration (e.g., 000000 to 111111). Assume here that the base station implements binary signaling (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) or binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), values of [0,1]) and the base station has seven bits of data [1101001] pending transmission to the UE. To implement control-information-based index modulation, the Cl index modulator selects a beamID of the beam space CUM table that corresponds to [101001] (e.g., beamID 41) and sends the signal constellation for [1] using a transmit beam having the beamID 41 to create a seven-bit data message [1101001] for the UE with CUM. Here, assume the transmit beam with the beamID 41 supports communication with the UE, although this is not always the case depending on relative locations of the base station and UE, or other channel conditions. When the UE receives the downlink communication with the seven-bit data message, the first bit [1] can be decoded by a decoder of the UE, and the six bits modulated with CUM [101001] can be decoded based on the beamID of the communication of the signal constellation of the first bit, to provide the data [1101001] sent by the base station. Alternatively, if the corresponding beamID or beam index is not available in a current slot, the Cl index modulator may not use CUM when transmitting the signal constellation to the UE. In some
cases, the Cl index modulator uses a bit of a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) to indicate to the UE whether CUM is enabled for a slot, subframe, or frame of air interface resources. Thus, UEs that support CUM may use the modulation scheme intermittently, as directed by the base station using the PDCCH in either a same-slot physical downlink shared data channel (PDSCH), a later-slot PDSCH, or cross-slot PDSCH. These are but a few examples of control information-based index modulation, others of which are described throughout the disclosure.
[0008] In aspects, a wireless transmitter modulates a first portion of information for a wireless receiver to provide modulation symbols that correspond to the first portion of the information. The wireless transmitter also selects, based on a bit value of a second portion of the information, control information of a transmission configuration parameter by which to transmit the modulation symbols. (Note that the terms “first” and “second” are not used to imply that the first portion of the information is before the second portion in a data set stored in the wireless transmitted to represent the information; although that may be the case, the first portion of the information may alternatively be later in the dataset than the second portion. Indeed, in principle the first and second portions of the information may be interleaved in the stored dataset.) For example, the base station selects a beam identifier or antenna port parameter to use when transmitting the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver. The wireless transmitter then transmits the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver using the transmission configuration parameter to convey the first portion of the information and the second portion of the information to the wireless receiver. By so doing, the wireless transmitter conveys the second portion of the information without using additional time-frequency resources of a downlink channel, which can be useful when concurrently transmitting small amounts of data to many wireless receivers (e.g., IoT devices).
[0009] While features and concepts of the described systems and methods for control information-based index modulation can be implemented in any number of different environments, systems, devices, and/or various configurations, aspects of control information- based index modulation are described in the context of the following example environments, devices, systems, and configurations.
Example Environments
[0010] FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment 100, which includes a user equipment 110 (UE 110) that can communicate with one or more base stations 120 (illustrated as base stations 121 and 122) through one or more wireless communication links 130 (wireless links 130), illustrated as wireless links 131 and 132. In various aspects, the base stations 120 send respective data to one or more UEs 110 using control information-based index modulation, which may
improve spectral efficiency of a wireless network. For simplicity, the UE 110 is implemented as a smartphone but may be implemented as any suitable computing or electronic device, such as an Intemet-of-Things (IoT) device or massive machine-type communications (mMTC) device, that may include, by way of example, a sensor, a retail tag, a switch, a meter, a medical device, an actuator, or the like. Alternatively or additionally, the UE 110 may be implemented as a mobile communication device, modem, cellular phone, gaming device, navigation device, media device, laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, smart appliance, or vehicle-based communication system. The base stations 120 (e.g., an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network Node B, E-UTRAN Node B, evolved Node B, eNodeB, eNB, Next Generation Node B, gNode B, gNB, ng-eNB, or the like) may be implemented in a macrocell, microcell, small cell, picocell, distributed base station, and the like, or any combination thereof.
[0011] The base stations 120 communicate with the UE 110 using a wireless link 130, which may be implemented as any suitable type of wireless link. The wireless link 130 includes control-plane information and/or user-plane data, for example, downlink of user-plane data and control-plane information communicated from the base stations 120 to the UE 110, uplink of other user-plane data and control-plane information communicated from the UE 110 to the base station 120, or both. The wireless link 130 may include one or more wireless links (e.g., radio links) or bearers implemented using any suitable communication protocol or standard, or combination of communication protocols or standards, such as Third Generation Partnership Project Long-Term Evolution (3GPP LTE), fifth generation New Radio (5G NR), sixth generation (6G) technologies, and so forth. In various aspects, the base stations 120 and UE 110 may be implemented for operation in sub-gigahertz bands, sub-6 GHz bands (e.g., Frequency Range 1), and/or above-6 GHz bands (e.g., Frequency Range 2, millimeter wave (mmWave) bands) that are defined by one or more of the 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, or 6G communication standards (e.g., 26 GHz, 28 GHz, 38 GHz, 39 GHz, 41 GHz, 57-64 GHz, 71 GHz, 81 GHz, 92 GHz bands, 100 GHz to 300 GHz, 130 GHz to 175 GHz, or 300 GHz to 3 THz bands). Multiple wireless links 130 may be aggregated in a carrier aggregation or multi-connectivity technology to provide a higher data-rate for the UE 110. Multiple wireless links 130 from multiple base stations 120 may be configured for Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) communication with the UE 110.
[0012] The base stations 120 are collectively a Radio Access Network 140 (e.g., RAN, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network, E-UTRAN, 5G NR RAN, NR RAN), where the RAN 140 communicates with one or more core networks 150 (core network 150). To illustrate, the base station 121 connects, at interface 102, to a 5G core network 151 (5GC 151) through an NG2 interface for control-plane signaling and using an NG3 interface for user-plane data communications. The base station 122 connects, at interface 106, to an Evolved Packet Core
152 (EPC 152) using an SI interface for control-plane signaling and user-plane data communications. Alternatively or additionally, if the base station 122 connects to the 5GC 151 core network, the base station 122 connects to the 5GC 151 using an NG2 interface for control- plane signaling and through an NG3 interface for user-plane data communications at interface 107. Accordingly, certain base stations 120 can communicate with multiple core networks 150 (e.g., 5GC 151, EPC 152). In addition to wireless links to core networks, the base stations 120 may communicate with each other. For example, the base stations 121 and 122 communicate through an Xn interface at interface 105 to coordinate apportioning or assigning air interface resources as further described.
[0013] The UE 110 may connect, through the 5G core network 151 or the Evolved Packet Core Network 152, to public networks, such as the Internet 170, to interact with a remote service 180. The remote service 180 represents the computing, communication, and storage resources used to provide any of a multitude of services, including sensing, metering, tracking, automation, control, interactive voice or video communication, file transfer, streaming audio, voice, or video, and other technical services implemented in any manner, for example, medical services, industrial automation, home automation, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), logistics tracking and management, IoT-related services, mMTC-related services, voice calls, video calls, website access, messaging services (e.g., text messaging or multimedia messaging), photo file transfer, enterprise software applications, social media applications, video gaming, streaming video or audio services, and podcasts.
Example Devices
[0014] FIG. 2 illustrates an example device diagram 200 of the UE 110 and one of the base stations 120 that can implement various aspects of control information-based index modulation in a wireless communication system. In aspects, multiple UEs 110 may be deployed in large numbers as IoT devices or mMTC devices that communicate with a base station 120 of a RAN 140. TheUE 110 and/orthe base station 120 may include additional functions and interfaces that are omitted from FIG. 2 for the sake of clarity. In aspects, an apparatus may be configured as a UE 110 or configured as a base station 120 as described herein.
[0015] The UE 110 includes antennas 202, a radio frequency front end 204 (RF front end 204), and a wireless transceiver 206 (e.g., an LTE transceiver, a 5GNR transceiver, and/or a 6G transceiver) for communicating with the base station 120 in the RAN 140. The RF front end 204 of the UE 110 can couple or connect the wireless transceiver 206 to the antennas 202 to facilitate various types of wireless communication. The antennas 202 of the UE 110 may include an array of multiple antennas that are configured in a manner similar to or different from each
other. The antennas 202 and the RF front end 204 can be tuned to, and/or be tunable to, one or more frequency bands defined by the 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, or 6G communication standards and implemented by the wireless transceiver 206. Additionally, the antennas 202, the RF front end 204, and/or the wireless transceiver 206 may be configured to support beamforming for the transmission and reception of communications with the base station 120. By way of example and not limitation, the antennas 202, RF front end 204, and the wireless transceiver 206 can be implemented for operation in sub-gigahertz (GHz) bands (e.g., 700-900 megahertz(MHz)), sub-6 GHz bands (1.7 GHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.5 GHz, or 3.5 GHz bands), and/or above 6 GHz bands (e.g., 57- 64 GHz, 28 GHz, 38 GHz, 71 GHz, 81 GHz, or 92 GHz bands) that are defined by the 3 GPP LTE, 5G NR, or 6G communication standards.
[0016] The UE 110 also includes processor(s) 208 and computer-readable storage media 210 (CRM 210). The processor 208 may be a single-core processor or a multiple-core processor composed of a variety of materials, for example, silicon, polysibcon, high-K dielectric, copper, and so on. The computer-readable storage media described herein excludes propagating signals. The CRM 210 may include any suitable memory or storage device such as random-access memory (RAM), static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), read-only memory (ROM), or Flash memory useable to store device data 212 of the UE 110. The device data 212 include user data, sensor data, control data, automation data, multimedia data, beamforming codebooks, applications, and/or an operating system of the UE 110, some of which are executable by processor(s) 208 to enable user-plane data, control-plane information, and user interaction with the UE 110. The CRM 210 may also include uplink information 214, which includes information for transmission to a base station 120 with which the UE 110 is associated. Generally, the uplink information 214 includes control-bits or data-bits of information in various stages of processing for transmission to the base station 120, for example, unstructured control information or user data that the UE 110 prepares for transmission or pre-built data for transmission to the base station 120 via a control channel (e.g., physical uplink control channel (PUCCH)) or data channel (e.g., physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH)) of a wireless link 130.
[0017] In aspects, the CRM 210 of the UE 110 includes one or more UE control information-based index modulation codebooks 216 (UE CUM codebooks 216) and may include a UE control information index modulator 218 (Cl index modulator 218) for implementing control information-based index modulation for uplink communications to a base station. The Cl index modulator 218 may be implemented in whole or part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of the UE 110, for example, the wireless transceivers 206 or processor 208. The Cl index modulator 218 enables the UE 110 to implement various aspects of CUM, examples of which include those illustrated and described with reference to the transaction
diagrams of FIGs. 10 and 11 and the methods of FIGs. 13-17. Generally, the Cl index modulator 218 can convey additional information bits to a base station 120 by modulating the additional information bits through configuration information of transmission configuration parameters for uplink communication. In other words, the Cl index modulator 218 of the UE 110 can determine when a control information index value of the information bits align with control information of a transmission configuration parameter (e.g., beam index, precoding index, or sounding resource indicator) assigned to the UE 110 for uplink communication. By so doing, the Cl index modulator 218 can improve spectral efficiency of uplink communications in a wireless communication system, which may include a large number of UEs that implement concurrent transmissions to a base station.
[0018] The CRM 210 also includes control information-based index modulation capability information 220 (CUM capability information 220) of the UE 110 and a control information-based index modulation decoder 222 (CUM decoder 222). The CUM decoder 222 may be implemented in whole or part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of the UE 110, for example, one of the wireless transceivers or a decoder of one of the wireless transceivers (e.g., a turbo decoder, a polar decoder, or low-density parity-check decoder (LDPC)). Generally, the UE CUM codebook 216 includes information that enables the UE 110 to encode or decode data or information based on respective control information of transmission configuration parameters (e.g., beamID, precoding matrices, antenna ports) of a downlink or uplink communication. To illustrate, a UE CUM codebook 216 may define one or more CUM tables or bit-overlays in which information bits (e.g., CUM coded bits) are mapped to control information bits to convey additional information to the receiving device via the control information of a transmission configuration parameter of a communication. Alternatively or additionally, the UE CUM codebook 216 can be implemented as a CUM index array, CUM list, CUM lookup table (LUT), or other data structure of CUM information useful to the UE 110 for decoding CUM coded information from CIIM-enabled downlink communications. In aspects, the UE 110 may use a CUM table or CUM codebook (e.g., an uplink CUM codebook) to encode or modulate uplink communications to a base station 120 with information using a CUM scheme. Examples of various CUM schemes and CUM codebooks are further described herein, particularly with reference to FIGs. 4-7.
[0019] The CUM capability information 220 describes capabilities of the UE 110 with respect to implementing various aspects of CUM. For example, the CUM capability information 220 may indicate that the UE 110 is capable of decoding CUM information from downlink communications, encoding CUM information on uplink communications, whether CUM capabilities of the UE 110 are enabled, one or more UE CUM codebooks 216 that are accessible
by the UE 110, a currently selected UE CUM codebook 216, a currently selected (e.g., active) CUM codebook or bit-overlay, capabilities of the CUM decoder 222, or the like. In some cases, the UE 110 uses one or more parameters of the CUM capability information 220 to generate a user-equipment-capability-information information element (UE Capabilitylnformation IE) that indicates one or more capabilities of the UE specific to CUM. As described herein, the UE 110 can transmit the UE Capabilitylnformation IE to a base station 120 to inform the base station of the CUM capabilities of the UE. Alternatively or additionally, the UE 110 may also receive from the base station 120 a base-station-capability-information information element (BS Capability Information IE) that indicates one or more capabilities of the BS specific to CUM.
[0020] In aspects, the CUM decoder 222 uses a UE CUM codebook 216 to decode CUM information (e.g., data-bits) from downlink communications received by the UE. As noted, the CUM decoder 222 may be implemented as part of another decoder (not shown) of the UE 110 or provide information useful to the other decoder for decoding information (e.g., user data) from a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) of an air interface that extends between the UE 110 and a base station 120. For example, when the UE 110 receives a CIIM-enabled downlink communication of user information, and control information of a transmission configuration parameter of the communication is determined with CUM based on coded bits of additional user information, the UE 110 can use bits decoded from the CUM in a decoder (e.g., turbo, polar, or LDPC decoder) of the UE to assist in decoding the user information bits from PDSCH data of the communication. Other examples of CUM aspects that a UE 110 can implement in a wireless communication system are further described herein.
[0021] The device diagram for the base station 120, shown in FIG. 2, includes a single network node (e.g., a gNode B). The functionality of the base station 120 may be distributed across multiple network nodes or devices and may be distributed in any fashion suitable to perform the functions described herein. The nomenclature for this distributed base station functionality varies and includes terms such as Central Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), Baseband Unit (BBU), Remote Radio Head (RRH), and/or Remote Radio Unit (RRU). The base station 120 includes antennas 252, a radio frequency front end 254 (RF front end 254), one or more wireless transceivers 256 (e.g., one or more LTE transceivers, one or more 5G NR transceivers, and/or one or more 6G transceivers) for communicating with the UE 110. The RF front end 254 of the base station 120 can couple or connect the wireless transceivers 256 to the antennas 252 to facilitate various types of wireless communication. The antennas 252 of the base station 120 may include an array of multiple antennas that are configured in a manner similar to, or different from, each other. The antennas 252, the RF front end 254, and wireless transceivers 256 can be tuned to, and/or be tunable to, one or more frequency bands in sub-gigahertz (GHz) bands (e.g., 700-900
MHz), sub-6 GHz bands (1.7 GHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.5 GHz, or 3.5 GHz bands), and/or above-6 GHz bands (e.g., 57-64 GHz, 28 GHz, 38 GHz, 71 GHz, 81 GHz, or 92 GHz bands) that are defined by the 3GPP LTE, 5GNR, or 6G communication standards. Additionally, the antennas 252, the RF front end 254, the wireless transceivers 256 may be configured to support beamforming (e.g., Massive multiple-input, multiple-output (Massive-MIMO)) for the transmission and reception of communications with the UE 110.
[0022] The base station 120 also includes processor(s) 258 and computer-readable storage media 260 (CRM 260). The processor 258 may be a single-core processor or a multiple-core processor composed of a variety of materials, for example, silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectric, copper, and so on. The CRM 260 may include any suitable memory or storage device such as random-access memory (RAM), static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), read-only memory (ROM), or Flash memory useable to store device data 262 of the base station 120. The device data 262 include network scheduling data, radio resource management data, beamforming codebooks, applications, and/or an operating system of the base station 120, which are executable by processor(s) 258 to enable communication with the UE 110. CRM 260 may also include downlink data 264, which include respective data for transmission to one or more UEs 110 associated with the base station 120. Generally, the downlink data 264 include data in various stages of processing for transmission to the UE 110, for example, unstructured user data that the base station 120 prepares for transmission or pre-built data for transmission to the UE 110 via a data channel (e.g., physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH)) of a wireless link 130.
[0023] In aspects, the CRM 260 of the base station 120 also includes one or more base station CUM codebooks 266 (BS CUM codebook 266) and a control information index modulator 268 (Cl index modulator 268). Generally, the base station 120 may include one or more BS CUM codebooks 266 that are complementary to the UE CUM codebooks 216 of the UEs 110 of the wireless network. The base station 120 may also store and distribute the UE CUM codebooks 216 to the UEs 110 to enable the UEs to implement aspects of CUM. The BS CUM codebook 266 includes information that enables the base station 120 to encode or modulate data-bits using control information of communications transmitted to a UE 110 on a downlink of the wireless link 130. Alternatively or additionally, information of the codebook 266 may enable the base station 120 to decode or demodulate information bits (e.g., data-bits or control-bits) of a CIIM-enabled communication received from a UE 110 on an uplink of the wireless link 130. As described herein, a BS CUM codebook 266 may define one or more CUM tables or bit-overlays in which information bits are mapped to control information bits to convey additional information to a receiving device via the control information (e.g., transmission configuration) of a
communication. In some cases, the BS CUM codebook 266 can be implemented as a CUM index array, CUM list, CUM LUT, or other data structure of CUM information useful to the BS 120 for encoding information in CIIM-enabled downlink communications. In aspects, the BS 120 may use a CUM table or CUM codebook to decode or demodulate information from uplink communications received from a UE 110 using a CUM scheme. Examples of various CUM schemes and CUM codebooks are further described herein, particularly with reference to FIGs. 4- 7.
[0024] The Cl index modulator 268 enables the base station 120 to implement various aspects of CUM, examples of which include those illustrated and described with reference to the transaction diagrams of FIGs. 8-11 and the methods of FIGs. 12-17. Generally, the Cl index modulator 268 can convey additional information bits to a UE 110 by modulating the additional information bits through control information (e.g., PDCCH fields) of communications sent to the UE on a downlink of a wireless connection. In other words, control bits of a communication can be chosen or selected by the Cl index modulator or base station 120 to indicate a value of the additional bits to the UE 110. Alternatively or additionally, CUM can also be used to convey additional information bits from the UE to the base station when uplink information bits align with control bits of a communication on an uplink of the wireless connection. By so doing, a Cl index modulator implemented by the base station and/or UE can improve spectral efficiency of a wireless communication system, which may include a large number of UEs.
[0025] In aspects, the Cl index modulator 268 can assign or specify a CUM configuration for a UE 110 and send a notification to the UE 110 of the CUM configuration to use for decoding CIIM-enabled downlink communications. The CUM configuration may include a CUM codebook or bit-overlay in which information bits are mapped to control bits of communications sent on the downlink to the UE 110. In some cases, the Cl index modulator 268 notifies or configures the UE 110 for CUM through communication of one or more respective radio resource control messages (RRC messages). To illustrate, the Cl index modulator 268 may assign a beam space CUM table to the UE 110 and notify the UE of the beam space CUM table (e.g., of a UE CUM codebook 216) to use for decoding information of CIIM-enabled downlink communications. Assuming that the base station 120 has data for transmission to the UE 110, the base station modulates a first portion of the data to provide modulation symbols (or signal constellations) that correspond to the first portion of the data. The Cl index modulator 268 selects, based on a value of a second portion of the data and using the beam space CUM table, a beam index by which to transmit the modulation symbols to the UE 110. The base station 120 then transmits the modulation symbols to the UE 110 using a downlink with the selected beam index to convey the first portion of the data and the second portion of the data to the UE. By so doing, the base station 120 conveys the second portion
of the data using the beam index control information instead of using additional time-frequency resources of a downlink channel (e.g., wireless link 130), which can be useful when concurrently transmitting small amounts of data to many UEs (e.g., IoT devices). These are but a few example aspects of CUM that a base station or UE can implement, others of which are further described herein.
[0026] The CRM 260 of the base station 120 also includes a base station manager 270, which may control various functionalities of the base station 120. Alternatively or additionally, the base station manager 270 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with, or separate from, other components of the base station 120. In at least some aspects, the base station manager 270 configures the wireless transceivers 256 for communication with the UE 110, as well as communication with a core network (e.g., the core network 150). The base station 120 also includes an inter-base station interface 272, such as an Xn and/or X2 interface, which the base station manager configures to exchange user-plane data, control-plane information, and/or other data/information between other base stations, to manage the communication of the base station 120 with the UE 110. The base station 120 includes a core network interface 274 that the base station manager 270 configures to exchange user-plane data, control-plane information, and/or other data/information with core network functions and/or entities.
Air Interface Resources
[0027] FIG. 3 illustrates at 300 an air interface resource that extends between a user equipment and a base station that can be used to implement various aspects of control information- based index modulation. The air interface resource 302 can be divided into resource units 304, each of which occupies some intersection of frequency spectrum and elapsed time. A portion of the air interface resource 302 is illustrated graphically in a grid or matrix having multiple resource blocks 310, including example resource blocks 311, 312, 313, 314. An example of a resource unit 304, therefore, includes at least one resource block 310. As shown, time is depicted along the horizontal dimension as the abscissa axis, and frequency is depicted along the vertical dimension as the ordinate axis. The air interface resource 302, as defined by a given communication protocol or standard, may span any suitable specified frequency range and/or may be divided into intervals of any specified duration. Increments of time can correspond to, for example, milliseconds (mSec). Increments of frequency can correspond to, for example, MHz.
[0028] In the lower-left comer of the grid, the resource block 311 may span, as defined by a given communication protocol, a specified frequency range 306 and include multiple subcarriers or frequency sub-bands. The resource block 311 may include any suitable number of subcarriers
(e.g., 12) that each corresponds to a respective portion (e.g., 15 kHz) of the specified frequency range 306 (e.g., 180 kHz). The resource block 311 may also span, as defined by the given communication protocol, a specified time interval 308 or time slot (e.g., lasting approximately one-half millisecond or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols). The time interval 308 includes subintervals that may each correspond to a symbol, such as an OFDM symbol. As shown in FIG. 3, each resource block 310 may include multiple resource elements 320 (REs 320) that correspond to, or are defined by, a subcarrier of the frequency range 306 and a subinterval (or symbol) of the time interval 308. Alternatively, a given resource element 320 may span more than one frequency subcarrier or symbol. Thus, a resource unit 304 may include at least one resource block 310, at least one resource element 320, and so forth.
[0029] In aspects, the base stations 120 allocate portions (e.g., resource units 304) of an air interface resource 302 for uplink and downlink communications. In the downlink, the base station 120 may use physical resource blocks (PRBs) for specifying and mapping physical downlink channels (e.g., control and shared channels) and signals onto the REs 320. Generally, an RE 320 may be the smallest physical channel unit, with each RE 320 being uniquely identifiable by its subcarrier index and symbol index within the PRB. In the context of the present example, a PRB may span 12 subcarriers over 7 OFDM symbols such that one PRB includes 84 REs 320, which fit into two consecutive slots. With respect to the uplink, the base station 120 may use the resource units 304 for specifying and mapping physical uplink channels onto the REs 320. As noted, a definition of the RU depends on the configured subcarrier spacing and the number of subcarriers allocated to an uplink transmission. In the case of an allocation for 12 subcarriers that use a 15 kHz spacing, an RU may correspond to the PRB as described with reference to the downlink. In the case of sub-PRB scheduling assignments of fewer than 12 subcarriers (e.g., six subcarriers, three subcarriers, or one subcarrier), then an RU can be expanded in time to compensate for the diminishing frequency allocation.
[0030] In aspects of control information-based index modulation, a base station 120 or UE 110 can modulate information using bits or fields of a physical control channel of the air interface resource. For example, the base station 120 can define or apply a bit-overlay of data-bits to control-bits of the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). The base station 120 then configures the UE 110 with the bit-overlay for the control-bits and notifies the UE 110 when to apply the bit-overlay to downlink communications. In some cases, the bit-overlay can convey an additional three to six bits of data per downlink communication, with the notification to the UE 110 using one bit of the PDCCH. Thus, in some cases, the base station 120 can convey three to six additional bits of data to the UE 110 at the cost of one bit in the PDCCH to notify the UE 110 that the communication includes additional information modulated with the control-bits of the
PDCCH. This and other aspects of CUM are described with reference to the examples of FIGs. 4-7, the transaction diagrams of FIGs. 8-11, and the methods of FIGs. 12-17.
Control Information-Based Index Modulation
[0031] FIG. 4 illustrates at 400 example mapping graphs of control resource sets and control channel elements that a base station can use to implement various aspects of control information-based index modulation. In this example, the mapping graph (e.g., resource-mapping graph) for a frame portion illustrates a bandwidth part 402 (BWP 402) of channel bandwidth over a slot 404 of OFDM symbols. Generally, a control resource set, or CORESET, includes a set of physical resources within an area of a downlink resource grid and carries the PDCCH. In aspects, the base station 120 may selectively configure physical resources of a CORESET in which a PDCCH is transmitted to a UE 110. In other words, the base station 120 can configure a set of RBs and a set of OFDM symbols in which the CORESET is located within the corresponding PDCCH search spaces. The base station 120 may use a frequency allocation for a CORESET configuration that is contiguous or non-conti guous and/or use a time configuration for the CORESET that spans one to three consecutive OFDM symbols.
[0032] By way of example, consider some PDCCH search spaces of the mapping graph that are illustrated as PDCCH monitoring occasion 406 on a 1 -symbol CORESET and PDCCH monitoring occasion 408 on a 3-symbol CORESET. A UE 110 may monitor these search spaces to receive control information from the base station 120, and the base station 120 may selectively configure the set of RBs and the set of OFDM symbols of a CORESET for the PDCCH monitoring occasions 406 and 408 of the UE 110. With reference to an example CORESET 410 shown at 401, REs 320 of the CORESET 410 are organized into RE groups 412 (REGs 412), which include 12 REs 320 of an OFDM symbol. To illustrate, the base station 120 can configure a PDCCH for one CORESET and transmit the PDCCH with demodulation reference signals 414 (DMRS 414) that enable UE-specific beamforming of the control channel. Here, six REGs 412 of the CORESET are grouped as a control channel element 416 (CCE 416) that carries the PDCCH. The base station 120 may configure one, two, four, eight, or 16 CCEs to carry a PDCCH to accommodate different downlink control information (DCI) payload sizes and/or different coding rates of the PDCCH. Alternatively or additionally, the base station 120 may implement interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping (e.g., for frequency diversity) or non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping (e.g., for localized beam-forming).
[0033] In some aspects of control information-based index modulation, the base station 120 or Cl index modulator 268 may define a CUM configuration based on one or more CORESETs 410 used to convey control information to a UE 110. For example, a serving base
station may have four BWPs 402 that may each support three CORESETs (e.g., available 12 CORESETS). In some cases, each of the CORESETs is identifiable using an index with range 0- 11 of a “controlResourceSetld” field sent to the UE 110. As described herein, the base station 120 may create or assign a CUM configuration (e.g., a CUM table or bit-overlay) that maps information bits (e.g., [0000]-[l 011]) to respective ones of the 12 index values of the CORESETs. By so doing, the base station 120 can use a configuration or index of a CORESET that carries the PDCCH to convey the additional data bits to a UE 110.
[0034] The base station 120 also specifies and maps a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) onto other REs 320 of a slot and/or a frame that carries the PDCCH to the UE 110. In aspects, the base station 120 can send a first portion of information to a UE 110 as user data in the PDSCH and a second portion of the information through CUM, which may include modulation of control information or other PDCCH parameters (e.g., CORESET indices). In an example of CUM, the base station may configure and use a search space (SS) set of a UE, that the UE uses to decode the PDCCH candidates. Thus, the base station can select one of the 40 SS set indices 0- 39 to convey up to 6 bits (e.g., 100111) of data to the UE through the control channel. The user data carried in REs or RBs of the PDSCH may be modulated using any suitable type of modulation (e.g., at the PHY layer), such as binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), binary frequency -shift keying (BFSK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), 16-state QAM (16QAM), 64-state QAM (64QAM), 256-state QAM (256QAM), and so on.
[0035] On reception, the UE 110 may decode the coded user data (e.g., [11]) from the PDSCH of the downlink communication and the additional information bits (e.g., [0101]) based on the index of the CORESET by which the PDCCH is transmitted to the UE. Thus, the base station 120 implements CUM to convey an additional four bits of information [0101] using the CORESET index value for the PDCCH of the downlink communication. In aspects, the Cl index modulator 268 can indicate whether CUM is being used or enabled for the downlink transmission by using a bit of the PDCCH. For example, not every UE may support CUM, the base station 120 may determine that CUM is not needed to transmit queued data to a UE, or the base station 120 may selectively direct a UE to intermittently use CUM. Alternatively or additionally, the base station 120 may notify the UE 110 whether to prepend or append the information bits provided by CIIM-enabled communications to data from the PDSCH. For example, the base station 120 may use another bit of the PDCCH to configure the UE 110 to prepend or append additional bits provided by CUM to other information bits received with the communication. In other implementations, a CUM table or bit-overlay selected by a wireless transmitter (e.g., base station 120) may indicate whether a wireless receiver prepends or appends CUM decoded bits to other data-bits or control-bits of a received communication.
[0036] FIG. 5 illustrates at 500 example configurations of a physical control channel and a physical shared channel through which aspects of control information-based index modulation can be implemented. In this example, a first slot of a subframe includes a PDCCH 502 and a synchronization signal/physical broadcast channel block 504 (SSB 504), and a second slot includes a PDSCH 506. Generally, the base station 120 transmits control information for managing various aspects of a wireless connection to the UE 110 using the PDCCH 502. In aspects, the base station 120 sends control information for a UE 110 as a downlink control indicator 508 (DCI 508) carried by the PDCCH. The DCI 508 can be implemented with any suitable DCI format (e.g., for uplink scheduling or downlink scheduling) and may include control information bits 510 (control bits 510) for one or more DCI fields associated with managing parameters of downlink and/or uplink communications or signaling between the base station 120 and the UE 110 (e.g., antenna ports, sounding resource signal (SRS) requests, precoding matrix information). In aspects, the base station 120 and/or UE 110 may implement control information- based index modulation to convey additional information bits to a receiving device based on values of the control bits 510 for managing downlink or uplink communication. The base station 120 may also configure the PDCCH 502 with a CUM enable indicator 512 (e.g., CUM enable bit) to indicate use of CUM for a particular slot, sub-frame, or frame of air interface resources. In alternative implementations, the CUM enable indicator 512 may be incorporated into the DCI. Although not shown, a UE 110 may implement a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) or physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) with a CUM enable bit to indicate to the base station 120 that an uplink communication is CIIM-enabled and uses control information to convey additional control-bits or data-bits on the uplink of a wireless connection.
[0037] Returning to FIG. 5, the SSB 504 includes a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS) and a physical broadcast channel (PBCH). The UE 110 may use the SSB to acquire time and frequency synchronization with the base station 120, as well as obtain information useful to decode information and data from the PDSCH 506. Although illustrated as one SSB 504, the base station 120 may transmit multiple SSBs 504 or bursts of SSBs 504 on different beams with respective beam identifiers. The base station 120 may configure and use the PDSCH 506 to transmit user data bits 514 to a UE 110. As noted, the user data bits 514 conveyed to the UE 110 may be modulated using any suitable type of modulation (e.g., at the PHY layer), such as BPSK, BFSK, QAM, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM, and so on. Thus, in aspects of control information-based index modulation, a base station 120 can configure a downlink communication to a UE 110 to convey user data bits 514 in the PDSCH and additional information bits using the control bits 510 of the PDCCH 502.
[0038] As shown at 501, a DCI 508 of the PDCCH 502 may include a transmission configuration indicator 516 (TCI 516) that specifies various transmission configuration parameters used by the base station 120 or the UE 110. The transmission configuration parameters or other information of the TCI may be structured as fields or state information that the base station 120 selectively configures to manage aspects of communication between the base station 120 and a UE 110. In aspects of control information-based index modulation, the base station 120 can configure the UE 110 with any suitable number of TCI-state configurations in which a given TCI- state includes parameters and corresponding control bits 510 for various reference signals, antenna ports, beams of downlink communications. Examples of TCI-state specified parameters may include configurations relating to quasi co-location relationships between reference signals and the demodulation reference signal (DM-RS) ports of a PDSCH 506, the DM-RS port of a PDCCH 502, a channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS) state, SSB beam identifier, and so forth. In this example, the TCI 516 of the DCI 508 includes a CSI-RS state 518 and an SSB beam identifier 520 (SSB beamID 520), which the base station 120 may set individually or through selection of corresponding a TCI-state ID for the CSI-RS state 518 or SSB beam identifier 520. As shown at 501, the SSB beam identifier 520 of the TCI 516 indicates to the UE 110 the beam identifier (BeamID 22) of a beam used by the base station 120 to transmit a downlink communication to the UE 110.
[0039] As described herein, the base station 120 may implement control information- based index modulation to use various control information, such as the beam identifier or CSI-RS state of the TCI 516, to convey information bits to the UE 110 without using additional resources of the air interface. In aspects, the base station 120 configures the UE 110 with a CUM table or bit-overlay that enables a wireless receiver to decode information bits from a CIIM-enabled communication. Thus, the base station 120 can selectively configure information or fields of the TCI 516 to indicate an additional number of bits to the UE 110. For example, the TCI 516 indicates the SSB beam ID, which can be used to convey additional bits to a UE 110. The TCI 516 may also include a CSI-RS state, which can be used to convey or signal the additional information bits to a UE 110. The base station 120 may define or set multiple TCI-states for a UE 110, with TCI-state IDs that range from state 1 to state M, where M may depend on UE capability per BWP. Alternatively or additionally, the PDCCH can indicate (e.g., a CIIM-enabled bit or flag) whether CUM is enabled for the assigned PDSCH, where the TCI can convey the additional information bits.
[0040] FIG. 6 illustrates at 600 an example control information-based index modulation table implemented in accordance with one or more aspects. Generally, a CUM codebook, a CUM bit-overlay, a CUM table, or the like enables network entities to implement respective CUM
operations, such as encoding information bits using control information or decoding information bits based on the control information. This common or shared CUM information of the base station 120 and UE 110 may map two or more information bits to control information bits or values exchanged by the base station 120 and the UE 110. Thus, the base station 120 and/or UE 110 may leverage the control information bits or values to convey additional bits of information through downlink or uplink communications. The additional bits of information may be appended or prepended to other data-bits or control-bits of a communication for which CUM is enabled, providing flexibility as to how the additional bits of information conveyed through CUM are used at a receiving device. Additionally or alternatively, a receiving device may be configured to suppress a predefined number of leading zeros or trailing zeros of the bits of information sent using CUM, allowing for the conveyance of fewer bits (e.g., three bits, [101]) than specified by a CUM table or bit-overlay entry (e.g., six bits, [000101] or [101000]) when a number of information bits pending transmission by a transmitting device is fewer than a corresponding entry of a currently selected CUM table or bit-overlay entry.
[0041] In this example, a base station 120 configures a UE 110 with a UE CUM codebook 216 for beam space modulation in which information bits are mapped to SSB beam identifiers (beamIDs) as indicated by the TCI 516 of downlink communications. In other implementations, control information-based index modulation is implemented using other control information or transmission configuration parameters, which may include CSI-RS states, SRS indicators, precoding matrices, antenna ports, resource block mapping, CORESET configurations, reference signal index, a sounding resource indicator, a search space index, a control channel element map, or the like. Thus, a UE 110 and a base station 120 may include or have access to one or more CUM codebooks that enable control information-based index modulation on any suitable control information or control information fields (e.g., beam identifiers, CSI-RS states, SRS resource indicators) that are communicated between the UE 110 and the base station 120.
[0042] As shown at 600, the UE 110 is configured with a UE CUM codebook 216 that includes CUM table 1 602, CUM table 2 604, through CUM table “n” 606, where “n” is any suitable integer. The base station 120 also includes a BS CUM codebook 266 with CUM table 1 602, CUM table 2604, through CUM table “n” 606, where “n” is any suitable integer. Note, the base station 120 may include multiple CUM codebooks for same or different control information that the base station can distribute to the UE 110 or other UEs associated with the base station. The respective information of the UE CUM codebook 216 and the BS CUM codebook 266 may be similar or complementary, such that selection of corresponding codebooks 216/266 enables the base station 120 and UE 110 to implement aspects of CUM for downlink or uplink communications. As described herein, the base station 120 and the UE 110 can agree on the
information bit values or bit-overlays associated with control information (e.g., control bits). Generally, this control information may include a transmission configuration parameter and/or other information communicated by the base station 120 or UE 110 through a control channel (e.g., PDCCH or PUCCH). In some cases, the base station 120 and UE 110 communicate RRC messages to configure and select a CUM codebook and/or CUM configuration with which to implement CUM operations. In the context of the present example, assume that the base station 120 has directed the UE 110 to select and use CUM table 2604 of the UE CUM codebook 216 for CIIM-enabled downlink communications that use a beam space modulation scheme (e.g., beam identifier or beam index).
[0043] In aspects, the base station 120 and the UE 110 can agree on bit values associated with control bits, control fields, or combinations of a CUM configuration, such that the UE 110 is aware of a selected CUM configuration (e.g., as applied to control bits for air interface resources) and control information index for the selected control information bits. As shown in FIG. 6, the base station 120 implements CUM table 2 604 for a beam space of 64 beam identifiers or indices (e.g., BeamID_22 of FIG. 5) in which one beam identifier (beamID) is used for a scheduled downlink to the UE 110. Thus, the base station 120 can convey six additional bits of information, [000000] though [111111], by scheduling downlink transmission with a corresponding one of the beam indices or beam identifiers BeamID O through BeamID_63. In other words, if the base station 120 has one bit of data (e.g., binary signaling) to transmit to the UE 110, then up to an additional 6 bits of the UE data can be conveyed by using a beam within the beam space CUM configuration that is selected based on the up to 6 bits of additional UE data (e.g., the most- significant bits or least-significant bits of UE information bits or coded bits). In addition to use of the selected beam, the base station 120 may use one control bit in the PDCCH to indicate that a downlink transmission is CIIM-enabled to inform the UE 110 to decode additional data bits based on an active CUM configuration (e.g., CUM codebook or bit-overlay) of the UE 110.
[0044] The base station 120 may use different CUM bit-overlays, CUM tables, and/or CUM codebooks to convey different amounts of data to the UE 110 or other UEs 110 connected to the base station 120. Generally, an amount of information that the base station 120 can convey to the UE 110 through control information-based index modulation corresponds with a number of selectively configurable control bits within a control information index, field, or bit-overlay of a given size. With reference to FIG. 6, the base station 120 conveys six additional bits of information, e.g., [000000] through [111111], by scheduling downlink communications using a beam identifier within a CUM configuration of 64 beam identifiers (e.g., 64 selectable BeamIDs). Similarly, the base station 120 and UE 110 can agree to use another CUM table for CORESET where each of the 12 CORESET indices maps to a corresponding bit-value for four information
bits (e.g., [0000] through [1011]). Thus, control information-based index modulation may be adaptively configured or used to convey different amounts of information to a wireless receiver, which may include as few as two bits of information or six or more bits of information. In some cases, a base station 120 may select a CUM codebook or CUM bit-overlay based on an average number of data bits communicated with a UE 110 through a downlink communication or uplink communication. For example, when a base station 120 transmits an average of four data bits to a UE 110 per downlink communication, the base station 120 may configure the UE 110 with a CUM bit-overlay that includes three information bits overlaid control information bits such that the base station 120 conveys one data bit value using binary signaling and three additional data bits (e.g., [000] through [111]) using control information-based index modulation to convey a total of four data bits to the UE 110. In other words, the base station 120 can convey one data bit to the UE 110 using the data channel of the air interface and convey three other data bits using control information-based index modulation without consuming additional air interface resources.
[0045] Generally, a number of bits that the base station 120 or UE 110 is able to convey through control information-based index modulation depends on a number of elements (e.g., bit values or configurable options) that are selected from a set of CUM selectable elements. For example, a CUM codebook may define a region of air interface resources from which two or three resource element groups (REGs) or control channel elements (CCEs) are selected to carry control information to the UE 110. In such cases, the amount of information conveyed through control information-based index modulation is based on a number of unique combinations (e.g., combinations of CCEs) that can be chosen or selected from the set of CUM selectable elements (e.g., a CUM region of CCEs). As such, the Cl index modulator 268 or base station 120 may select and use a CUM configuration, CUM table, or CUM codebook based on an amount of information pending transmission to a UE 110.
[0046] By way of example, consider the equations below, which illustrate a number of different bit values that a base station 120 can convey to a UE 110 by implementing various aspects of CUM.
Equation 1: CIIM bit value combinations
[0047] Generally, the number of different binary bit values that a wireless transmitter can convey to a wireless receiver through CIIM may be based on a size or range of a CIIM element set (e.g., selectable options or settings) and a number of control information elements selected
(e.g., selected option(s) or setting(s)). As shown in Equation 1, based on the Combinations formula for a number of combinations C given by a subset or selected r (BeamID) chosen from a set n (BeamID range), the base station 120 may convey up to six bits of information by selecting to use a beam with a BeamID that corresponds to the information bits to convey.
Equation 2: Bit value Combinations for a CIIM configuration of 64 BeamlDs selecting 1
BeamID
[0048] In the context of FIG. 6 and as shown in Equation 2, by scheduling a downlink communication to the UE 110 with one of the 64 available beams, the base station 120 can send one of 64 different binary values (e.g., 6 bits) to the UE 110. To illustrate, consider BeamID 608 (BeamID_53), which is selected as a beam for a downlink communication to the UE 110 in the context of CUM table 2 604. In this case, the Cl index modulator 268 can convey six additional bits with BeamID 608 by selecting, based on CUM table 2504, one of the 64 available beam space entries of the CUM configuration (e.g., 000000 to 111111). Assume here that the base station 120 is using a binary signaling and the base station has seven bits of data [0110101] pending transmission to the UE 110. To use control information-based index modulation, the Cl index modulator 268 selects the 53rd beam (BeamID 53) of the CUM configuration that corresponds to bits [110101] 610 and sends the signal constellation for binary signaling of [0] 612 an RE of the PDSCH to create a seven-bit data message [0110101] 510, 512 for the UE 110. In aspects, the base station 120 also asserts an indication bit in the PDCCH to notify the UE 110 that the downlink communication is CIIM-enabled and carries information that is modulated using a control information index or bit-overlay.
[0049] When the UE 110 receives the downlink communication with the seven-bit data message, the first bit [0] 612 is decoded by a PHY-layer decoder of the UE 110, and the six information bits modulated with CUM [110101] 610 are decoded based on the SSB beam ID 520 of the TCI 516 in the PDCCH to provide the data [0110101] sent by the base station. In aspects, the base station 120 or Cl index modulator may assign multiple UEs 110 to a CUM configuration, enabling the base station 120 to convey additional information with CUM to at least some of the multiple UEs 110 via the CUM configuration of air interface resources. In this example, the CUM information is appended to the decoded data value, but in other implementations, the CUM information can be prepended to the decoded data value. Alternatively or additionally, a Cl index modulator of a wireless receiver can drop or omit leading zeros (e.g., when appending) or trailing
zeros (e.g., when prepending) of CUM information. By so doing, a wireless transmitter may convey fewer bits (e.g., [101]) than specified by a complete entry (e.g., [00101] or [10100]) of a CUM codebook, CUM table, CUM bit-overlay, or the like.
[0050] FIG. 7 illustrates an example operating environment 700 in which control information-based index modulation can be implemented with multiple UEs in accordance with various aspects. Generally, a base station 120 or Cl index modulator 268 may assign a respective CUM configuration (e.g., a CUM table or CUM bit-overlay) to multiple UEs 110 (e.g., UE 111, UE 112, UE 113, UE 114, and UE 115) that communicate with the base station. The base station 120 may assign same or different CUM configurations to the UEs 110, as well as different CUM configurations to a UE 110 for use with downlink communications versus uplink communications. By so doing, the base station 120 may enable CUM with at least some of the multiple UEs 110 during a frame, subframe, or slot of air interface resources to improve spectral efficiency of a wireless communication system. Although described with reference to multiple UEs 110, the aspects described in relation to FIG. 7 may be implemented additionally or alternatively with aspects described with reference to FIGs. 1-6, the transactions of FIGs. 8-11, and/or the methods ofFIGs. 12-17.
[0051] In the example shown in FIG. 7, the base station 120 configures the UE 111, UE
112, UE 113, UE 114, and UE 115 to use a respective CUM table 600 or bit-overlay from a UE CUM codebook 612. Assume here that the base station has configured UE 111, UE 113, and UE 114 with a beam space CUM table and configured UE 112 and UE 115 with a CSI-RS port CUM table. Alternatively or additionally, the base station 120 may configure the UE 111, UE 112, UE
113, UE 114, or UE 115 with an uplink CUM configuration, which may use control information of a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) or a sounding resource signal (SRS) resource indicator (SRI) for CIIM-enable communications on the uplink to the base station 120. Based on a beam space CUM configuration of a UE 110, the base station 120 can schedule UEs 110 with beams selected based on additional information bits queued for transmission on the downlink. For example, when there are 64 beams available on the base station side, the base station 120 can select a beam ID for the UE 110 to convey six bits in addition to UE data in the PDSCH. To do so, the base station 120 can select a beam for the UE 110 such that the additional beam-coded information bits for the UE are consistent or aligned with one of the beams that support communication with the UE. In other cases, based on a CSI-RS port CUM configuration, the base station can use a selected antenna port (e.g., 3000 series CSI-RS antenna ports) to convey the additional information bits. The base station can select a CSI-RS antenna port for the UE 110 such that the additional CSI-RS port-coded information bits for the UE 110 are consistent or aligned with one of the CSI-RS ports that support communication with the UE. When received,
the UE 110 with the assigned CSI-RS state or antenna port can decode the additional bits based on CSI-RS ports indicated in the TCI 516.
[0052] In the context of FIG. 7, the base station 120 or Cl index modulator 268 schedules respective downlink communications to one or more of the multiple UEs 110 using specific control information modulations based on additional information bits to send to the multiple UEs. For example, the base station 120 can evaluate information bits pending transmission to the UEs based on available CUM entries (e.g., that support communication with the UE) to determine CUM entries with coded information bits that align with the information bits pending transmission to the UE. The base station 120 may also mix CIIM-enabled downlink communications with non- CIIM-enabled downlink communications. For example, a UE 110 may not have additional information pending transmission, or the base station 120 may not be able to use a CUM entry or setting of a CUM configuration needed to convey the additional information. In the context of the present example, assume that the base station 120 is able to schedule downlink communications with beam space or CSI-RS index modulations to convey respective additional information for UE 111, UE 112, and UE 114, but is unable to schedule a desired beam for additional information of UE 113 and has no pending data for transmission to UE 115. In this case, the base station 120 mixes the CIIM-enabled communications to UE 111 on downlink 711, UE 112 on downlink 712, and UE 114 on downlink 714, with a non-CIIM-enabled communication to UE 113 on downlink 713. As shown in FIG. 7, the base station 120 conveys additional bits of information [010011], [OHIO], and [101100] to UE 111, UE 112, and UE 114 by using BeamID_19, CSI-RS port 3013, and BeamID_44, respectively.
[0053] Alternatively or additionally, a UE (e.g., UE 110) may implement aspects of control information-based index modulation as described with reference to FIGs. 1-7, the operations as described with reference to FIGs. 8-11, and/or the methods as described with reference to FIGs. 12-17. For example, a UE may include an instance of a Cl index modulator 218 that enables the UE to implement CUM for uplink communications to a base station. The UE 110 or Cl index modulator 218 may use a CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-overlay assigned to the UE by the base station. In aspects, the UE 110 or Cl index modulator 218 determines that additional data-bits or control -bits pending transmission to the base station 120 align with CUM coded information of an assigned CUM entry or bit-overlay of the UE 110. Based on the determination that the additional data-bits or control-bits align with coded bits of the assigned CUM entry (or bit-overlay), the UE 110 can set an indicator in the PUCCH or PUSCH to indicate use of control information-based index modulation on the uplink communication to the base station 120. By using CUM on an uplink communication, the UE may improve spectral efficiency of a wireless network in which the UE and base station communicate. Additional
aspects of implementing CUM with uplink communications are also described in reference to operations ofFIGs. 10 and 11, as well as a method of FIG. 16.
[0054] In aspects, the UE 110 can implement CIIM-enable uplink communications based on control information configured by the base station for the UE to use for uplink transmissions. Thus, on the uplink, the UE 110 can use a beam index or precoding index sent by the base station 120 to convey additional uplink information, which may include control-bits or data-bits of the UE. For example, the can UE 110 determine that additional data channel bits (e.g., PUSCH data- bits) pending transmission to the base station 120 align with coded bit values of a CUM entry (e.g., of an uplink CUM table or bit-overlay) for a precoding matrix index or beam index assigned to the UE by the base station. Based on the determination, the UE sends an indication (e.g., CIIM- enable bit) in PUSCH to notify the base station that CUM in the uplink is enabled and the additional information bits should be obtained based on the precoding matrix index or beam index previously sent to the UE. Alternatively or additionally, the UE 110 may use an SRS resource indicator (SRI) sent by the base station 120 (e.g., in a DCI) to convey the additional information bits to the base station on the uplink. The SRS resources or SRI sent or assigned by the base station 120 may correspond to an uplink beam index or identifier.
[0055] In other aspects, the UE 110 can use control information sent or assigned by the base station 120 to convey additional control channel bits (PUCCH control-bits) to the base station 120. For example, the UE 110 can determine that control-bits pending transmission to the base station align with coded bit values of a CUM entry (e.g., of an uplink CUM table or bit-overlay) for a precoding matrix index or beam index assigned to the UE by the base station. Based on this determination, the UE 110 sets an indicator (e.g., a CIIM-enable bit) in the PUCCH sent by the UE with the precoding matrix index or beam assigned by the base station to convey the additional control information bits when those control information bits align with the base station-assigned precoding matrix index or uplink beam. In some cases, the additional control-bits conveyed to the base station include additional CSI information, such as sub-band channel quality information (CQI) or channel state information (CSI) when the PUCCH carries CSI-RS reporting information back to the base station. As described herein, the PUCCH can have a special indication, which may include a predefined or assigned enable bit, indicating that the UE 110 transmits the PUCCH with the assigned precoding matrix, beam, or direction with control information-based index modulation enabled (e.g., conveying additional information with the precoding matrix or beam index known to the base station).
[0056] In the context of FIG. 7, the UE 115 implements control information-based index modulation on an uplink 721 to the base station 120. Here assume that the base station 120 had previously assigned a PMI-based CUM table to the UE 115 for uplink communications. In
response to the UE 115 determining that pending additional data bits [101] align with coded information bits of the assigned PMI of the UE 115, the UE uses an indicator in the PUSCH to indicate to the base station 120 that the uplink communication is CIIM-enabled on the PUSCH. On reception, the base station 120 can use the previously assigned PMI and the current CUM table to decode the additional data bits conveyed on the uplink by the UE 115. Alternatively, the UE 115 can convey additional control-bits or control information with CUM by using an indicator in the PUCCH to the base station 120. Thus, aspects of control information-based index modulation may enable a wireless transmitter to convey additional information on an uplink or downlink without using additional air interface resources, which can improve spectral efficiency of a wireless network.
Control Information-Based Index Modulation Operations
[0057] FIGs. 8-11 illustrate example control and data signaling diagrams 800, 900, 1000, and 1100, respectively. The diagrams 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 illustrate example signals between various network entities, such as the UE 110 and the base station 120 in accordance with various aspects of control information-based index modulation. The operations of the diagrams 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 may be combined with operations of other diagrams, with aspects described with reference to FIGs. 1-7, and/or operations of the methods described with reference to FIGs. 12-17 to implement various aspects of CUM. With reference to specific examples, the diagram 800 illustrates a base station 120 configuring a UE 110 for CUM, the diagram 900 illustrates a base station 120 transmitting CIIM-enabled downlink communications to multiple UEs 110, the diagram 1000 illustrates a UE 110 transmitting CIIM-enabled uplink communications to a base station 120, and the diagram 1100 illustrates aspects of CUM that a base station 120 or UE 110 can implement with a CUM bit-overlay. The UE 110, the base station 120, the UE Cl index modulator 218, and the BS Cl index modulator 268 may be implemented using any combination of aspects described with reference to FIGs. 1-7 or FIGs. 12-17.
[0058] A first example of control and data signaling for control information-based index modulation is illustrated by the transaction diagram 800 of FIG. 8. In the diagram 800, a base station 120 may configure the UE 110 for CUM operations and transmit a portion of data modulated with CUM to the UE. By so doing, the base station conveys an increased amount of data or user plane information to the UE without consuming additional air interface resources, which can be useful for efficiently transmitting small amounts of data to a large number of UEs (e.g., improved spectral efficiency).
[0059] At 805, a UE determines CUM capability information of the UE. The CUM capability information may include a currently selected CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-
overlay for use in decoding CIIM-enabled downlink communications. The CUM capability information of the UE can include locally stored CUM codebooks or CUM bit-overlays that the UE can access for CUM operations. In some cases, the UE determines that the UE does not have a CUM codebook or that a local copy of a CUM codebook has been deprecated. In such cases, the UE may determine to request a CUM codebook from a base station or access a remote source to obtain one or more CUM codebooks.
[0060] At 810, the UE transmits an indication of the UE’s CUM capability information to a base station. In some cases, the UE transmits an indication of CUM specific capabilities of the UE, which may include an indication of one or more CUM codebooks or CUM tables accessible by the UE. In other cases, the UE transmits an indication of an active or current CUM configuration of the UE. In this example, the UE transmits an indication of UE CUM capabilities as a user equipment-capability-information information element (UE Capabilitylnformation IE) that indicates one or more capabilities specific to CUM. In aspects, the UE and base station communicate indications of the UE’s CUM capability information and/or UE CUM configuration information via respective RRC messages.
[0061] At 815, the base station determines a CUM configuration for the UE. The CUM configuration of the UE may include assignment to a CUM group of UEs, a CUM configuration to which the UE is assigned, a CUM codebook or CUM table to use for decoding CIIM-enabled communications, or the like. Optionally at 820, the base station sends a CUM codebook or CUM bit-overlay to the UE. For example, when the base station selects to use a CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-overlay that is not accessible to the UE, the base station may send that UE CUM codebook to the UE for use in subsequent CUM operations. At 825, the base station transmits an indication of the CUM configuration to the UE. The indication may include a CUM information element (e.g., UE CIIM Configuration IE) with values that identify or specify a CUM table or CUM bit-overlay to use for subsequent CUM operations. In various aspects, the transmission configuration parameters or control fields used by the base station to implement CUM may include one or more of a CSI-RS state, SRS indicator, precoding matrix, antenna port, resource block mapping, CORESET configuration, reference signal index, a sounding resource indicator, a search space index, or a control channel element map. As noted, the base station may transmit the indication of the CUM configuration or configuration parameters to the base station using one or more RRC messages. Generally, the one or more of the operations 805, 810, 815, 820, and/or 825 may correspond to a sub-diagram 830 in which the UE and base station communicate to establish a CUM configuration for subsequent CIIM-related transactions.
[0062] At 835, the base station determines to use CUM for a downlink communication to the UE. Generally, the base station can implement CUM dynamically (e.g., on a slot-by-slot or
subframe-by-subframe basis), for example, when additional information is pending transmission to the UE and/or a corresponding control information value or bit-coding is available to convey the additional information to the UE. In some cases, the BS evaluates a transmit queue or transmit buffer to determine whether multiple bits of data are pending transmission to the UE. When additional coded bits (e.g., a second portion of information) are pending transmission to the UE, the base station may determine that control information with a corresponding CUM coded bit value is available to convey the additional coded bits to the UE. For example, the base station may query a CUM table or bit-overlay to determine, based on a value of the coded bits, which available CUM entry (e.g., beamID, CSI-RS state, antenna port, transmission configuration (or control) parameter) corresponds to the additional coded bits. Responsive to determining that the CUM entry or setting is available for use with a downlink communication to the UE, the base station may determine to use CUM for the downlink communication to the UE. Alternatively, when the CUM entry or setting that corresponds to the additional bits is not available (e.g., does not support communication with the UE) to configure the downlink communication to the UE, the base station may determine not to use CUM for the downlink communication to the UE. In aspects, when the base station determines to convey a portion of queued or buffered data using CUM, the base station removes that portion of data from the transmit queue or transmit buffer, such as to avoid conveying same (e.g., duplicative) data using the data channel and control channel.
[0063] At 840, the base station sets an indication (e.g., a CUM enabled bit) that CUM is enabled for the downlink communication to the UE. As described herein, the base station can implement CUM dynamically on a slot-by-slot or subframe-by-subframe basis to transmit information to the UE using modulated control information, such as transmission configuration parameter values or settings. When CUM is enabled or used with a downlink communication to a UE, the base station can indicate to the UE that CUM is being used via the PDCCH. For example, the base station may use a predefined bit in the PDCCH or DCI to indicate whether CUM is enabled for a corresponding PDSCH. Based on the indication, the UE can use values of the control information or transmission configuration parameter in the TCI of the PDCCH to extract the additional information bits (e.g. user data bits) when the CUM scheme is used.
[0064] At 845, the base station transmits data intended for the UE with CUM on the downlink communication. In aspects, the base station modulates a first portion of the data (e.g., first coded bits, MSB bits, or LSB bits) as modulation symbols or signal constellations at a PHY layer of a wireless link between the base station and the UE. In accordance with aspects of CUM, the base station uses the bits of control information (e.g., CUM entry or CUM setting) determined or selected at 835 to modulate a second portion of the data (e.g., second coded bits, LSB bits, or
MSB bits) as the control information for a transmission configuration parameter by which to transmit the modulation symbols to the UE. The base station then schedules the first portion of the data for transmission to the UE in accordance with the selected control information to convey both the first and second portions of the data to the UE. As such, the CIIM-enabled downlink transmission to the UE includes the first portion of data (e.g., a string of first data bits) modulated at the PHY layer in the PDSCH and the second portion of data modulated with CUM through control information in the PDCCH (e.g., a string of control bits from which the second portion of data bits are can be decoded).
[0065] At 850, the UE decodes the CUM modulated bits from the downlink control channel. Based on the control information for the transmission configuration parameter (e.g., beamID, CSI-RS state, antenna port, or the like), the UE decodes the CUM modulated data bits from the control channel. In aspects, the UE determines the bit values associated with the control information in the downlink control channel to the UE by using a CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-overlay. At 855, the UE decodes the data bits from the PHY-layer modulation symbols in the downlink data channel (e.g. PDSCH). When CUM is used, the UE may then append or prepend the decoded CUM bits to the data bits carried in the PDSCH to reconstruct the user plane information sent by the base station. In some cases, the base station may use CUM to convey error-correcting code (ECC) bits for data bits sent using the data channel. Thus, the UE may use these CUM bits (e.g., ECC bits) to assist in decoding the data bits obtained from the downlink data channel.
[0066] Another example of control and data signaling for control information-based index modulation is illustrated by the transaction diagram 900 of FIG. 9. In the diagram 900, a base station 121 communicates with UEs 111 and 112 using CUM and communicates with another UE 113 without using CUM. By so doing, the base station may convey an increased amount of data or information to at least two UEs connected to the base station, which can be useful to increase spectral efficiency when transmitting small amounts of data to multiple UEs (e.g., deployments of IoT devices).
[0067] At 830, the base station establishes CUM configurations for multiple UEs that are connected to the base station through respective wireless links as described with reference to FIG. 8. As shown in FIG. 9, the base station 121 establishes CUM configurations for the UE 111, UE 112, and UE 113. The base station may configure the UE 111, UE 112, and UE 113 with same or different CUM configurations. For example, the base station may select respective CUM configurations for the UE 111, UE 112, and UE 113 based on an average amount of data transmitted to the UE or a type of CUM parameter (e.g., beamID, CSI-RS state, or antenna port) that provides a suitable range of bit values based on characteristics of communications between
the base station and the UE (e.g., relative beam direction, channel state, or quasi co-location parameters).
[0068] Optionally at 905, the base station selects a subset of the multiple UEs for CUM on the downlink. The base station may select the subset of UEs based on respective data pending transmission to the UEs. For example, the base station may select a subset of UEs with different combinations of coded bits pending transmission (e.g., [1011], [0101] and [1001]), such that corresponding control information values or settings of a same or mutually exclusive CUM configuration (e.g., search space index or CCE mapping) are available to use for CUM with one or more of the multiple UEs. Alternatively or additionally, the base station may reselect the UEs for the CUM configuration dynamically, such as on a slot basis, subframe basis, or frame basis. When the base station configures multiple UEs with different respective CUM configurations or non-exclusive CUM configurations (e.g., beam index), the base station omits operation 905 and advances to operation 910.
[0069] At 910, the base station determines to communicate with one or more of the UEs using CUM. As described with reference to operation 835, the base station may determine control information modulations based on bit values of the data (e.g., a second portion of the data) and a CUM table or bit-overlay that maps data bit values to corresponding control information bit values or settings. The base station may then determine whether respective CIIM-enabled control information is available for use to communication with one or more of the UEs. When the base station does not have additional data to send the UE, or no available control bits match the desired data bits, the base station may disable CUM for that UE in a slot, subframe, or frame. Alternatively or additionally, the base station may schedule a downlink transmission for a non-CIIM UE using transmission configuration parameter settings (e.g., a UE-specific PDCCH search space) that are not used for CUM with another UE and are thus available to use for non-CIIM communication.
[0070] After determining that respective control information modulations for transmission configuration parameters are available to use for communication with multiple UEs, the base station schedules transmission of downlink data channels to at least some of the multiple UEs in accordance with the determined control information. In the context of the present example, assume that the base station is able to schedule CIIM-enabled downlinks with beam index control information that corresponds with additional coded bits for UE 111 and UE 112 but not UE 113 due to a lack of suitable beam selection (e.g., a beam index with data aligned CUM coded bit values does not support communication with the UE 113).
[0071] At 915, the base station enables or disables CUM for the multiple UEs. The base station can send an indication (e.g., operation 840 of FIG. 8) to a UE in the PDCCH that CUM is enabled for the downlink control channel to the UE on a slot-by-slot or subframe-by-subframe
basis to transmit information to the UE using modulated control information in the DCI or TCI of the PDCCH. In the present example, the base station 121 sets respective CUM enable bits in the PDCCH to notify UE 111 and UE 112 that CUM is enabled for the respective downlink communications to these UEs and deasserts a CUM enable bit to notify UE 113 that CUM is disabled.
[0072] At 845, the base station transmits respective data to the UEs with CUM, such as described with reference to FIG. 8 using the control information modulations determined at operation 910. The base station then schedules the respective first portions of the data for transmission to the UEs in accordance with the control information modulations to convey both the first and second portions of the data. As shown in FIG. 9, the base station 121 transmits downlink communications to UE 111 and UE 112 (e.g., UEs 111 and 112 of FIG. 7) using CUM to convey the PHY-layer modulation symbols and the CUM coded bits to those UEs. At 920, the base station transmits data to another of the UEs as PHY-layer modulation symbols without CUM enabled. As noted, the base station may not have additional information pending transmission to the UE, or the base station may not be able to use control information having CIIM-coded bits that align with the additional bits pending communication to the UE. Here, the base station 121 sends a downlink communication to the UE 113 (e.g., UE 113 FIG. 7) without using CUM due to the lack of suitable beam selection for CIIM-enabled communication.
[0073] At 850, some of the multiple UEs decode CUM coded bits from the respective downlink control channels. Based on respective control information modulations and CUM configurations of the UEs, the UEs decode the CUM modulated bits from the TCIs of the downlink communications. The UE can determine the bit values associated with the respective control information modulations by using a CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-overlay as described herein. As shown in FIG. 9, the UE 111 and UE 112 decode CUM bits from respective TCI fields of the CIIM-enabled downlink communications received from the base station 121.
[0074] At 855, the multiple UEs decode data from the PHY-layer modulation symbols or constellation groups in the PDSCH of the respective downlink communications. When CUM is used, the UE can append or prepend the CUM bits decoded from the control channel to the data bits decoded from the data channel to reconstruct the user plane information sent by the base station. When CUM is not used for a UE (e.g., UE 113 CUM disabled), the UE decodes UE data from the PDSCH of the downlink communication that was sent without CUM. Concluding the present example, the UE 111 and UE 112 append or prepend the CUM bits decoded from the control channel to respective user data decoded from the data channel in order to reconstruct the user plane information sent by the base station. The UE 113, which received user data without
CUM, uses a decoder to decode the data from the modulation symbols in the data channel of the downlink communication.
[0075] FIG. 10 illustrates an example transaction diagram 1000 in which a user equipment implements control information-based index modulation in accordance with one or more aspects. In the diagram 1000, the user equipment may use control information bits to convey additional data-bits on an uplink to a base station. Also in the diagram 1000, the UE may use control information bits to convey additional control-bits on an uplink to a base station.
[0076] At 830, a base station (e.g., a base station 120) establishes a CUM configuration for a UE (e.g., a UE 110) with which the base station is connected through a wireless link as described with reference to FIG. 8. Based on the CUM configuration established with the base station, the UE can modulate some uplink data-bits or some uplink control-bits through control information-based index modulation. Accordingly, the operations of diagram 1000 may proceed to a sub-diagram 1005 for conveying data-bits with CUM on the uplink or proceed to sub-diagram 1010 for conveying control-bits with CUM on the uplink. In aspects, the UE may determine to use CUM for the data-bits or control-bits based on a coded bit value of the uplink control information modulation (e.g., bits of a CUM bit-overlay) aligning with the data-bits or the control- bits pending transmission to the base station.
[0077] At 1015 of the 1005 sub-diagram, the UE determines to use CUM for data-bits pending transmission to the base station, which may include data-bits of an uplink data buffer or queue. The UE may determine to use CUM when the data-bits align with CUM coded bit values of control information assigned to the UE for an uplink transmission parameter (e.g., beam index, precoding matrix, or SRI). In some cases, the UE may look up or search for a CUM entry (e.g., CUM table or bit-overlay entry) with coded bit values that match the data-bits and determine if the UE is configured with control information (e.g., beamID) that corresponds to the control information (e.g., beamID) specified by the matching CUM entry. When the data-bits of the UE align with the CUM coded bit values of the control information assigned to the UE for the uplink transmission, the UE can use CUM on the uplink to convey the data-bits to the base station. The CUM encoded data-bits may be conveyed to the base station in addition to at least one other data bit in the PUSCH on the uplink. In aspects, when the UE enables CUM on the uplink, the UE may remove the data-bits that will be conveyed using CUM from the uplink data buffer or queue, such as to avoid transmitting duplicate bits in the data channel.
[0078] At 1020, the UE sets an indication in the PUSCH that CUM is enabled for the uplink communication. When CUM is enabled or used to convey data-bits in the uplink communication, the UE can set or assert an indication bit in the PUSCH to notify the base station that the uplink communication includes additional data-bits modulated with CUM. For example,
the UE may use a predefined bit in the PUSCH to indicate whether CUM is enabled for the uplink data channel.
[0079] At 1025, the UE transmits the uplink communication with CUM to the base station. In aspects, the UE modulates a first portion of the data (e.g., first coded bits, MSB bits, or LSB bits) as modulation symbols or signal constellations at a PHY layer of the wireless link between the UE and the base station. The UE then schedules the first portion of data for transmission to the base station in the data channel in accordance with the control information assigned to the UE, which is used to convey a second portion of the data (e.g., second coded bits, LSB bits, or MSB bits) using CUM. As such, the CIIM-enabled uplink transmission to the base station includes the first portion of data modulated at the PHY layer in the PUSCH and the indication that the second portion of the data is modulated based on control information previously assigned by the base station to the UE for the uplink transmission.
[0080] At 1030, the base station decodes the CUM bits of the uplink communication received from the UE. Based on the CUM enabled indication in the PUSCH, the base station can determine that the uplink communication is conveying the additional data-bits based on the control information associated with the uplink. Thus, the base station can use the control information assigned to the UE for the transmission configuration parameter and the CUM configuration established with the UE to determine the additional data-bits when the CUM scheme is used for the uplink data channel. For example, the base station can use control information of an assigned uplink beam index, precoding matrix index, or SRI to determine the additional data-bits based on the CUM coded bit value that corresponds to that control information in the CUM table or bit- overlay of the UE.
[0081] At 1035, the base station decodes the UE data from the PUSCH of the uplink communication received from the UE. The base station may decode the UE data or a first portion of the data from the PHY-layer modulation symbols or constellation groups in the PUSCH of the uplink communication. The base station may then append or prepend the additional CUM bits to the decoded user data to reconstruct the user plane information sent by the UE. Alternatively, the UE may implement CUM to convey control-bits of information to the base station on the uplink as described with reference to sub-diagram 1010.
[0082] At 1040 of the 1010 sub-diagram, the UE determines to use CUM to modulate control-bits or additional coded control bits pending transmission to the base station, which may include control-bits of an uplink control information buffer or queue. The UE may determine to use CUM when the control-bits align with CUM coded bit values of control information assigned to the UE for an uplink transmission parameter (e.g., beam index, precoding matrix, or SRI). In some cases, the UE may look up or search for a CUM entry (e.g., CUM table or bit-overlay entry)
with coded bit values that match the control-bits and determine if the UE is configured with control information (e.g., assigned precoding matrix index) that corresponds to the control information (e.g., precoding matrix index) specified by the matching CUM entry. When the control-bits of the UE align with the CUM coded bit values of the control information assigned to the UE for the uplink transmission, the UE can use CUM on the uplink control channel to convey the control- bits to the base station. In some cases, the additional control-bits conveyed to the base station include additional CSI information, such as sub-band CQI or CSI when the PUCCH is scheduled to carry CSI-RS reporting information back to the base station.
[0083] At 1045, the UE sets an indication in the PUCCH that CUM is enabled for the uplink control channel. When CUM is enabled or used to convey control-bits in the uplink communication, the UE can set or assert an indication bit in the PUCCH to notify the base station that the uplink control channel includes additional control-bits encoded with CUM. For example, the UE may use a predefined bit in the PUCCH to indicate whether CUM is enabled for the uplink communication.
[0084] At 1050, the UE transmits the uplink communication with CUM to the base station. In aspects, the UE modulates a first portion of the control information (e.g., first coded bits, MSB bits, or LSB bits) as modulation symbols or signal constellations at a PHY layer of the wireless link (e.g., PUCCH) between the UE and the base station. The UE then schedules the first portion of control information for transmission to the base station in accordance with the control information assigned to the UE, which is used to convey a second portion of the control information (e.g., second coded bits, LSB bits, or MSB bits) based on the CUM enable indication in the uplink control channel.
[0085] At 1055, the base station decodes the CUM bits of the uplink communication received from the UE. Based on the CUM enabled indication in the PUCCH, the base station can determine that the uplink communication is conveying the additional control-bits based on the control information associated with the uplink. Thus, the base station can use the control information assigned to the UE for the transmission configuration parameter and the CUM configuration established with the UE to determine the additional control-bits when the CUM scheme is used in the uplink control channel. As described herein, the base station can use control information of an assigned uplink beam index, precoding matrix index, or SRI to determine the additional control-bits based on the CUM coded bit value that corresponds to that control information in the CUM table or bit-overlay of the UE.
[0086] At 1060, the base station decodes the UE control information from the PUCCH of the uplink communication received from the UE. The base station may decode the UE control information or a first portion of the control information from the PHY-layer modulation symbols
or constellation groups in the PUCCH of the uplink communication. When CUM is used, the additional control-bits conveyed to the base station include additional CSI information from the UE, such as sub-band CQI or CSI when the PUCCH is scheduled to carry CSI-RS reporting information back to the base station.
[0087] FIG. 11 illustrates an example transaction diagram 1100 of operations implemented by a base station and a UE using a bit-overlay in accordance with one or more aspects. At 1105, the base station selects a data-bit overlay for a set of control -bits to use with the UE. The base station may select a bit-overlay for any suitable set of multiple control-bits in the PDCCH, which may include control information for a transmission configuration parameter. Alternatively or additionally, the base station selects a bit-overlay that the UE may use for CUM on the uplink, with the bit-overlay mapping data-bits or control-bits to control information for transmissions on the uplink. Thus, the base station may select a downlink bit-overlay and/or an uplink bit-overlay with which to implement CUM with the UE.
[0088] As described herein, the base station uses various transmission configuration parameters, settings, or fields of the PDCCH to manage downlink communications to UEs connected to the base station. For example, the base station can select from a large number of beams or beam indices to use for a downlink communication which may correlate to a similar number of useful bit combinations (e.g., 64 beams is equivalent to 1000000 in binary). In aspects of CUM, a wireless transmitter can use the control information of the various parameters, settings, or fields of the PDCCH on the downlink or PUCCH on the uplink to convey additional bits of information (e.g., additional data-bits or additional control-bits) to a wireless receiver. In the context of the base station selected beam index, an index number for any particular beam can be used to convey additional data-bits to the UE on the downlink. Note that the selected beam, beam index, or other transmission confirmation parameter would be used for signaling with the UE as well. The additional data-bits of a downlink may be mapped (e.g., BeamID mapping Table 2 of FIG. 6) to or overlaid with any suitable control information, control bits, or control field that the base station uses to manage communication with the UE. For example, the bit overlay (or CUM table) may include an overlay of additional data-bit values on a range of multiple beamIDs, a range of multiple CSI-RS indices, a set of antenna ports, CORESET monitoring occasions, CCE mappings, or the like. In some cases, an existing or previously set TCI SSB BeamID can be re used to convey a BeamID when using CUM on the downlink. In other cases, an existing or previously set TCI CSI-RS state can be re-used to convey a CSI-RS index when using CUM.
[0089] At 1110, the base station sends an indication of the selected data-bit overlay to the UE. The base station may send the indication of the selected data-bit overlay by communicating one or more RRC messages with the UE to set the data-bit overlay as part of a CUM configuration
of the UE (e.g., CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-overlay settings for a UE). In some cases, the base station configures the UE with respective CUM setings for decoding CIIM- enabled downlink communications received by the UE and CIIM-enabled uplink communications transmited by the UE.
[0090] At 1115, the base station determines to use the data-bit overlay on the downlink control channel. Generally, the base station can use the data-bit overlay dynamically (e.g., on a slot-by-slot or subframe-by-subframe basis), for example, when additional information is pending transmission to the UE (e.g., in a transmit buffer or queue) and/or a corresponding control information value or bit-coding of the data-bit overlay is available to convey the additional information to the UE. When additional coded bits are pending transmission to the UE, the base station may determine, based on the selected data-bit overlay, that corresponding control-bits of a transmission configuration parameter or PDCCH field are available to convey the additional coded bits to the UE. When the base station determines to use the selected data-bit overlay to convey the additional bits using the control channel, the base station may remove the additional bits or information from a transmit buffer or queue, such as to avoid redundant transmission of the additional bits in the data channel.
[0091] At 1120, the base station sets a bit indicating use of the data-bit overlay on the downlink control channel. The base station may send a bit or control signal using the PDCCH to indicate use of the data-bit overlay on control information in the PDCCH. In some cases, the base station allocates or assigns an additional bit in the PDCCH for indicating whether the data-bit overlay or CUM is used or applied in a corresponding downlink communication to the UE. Based on the indication in the PDCCH, the UE can use values of the control information or transmission configuration parameter in the TCI of the PDCCH to extract the additional information bits when the data-bit overlay is used by the base station.
[0092] At 1125, the base station transmits a downlink communication using the control- bits of the data-bit overlay. In aspects, the base station modulates a first portion of the data-bits (e.g., first coded bits, MSB bits, or LSB bits) as modulation symbols or signal constellations at a PHY layer in the downlink data channel. The base station modulates a second portion of the data- bits (e.g., second coded bits, LSB bits, or MSB bits) using the data-bit overlay entry selected at 1115 with the control-bits for a transmission configuration parameter or PDCCH field in the downlink control channel to UE. As such, the downlink transmission to the UE includes the first portion of data modulated at the PHY layer in the PDSCH and the second portion of data modulated with the data-bit overlay through the selected control information in the PDCCH.
[0093] At 1130, the UE decodes additional data-bits from the downlink control channel using the data-bit overlay. Based on the control-bits of the transmission configuration parameter
(e.g., beamID, CSI-RS state, antenna port, or the like) or PDCCH field of the downlink control channel, the UE decodes the data-bits modulated with the data-bit overlay from the downlink control channel. At 1135, the UE decodes data-bits from the downlink communication. The UE may decode the data-bits from the PHY-layer modulation symbols or signal constellation in the PDSCH of the downlink communication. As described herein, the UE may then append or prepend the additional data-bits to the data-bits carried in the PDSCH to reconstruct the user plane information sent by the base station. Alternatively or additionally, the UE may use a bit-overlay to convey additional data-bits or control-bits on the uplink as described with reference to other operations of the diagram 1100.
[0094] At 1140, the UE determines to use a data-bit overlay on the uplink. In aspects, the UE may determine to use the data-bit overlay to convey additional data-bits or control-bits on the uplink. As such, the base station may configure (e.g., at operations 1105 and 1110) the UE with a data-bit overlay and/or a control-bit overlay bit-overlay with respective bit values overlaid or mapped to with any suitable control information, control bits, or control field that the base station uses to manage uplink communications from the UE. The UE may determine to use the bit- overlay when control-bits or data-bits pending transmission to the base station (e.g., in a UE transmit buffer) align with the mapped or overlaid control information assigned to the UE for an uplink transmission parameter (e.g., uplink beam index, precoding matrix or codebook index, or SRI). For example, when the control-bits of the UE align with the overlaid control-bits of a PUCCH field assigned to the UE for the uplink transmission (e.g., an uplink configuration previously sent by the base station), the UE can use CUM on the uplink to convey the control-bits to the base station. In some cases, the additional control-bits conveyed to the base station include additional CSI information, such as sub-band CQI or CSI when the PUCCH is scheduled to carry CSI-RS reporting information back to the base station. As described herein, when CUM is enabled, the wireless transmitter may remove the additional data- or control-bits from a transmit buffer.
[0095] At 1145, the UE sets a bit indicating use of the bit-overlay on the uplink communication to the base station. When the bit-overlay is enabled or used to convey control- bits in the uplink communication, the UE can set or assert an indication bit in the PUCCH to notify the base station that the uplink communication includes additional control-bits modulated with the bit-overlay. In some cases, the base station assigns or configures a bit in the PUCCH for the UE to use to indicate whether the control-bit overlay is enabled or disabled for the uplink communication. Alternatively, when the bit-overlay is enabled or used to convey data-bits in the uplink communication, the UE can set or assert an indication bit in the PUSCH to notify the base station that the uplink communication includes additional data-bits modulated with the bit-
overlay. In some cases, the base station assigns or configures a bit in the PUSCH for the UE to use to indicate whether the data-bit overlay is enabled or disabled for the uplink communication.
[0096] At 1150, the UE transmits an uplink communication with the control-bit in the PUCCH or data-bit in the PUSCH indicating use of the respective control-bit overlay or data-bit overlay. In aspects, the UE modulates a first portion of information (e.g., control-bits or data-bits) as modulation symbols or signal constellations at a PHY layer of the wireless link between the UE and the base station. The UE then schedules the first portion of the information for transmission to the base station in accordance with the control information assigned to the UE, which is used to convey a second portion of the information based on the control-bit overlay or data-bit overlay enabled by the UE on the uplink communication.
[0097] At 1155, the base station decodes the additional control -bits or data-bits from the uplink communication using the bit overlay. Based on the bit-overlay enabled indication in the PUCCH or PUSCH, the base station can determine that the uplink communication is conveying the additional control-bits or data-bits based on the control information associated with the uplink from the UE. Thus, the base station can use the control information assigned to the UE for the transmission configuration parameter and one of the control-bit overlay or data-bit overlay selected for the UE to determine the additional control-bits or data-bits when the bit overlay is used in the uplink control channel or data channel. As described herein, the base station can use control information of an assigned uplink beam index, precoding matrix index, or SRI to determine the additional control-bits or data-bits based on the mapped bit values that correspond with that control information in the bit-overlay enabled by the UE. At 1160, the base station decodes UE control-bits or data-bits from the uplink communication. The base station may decode the UE control information or data from the PHY-layer modulation symbols or constellation groups in the PUCCH or PUSCH of the uplink communication. The base station may then use the additional data-bits or control-bits to reconstruct the respective user plane or control plane information sent by the UE on the uplink. When the control-bit overlay is used, the additional control-bits conveyed to the base station may include additional CSI information from the UE, such as sub-band CQI or CSI when the PUCCH is scheduled to carry CSI-RS reporting information back to the base station.
Example Methods for Control Information-Based Index Modulation
[0098] Example methods 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, and 1700 are described with reference to FIGs. 12-17 in accordance with one or more aspects of control information-based index modulation. The operations of the methods 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, and 1700 may be combined with operations of other methods, with aspects described with reference to FIGs. 1-
7, and/or operations of the diagrams 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 to implement various aspects of CUM. In various aspects, operations of the methods 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, and/or 1700 are performed by a base station or user equipment, such as the UE 110 or base station 120 described with reference to FIGs. 1-11. For example, a base station (e.g., a base station 120) may establish a CUM configuration for a UE (e.g., a UE 110) with which the base station is connected through a wireless link. As described with reference to FIG. 8, the UE may send CUM capability information to the base station and receive a CUM configuration from the base station to use for implementing CUM operations, including those described with reference to methods 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, and/or 1700.
[0099] FIG. 12 illustrates an example method 1200 for control information-based index modulation (CUM) as generally related to transmitting information (e.g., data-bits or control-bits) to one or more wireless receivers (e.g., UEs or a base station). At 1205, a wireless transmitter determines information for transmission to a wireless receiver. In some cases, a base station (e.g., base station 121) determines data for transmission to a UE (e.g., UE 111, UE 112, UE 113, or UE 114). The base station may process, queue, or buffer data pending transmission to the UE. For example, the base station can encode user data to provide coded bits of data for transmission to the UE. In some cases, the data include coded bits that form a codeword of data or information that is intended for transmission to the UE. Alternatively, a UE may determine data-bits or control-bits for transmission on an uplink to a base station using CUM.
[0100] At 1210, the wireless transmitter modulates a first portion of the information to provide modulation symbols that correspond to the first portion of the information. In some cases, the base station modulates a first portion of the data to provide modulation symbols that correspond to the first portion of the data. In some cases, the base station modulates a first number of coded bits that are pending transmission to the UE. Generally, the base station modulates the first portion of data at the PHY layer as modulation symbols or signal constellations. The base station may use any suitable type of modulation to modulate the first portion of the data, such as BPSK, BFSK, QAM, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM, 1024QAM, and so forth. Alternatively, the UE may modulate a first portion of data-bits or control-bits for transmission on the uplink in a respective data channel or control channel.
[0101] At 1215, the wireless transmitter selects, based on a bit value of a second portion of the information, control information of a transmission configuration parameter by which to transmit the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver. In some cases, the base station selects, based on a data value of a second portion of the data, control information for a transmission configuration parameter by which to transmit the modulation symbols to the UE. In other words, the base station can modulate coded bits of the second portion of the data by selecting a
transmission configuration parameter or field of the PDCCH with control information with CUM coded bit values that correspond to the second portion of the data. Additionally, the base station can determine whether a transmission configuration parameter with control information that aligns with the second portion of the data is available to use for a downlink communication to the UE. Alternatively, the UE may determine whether control information of an uplink transmission configuration parameter aligns with a second portion of the data-bits or control-bits.
[0102] At 1220, the wireless transmitter schedules transmission of the modulation symbols in accordance with the control information of the transmission configuration parameter. In some cases, the base station schedules transmission of the modulation symbols in the data channel in accordance with the control information for the transmission configuration parameter. Based on the selected control information, the base station schedules a downlink communication to the UE with a PDCCH field that includes the control information. For example, the base station schedules the downlink communication using a selected beam identifier, CSI-RS state, antenna port, CCE mapping, CORESET monitoring occasion, or the like. Alternatively, the UE can schedule transmission of the modulation symbols in the data channel or the control channel in accordance with the transmission configuration parameter assigned by the base station. Optionally at 1225, the wireless transmitter indicates use of control information-based modulation to the wireless receiver. In some cases, the base station indicates use of control information-based modulation to the UE (e.g., operation 840 of FIG. 8). In other cases, the UE may use a bit in the data channel or control channel on the uplink to indicate the transmission of additional data-bits or control-bits via CUM on the uplink.
[0103] At 1230, the wireless transmitter transmits the modulation symbols to the wireless receiver using the transmission configuration parameter to convey the first portion of the information and the second portion of the information to the wireless receiver. In some cases, the base station transmits the modulation symbols to the UE using the transmission configuration parameter to convey the first portion of the data and the second portion of the data to the UE. Generally, the modulation symbols or signal constellations of the downlink data channel convey the first portion of data or coded bits via the PHY layer of the wireless link between the base station and the UE. By using CUM, the base station uses the control information to convey the second portion of data using the control channel of the wireless link. As such, the base station conveys additional bits of information or data to the UE in the PDCCH without consuming additional air interface resources in the PDSCH of the wireless connection, which can improve spectral efficiency of the wireless communication system. Alternatively, the UE transmits a first portion of the data-bits or the control-bits using the uplink transmission configuration parameter scheduled by the base station and with the indication of CUM use on the uplink to the base station.
Thus, the UE uses CUM on the uplink to convey additional data-bits or control-bits to the base station without consuming additional air interface resources on the uplink.
[0104] FIG. 13 illustrates an example method 1300 for transmitting data to a user equipment with control information-based index modulation. At 1305, a base station (e.g. base station 121) receives CUM capability information from a UE (e.g., UE 111, UE 112, UE 113, or UE 114). Optionally at 1310, the base station transmits a CUM codebook to the UE. For example, if the UE does not have a CUM codebook or has a CUM codebook that has been deprecated, the base station may send the CUM codebook, a CUM table, or CUM data-bit overlay to the UE for use in CUM operations. At 1315, the base station transmits an indication of a CUM configuration to the UE. Based on the CUM capability information of the UE, the base station may select the CUM configuration for the UE. The operations 1305, 1310, and/or 1315 may be implemented as described with operation 830 of FIG. 8 to establish the CUM configuration for the UE.
[0105] At 1320, the base station modulates a first portion of data for transmission to the UE. In some cases, the base station modulates a first number of coded bits or bits of information that are pending transmission to the UE (e.g., operation 1210 of FIG. 12). At 1325, the base station determines control information for a transmission configuration parameter or field of a PDCCH that corresponds to a second portion of the data (e.g., operation 1215 of FIG. 12 or BeamID_53 of FIG. 6). The CUM capability information may be exchanged or used as described with operation 810 of FIG. 8.
[0106] At 1330, the base station determines whether the transmission configuration parameter with the corresponding control information supports communication with the UE. In some cases, the base station may determine whether a selected beam index or selected antenna port can be used to communicate with the UE on the downlink. For example, a selected beam may have a desired beam index or beam identifier but may correlate to a physical beam direction that will not reach the UE. In aspects, the base station may determine a candidate set of control information for a transmission configuration parameter (e.g., beam index, CSI-RS state, or antenna port) that enables downlink communications to the UE. Thus, the base station may compare the selected control information that corresponds to the second portion of the data with a candidate set of control information to determine whether to enable or disable CUM for a particular downlink communication to the UE.
[0107] At 1335, the base station transmits the first portion of the data to the UE with CUM to convey the first portion of the data in the data channel and the second portion of the data using the control channel. By transmitting the modulation symbols of the first portion of the data using the transmission configuration parameter or PDCCH field in accordance with CUM, the base station is able to convey the second portion of the data to the UE via the control information in
the PDDCH (e.g., DCI, TCI). By so doing, the base station is able to convey the additional information to the UE without consuming more PDSCH resources, which can improve spectral efficiency of communication between the base station and the UE.
[0108] At 1340, the base station transmits the first portion of the data to the UE without CUM to convey the first portion of the data to the UE. As described with respect to operation 1330, the base station may not be able to schedule the downlink communication to the UE with the control information of the transmission configuration parameter or PDCCH field that corresponds to the second portion of the data. In such cases, the base station may transmit the first portion of the data to the UE in the PDSCH without CUM and/or transmit additional data to the UE during another slot or subframe.
[0109] FIG. 14 illustrates example method 1400 for transmitting data to multiple user equipment (that is, multiple items of user equipment, UEs) with control information-based index modulation. At 1405, abase station (e.g. base station 121) assigns respective CUM configurations to multiple UEs (e.g., UE 111, UE 112, UE 113, or UE 114), such as described with reference to operation 830 of FIG. 9. The base station may assign different respective CUM configurations to the UEs or assign a same CUM configuration to at least two of the UEs. At 1410, the base station modulates respective data for transmission to the multiple UEs (e.g., operation 1320 of FIG. 13). Generally, the base station may modulate, for each of the multiple UEs, a first number of coded bits that are pending transmission to the UE.
[0110] At 1415, the base station determines respective CIIM-enabled transmission configuration parameters for additional data bits pending transmission to the multiple UEs (e.g., operation 1325 of FIG. 13). The base station then determines whether control information of the respective transmission configuration parameters support communication with respective ones of the multiple UEs (e.g., operation 1330 of FIG. 13). When the CIIM-enabled transmission configuration parameter is not available to use for communication with one of the UEs, the base station may disable CUM on the downlink to that UE. At 1420, the base station schedules transmission of the modulated data for some of the multiple UEs using the CIIM-enabled transmission configuration parameters (e.g., operation 1220 of FIG. 12).
[0111] At 1425, the base station transmits the respective modulated data to some of the multiple UEs using the control information selected in accordance with the CUM configurations of the UEs (e.g., operation 1225 of FIG. 12). At 1430, the base station transmits the respective modulated data to others of the multiple UEs without CIIM-enabled downlink communications. As described with respect to operation 1420, the base station may not be able to assign or use CIIM-enabled transmission configuration parameters for downlink communications to these other UEs.
[0112] FIG. 15 illustrates an example method 1500 for decoding a downlink communication that includes data modulated in accordance with aspects of control information- based index modulation. At 1505, a UE (e.g., UE 111, UE 112, UE 113, or UE 114) receives a downlink communication from a base station (e.g., base station 121). As described herein, the CIIM-enabled downlink to the UE includes the first portion of data modulated at the PHY layer in the PDSCH and the second portion of data modulated with CUM through control information in the PDCCH.
[0113] At 1510, the UE determines that the downlink communication includes a first portion of data in a data channel and a second portion of data modulated with CUM. For example, the UE may determine whether a predefined bit in the DCI or PDCCH is set by the base station to indicate that CUM is enabled for a corresponding PDSCH. At 1515, the UE determines control information of a CIIM-enabled transit configuration parameter of the downlink control channel. Based on a CUM configuration of the UE (e.g., as assigned at operations 1310 and/or 1315 of FIG. 13), the UE can identify or extract control information from the transmission configuration parameter or control field of the PDDCH that corresponds to the CUM table or CUM bit-overlay assigned to the UE.
[0114] At 1520, the UE decodes the second portion of the data from the control channel based on the control information of the CIIM-enabled transmission configuration parameter. In aspects, the UE determines the bit values associated with the control information of the downlink communication to the UE by using its assigned CUM codebook, CUM table, or CUM bit-overlay (e.g., operation 850 of FIG. 8). At 1525, the UE decodes the first portion of the data from the data channel of the downlink communication. To illustrate, the UE can decode the data from the PHY - layer modulation symbols in the PDSCH of the downlink communication (e.g., operation 855 of FIG. 8). As described herein, the UE may then append or prepend the decoded CUM bits to the data bits carried in the PDSCH to reconstruct the user plane information sent by the base station.
[0115] FIG. 16 illustrates an example method for implementing control information-based index modulation with an uplink communication in accordance with one or more aspects. In the example method, a UE (e.g., UE 110) implements CUM to convey additional information to a base station 120 (e.g., base station 120) using an indicator in a PUCCH or PUSCH of an air interface between the base station and the UE. At 1605, a UE (e.g., UE 111, UE 112, UE 113, or UE 114) determines information for transmission to a base station (e.g., base station 121). The information may include data-bits or control-bits pending transmission to the base station.
[0116] At 1610, the UE determines whether a CUM codebook 216 is available for transmitting a second portion of the information. The CUM codebook or an uplink CUM codebook may be pre-stored at the UE or transferred as part of a CUM configuration provided by
the base station. When a CUM codebook is available for the UE to use for implementing CUM on uplink communications, then the flow proceeds to operation 1615 of the method 1600. Otherwise, the UE advances to 1620 and transmits the first portion of the information to the base station without CUM. When transmitting an uplink communication without CUM at 1620, the UE modulates and transmits the first portion of the information to the base station without a CUM indicator in the PUCCH or PUSCH. Thus, the non-CIIM uplink communication includes the first portion of the information (e.g., control-bits or data-bits), and the method returns to operation 1605 to schedule transmission of the second portion of the information to the base station in another uplink slot or subframe.
[0117] At 1615, the determines, based on the CUM codebook, uplink control information that is useful to convey the second portion of the information to the base station. The UE may determine (e.g., operation 1015 or operation 1040 of FIG. 10) uplink control information with CIIM-coded bit values that correspond to the second portion of the information (e.g., control-bits or data-bits). At 1625, the UE determines whether the control information useful to convey the second portion of the information aligns with currently assigned control information of the UE. Alternatively, the UE can determine whether the CIIM-coded bit values of the currently assigned uplink control information or uplink configuration of the UE align with coded bits of the second portion of information. When the currently assigned uplink control information of the UE aligns with the control information useful to convey the second portion of the information to the base station, then the flow proceeds to operation 1630 of the method 1600. Otherwise, the UE advances to 1620 and transmits the first portion of the information to the base station without CUM in response to determining that the currently assigned uplink control information is not useful to convey the additional information on the uplink using CUM.
[0118] At 1630, the UE modulates a first portion of the information to provide modulation symbols that correspond to the first portion of the information. As described herein, the UE can modulate the first portion of information as modulation symbols or signal constellations for transmission to the base station in the PUCCH or PUSCH as control-bits or data-bits, respectively. At 1635, the UE indicates use of CUM to the base station in an uplink communication, such as describe with reference to operation 1020 or operation 1045 of FIG. 10. At 1640, the UE transmits the modulation symbols to the base station with the CUM indication to convey the first portion of the information and the second portion of the information to the base station (e.g., operation 1025 or operation 1050 of FIG. 10). Based on the CUM indication, the base station can decode the additional control-bits or data-bits that the UE conveys on the uplink using CUM.
[0119] FIG. 17 illustrates an example of conveying data-bits to a wireless receiver using a data-bit overlay for control information in accordance with one or more aspects. In the example
method, a wireless transmitter may implement control information-based index modulation using the data-bit overlay to convey data to the wireless receiver without using additional resources of a data channel (PDSCH) of a wireless link between the wireless transmitter and the wireless receiver.
[0120] At 1705, a wireless transmitter selects (e.g., a base station 120), for a wireless receiver (e.g., a UE 110), a data-bit overlay for a set of control-bits of a control channel field. The data-bit overlay may map or overlay coded bit values to combinations of control-bits of the control channel field or transmission configuration parameter a physical control channel of a wireless link between the wireless transmitter and the wireless receiver. At 1710, the wireless transmitter sends an indication of the data-bit overlay to the wireless receiver. The wireless transmitter can send the indication of the selected data-bit overlay by communicating one or more RRC messages with the wireless receiver to set the data-bit overlay as part of a CUM configuration of the wireless receiver (e.g., CUM bit-overlay settings for the UE).
[0121] At 1715, the wireless transmitter determines data for transmission to the wireless receiver. The wireless receiver may evaluate a queue or buffer of data-bits pending transmission to the wireless receiver to determine a first portion of the data to send in a data channel and a second portion of the data to send in the control channel using the selected data-bit overlay. In some cases, the wireless transmitter apportions the first portion and second portion of the data based on a number of coded bits that can be conveyed using the data-bit overlay. For example, when seven bits of data are pending transmission to the wireless receiver and the bit-overlay enables encoding of five bit values, the wireless transmitter may select two bits for the first portion of the data and select the remaining bits as the second portion of the data to efficiently convey the data pending transmission to the wireless receiver.
[0122] At 1720, the wireless transmitter modulates a first portion of the data for transmission in a data channel. In aspects, the wireless transmitter modulates a first portion of the data (e.g., first coded bits, MSB bits, or LSB bits) as modulation symbols or signal constellations at a PHY layer of a wireless link between the base station and the UE. At 1725, the wireless transmitter determines a corresponding set of control-bits within the data-bit overlay for a second portion of the data. To use the data-bit overlay, the base station modulates a second portion of the data-bits (e.g., second coded bits, LSB bits, or MSB bits) by selecting, based on a bit value of a second portion of the data, the control-bits for a transmission configuration parameter or PDCCH field that is used to transmit the modulation symbols to the UE. At 1730, the wireless transmitter schedules transmission of the first portion of the data with a control channel field using the set of control-bits of the data-bit overlay that correspond to the second portion of the data. Thus, the wireless transmitter can schedule transmission of the modulation symbols or signal constellations
of the first data using a transmission configuration parameter with control information or control- bits that correspond to the second portion of the data.
[0123] At 1735, the wireless transmitter indicates use of the data-bit overlay with another control bit of the communication, such as described with reference to operation 1120 or operation 1145 of FIG. 11. At 1740, the wireless transmitter transmits the communication to the wireless receiver in accordance with the set of control-bits to convey the first portion of the data in the data channel and the second portion of the data using the data-bit overlay. Generally, the modulation symbols or signal constellations of the communication convey the first portion of data via the data channel (e.g., PDSCH or PUSCH) of the wireless link between the wireless transmitter and wireless receiver. Additionally, the set of control-bits of the transmission configuration parameter or control channel field conveys the second portion of data using the physical control channel (e.g., PDCCH or PUCCH) of the wireless link. As such, the wireless transmitter is able to convey additional bits of information or data to the wireless receiver in the control channel without consuming additional air interface resources in the data channel of the wireless link, which can improve spectral efficiency of the wireless communication system.
