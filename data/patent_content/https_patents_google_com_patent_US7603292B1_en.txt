- Membership information can also include information about the rate and frequency that a member profile gains associations to other member profiles.
- a member profile may contain consumer information. Consumer information may include the frequency, patterns, types, or number of purchases the member makes, or information about which advertisers or sponsors the member has accessed, patronized, or used.
- a member profile may comprise data stored in memory.
- the profile in addition to comprising data about the member, can also comprise data relating to others.
- a member profile can contain an identification of associations or virtual links with other member profiles.
- a member's social network member profile may comprise a hyperlink associated with another member's profile. In one such association, the other member's profile may contain a reciprocal hyperlink associated with the first member's profile.
- a member's profile may also contain information excerpted from another associated member's profile, such as a thumbnail image of the associated member, his or her age, marital status, and location, as well as an indication of the number of members with which the associated member is associated.
- a member's profile may comprise a list of other social network members' profiles with which the member wishes to be associated.
- An association may be designated manually or automatically.
- a member may designate associated members manually by selecting other profiles and indicating an association that can be recorded in the member's profile.
- an association between two profiles may comprise an association automatically generated in response to a predetermined number of common entries, aspects, or elements in the two members' profiles.
- a member profile may be associated with all of the other member profiles comprising a predetermined number or percentage of common entries, such as interests, hobbies, likes, dislikes, employers and/or habits.
- Associations between profiles within a social network can be of a single type or can be multiple types and can include, for example, friendship associations, business associations, family associations, community associations, school associations, or any other suitable type of link between profiles. Associations can further be weighted to represent the strength of the association. For example, a friendship association can be weighted more than a school association. Each type of association can have various levels with different weights associated with each level. For example, a friendship association can be classified according to which of a plurality of friendship association levels it belongs to. In one embodiment, a friendship association may be assigned a level by the member from a list of levels comprising: a best friend, a good friend, a regular friend, an acquaintance, and a friend the member has not met.
- the edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 shown comprise associations between profiles.
- the social network 200 comprises a plurality of differing types of associations represented by edges 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 .
- the types of associations shown in FIG. 2 for illustration purposes are business associations, activity partner associations, friendship associations, community associations, and common characteristic associations.
- Common characteristic associations may include, for example, associations based on some characteristic, such as attending the same high school or being from the same hometown, and can indicate a lower level of significance than another type of association, such as a friendship association.
- edge 220 and edge 222 each comprise an association between profile A at vertex 202 and profile D at vertex 208 .
- the edge 220 represents a business association
- the edge 222 represents a friendship association.
- Profile A is also associated with profile E by a common characteristic association comprising edge 218 .
- the association between profile A and profile E may be more attenuated than the association between profile A and D, but the association can still be represented by the social network depicted in FIG. 2 .
- Each member represented by the profiles A, B, C, D, E, F, and G comprising the vertices 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 , respectively, for purposes of illustration, comprises a person.
- Other types of members can be in social network 200 .
- communities, special interest groups, organizations, political parties, universities, and legal persons, such as corporations and business partnerships may be members of the social network 200 .
- the associations 218 , 220 , 222 , 224 , 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 , and 234 illustrated in FIG. 2 comprise bi-directional associations.
- An association between two profiles may comprise a bi-directional association when both parties to the association are associated with each other.
- profile A is associated with profile D
- profile D is also associated with profile A.
- profiles A and D will not be bi-directionally associated with each other until both profiles consent to such an association.
- profile A may invite profile D to be associated therewith, and the bi-directional association occurs upon profile D's acceptance of such invitation.
- the invitation may include sending an email or other message to profile D indicating that profile A has requested an association with profile D.
- Directed associations can associate a first profile with a second profile while not requiring the second profile to be associated with the first profile.
- profile A can be associated by a friendship association with profile B, and profile B can be unassociated with profile A, or profile B can be associated with profile A through a different type of association, such as a business association.
- a display of profile A's friends would include profile B, but a display of profile B's friends would not include profile A.
- a degree of separation can be determined for associated profiles.
- a degree of separation between two profiles can be determined the fewest number of edges of a certain type separating the associated profiles.
- a type-specific degree of separation may be determined.
- a type-specific degree of separation comprises a degree of separation determined based on one particular type of association. For example, a profile A has a friend association degree of separation of two from profile E. The fewest number of friendship associations between profile A and profile E is two—the friendship association comprising edge 222 between profiles A and D and the friendship association comprising edge 234 between profiles D and E.
- the degree of friendship separation determined according to one aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, is two.
- a common characteristic degree of separation can be determined by determining the fewest number of common characteristic associations separating profile A and profile E.
- the common characteristic association degree of separation is one.
- the common characteristic in this example can be that profile A attended the same high school as profile E.
- a common characteristic association may be selected by profiles A and E to represent that they are associated in some fashion, but to not create a close association, such as with a friendship association.
- the degree of separation may be determined by use of a weighting factor assigned to each association. For example, close friendships can be weighted higher than more distant friendships. According to certain aspects of embodiments using a weighting factor, a higher weighting factor for an association can reduce the degree of separation between profiles and lower weighting factors can increase the degree of separation. This can be accomplished, for example, by establishing an inverse relationship between each associations and a corresponding weighting factor prior to summing the associations. Thus, highly weighted associations would contribute less to the resulting sum than lower weighted associations.
- Methods according to the present invention may be implemented by, for example, a processor-executable program code stored on a computer-readable medium.
- one embodiment according to the present invention comprises identifying gift interest data from a person wishing to create a gift registry, and then automatically generating a gift registry comprising a gift indicator associated with the gift interest data.
- Gift interest data comprises data associated with a gift of interest or possible interest.
- the gift interest data may comprise, for example, a gift category comprising a gift included in the gift registry and other similar gifts, an attribute of the gift included in the gift registry, or a specified product or service a registrant wishes to receive as a gift.
- a gift category comprises a category reflecting one or more possible gifts. Examples of gift categories comprise toys, games, jewelry, wall art, electronic devices, clothing, etc.
- a gift attribute comprises an attribute of a gift.
- gift attributes comprise luxurious, practical, requires batteries, non-violent, loud, brightly colored, suitable for children, etc.
- Gift interest data comprising a specified product may comprise a particular brand and model number the registrant know he or she would like to receive.
- An example of gift interest data comprising a specified service may comprise a one-hour massage with a particular massage therapist.
- a gift indicator comprises data indicating or identifying, at least in part, a gift.
- a gift indicator may comprise, for example, a text description of a gift, a thumbnail image of a gift, and/or a product or merchant number or SKU associated with a gift.
- the social network engine 120 may identify (e.g., receive) gift interest data.
- the gift interest data may be generated by the user 112 a.
- the user 112 a may input his or her gift interests and preferences into a user interface on the client device 102 a by modifying or creating a member profile associated with the user 112 a on the social network engine 120 .
- These input interests and preferences may be output as gift interest data to the social network engine 120 over the network 106 .
- identifying the gift interest data may comprise implicitly generating the gift interest data based upon the member profile associated with the user 112 a and stored in the social network database 130 .
- the sex, age, interests, and hobbies the user 112 a has previously provided for his or her member profile may be used to identify or suggest categories, types, or attributes of gifts, and specific products and services that the user 112 a may find appealing, desirable or useful.
- the social network engine 120 may then store the gift interest data in the social network database 130 .
- the social network engine 120 may generate and output a request signal.
- a request signal comprises a signal, such as data, indicating a request.
- the request signal may indicate a request for permission to add a proposed gift to the gift registry.
- the social network engine 120 may output a request to the user 112 a over the network 106 to make a decision about the acceptability of a proposed gift associated with the gift interest data input by the user 112 a. If the proposed gift is acceptable to the user 112 a, he or she may respond to the request signal by sending a reply signal indicating that the proposed gift should be included in the gift registry. The social network engine 120 may then add the proposed gift to the gift registry. Conversely, if the proposed gift is unacceptable to the user 112 a, he or she may respond with a reply signal indicating that the proposed gift should be excluded from the gift registry.
- One embodiment may further comprise identifying an audience criterion.
- An audience criterion comprises a criterion indicating an audience (or audiences) of inclusion or exclusion.
- the user associated with the gift registry may provide an audience criterion.
- the audience criterion may represent, for example, the audience to which the provider of the gift interest data wishes to display the resulting gift registry, or parts of the resulting gift registry.
- the audience criterion may comprise, for example, a degree of separation, such as a type-specific degree of separation. For instance, a registrant represented by node A ( 202 ) in FIG. 2 , may require that only those people separated by a single degree of separation may view the gift registry.
- gift givers as represented by nodes B-G ( 204 - 214 ) would either be permitted to view the gift registry if they are within one degree of separation, or would be unable to do so if separated from node A 202 by more than one degree of separation.
- the gift givers represented by nodes B, C, D, and E 204 - 210 would be able to view the gift registry, but the gift givers represented by nodes G and F 212 , 214 would not.
- the audience criterion may comprise whether the potential gift registry viewer has a first degree of separation that is business related. In an embodiment employing such a type-specific degree of separation audience criterion, only the potential gift registry viewers represented by nodes B and D 204 , 208 would be able to view the gift registry.
- the audience criterion may comprise an association, such as a bi-directional association, or a directed association. In an embodiment employing a directed association, only social network members that have identified the registrant as a social network friend, and whom the registrant has identified as a social network friend would be permitted to view the gift registry.
- a person considering purchasing a gift for the user who initiated the gift registry may access a computer interface connected to the network. This interface may facilitate the sending of an inquiry signal indicating an interest in viewing all or part of the user's gift registry.
- an audience criterion may be used to evaluate a received inquiry signal.
- the received inquiry signal may be evaluated for satisfaction of the audience criterion, and the gift registry may be output if the inquiry signal satisfies the audience criterion.
- a potential gift registry viewer comprising a social network member may generate the inquiry signal.
- the social network member may be viewing the registrant's publicly viewable member profile information, and may become aware that the registrant has a gift registry associated with him or her.
- the social network member may request access to the gift registry with an inquiry signal that may comprise clicking on an icon associated with opening the gift registry.
- the social network engine 120 may then evaluate the inquiry signal for satisfaction of the previously identified audience criterion. For example, in an embodiment employing a degree of separation or an association for an audience criterion, the social network engine 120 may ascertain the source of the inquiry signal. The social network engine 120 may then determine whether the source of the inquiry signal satisfies the identified audience criterion. If the source of the inquiry signal satisfies the audience criterion, the gift registry will be output to the originator of the inquiry signal. If the source of the inquiry signal does not satisfy the audience criterion, the gift registry will not be output to the originator of the inquiry signal.
- Certain embodiments of the present invention may include the use of advertisements associated with the gift interest data, or with a gift on the gift registry.
- one embodiment may further comprise generating an advertisement based on the gift interest data. The generated advertisement may then be output with the gift registry.
- a retailer, vendor, distributor, or manufacturer of a gift included in the gift registry may be contacted to ascertain whether it would like to advertise to those viewing the gift registry, and for a fee, a pertinent advertisement may be output with the gift registry to the originator of the inquiry signal.
- the gift registry may be output to a plurality of vendors, and the plurality of vendors may submit price bids for various gifts associated with gift indicators associated with the gift registry. In such an embodiment, the lowest price bid submitted may be output with the gift registry to allow a viewer of the gift registry a convenient method of finding which vendor has the lowest price for a particular gift.
- the usefulness of a gift registry may be increased in certain embodiments by sending timely reminders about the registrant's upcoming life events to his or her friends and contacts on the social network.
- an embodiment may further comprise generating and outputting a reminder signal.
- a reminder signal comprises a signal, such as data, to remind a recipient of the reminder signal about an upcoming life event of the registrant.
- a reminder signal may be generated and output a set period of time before a registrant's birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion, allowing enough time for the reminder signal recipients to purchase a gift found on the gift registry.
- the reminder signal may be output to a prescribed group of friends or contacts on the social network that the registrant has previously selected for receipt.
- the reminder signal may be output in association with the audience criterion.
- only social network members able to view the registrant's gift registry may receive a reminder signal.
- the reminder signal may comprise a pointer to the gift registry or to a gift on the gift registry.
- the reminder signal may comprise an email message sent to the designated recipient's preferred email account.
- Such a reminder signal may comprise a hyperlink pointer to the gift registry or to a particular gift on the gift registry. Once the reminder signal recipient clicks on the hyperlink, he or she may be able to view the registrant's gift registry on a web browser application.
- the gift registry may be updated in certain embodiments to reflect the purchase of gifts therein.
- the social network engine 120 may receive a purchase signal, and the gift registry may be altered to reflect the purchase signal.
- a purchase signal comprises a signal, such as data, indicating activity associated with a gift associated with a gift indicator on the gift registry.
- the purchase signal may comprise an indication from a viewer of the gift registry that he or she will be purchasing, or has purchased a gift on the gift registry.
- the purchase signal may be generated by the vendor in response to a consummation of a purchase transaction.

- the gift interest data may comprise a combination of different types of data, such as a gift categories, gift attributes, and specified products and services.
- the gift interest data may comprise an indication that one gift the user 112 a is interested in adding to his or her gift registry comprises a Fisher Price® red toy boat.
- the social network engine 120 may then generate a gift registry.
- the generated gift registry will comprise at least one gift that is associated with the gift interest data.
- the matching processor 122 may attempt to match the identified gift interest data with gifts having as many of the requested features, attributes, and aspects specified as possible.
- the social network engine 120 may perform a search of an information network, such as the Internet, or a search of an index of gifts popular with other members of a social network stored in the social network database 130 to find the best gift for the current user 112 a in light of the gift interest data.
- the gift registry may comprise a web page article associated with a member profile of a member of a social network.
- the gift registry may also comprise a list text descriptions, each accompanied by a thumbnail image of the desired gift and a hyperlinks, each such hyperlink associated with a vendor site accessible over the network 106 that sells the gift.
- the method 300 further comprises identifying an audience criterion.
- the audience criterion may be generated by the user 112 a wishing to generate a gift registry by inputting and sending to the social network engine 120 a criterion for those who may view all or a portion of his or her gift registry.
- the social network engine 120 may identify the audience criterion.
- the audience criterion may comprise, for example, a requirement that only those members of the social network that have one degree of separation from the registrant user 112 a may view the gift registry.
- the audience criterion may comprise a requirement that a potential viewer of the gift registry who generates an inquiry signal share a common characteristic with the registrant, for instance, that they both have the same wedding anniversary date.
- the method 300 shown in FIG. 3 further comprises receiving an inquiry signal as shown by block 308 .
- the inquiry signal may be generated by a user 112 b of a client device 102 b in communication with the network 106 .
- the user 112 b may comprise a member of the same social network that the user 112 a is a member of.
- the user 112 b wishing to view the gift registry may have been alerted to the presence of the registrant user's 112 a gift registry by a reminder signal generated and output by the social network engine 120 .
- the user 112 b may have become aware of the gift registry when viewing user's 112 a member profile available for viewing on the social network. The user 112 b may then generate an inquiry signal by clicking a hyperlink associated with the gift registry.
- the method 300 further comprises evaluating the received inquiry signal for satisfaction of the audience criterion set by the user 112 a as shown by block 310 .
- the matching processor 122 may identify the source of the inquiry signal and determine whether the originator of the inquiry signal satisfies the applicable audience criterion. If, as shown in block 312 , the inquiry signal does satisfy the audience criterion, the gift registry is output. The gift registry may be output as an HTTP document to the originator of the inquiry signal over the network 106 . If, as shown in block 314 , the inquiry signal does not satisfy the audience criterion, the gift registry will not be output. In this way, the registrant user 112 a may control access to the gift registry.
- only a portion of the gift registry may be subject to the audience criterion. In such an embodiment, only that portion of the gift registry subject to the audience criterion may be withheld from a potential viewer if the inquiry signal does not meet the audience criterion.
- FIG. 4 shows a flow diagram of a subroutine of the method of FIG. 3 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 shows a subroutine 302 that shows a method for generating a gift registry in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

- the member profile may comprise entries.
- the entries may comprise personal information about a member of a social network he or she is willing to make available to other members of the social network.
- the matching processor 122 may generate the gift interest data by associating the stated hobbies or interests, age, and location of a member as found in with his or her member profile with attributes or categories of gifts.
- the subroutine 302 further comprises searching an information network, such as the Internet, for a proposed gift associated with the implicitly generated gift interest data.
- the social network engine 120 further searches the information network for an on-line vendor that vends the proposed gift, and a price associated with the proposed gift.
- the social network engine may perform a search of the FroogleTM system using the implicitly generated gift interest data as a search query.
- the request signal comprises a request for permission to add the proposed gift to a gift registry.
- the request signal may comprise an automatically generated email message delivered to the inbox of the member of the social network's preferred email address.
- the request signal may further comprise a list of proposed gifts, vendors who carry the proposed gifts, and the lowest price currently associated with each respective proposed gift.
- the request signal may further comprise a plurality of virtual buttons the member may use to quickly and easily generate a reply signal.
- the generated request signal is then output to the member from whom the gift interest data was implicitly generated. For example, the request signal may be output over the network 106 to the client device 102 a the member user 112 a regularly uses.
- the member receiving the request signal is requested to evaluate the proposed gift associated with the gift interest data implicitly generated from the member's social network member profile. If, as shown in block 412 , the member responds positively to the proposed gift, and generates and outputs a reply signal indicating his or her acceptance of the proposed gift, it will be added to a gift registry associated with the member's social network member profile. If, as shown in block 414 , the proposed gift is not acceptable to the member, the proposed gift will not be added to the gift registry, and the social network engine 120 may then again search the information network for a new proposed gift associated with the implicitly generated gift interest data for the member as shown in block 404 . In another embodiment, the social network engine 120 may refrain from searching for a new proposed gift. In yet another embodiment, the social network processor 120 may perform a search for a new proposed gift after adding an acceptable gift to the gift registry.
