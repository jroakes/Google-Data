- the TBS/MCS component 705 and the TBS/MCS Table 709 may be stored on one, or more, computer readable media such as one or more flash memories, one or more Compact Disc's (CD's), one or more DVDs, on or more EEPROM's, etc, and may be transferred to and from various network entities such as eNBs, controllers and, with respect to FIG. 7 , mobile stations.
- the TBS/MCS component 705 and the TBS/MCS Table 709 may therefore be transported on such computer readable media and loaded into memory of various network entities and/or mobile devices as needed. Additionally, the TBS/MCS component 705 and the TBS/MCS Table 709 may be downloaded or uploaded via wireline (such as over the Internet) or via Over-the-Air (OTA) upgrades that may from time-to-time be performed to upgrade mobile stations (i.e. UEs) that access the network.
- OTA Over-the-Air
- a network operator may, via any suitable approach such as, but not limited to, OTA upgrades, provide the TBS/MCS component 705 and the TBS/MCS Table 709 to mobile stations of its service subscribers.
- OTA Over-the-Air
- the RB/MCS allocation component 625 and the TBS/MCS Table may be provided to a base station via any suitable approach including, but not limited to, uploading to or downloading from, a central storage point such as, for example, a Radio Operation and Maintenance Center (OMCR).
- OMCR Radio Operation and Maintenance Center
- FIG. 8 summarizes operation of a mobile station in accordance with the various embodiments.
- a mobile station receives a Downlink Control Information (DCI) element from a base station including an index.
- the index may be a set of bits contained in a bit map position of a grant message, or a scheduling and assignment message as was discussed previously with respect to FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- the mobile station determines the index as shown in 803 , which may include reading the index from predetermined bit positions of a bit map contained in a DCI element.
- the mobile station may then, in 805 , use the index to lookup an appropriate TBS and MCS to use in conjunction with the RB assignment, using for example, Table 500 illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- the mobile station has a priori knowledge of the TBS and appropriate MCS to be used corresponding to a PRB assignment from a base station.
- the mobile station may proceed to use the PRBs, that is, the assigned time-frequency resources, using the determined TBS and MCS.
- the mobile station will use the radio resource assignment information and any Table information which may include vocoder rate, modulation, or coding information.
- FIG. 9 which includes parts 9 a through 9 k , provides a single TBS/MCS table 900 , in accordance with an embodiment.
- table 900 is a 29-entry MCS table which provides a mobile station with a target code rate based on an MCS index position, shown in FIG. 9 as the leftmost column.
- the table 900 includes a 5-bit MCS index column with 3 reserved entries for modulation order signaling.
- the highest code rate is chosen as 0.92.
- various Channel Quality Indication (CQI) MCS values were taken as a starting point.
- CQI Channel Quality Indication
- MCS multiple MCS entries
- the second column labeled “modulation” indicates the modulation order
- the third column, “coding rate ⁇ 1024,” indicates the coding rate ⁇ 1024, and sixth column, “Code Rate,” indicates the target coding rate.
- the fifth column, “Comments,” contains comments as to how the particular spectral efficiency was obtained. As can be seen the last three rows of MCS entries (rows 29 , 30 and 31 ) may be reserved for other purposes.
- the TBS sizes utilized are aligned with QPP (Quadratic Polynomial Permutation) interleaver sizes and hence remove the need for insertion of filler bits.
- PCFICH (n) Physical Control Format Indicator Channel
- CP cyclic prefix
- the MCS table includes reuse for different system bandwidths, overall testing complexity is reduced, for example the MCS table section defined for 100 RB (20 MHz system bandwidth) is reused for the 25 RB case (5 MHz system bandwidth).
- the set of TB sizes for the 25 RB case are a subset of the TB sizes for the 110 RB case corresponding to columns 1 to 25 PRBs in the TBS/MCS table 900 .
- the physical layer first attaches a 24-bit CRC to each transport block received from the MAC layer.
- This CRC may be used at the receiver to verify correct reception and to generate the HARQ ACK/NACK feedback.
- FEC forward error correction
- the filler bits (if any) would then be placed in the first segment.
- the set of possible transport block sizes may be restricted such that the segmentation rule described above always results in a single interleaver size for each code block with no filler bits.
- a further 24-bit code block CRC is attached to each code block if the TB was split into two or more code blocks.
- the physical layer attaches no filler bits to the transport blocks or to the code blocks while there may be transport block CRC and code block CRC bits that are inserted by the physical layer. It is noted here that there may be some padding or header introduced at the MAC layer in forming the transport block.
- code block segmentation may be applied such that code blocks are substantially equal in size, including and taking into account any required CRC bits. That is, transport blocks may be divided as necessary to limit each code block to less than, or equal to, the number of bits suitable for the utilized FEC scheme.
- a downlink carrier supporting N PRBs that is, N downlink physical resource blocks, would require an N ⁇ 29 (number of rows ⁇ number of columns) MCS table that is invariant to subframe configuration.
- N control region size
- TBS Transport Block Size
- the CRC bits (TB CRC and code-block CRC) are considered part of the information bits for purposes of rate-computation.
- a mobile station may infer the TBS using the MCS table 900 via the RB allocation and the MCS index. The following provides an overview of the design procedure.
- the MCS Table may be generated for 100 PRBs (or up to 110 PRBs).
- the design begins with an initial set of TBS with maximum MAC (Medium Access Control) padding limited to 3% (spacing between adjacent sizes, i.e., worst case padding).
- the padding in the lower TBS range is higher due to the QPP interleaver granularity. All the sizes in the set may be such that no filler bits or padding are attached to the transport blocks or to the code blocks as explained above.
- the set of some common MAC payload sizes are also included in this initial set.
- common MAC payload sizes include buffer status report: 1 or 3 bytes, RACH (Random Access Channel): 9 bytes, RACH response: 7 bytes or 1+N*6 where N is the number of mobile stations being responded to, TCP ACK ( ⁇ 1+3+1 or 2+3+1 or 5 ⁇ 6 bytes), SID: 15 bytes, Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) vocoder 7.95 Kbps: 29 bytes, AMR 12.2 Kbps: 40 bytes.
- Exemplary MAC sizes included in the design include 16, 24, 40, 48, 56, 72, 104, 120, 152, 200, 232, 248, 296, 320, 344, 392, 440, 488 and 536.
- the TBSs for smaller RB allocations may be modified.
- the TBSs from the initial set that do not appear in the MCS table are pruned away, and the frequency of each TBS in the MCS table is recorded.
- a higher frequency (or number of occurrences) enables flexibility in scheduling the TBS with different resources on a retransmission. Except for some small TBSs, the frequency is reasonably high, thus allowing good flexibility.
- the frequency of preferred TBS (for example 320) may be increased, and the padding percentage may also be adjusted, by modifying MCS table entries.
- the single N ⁇ 29 MCS table can be used for all possible DL subframe configurations, e.g., for all 18 or more DL subframe configurations (different number of Transmit antennas, different PCFICH values, etc). Some table entries are blocked for certain subframe configurations, for example coding rate drops below minimum TBS. The same table can be used as much as possible for the uplink also.
- the same MCS table may be used for downlink and uplink in both TDD and FDD. To achieve this, some decimation (such as deleting RBs that are not multiples of 2, 3 or 5) may be required for the uplink. However, most embodiments will utilize the MCS table, modified as needed, for the uplink as well as the downlink. It is possible to change the modulation order associated with the rows (without changing the spectral efficiency of the entry) of the MCS/TBS table for the uplink to better adapt the table for the uplink SC-FDMA scheme.
- FIG. 10 summaries operation of a mobile station in accordance with the embodiments using the table 900 illustrated in FIG. 9 .
- the mobile station in 1001 receives the resource block (RB) assignment information and the MCS index in a downlink message.
- the mobile station accesses the table 900 and determines its transport block size using its RB assignment and the MCS index.
- FIG. 11 summarizes the procedure for generation of the MCS table 900 as described above.
- a reference subframe configuration is determined and in 1103 TBSs are generated for various numbers of resource block allocations. The TBS sizes are selected in 1103 to reduce or eliminate the need for filler bits.
- the TBSs are assigned per RB allocation in the table. Duplicate TBSs are detected in 1107 and from 1109 , this process is completed for each set of resource block allocations until the table is completed.
- FIG. 12 illustrates an alternative embodiment using a second table 1200 for modulation order and TBS Index determination.
- the MCS Index 1201 may be used to retrieve a modulation order 1203 and a TBS index 1205 .
- the MCS table 900 may then be accessed using the TBS index 1205 in some embodiments.
- the RB allocation for computing the TBS may be interpreted as either a per-subframe number of RBs or per-bundle number of RBs, etc.
- the systematic TBS/MCS table with 110 columns (one per RB) available for the non-bundling case may also be reused to find the TBS for the bundling case.
- the embodiments provide three alternatives for using the MCS table 900 for the bundling case, that is, assuming nRB_subframe is the number of RBs allocated to the scheduled mobile station in one subframe of the bundle.
- a third approach which also allows code rates greater than one in a subframe of a bundle, determines the TBS from the non-bundling TBS/MCS table 900 , using the MCS index+dummy number of RBs (for example, (nRB_subframe ⁇ offset)).
- the single layer TBS/MCS table may be re-used.
- a transport block is mapped to 10 PRB allocation with 2 layers, it is effectively mapped to 20 RBs (10 RBs in the first transmission layer, and 10 RBs in the second transmission layer).
- a two layer transport block i.e. transport blocks mapped to two layers
- One simple way of extending the MCS/TBS table is as follows: for a given MCS index and RB allocation, first determine the one-layer TBS using the MCS/TBS table as described previously. Then, define a mapping table that maps each one-layer TBS to a two-layer TBS which is approximately twice the one-layer TBS, the two-layer TBS using the transport block sizes already defined in the one-layer TBS table. If the two layer TBS exceeds twice maximum TBS in the one-layer design, additional TBSs may be defined which still follow the TBS design principles (no filler bits, same size code blocks, adjustments for CRC parity bits, etc). An example of such a TBS mapping is shown in FIG. 13 Table 1300 .
- the two-layer TBS is determined from the single layer TBS/MCS table 900 using the MCS index and two times the number of RBs allocations.
- the one layer TBS is determined based on the MCS Index+PRB allocation and it is then mapped to a two-layer TBS by a table lookup.
- the one-layer to two-layer TBS table can be shortened by removing some of the unused rows of table 1300 . While it is not shown explicitly, the above approach can be extended to transport blocks that are mapped to more than two layers. It is also noted that the RB scaling approach for one-layer to two-layer TBS mapping using the TBS/MCS tables can also be used for assigning TBS to shortened RBs, wherein the RBs may comprise of a smaller number of REs.
- the TBS may be determined using the (0.5*x) PRB allocation and using the TBS/MCS table.
- the scaling appropriately matches the TBS so that the resulting MCS index closely matches the original MCS index.
- the five-bit MCS index to modulation order mapping can be made variable, for example, a function of the number of PRBs.
- Three entries of the MCS table may be reserved for implicit modulation order signaling or implicit redundancy version signaling.
- Each MCS entry in the table is therefore populated by a TBS and the table entries are accessed based on a 5-bit MCS index and resource allocation information (number of PRBs) signaled via a DCI element that may be contained in a scheduling message, which may be a grant or assignment message.
- the methods and apparatuses further provide that a 5-bit MCS field for each transport block is included in the scheduling assignment/grant message which, along with the resource allocation information (#PRBs), enables the mobile station or UE to determine the scheduled TBS.
- the exemplary embodiments provided herein describe a five-bit MCS signaling, other embodiments may utilize more than five, or fewer than five, MCS bits to expand or shorten the TBS tables.
- the various embodiments described herein may be applied to various systems such as LTE-Advanced systems, for example in carrier aggregation, where multiple transport blocks are mapped to multiple carriers.
- the TBS/MCS table can be applied to the aggregated carriers (combining all the RBs from the different carriers) or to each carrier separately, or to a subset of the carriers.
- an aggregated transport block may be defined wherein the aggregated transport block comprises one or more transport blocks (that are compatible with the one-layer and two-layer TBS design) with an additional CRC parity check on the aggregated transport block.
- This is similar to defining a new segmentation rule at the MAC or physical layer, such that the segments are compatible with the Rel-8 transport block sizes.
- the method and apparatuses of the embodiments herein disclosed may be used for other uplink modulation schemes such as DFT-SOFDM with non-contiguous resource allocations on the uplink or OFDMA on the uplink.
