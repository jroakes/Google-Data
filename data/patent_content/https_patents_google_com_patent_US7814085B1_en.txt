Definitions
- the invention relates in general to search result scoring and, in particular, to a system and method for determining a composite score for categorized search results.
- Web Worldwide Web
- the Web provides information via interconnected Web pages that can be navigated through embedded hyperlinks.
- the Web provides desktop access to a virtually unlimited library of information in almost every language.
- the Web has proven particularly helpful in facilitating on-line shopping by providing easy access to helpful information and to resources often unavailable in a conventional “brick and mortar” store.
- Web content searching not all Web content is equally retrievable. For instance, some types of Web content are esoteric and may be referenced so infrequently that relatively few hyperlinks are available for a search engine to identify and exploit. Similarly, other types of Web content, such as advertisements, are short-lived and can change frequently, often making retrieval a matter of timing, rather than based on quality of match. Still other types of Web content, especially advertisements, are highly repetitive and duplicate a significant amount of content between individual Web pages.

- a plurality of individual clients 12 are communicatively interfaced to a server 11 via an internetwork 10 , such as the Internet, or other form of communications network, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.
- the individual clients 12 are operated by users 19 who transact requests for Web content, news messages, advertisements, other types of content, and other operations through their respective client 12 .
- Each client 12 can be any form of computing platform connectable to a network, such as the internetwork 10 , and capable of interacting with application programs.
- exemplary examples of individual clients include, without limitation, personal computers, digital assistants, “smart” cellular telephones and pagers, lightweight clients, workstations, “dumb” terminals interfaced to an application server, and various arrangements and configurations thereof, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.
- the internetwork 10 includes various topologies, configurations, and arrangements of network interconnectivity components arranged to interoperatively couple with enterprise, wide area and local area networks and include, without limitation, conventionally wired, wireless, satellite, optical, and equivalent network technologies, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.
- each client 12 executes a Web browser or news reader application 18 (“Browser/Reader”).
- Web content 24 is requested via a Web server 20 executing on the server 11 .
- news messages (“News Msgs”) 25 are posted and retrieved via a news server 21 also executing on the server 11 .
- advertisements (“Ads”) 26 are provided with the Web content 24 , news messages 25 , and other content 27 via an advertisement server (“Ad Server”) 22 also executing on the server 11 .
- Ad Server advertisement server
- Other types of server functionality can be provided, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. Note the Web browsing, news reading, and advertising functions could also be implemented separately as stand alone applications.
- the server 11 maintains an attached storage device 15 in which the Web content 24 , news messages 25 , advertisements 26 , and other content 27 (collectively referred to as simply “content 28 ”) are stored.
- the content 28 could also be maintained remotely on other Web and news servers (not shown) interconnected either directly or indirectly via the internetwork 10 and which are preferably accessible by each client 12 .
- a search engine 23 executes on the server 11 for processing queries for content 28 .
- Each query is meant to describe or otherwise identify information potentially retrievable via either the Web server 20 or other servers.
- the information can include other information also determined to be relevant to the query.
- each query provides characteristics, typically expressed as terms, including individual words and compounds.
- the search engine 23 receives a query, identifies matching content 28 and sends back results conforming to the query preferences.
- Other styles, forms or definitions of queries, query characteristics, and related metadata are feasible, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.
- the search engine 23 identifies the content 28 determined to be highly relevant in relation to a given set of search query terms, for example, using such techniques as described in S. Brim and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine” (1998) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, issued Sep. 4, 2001 to Page, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.
- the search engine 23 operates on information characteristics describing potentially retrievable content. Note the functionality provided by the server 20 , including the Web server 20 , news server 21 , advertising server 22 , and search engine 23 , could be provided by a loosely- or tightly-coupled distributed or parallelized computing configuration, in addition to a uniprocessing environment.
- the content 28 is supplemented with a set of categories to assist the search engine 23 in identifying content.
- the categories identify and aggregate the content 28 , particularly documents, into generalized groups preferably sharing some form of common traits and characteristics. Individual documents and word and word phrases are associated by relative strength of correlation to individual categories.
- a scoring engine (not shown) references the association strengths to determine a composite score based on search query and category matches for use by the search engine 23 , as further described below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the individual computer systems include general purpose, programmed digital computing devices including a central processing unit (processors 13 and 16 , respectively), random access memory (memories 14 and 17 , respectively), non-volatile secondary storage 15 , such as a hard drive or CD ROM drive, network or wireless interfaces, and peripheral devices, including user interfacing means, such as a keyboard and display.
- Program code including software programs, and data is loaded into the RAM for execution and processing by the CPU and results are generated for display, output, transmittal, or storage.
- FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram 30 showing a scoring engine 31 , in accordance with one embodiment.
- the scoring engine 31 matches each search query 38 received from a user 19 to documents 53 stored in a text corpus 42 to generate search results 46 .
- the scoring engine 31 then references a set of categories 43 using individual search query terms 39 , one or more parts of the search query 38 , or the complete search query 38 , and the search results 46 to determine text match scores 47 and category scores 48 , 49 . These scores are combined into a composite score 40 , which is provided to the search engine 23 for further evaluation in providing the content 28 .
- compound words are identified for inclusion as part of a search query 38 , such as described in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/647,203, filed Aug. 21, 2003, pending, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.
- the scoring engine 31 includes storage for maintaining the text corpus 42 , categories 43 , document mappings 44 , and word and word phrase associations 45 .
- the text corpus 42 includes documents 53 and excerpts of the documents 53 that include content stored by the server 11 (shown in FIG. 1 ), as well as documents and excerpts from other sources.
- the categories 43 are indexed and searchable by the scoring engine 31 and can be provided as a list, organized in a hierarchical fashion, as further described below, by way of example, with reference to FIGS. 4A-D , or defined in any searchable form of data structure.
- the categories 43 can be used to efficiently cluster or aggregate multiple individual documents 53 into generalized groups and can significantly decrease the misidentification of related, but less relevant documents 53 .
- the categories 43 can be arbitrary or descriptive, can reflect product or service information and characteristics, or can reflect interrelationships and independencies between other categories 43 or advertisements 26 . In a further embodiment, multiple categories can be used.
- the document mappings 44 associate documents 53 with the categories 43 .
- the word and word phrase associations 45 associate individual words and word phrases with the categories 43 .
- the individual words and word phrases can appear as search query terms, as part of or as a complete search query 38 , or in other ways, such as derived or determined from the topics or concepts associated with an article or document.
- Each document mapping 44 may include association strengths (“Conf”) 51 reflecting the relative degree to which the document 53 matches each corresponding category 43 .
- the word and word phrase associations 45 defines word-category and word phrase-category associations that include a association strength (“Conf”) 52 reflecting the relative degree to which each word or word phrase matches a corresponding category 43 .
- Each document-category mapping 44 , word-category association and word phrase-category association may have a separate association strength 51 , 52 and each document 53 , word and word phrase 45 can be associated with one or more of the categories 43 .
- Other types of confidence measures are possible.
- Category definitions, document-to-category mappings, and word- and word phrase-to-category associations can be pre-computed prior to execution of a query 38 .
- the category definitions, document-to-category mappings, and word- and word phrase-to-category associations can be computed dynamically, or can include a combination of dynamically computed and pre-computed values.
- the document mappings 44 may be initially formed through manual mapping or via automatic clustering on a category-by-category basis.
- the individual document 44 mappings can be used as training data for an automated classifier, such as a Na ⁇ ve Bayes classifier, to enable the formation of further document mappings 44 .
- the word and word phrase associations 45 associations may be initially formed through an analysis of system logs and documents 53 from the text corpus 42 , which help identify those categories 43 most frequently associated with a particular word or word phrase.
- the individual word-category and word phrase-category associations can also be used as training data for an automated classifier to form further word and word phrase associations 45 .
- the scoring engine 31 includes an indexer 34 , text scorer 35 , category scorer 36 , and blending function 37 .
- the indexer 34 executes a search by evaluating the search query 38 against the text corpus 42 to generate a set of document results 46 .
- the search query 38 can be expanded by integrating additional information, such as categories 43 of products or services, or through a combination of actual content, such as product names, and categories 43 .
- the terms 40 of the search query 38 are broadened to modify the scope of the search query 38 , such that the search results reflect an increased breadth, rather than a narrowing, limiting, or otherwise restricting of the search scope.
- Search query broadening is described, for instance, in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/629,479, filed Jul. 28, 2003, pending, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.
- the indexer 34 can integrate the broadened terms when executing advertisement searches against the information and characteristics maintained in documents 53 .
- a search query 38 may not be necessary or need not be entered; instead, the concept or topic of a document 53 , such as a Web page, can be used to determine other documents 53 , including the advertisements 26 , that may then be ordered or ranked, such as described in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/389,688, filed Mar. 14, 2003, pending; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/375,900, filed Feb. 26, 2003, pending; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/314,427, filed Dec. 6, 2002, pending; and U.S. Provisional Patent application Ser. No. 60/413,536, filed Sep. 24, 2002, pending, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.
- the indexer 34 may identify thousands or even millions of document results 46 , so only a subset of the document results 46 , such as, in this implementation, between 100 to 10,000, are retained as the most promising document results 46 .
- the most promising document results 46 are then qualitatively ranked or scored by degree of match to the terms 39 of the search query 38 .
- the text scorer 35 assigns a text match score 47 to each document result 46 for indicating a quality of match and the text match scores 47 are used by the blending function 37 to determine the composite score 40 .
- the category scorer 36 generates document-categories scores 48 , query-categories scores 49 , and category match scores 50 .
- Document-categories scores 48 measure the closeness of fit between the document results 46 and one or more categories 43 .
- the query-categories scores 49 measure the closeness of fit between the search query 38 and one or more categories 43 .
- the document-categories scores 48 and query-categories scores 49 are expressed as functions of the respective association strengths 51 , 52 associated with the document mappings 44 and word and word phrase associations 45 .
- search criteria-category scores are used instead of the query-categories scores 49 when a search query 38 is either unnecessary or need not be entered.
- the category match scores 50 combine the document-categories scores 48 and query-categories scores 49 for a given set of document results 46 .
- the category match scores 50 can be calculated as the dot product of vectors storing the document-categories scores 48 and query-categories scores 49 , in accordance with the equation of the form:
- D is the vector containing the document-categories scores 48
- C is the vector containing the query-categories scores 49
- n is the number of categories 43 .
- category match scores 50 are calculated for only the top n categories 43 for the query-categories scores 49 , where n equals ten or similar limit and with a bias for document-categories scores 48 based on manually mapped data.
- the blending function 38 calculates the composite scores 40 based on the text match scores 47 and category match scores 50 .
- the composite scores 40 can improve upon the text match scores 47 by factoring in the relative degrees of match for the document results 46 based on the association strengths 51 , 52 of the document mappings 44 and word and word phrase associations 45 .
- the composite scores 40 can help resolve ambiguous search queries 43 by factoring in the qualitative weights assigned to potentially ambiguous words and word phrases using the word-category and word phrase-category associations in the word and word phrase associations 45 .
- each composite score 40 can be determined as a weighted linear combination by simply adding, multiplying, or otherwise combining the text match scores 47 and category match scores 50 .
- Each composite score 40 can be determined as a weighted combination of the form: ⁇ S t + ⁇ S c [2] where S t is the text match score 47 , S c is the category match score 50 and ⁇ and ⁇ are weighting factors.
- each composite score 40 can be determined as a weighted combination in accordance with an equation of the form: ⁇ S t + ⁇ S c + ⁇ S t ⁇ S c [3] where S t is the text match score 47 , S c is the category match score 50 , ⁇ , ⁇ and ⁇ are weighting factors.
- the last term, ⁇ S t ⁇ S c can operate as a soft logical AND function such that receiving a high composite score generally requires both a reasonably high text match score 47 and a reasonably high category match score 50 . Numerous other forms of blending functions to combine the text match scores 47 and category match scores 50 are possible.
- One or more of the documents could be annotated with a label and those documents sharing the same label could be grouped or clustered into a common group. For example, shopping documents could be mapped into a product taxonomy, news articles could be organized by topic, and Web documents could be grouped by language or clustered into genres describing the style, type or class of each document.
- the individual computer system including the scoring engine 31 , include general purpose, programmed digital computing devices including a central processing unit (processor 33 ), random access memory (memory 32 ), non-volatile secondary storage 37 , such as a hard drive or CD ROM drive, network or wireless interfaces, and peripheral devices, including user interfacing means, such as a keyboard and display.
- Program code including software programs, and data is loaded into the RAM for execution and processing by the CPU and results are generated for display, output, transmittal, or storage.
- FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram 60 showing composite scoring 61 by the search engine 31 of FIG. 2 in accordance with one embodiment.
- individual categories 43 are defined (Process 62 ).
- the categories 43 define a set of individual categories to identify and assimilate the content 28 and can be specified through a manual process, via automatically clustering, through a combination of automation and manual editing, or by similar means.
- the categories 43 can be specified as a list, organized in a hierarchical fashion, or defined in any searchable form of data structure. Categories may also overlap.
- a hierarchical tree diagram 70 shows, by way of example, a set of categories for a category hierarchy 71 relating to products offered for sale on a shopping Web site.
- An on-line shopping example is particularly useful to illustrate how categories 43 can assist in improving the quality of matches in a product searching context.
- products can be grouped into strong and natural categories that are widely established and easily understood, conventional approaches tend to simply sort products by price or paid placement, rather than by relevant category.
- These Web pages often have few hyperlinks because, for instance, the pages are short-lived or include so many pages as to be impracticable to identify and exploit.
- the following example combines a text score and category score to select between a pair of search results that would otherwise be equally relevant using basic text matching alone.
- the category hierarchy 71 defines a root node 72 , “Household.” Each other node is related to the root node 72 through one or more links Non-root nodes 73 , such as “Cleaning Supplies,” “Lawn Care,” “Maintenance,” and “Decorative,” represent subcategories and can also reflect specific items. Finally, non-root nodes 73 , such as “Brooms,” “Mops,” “Vacuum Cleaners,” “Rakes,” “Mowers,” “Flamingos,” “Gnomes,” reflect the specific items to which individual documents 53 and potential search query terms 39 are associated.
- the category hierarchy 71 could equally be defined as a list with each category including a full item description. For instance, “Flamingos” could be expressed as a list item, “Household>Lawn Care>Decorative>Flamingos.” Other data structures and data organizations are possible.
- words and word phrase associations 45 are associated with the categories 43 (Process 63 ) and the documents 53 are mapped to categories 43 as the document mappings 44 (Process 64 ).
- the document-to-category mappings 44 and word- and word phrase-to-category associations respectively include association strengths 51 , 52 reflecting the relative degree to which each document 53 , and word and word phrase 45 match a corresponding category 43 .
- Category definitions (Process 62 ), document-to-category mappings (Process 63 ), and word- and word phrase-to-category associations (Process 64 ) can be pre-computed prior to query execution.
- the category definitions, document-to-category mappings, and word- and word phrase-to-category associations can be computed dynamically, or can include a combination of dynamically computed and pre-computed values.
- the hierarchical tree diagram 70 shows, by way of example, document mappings 44 and association strengths 51 for a first sample document 80 .
- Each association strength 51 reflects the relative quality of the match between the document 80 and a corresponding category, as identified in a non-root node 73 .
- the document 80 has association strengths of 0.5000 relative to “Brooms,” 0.0060 relative to “Mops,” 0.0005 relative to “Vacuum Cleaners,” and 0.0007 relative to “Rakes,” indicating that the document 80 is most strongly related to the “Brooms” category and less strongly related to the other categories.
- Association strengths 51 of zero are omitted.
- the association strengths 51 for all document mappings 44 sum to one, although other association strength assignments could be used.
- the association strengths could reflect relative weaknesses of matches between documents and categories, as well as other measures of quality of match.
- each association strength 51 reflects the relative quality of the match between the document 90 and a corresponding category, as identified in a non-root node 73 .
- the document 90 has association strengths of 0.0001 relative to “Brooms,” 0.0010 relative to “Flamingos,” and 0.0140 relative to “Gnomes,” indicating that the document 80 is most strongly related to the “Gnomes” category and less strongly related to the other categories.
- Association strengths 51 of zero are omitted.
- the association strengths 51 for all document mappings 44 sum to one, although other association strength assignments could be used.
- the association strengths could reflect relative weaknesses of matches between documents and categories, as well as other measures of quality of match.
- the hierarchical tree diagram 70 shows, by way of example, word and word phrase associations 45 and association strengths 52 for a pair of words 100 .
- Each association strength 52 reflects the relative quality of the match between each word 100 and a corresponding category, as identified in a non-root node 73 .
- the word “Acme” has association strengths of 0.0010 relative to “Brooms,” 0.0002 relative to “Flamingos,” and 0.0010 relative to “Gnomes.”
- the word “Broom” has association strengths of 0.0500 relative to “Brooms” and 0.0007 relative to “Mops.”
- Association strengths 52 of zero are omitted.
- the association strengths could reflect relative weaknesses of matches between potential search query terms and categories, as well as other measures of quality of match.
- a search query 38 is executed against the text corpus to identify document results 46 and the query is associated with the categories 43 (Process 65 ).
- Text match scores 47 are calculated for indicating a quality of match to the documents 53 in the text corpus 42 (Process 66 ).
- the search query 38 contains, “Acme Broom.” Both documents 80 , 90 have the same number of occurrences of the individual search terms 39 , “Acme” and “Broom.” Assuming that documents 80 , 90 are the only document results 46 , relative text match scores 47 of 0.50 are assigned to each document result 46 .
- Category match scores 50 are calculated to complement and fine tune the text match scores 47 (Process 67 ).
- the text match scores 47 and category match score 50 are logically combined using a blending function (Process 68 ).
- the text match scores 47 and category match score 50 are logically combined using a blending function (Process 68 ).
- a composite score 40 determined using a blending function of the form provided in equation [3] yields: (0.33) ⁇ (0.50)+(0.33) ⁇ (0.0007)+(0.34) ⁇ (0.50) ⁇ (0.0007) ⁇ 0.1654 where ⁇ is 0.33, ⁇ is 0.33 and ⁇ is 0.34, by way of example.
- Comparing the composite scores 40 for the documents 80 , 90 shows the first sample document 80 having a consistently higher composite score than the second sample document 90 for a search query 38 that contains “Acme Broom.”
- the sample document 80 provides a qualitatively better search result than sample document 90 , even though both were equally relevant on the basis of basic text matching alone.
- Query-to-categories associations (Process 65 ), text match scoring (Process 66 ), category match scoring (Process 67 ) and score blending (Process 68 ) may be dynamically calculated subsequent to query execution.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram 110 showing a method for determining a composite score 40 for categorized search results, in accordance with one embodiment.
- the method 110 is described as a sequence of process operations or steps, which can be executed, for instance, by the scoring engine 31 of FIG. 2 or other components.
- the method 70 begins by processing a search query 38 to identify document results 46 (block 111 ) and determining text match scores 47 (block 112 ).
- Category match scores 50 are determined (block 113 ), as further described below with reference to FIG. 6 .
- composite scores 40 are determined (block 114 ), as further described below with reference to FIG. 7 , for use by the search engine 23 or equivalent component. The routine then terminates.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram showing the routine 120 for determining category match scores for use in the method 110 of FIG. 5 .
- One purpose of this routine is to calculate document-categories scores 48 , query-categories scores 49 , and category match scores 50 .
- the document-categories scores 48 are looked up (block 121 ).
- Query-categories scores 49 are then determined (block 122 ) based on the association strengths 52 in the associated word and word phrase associations 45 .
- search criteria-category scores are used instead of the query-categories scores 49 when a search query 38 is either unnecessary or need not be entered.
- the top n categories 43 most strongly associated with the search query 38 based on the association strengths 51 , 52 are selected (block 123 ).
- the category match scores 50 are determined (block 124 ) using, for example, a dot product of the document-categories scores 48 and query-categories scores 49 . The routine then returns.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram showing the routine 130 for determining composite scores for use in the exemplary method 110 of FIG. 5 .
- One purpose of this routine is to determine a set of composite scores 40 based on the text match scores 47 and category match scores 50 for a given search query 38 and identified document results 46 .
- the identified document results 46 are iteratively processed (blocks 131 - 135 ), as follows. For each document result 46 (block 131 ), the text match scores 47 and category match scores 50 are retrieved (blocks 132 and 133 , respectively). A composite score 40 is then determined by applying a blending function (block 134 ), as described above. Processing continues with the next document result 46 (block 135 ), after which the routine returns.
