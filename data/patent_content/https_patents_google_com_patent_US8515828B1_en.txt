Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to a system for providing product or service provider recommendations to a user based on a user's search criteria. More particularly, the present invention utilizes asymmetries between positive and negative consumer-generated reviews to identify information on product characteristics of interest to a user.
- a method for providing product recommendations based on user-generated product reviews comprises receiving a product recommendation request defining a product review search criteria, identifying product reviews matching the product review search criteria to generate a review analysis set, identifying negative sentiment key phrases in the review analysis set, calculating a weight for each identified negative sentiment key phrased based on the negative sentiment key phrase's relative frequency, correlating the negative sentiment key phrase to one or more product characteristics, calculating a score for each product characteristic based on the weights of the negative sentiment key phrase or phrases correlated to the product characteristic, generating, for each product reviewed in the customer review set, a product recommendation report comprising a list of each product reviewed and, for each product, a list of scored product characteristics, and communicating the product recommendation report to the user.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a product recommendation system according to an exemplary embodiment.
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for building a classification rubric according to an exemplary embodiment.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for generating product recommendations in response to a product recommendation request according to an exemplary embodiment.
- FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for identifying product reviews matching a product review search criteria according to an exemplary embodiment.
- the methods and systems described herein enable a user to filter a large body of product reviews to obtain product recommendations containing information on product characteristics unique to a given product and customized to the user's particular interest.
- the user may then read the identified reviews, utilize the product information in the identified reviews to categorize a product according to certain product characteristics important to the user, or filter out certain products from a list of viable purchase options.
- product should be interpreted to include tangible and intangible products, as well as services.
- the methods and systems of the present invention utilize one or more semantic analysis models to filter out extraneous and redundant information and identify negative sentiment keywords that relate to a specific characteristic of a product.
- the language analysis model is derived using only negative reviews, but once derived may be applied to both positive and negatively rated reviews. For example, a purely exemplary review may state the following. “I went to A Restaurant last evening and it was suspected! We waited over an hour to be seated, and our waiter was so rude to us!
- the language analysis would focus on terms such as “waited for over an hour,” “waited,” and “rude” since they refer to specific aspects of the restaurant that characterized the reviewer's experience, rather than “never coming back” or “horrible” since they are redundant to the negative sentiment already indicated by the review's negative rating, or “A Restaurant” or “last evening” which don't provide generally applicable information relevant to characterizing the service at the restaurant.
- the negative sentiment keywords are then correlated to one or more product characteristics. In the above example, the terms “rude” and “waiter” would be correlated to the product characteristics indicative of poor service.
- a weight may be assigned to each negative sentiment keyword and used to calculate a score for each product characteristic correlated to that negative sentiment key word.
- the results are then displayed to the user.
- the results may be used to list product characteristics identified from the reviews by problem category rather than by a score, or filter products based on the nature of their review. For example, results of the product review search could be used to filter out products identified as having bad service.

- the application module 110 may also comprise a mobile application that resides on a mobile device of the user 105 .
- the product review search system 125 comprises a user interface module 130 , a product review aggregator module 135 , a product review analysis module 145 , and optionally a review index 140 containing product review source records 141 and product review records 142 , and a temporary search index 150 .
- the product review search system 125 communicates with end-user devices 105 and the servers of online sources of product reviews 120 via a network 115 .
- the user interface module 130 generates a user interface that allows a user to enter through an application module 110 the product search information of interest, as well as view the product recommendations or product reviews returned by the product review search system 125 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 receives product search information from the user interface module 130 and identifies product reviews matching the search criteria.
- the product review aggregator 135 identifies product reviews in a review source index 140 .
- the review source index 140 can contain an index that is updated at a determined frequency to contain a list of all available online sources of product reviews 120 .
- the review source index 140 may store reviews as identified in previous product searches.
- the product review aggregator module 135 searches or polls online sources of user-generated product reviews 120 to identify reviews matching the product search request.
- the review aggregator module 135 may both search a review index 140 as well as search or poll online sources of user-generated product reviews 120 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 communicates identified product reviews to the product review analysis module 145 .
- the product review analysis module 145 applies a semantic analysis model to identify negative sentiment keywords.
- the negative sentiment keywords are associated with certain product characteristics which can be used to provide recommendations based on the identified product characteristics, annotate products, filter products, or a combination thereof.
- the product review analysis module 145 communicates the results to the user interface module 130 for display to the user.
- the product annotation system 125 is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the methods depicted in FIGS. 2-5 .
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 200 for constructing a product recommendation classification rubric based on negative sentiment key phrases. The method 200 is described with reference to the components in FIG. 1 .
- Method 200 begins with block 205 where the product review aggregator module 135 collects a set of user-generated product review samples for semantic analysis by, for example, crawling various web sites where user-generated product reviews are published.
- the review sample set may be uploaded directly to the product recommendation system 125 by an operator of the system.
- the size and scope of the review sample set may vary and will depend on such factors as the type of products the product recommendation system 125 is designed to provide product recommendations on and the type of semantic analysis to be performed on the review sample set.
- the review sample set may be further filtered, for example, to include product reviews scored above a pre-determined score or rating cut-off. Alternatively, product reviews may be filtered by user.
- user-generated product reviews may be selected based on the frequency with which a given user provides negative reviews.
- Customer reviews authored by a user who more frequently gives negative reviews can be excluded, and negatively scored reviews from a user that more frequently gives positive scored reviews included.
- a reviewer who infrequently gives a negative product review may be more likely to do so only when real issues exists with one or more aspects of a product, whereas an individual who frequently issues negative reviews may reflect a general predisposition to give negative reviews regardless of the existence of any substantive issues.
- Such a criteria may further reduce gaming of the system, or the planting of unsubstantiated negative reviews to influence the outcomes of the product recommendation system 125 analysis.
- the product review analysis module 145 applies a semantic analysis algorithm to the text of each product review in the review set to identify those words that are indicative of a user's preferences or opinions when assessing their experience with a product. These words or combinations of words are classified as “sentiment key phrases” and can be identified, for example, by a language analysis algorithm.
- the language analysis algorithm may be a supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Exemplary supervised learning algorithms include, but are not limited to, support vector machines and na ⁇ ve bayes classifiers. Exemplary unsupervised learning algorithms include, but are not limited to, bootstrapping and neural networks.
- the language analysis module may identify one or more product classes or product characteristics with which the key phrase is associated and as discussed further with reference to block 225 below.
- the key phrases are identified as expressing a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment.
- the classification is done using automatic sentiment analysis. This classification may be a straight binary classification as either positive or negative. For example, the phrase “I like” would be classified as positive and the phrase “I hate” would be classified as negative.
- the key phrases could be scored on a continuum between strictly positive and strictly negative. For example, the score could range from +1 for strictly positive to ⁇ 1 for strictly negative.
- the phrase “I dislike” might receive a score of ⁇ 0.2 while the phrase “I hate” a score of ⁇ 1.0.
- the product review analysis module 145 filters out key phrases defined above as positive sentiment key phrases to generate a negative sentiment key phrase set.
- each key phrase is then categorized into one or more product characteristic groups with which the phrase is most closely associated to generate a classification rubric.
- this classification may be manually performed by an operator of the product recommendation system 125 .
- the source or context of the key phrase may be noted during the semantic analysis performed in block 210 , and this information used to automatically define and classify key phrases based on the results of the semantic analysis.
- a combination of manual classification and automatic classification may be employed to define the product characteristic groups and characterize each key phrase accordingly.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 300 for generating product recommendations in response to a product recommendation request, wherein the product recommendations are based on an analysis of negative sentiment key phrases identified within a set of relevant customer reviews.
- a relevant customer review is a review describing a user's experience with a product or products matching the search parameters of the product recommendation request. The method 300 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- Filter options may also include common product characteristics of interest to consumers that a user can select to further define the type of product information they would like to receive.
- the user interface may also provide the user with the ability to limit the results to negative reviews, or product reviews that were scored below a certain score level.
- a cut-off value for a negative customer review can be defined by the operator of the product review search system 125 , or user defined.
- the product recommendation system 125 may further comprise a review score matrix for converting different review rating systems used by different online sources of user-generated product reviews 120 into a standardized rating for purposes of a determining a cut-off value.
- a score matrix can be defined that converts a scoring system based on a number of “stars” into a numerical score, or vice versa.
- the product search request and any user or system applied search filters are used to generate a product review search criteria.
- the user interface module 130 communicates the customer review search criteria to the customer review aggregator module 135 and the method proceeds to block 310 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 receives the review search criteria from the user interface module 135 and uses the review search criteria to identify user-generated product reviews for further analysis by the product review analysis module 145 .
- Block 310 will be described in further detail hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for identifying reviews matching a product review search criteria according to an exemplary embodiment, as referenced in block 310 of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 3 describes a process 310 by which product reviews matching the review search criteria are identified and indexed for utilization by the product recommendation system 125 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 identifies online sources of user-generated product reviews.
- Online sources may include product review specific websites that user-generated product reviews on a particular product, such as hotels or restaurants. Further, an online source may include a commercial website that allows users to comment or rate the products they purchase on the site, such as electronics, music, and books.
- the product review aggregator module 135 retrieves product review information from the online source and creates a review source record 141 in a review source index 140 .
- the product review information may include the type(s) of product reviewed at the online source, the review rating system used, and a URL or other locator where the product reviews can be accessed.
- the review aggregator module 135 may download and index the customer reviews as product review records 142 in the review source index 140 and associate each product review record 142 with the product review's corresponding product review source record 141 .
- the product reviews may be stored in a single index or multiple indices. In certain exemplary embodiments, the product reviews can be stored in separate indices based on product or product type. Metadata may also be stored for each product review record 142 and may include a user identifier for the author of the review, date of review, and product or product category reviewed.
- the product review aggregator module 135 may store only a URL or other locator of where the product reviews can be accessed with the review sourced record 141 .
- the product review information stored in the online review source record 141 can be used to identify user-generate product review sources 120 that contain product reviews related to a given product review search criteria.
- the URL may be static or dynamic.
- blocks 405 to 410 are completed upon initiation of the product recommendation system 125 and prior to any user-initiated product search request. In certain exemplary embodiments, blocks 405 to 410 are repeated at regular intervals to update the review source records 141 and product review records 142 contained in the review source index. An operator of the product recommendation system 125 may set or modify the regular update interval.
- the product review aggregator module 135 identifies review source records 141 , product review records 142 in the review source index 140 , or both that match the product review search criteria.
- the product review aggregator module 145 searches the product review records 142 and indentifies product reviews matching the product review search criteria.
- the set of all product reviews records 142 searched may be initially filtered by the product information stored in the review source record 141 or by metadata associated with each customer review record 142 . For example, if the product review search criteria is limited to restaurants in a particular geographic location, the product review aggregator module 135 will only search those product review records 142 associated with review source records 141 containing matching product information based on geographic location.
- the product review aggregator module 135 posts the product review search criteria to a API associated with the dynamic URL.
- the API then processes the product review search criteria to determine if matching product reviews are located at the online source.
- the API then communicates any matching product reviews to the product review aggregator module 135 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 may also store product reviews retrieved from dynamic URLs in the temporary review index 150 or other temporary data storage construct.
- the product review aggregator module 135 may utilize a persistent HTTP connection such as a HTTP server push, a pushlet, long polling, or HTML5 websockets to achieve dynamic retrieval of the customer reviews without delaying retrieval and analysis of product reviews obtained from static URLs and the review source index 140 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 determines if product reviews matching the review search criteria are identified. If no matching product reviews are identified the method proceeds to block 425 .
- the product review aggregator module 135 communicates the lack of reviews to the user interface module 130 .
- the user interface module 130 generates a notification indicting no reviews were identified and communicates the notification to the user. The method 400 then terminates.
- the product review aggregator module 135 compiles all product reviews matching the product review search criteria into a product review analysis set for further analysis by the product review analyzer module 145 .
- matching product reviews in the review analysis set are stored in the review source index 140 to allow commonly searched product reviews to be more readily retrieved in subsequent searches. The method then proceeds to block 315 of FIG. 3 .
- the product review analysis module 145 receives the reviews compiled by the product review aggregator 135 to form a review analysis set.
- the product review analyzer module 145 searches and identifies in each product review matching negative sentiment keywords defined in the classification rubric referenced in block 225 of FIG. 2 .
- the negative sentiment keywords in the classification rubric may be selected by filtering the negative sentiment keywords from the positive sentiment keywords using a cutoff for the weighted values assigned to each keyword as referenced at block 220 of FIG. 2 .
- the negative sentiment keywords can be identified by searching the customer review text using a natural language processing algorithm.
- the product review analysis module 145 calculates a weight for each identified negative sentiment key phrase based on the key phrase's relative frequency.
- the relative frequency may be calculated using the raw frequency or the negative-log frequency.
- the relative frequency of a negative sentiment keyword is based on the number of times the keyword appears in a given product review compared to the number of times the negative sentiment keyword appears in other reviews of the same product in the review analysis set.
- the relative frequency is determined in relation to how frequently the negative sentiment keyword is used in product reviews of all products within that same product class, not just the product reviews in the product review set.
- the use of “term X” in a product review of generic “restaurant A” is compared to how frequently the term is used in product reviews of all other restaurants, or restaurants of the same class, such as French restaurants.
- the relative frequency is determined in relation to how frequently a negative sentiment keyword appears in a product review and all other product reviews available to the product recommendation system 125 .
- the product review analyzer module 145 weights each identified negative sentiment keyword inversely based on the term's relative frequency. Thus, negative sentiment key phrases that occur less frequently are therefore given higher weight as such terms are more likely to reflect a product characteristic that is unique for that product.
- the weight for the key word may further include the weight assigned to the keyword at block 220 of FIG. 2 .
- the product review analysis module 145 assigns, for each product, the product characteristics to which the identified negative sentiment key phrases are assigned in the classification rubric. For example, if the product review criteria defined in block 305 of FIG. 3 results in a review analysis set that contains product reviews for five different products, the negative sentiment key phrases identified in each individual product's corresponding product reviews would be used to assign product characteristics to that product. Accordingly, after a negative sentiment key phrase is identified in a customer review of a given product, the classification rubric defines which product characteristics are assigned to that product.
- the product review analyzer module 145 scores each product characteristic based on the composite value of the weights associated with the negative sentiment key phrase's correlated to that product characteristic. For example, one product review of a product may use term “A” associated with a given product characteristic and which carries a weight of X and another product review may use term “B” associated with the same product characteristic and which carries a weight of Y. The score for the product characteristic would be the composite value of weights X and Y. Accordingly each product characteristic can be ranked according to the weight of the underlying key phrases associated with that product characteristic. In certain exemplary embodiments, a link to the source product review for each negative sentiment key phrase is maintained so that a link back to the source product reviews can be presented to the user as described in further in reference to block 340 of FIG. 3
- the product review analysis module 145 generates a product information report comprising, for each product, an identity of the product and a ranked list of product characteristics based on the individual product characteristic scores. Accordingly, for each individual product identified, the product information report will list the product characteristics identified as characterizing that product. For example, where the negative sentiment keywords “rude” and “long wait” are identified in a customer review of a restaurant and associated by the classification rubric with poor service, the product information report will identify the reviewed restaurant has having the product characteristic of poor service. Each product characteristic will carry with it a score value showing how indicative the product characteristic is of that particular product.
- the product review analysis module 145 then communicates the product information report to the user interface module 130 , and the method proceeds to block 340 .
- the product characteristic score may be determined by the weights associated with each negative sentiment keyword or combined with other ratings.
- the user interface module 130 receives the product information report from the review analyzer module 145 .
- the user interface module 130 displays a product information report to the user according to user or system defined preferences.
- the user interface module 130 may present the product characteristics that were identified for each product based on the review search criteria.
- the identified negative sentiment keywords, or snippets showing the negative sentiment keyword in the immediate context of where it appears in the product review, may be displayed along with the product characteristics.
- a link to the complete source product review(s) for each product characteristic may be presented to the user.
- the user may further filter the product information based on eliminating those product characteristics not of interest. These user preferences may be defined when initiating the product information search, or selected when viewing the product information report.
- the product information report can include only those products that did not contain product characteristics identified by the semantic analysis. For example, the product information report could return only those products that did not have product reviews indicating bad service.
- the user may select to see the full product reviews identified in the semantic analysis. The user interface module 130 then loads those product reviews ranked according to the score assigned to each product review by the customer review analysis module 145 .
- Users can, in appropriate circumstances, limit or otherwise affect the operation of the features disclosed in the specification. For example, users can be given an initial opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of the collection or use of certain data or the activation of certain features.
