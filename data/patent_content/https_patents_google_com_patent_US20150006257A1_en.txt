- 2. Description of Related art
- With the increased popularity and sophistication of personal mobile devices, there is an increased demand for media content available for personal mobile devices. Electronic book readers, or eReaders, are an increasingly popular classification of personal mobile devices. Even electronic devices not known traditionally as eReaders, such as smartphones and laptops, are programmed with functionality similar to that of eReaders. Several reading platforms exist in the art that allow users to install applications or programs on their mobile device to access digital media. In particular, books have made a significant transition from print to digital in order to satisfy the demands and capabilities of consumers. The reading platforms that currently exist in the art allow users to view and interact with books and other published content, though on a very basic level. Users may read the words on the pages and in some instances make notes. Currently, users may also interact with other users in order to discuss books users are reading or to discover new content. There exists a need in the art, however, of a more sophisticated method of consuming digital content. Consumers currently lack an ability to seamlessly access content while discovering new content in an organic environment that is unique to each user. Consumers and publishers alike lack methods of finding common ground, in order to provide the best content possible while still generating the most value for each individual user. The methods and systems disclosed herein address such needs.

Further provided are methods which include controlling user reading speed/jumping based on tracking extent of content read in an electronic book reader and passive book list generation based on observed reading behavior.
- In accordance with various illustrative but non-limiting embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may include a method of determining a lifetime value of a book. The method may include taking a reading prediction model that predicts reader reading activity for the book based on at least two of customer ratings, critic ratings, retail pricing, wholesale pricing, print pricing, and electronic pricing, the population of the reading prediction model. The method may then include aggregating data from a plurality of social media sources associated with the book and aggregating user reading activity for the book across a plurality of subscribers using an electronic book reading platform. The method may further include using a valuation model to calculate the expected lifetime value for the book, wherein the expected lifetime value is based on at least one of the price for reading within the book, the price of the book, the reading prediction model and the cost of offering the book. In embodiments, the data from the plurality of social media sources may include trending data. In embodiments, the data may be associated with popularity of the book may include liking data. In embodiments, the calculated expected lifetime value may be based on trending data. In embodiments, the calculated expected lifetime value may be based on liking data, critic reviews, or book price. In embodiments, the data from the plurality of social media sources may include social media data. In embodiments, the calculated expected lifetime value may be based on metrics derived from external book-related behavior or on metrics derived from a user's book-related behavior. In embodiments, the metrics derived from a user's book-related behavior may include reading progress. In embodiments, a user's reading progress is determined by using user view-page boundary words. In embodiments, determining the user view-page boundary words includes taking a page size attribute of a user's content viewing device, determining an amount of viewable content for the page size, taking a first word of a section of an electronic book, calculating a page last word for a plurality of sequential pages of the electronic book based on the determined amount of viewable content and content in the section that follows the first word, and based on page last word information gathered when a page is viewed during a reading session, and then determining an extent of user reading of the electronic book during and across reading sessions. In embodiments, user reading activity may include an amount of the book the user has read. In embodiments, the method may include distributing subscription fees to content owners based on the expected lifetime value via a publisher payment facility. The method may include generating a recommendation for a user based on a book's expected lifetime value. The method may also include determining an impact of the calculated expected lifetime value on how much a content owner of the book is paid, and adjusting at least one upcoming content owner payment based on the calculated expected lifetime value. In embodiments, aggregating user reading activity for the book across a plurality of subscribers using an electronic book reading platform is adjusted based on an anticipated reader churn rate for the subscribers. The reading prediction model may predict reader reading activity based on an anticipated reader churn rate for subscribers using the electronic book reading platform.
- In accordance with various illustrative but non-limiting embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may include a method including aggregating user viewing activity for a book across a sample group of subscribers to an electronic book reading platform, measuring the amount of time the sample group of subscribers spend reading the book, then, based at least in part on the sample group, projecting the amount of time a population of subscribers other than the sample group is expected to spend reading the book, and calculating the expected lifetime value for the book, wherein the expected lifetime value is based on at least one of the price for reading within the book, the price of the book, the projected amount of time and the cost of the book. In embodiments, projecting may include accounting for at least one of a demographic factor, an age factor, a gender factor, a psychographic factor and a location factor.

- Referring to
FIG. 1 and in embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise providing recommendations based on in-book reading activity in a subscription-based e-book business model. The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a reading platform or accessing adatabase 104 of electronic books. The reading platform may allow users to access thedatabase 104 of electronic books after paying a subscription fee 108 (e.g. one lifetime fee, periodically, such as monthly, semiannually, annually, etc.).Users 112 may access thedatabase 104 via amobile device 102, such as a smart phone, tablet, and the like. Themobile device 102 may serve as both a host to a reading platform from which the user accesses and readselectronic books 110, as well as a client device from which theuser 112 communicates with thedatabase 104. Themobile device 102 hosting a reading platform may be referred to herein as a content viewing device. In embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise arecommendation engine 114. In embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise an inbook activity monitor 118. The in book activity monitor may aggregate data about a user's 112 reading habits and provide the information to therecommendation engine 114. The recommendation engine may analyze data collected by the inbook activity monitor 118, along withbook metadata 120 collected from thedatabase 104 to generaterecommendations 122 tousers 112 via themobile device 102. Various algorithms and statistical models may be employed by the recommendation engine to generate its results which are known to the art, such as, but not limited to, similarity-based models, collaborative filtering models, neural networks, robust regressions, random forests, CART, semiparametric regressions, and naïve Bayesian classifiers, among others. - The reading platform in cooperation with a subscription-based reading host may allow users to access information about the devices and books of other uses using the same or similar reading platforms. In a non-limiting example of accessing other users' book related information, the reading platform may allow users to “borrow” other user's books, in order to see their annotations or comments, among others. Users may share annotations globally, such as via a social network, or to selected individuals, such as to a private book group, among other non-limiting examples.
- In embodiments, the users may be allowed to modify content. Such functionality may be deployed when a user wishes to highlight, comment, or annotate specific passages within a book. As described above, users may make such modifications above to create user-specific instances of an electronic book. Modifications to the content may not alter the original base content of the electronic book, but may be stored within a user's specific device or stored in such a manner that it is associated with a user's particular account. This functionality may be deployed so as to not affect the content of all reading platform users, but only for an individual user to view and share with friends. Modifications may be used by the platform to encourage discussion about the book or enhance a reader's experience. In a non-limiting example, modifications made by celebrities, or by the author, may be made available to all platform users or as a premium feature, so that individuals may compare modifications to gain insight into the book or about the modifier. In a non-limiting example, an author may provide special content with notes and highlights describing why he or she made certain choices when writing the book. In embodiments, users may share their notes and highlights with friends or other users to encourage discussion about the book. Such functionality may also be deployed as a marketing tool to encourage global discussion about a book or to generate interest, among other uses. In embodiments, the user modifications may be categorized as annotations, highlight, suggestions, questions, error/typo detection, content error detection (e.g. mistakes in continuity), among others. Users may be able to choose the modifications from a suggested list of modification categories or create their own.
- In particular, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a recommendation engine. The recommendation engine may analyze books for certain substantive traits, such as, but not limited to, length of chapters, subject matter, writing style, author, etc. The recommendation engine may also account for a user's preferences. In a non-limiting example of recommendations based on user preferences, the recommendation engine may display more murder-mystery type books than autobiographies if, based on the reader's explicit or implicit indication of an interest in fiction books rather than nonfiction.
- The recommendation engine may take into account both explicit and implicit user actions in order to analyze a reader's habits, and in turn, a reader's preferences. The recommendation engine may analyze physical habits such as, but not limited to, where a reader pauses, where a reader stops reading, where a reader reads faster or slower, and the time of a reader's session, among others. Data about such physical habits may be provided by the in book activity monitor. Other actions that the recommendation engine may use to generate recommendations may be explicit actions that are not directly related to reading an electronic book, such as, but not limited to, adding a book to a list, sharing a book, viewing a book synopsis, reading a review of a book, how a user's friends or followers on social services (TWITTER, FACEBOOK, etc.) react to certain books, friends activities using the reading platform, among others.
- The recommendation engine may also analyze implicit actions from a user both while reading a book and when using the electronic book platform but not reading, such as, but not limited to, browsing for books and not selecting books already viewed, rereading sections, stopping a book after a certain number of chapters, etc. The recommendation engine may also analyze other variables not related to using the platform at all, such as, but not limited to, demographics, age, gender, location, profession, socioeconomic status, etc.
- The recommendation engine may use these analyses to generate certain user metrics as well as certain book metrics. In turn, the recommendation engine may use these metrics to compare to other users with similar metrics. The recommendation engine may then use these metrics to generate recommendations and display those recommendations to a user via the reading platform. In a non-limiting example, the recommendation engine may identify that Book A has similar book metrics to Book B, and recommend Book B to a user. Likewise, the recommendation engine may identify that User X liked Book A, and thus recommends it to User Y, who has similar user metrics as User X. The recommendation engine may additionally recommend books that are popular amongst the general reading population, but might not necessarily be accounted for by a user's metrics. For instance, in a non-limiting example, a user may have a book recommended that is generating news, or is popular/trending on social networking sites.
- The recommendation engine and methods and systems for analyzing data and preparing recommendations may be performed on the mobile device, on a networked server, on a plurality of networked servers, and/or on combinations thereof. Data related to the inputs described above may be collected over time, and recommendations may be provided to users of the subscription-based electronic book service from time to time, such as without limitation, when it is determined that the user is close to finishing reading a book, when a publisher announces a new book to be released in the near future, when a user has paused reading of a book for a predetermined amount of time, when a publisher is interested in gathering user input regarding books to publish, on a schedule, periodically, and the like.
- The reading platform may comprise a user interface. The user interface may display a number of items that a user may interact with, including, but not limited to, books that a user can browse, ratings of books, books that user has read in the past, books that a user is currently reading, discussions of individuals reading the same book or friends of the user, book and user metrics of the user and others, etc. The user interface may provide visual feedback around progression and accomplishments both while reading the book itself or while using the reading platform. In a non-limiting example, a user may receive a badge or an award message when the user has read five books, or when a book that the user has recommended is featured by the reading platform. The user interface may display the recommendations generated by the recommendation engine to the user. The user interface may display digital images of book covers that are designed to look like actual book covers by layering shadows on the book image to simulate a naturally lighted space. The user interface may provide options for typeface, font size, colors, and other aesthetic options aggregated into themes so that user may intelligently select a preferred set of aesthetic options.
- The methods and systems disclosed herein may comprise a method for a subscription model for electronic books. The subscription model may comprise granting access to the database of electronic books with a periodic subscription fee. The subscription model may comprise allowing users to download alternative media to supplement their subscription, such as, but not limited to, related television shows, movies, hard cover books, full digital downloads. In a non-limiting example, when a user has decided to end the subscription, the user may be directed to a link to download a book the user was reading but had not finished. The subscription model may grant users access to a version of the electronic book that is missing certain features. The user may have to pay an additional fee if a user wishes to access these premium features, such as, but not limited to, access to original drafts, alternative endings, customized artwork, unlimited database access, among others. Such functionality may also be implemented by content providers to give previews to users or other marketing uses. The subscription model may comprise granting users the ability to group together electronic books into lists within the subscription service. The subscription model may comprise providing tiers of subscription access. In a non-limiting embodiment, regular subscribers may only have access to 100 books a year, whereas premium subscribers may have unlimited access. In embodiments, premium subscribers may have access to special features whereas the regular subscribers may have to pay an additional fee to access special features. Such features may include, but are not limited to, special author notes, additional drawings, additional chapters, alternate endings, original manuscripts, and previews of upcoming books by the same author or content provider, etc.
- In embodiments, the subscription model may comprise providing a complimentary service. In a non-limiting example, the complimentary service may be deployed in the form of a complimentary application. The complimentary service may provide time-limited access to the database. In a non-limiting example of providing time limited access to a database of electronic books, the application may only offer books for a certain period of time in which a user must finish a book before the book is removed from the user's device. Likewise, a user who chooses not to select the book offered that day may have to wait until the next day in order to access another complimentary book. The complimentary service may provide content limited access to the database. In a non-limiting example of providing content limited access, the user may have to finish reading a complimentary book before the user may access a new book. Such embodiments may provide useful for marketing purposes or to assess user interest in a particular type of book, among other uses.
- The methods and systems disclosed herein may comprise a notification engine. The notification engine may remind a user to resume reading a book the user has abandoned, remind users to discuss books with friends that are reading the same book, among others. The notification engine may also remind users of subscription service policies, such as, but not limited to, if users who use the complimentary service abandon a book, the user may not get a new book until the next month. In a non-limiting example, the notification engine may look into a user's particular reading history and generate a reminder based on an individual's responses to reminders in the past. The notification engine may then try and adjust future notifications based on that behavior. For instance, if a user constantly chooses to ignore notifications about an unfinished book, the notification engine may notify the user after longer periods of time. If a user continues to ignore notifications, it may indicate that the user has abandoned the book. Notifications may be triggered based on a user's actual progress or location within a piece of content. Users themselves may trigger notifications. In a non-limiting example, a user may select an option in the reading platform via the user interface to remind them to return to a book after X days of inactivity. When a user is inactive for a period of time, the user may be sent a recommendation based on inactivity. When a user is inactive, the reading platform may also remind the user to return to the book or content or suggest an alternative piece of content. Additionally, the notification may ask a user to rate a book or content item after a certain period of inactivity. Such recommendations may be used as an input to recommend alternative content to other users or as an input for the inactive user's future book recommendations. In embodiments, content owners may also be notified when a user is inactive for a certain period of time. Content owners may also be notified of inactivity for multiple users. Such information may be used to determine the lifetime value of a book or simply be delivered as data for a content owner, among others. Inactivity amongst multiple users may also be delivered as data for a content owner to analyze or help determine the lifetime value of a book, among other uses. In embodiments, such notifications to content owners may be delivered via the publisher analytics portal and its associated dashboard, as described in other sections of this disclosure. Notifications may be triggered when others are in the same location or if others are consuming the same content at the same time. Such notifications may be accompanied by a link to a discussion platform, such as, but not limited to, a link to Twitter. The notification engine may also create notifications to generate value within the subscription service. In a non-limiting example, the notification engine may deliver a “Weekly Staff Picks” notification, where the service provider may give periodic recommendations for new content. The recommendations may be related to a thematic set, such as, but not limited to, a notification about service provider employees' favorite sports books in January, followed by a notification about employees' favorite science fiction books in February. In another non-limiting example, the notification engine may deliver a “New Today” book recommendation, where recently published or recently acquired content may be recommended. Other users may also use the notification engine for direct recommendations to other users. These recommendations may be customized. In embodiments, user may use the recommendation and notification engine in conjunction to send gifts (such as, but not limited to, buying access to a premium book) to other users. In a non-limiting example, the notification engine may alert the user that friend's birthday is approaching and may then recommend certain books to give as a gift to the friend.
- Providing a subscription model for reading multiple books presents a challenge, as the library of inventory for a publisher may be acquired based on a per-book pricing model. So, the ability of a publisher to make a profit depends heavily in a subscription model on the behavior of subscribers. The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a lifetime value model for a book to enable determination of publisher value in a subscription based electronic book business model. The lifetime value model may be based on a number of inputs, including the amount that users typically spend reading books, the amount of time users actually spend reading a particular book, and the like. Time amounts may be aggregated across users and over time. The lifetime value model may also be based on the rate of attrition, or churn, within the subscription service. The lifetime value model may be used to predict after what period of time a user will churn, or leave the subscription service. The lifetime value model may be used to learn the impact on the churn rates for various users that specific or combinations of book as well as the actions associated with those books will have. The amount that users read an individual book may impact the amount a subscription service provider may pay a content owner for individual books. The lifetime value model may prove useful to content providers to determine the true value of a book, so that they may accurately build on their business.
- In embodiments and referring to
FIG. 2 , the lifetime value model may comprise aggregating apool 202 ofusers 204 reading aspecific book 212, orusers 204 who have already read the book. Theusers 204 may be required to pay a subscription serviceprovider subscription fees 208 in order to access a subscription service provider'sdatabase 210 of electronic books as well as other content. The subscription service provider'sdatabase 210 may be populated by the content from a plurality of content owners orpublishers 218. The lifetime value model may comprise alifetime value calculator 220. Thelifetime value calculator 220 may determine a specific book's 212lifetime value 224 based on data or metrics derived from a user's book-relatedbehavior 222, such as, but not limited to, whether a reader finished the book. Thelifetime value calculator 220 may also determine a specific book's 212lifetime value 224 based on data or metrics derived from external book-relatedbehavior 228, such as, but not limited to, ratings or reviews on social networks or syndicatedpublications 230. The lifetime value model may comprise apublisher payment facility 214. The publisher payment facility may distributesubscription fees 208 to content owners orpublishers 218 based on a book'slifetime value 224, as determined by thelifetime value calculator 220. - The lifetime value model may comprise a lifetime value calculator. The calculator may use a statistical model to determine the business value of a particular book based on customer ratings and reviews, critics review, price (e.g. retail or wholesale, hardcopy, paperback, or electronic), whether the book was on the best seller list, among others, each of which may be used as an input to predict user behavior with respect to the book. Various algorithms and statistical models may be employed by the calculator to generate its calculations which are known to the art, such as, but not limited to, expected value models, models reflecting decay/abandonment rates, probabilistic models, models based on churn, models based on activity or inactivity, and models using artificial intelligence optimization techniques (such as neural networks), simulation-based models, such as random forest models, models using regression techniques, such as linear regressions, robust regressions, CART, semiparametric regressions, and the like, and Bayesian models, among others. The lifetime value calculator may aggregate and analyze data from social networking sites that reflect sentiment towards a specific book. In a non-limiting example, the calculator may look through TWITTER to see if there is a trending hashtag for Book A, while also looking through FACEBOOK for the number of “Likes” that Book A's dedicated page has received. The lifetime value calculator may aggregate and analyze data through critical sources, such as, but not limited to, the New York Times book reviews, Neilson bookscan, and the like to inform the calculation. The lifetime value calculator may analyze this aggregated data in conjunction with a user's reading behavior (similar to the metrics used by the recommendation engine) in order to calculate the lifetime value of a specific book, or book lifetime value.
- Users may pay a subscription fee that is aggregated into a revenue pool of subscription fees. The pool of subscription fees may be paid to content owners (e.g. book publishers) based on the aggregate of the content owner's book lifetime values with respect to other content owners. The determination of how much a content owner is paid may be determined by a content owner payment facility, which takes into account book lifetime value of specific books a content owner has in the database. The lifetime value model may comprise allowing content owners to receive, where the payment given to a specific content owner is determined by the number of times the content owner's content is consumed, divided by the total number of content items consumed, weighted by a comparable wholesale price of the content. The fraction of revenue given may be determined by the value of the content provided by content owners, as determined by the book lifetime value calculator, divided by the total value of content items consumed, weighted by the wholesale price of the content.
- In embodiments, the recommendation engine may use the lifetime value calculator, along with other metrics, in order to determine a recommendation that may be optimized for a given user. In embodiments, the recommendation engine may analyze book lifetime value in order to generate recommendations that maximize income for the subscription service provider. In embodiments, similarly, the lifetime value may be taken into account to generate a recommendation that may not necessarily maximize income for the subscription service provider, but may be at a desired level of both cost to the subscription service provider and the lifetime value of the book. Recommendations made to each individual user may vary depending on the user's reading metrics, among others, in relation to the book lifetime value. Likewise, the notification engine may inform the lifetime value model by providing data as to how a user responds to certain notifications. This behavior, taken with in-book reading behavior, critical reception, and the number of other sets of data accounted for by the recommendation engine, may all be used to determine a recommendation with respect to book lifetime value. The notification engine may trigger messages based on a user's progress or location within a piece of content. In a non-limiting example, a user might receive a notification message at the end of Book A directing the user to read the next book in the series, Book B. A user who chooses to directly read the Book B may lead to the lifetime value calculator determining that Book A has a higher book lifetime value.
- In embodiments, the lifetime value model may be used not only to determine the amount that should be paid to a content owner or publisher, but other purposes as well. In embodiments, the lifetime value may be used to estimate the lifetime value of similar books. In a non-limiting example, books which are by the same author may be estimated at a similar lifetime value levels. Such estimates may provide useful to content owners who engage with the platform to actively market or assess the business value of taking on certain projects. In a non-limiting example, books which are in the same genre or talk about similar topics may have similar estimated lifetime values. Content owners or publishers may take the estimated lifetime value into account when making editorial or plot changes, among other uses. The lifetime value of a book may also be used to determine which books are more prominently displayed to a user's content viewing device, either via the platform interface, recommendation engine, or other method. Books with higher lifetime value may be listed in a “popular” section in order to maximize traffic to the book, thus optimizing content owner or publisher value. Similarly, books with lower lifetime value may be listed in a “featured” section in order to drive up lifetime value. Books with lower lifetime value may also be used in a more interactive way with platform users. In a non-limiting example, a content owner may hold a contest to see if users can make a low lifetime value book better, or generate a higher lifetime value with reader-submitted alterations. In embodiments, the lifetime value may be used as an input for other algorithms or models. In a non-limiting example, the lifetime value may be used as an input for a book-related ancillary cost model. Such a model may predict metrics such as reader churn rate, reader retention, and the like. The model may rely on lifetime value to predict reader retention by determining that readers that read higher lifetime value books are more likely to be retained. Reader churn may be determined by assessing the volume of lower lifetime value books read across the entire platform.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a dynamic sample reading percentage/threshold for publisher payment determination. Referring to
FIG. 3 and in embodiments,users 302, viadevices 304 hosting a reading platform, may access adatabase 308 of electronic content, such as, but not limited to, electronic books. Content owners andpublishers 310 may contribute content to thedatabase 308. Users may gain access to thedatabase 308 by paying asubscription fee 312.Subscription fees 312 may be aggregated redistributed to content owners andpublishers 310. Subscription fees may be sent to a subscriptionfee pool allocator 314 in order to determine how much payment should allocated to each content owner orpublisher 310. Payment may be based on a percent of the subscription pool or it may be determined in other ways. A publisher payment may be determined on a retail pricing orwholesale pricing basis 318. The subscription fee pool allocator may also facilitate determining what portions of fees are related to a publisher'spayment 320. Apayment calculator 322 may determine a publisher's payment. The payment calculator may determine the publisher'spayment 320 based on thedevice size 324 that the user may be using to view content, or whether a sale of content is triggered 328. In a non-limiting example, a user X may have read one page of Book A before abandoning it; thus, Book A's sale is not triggered, and Book A's publisher will not receive a payment for user X's reading. Whether a sale of content is triggered 328 may be determined by a saletrigger determination function 330. The saletrigger determination function 330 may base its determination off of a user's reading behavior orinformation 334, such as, but not limited to, the percentage of the content viewed by theuser 302 or whether theuser 302 is a premium subscriber, among others. The saletrigger determination function 330 may additionally base its determination ofexternal factors 338, such as, but not limited to, whether the content was referred to theuser 302 by anotheruser 340. - In embodiments, the dynamic sample reading percentage may be used to determine when the subscription service provider may record a “sale” for a piece of content, therefore triggering a wholesale payment to a content owner, or sale trigger determination function. The sale trigger determination function may comprise querying the reading platform to indicate the first and last elements of each portion of the content. In a non-limiting example, the subscription service provider may query a reading platform to log the first and last elements of each page. These elements may then be recorded as HTML paths (similar to an XPATH expression) and is logged on a server. This information may produce a start and end tuple of all of the words each user has seen on the screen. By calculating the union of the tuples, the subscription service provider may determine the percentage of words that have appeared on the screen with respect to the total number of words that a book has.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a pricing module for clearing wholesale and retail pricing of electronic books where wholesale and retail pricing are not determined using the same unit basis. The pricing module may comprise a wholesale pricing model where a content provider is paid each time their content is consumed. Content may be “consumed” when a user reads beyond the sale trigger threshold. The sale trigger threshold may be determined when the first X % of content is consumed, rather than any X % of consumption. The subscription service provider may pay a fixed price for each book to the content owner.
- The pricing module may comprise a retail pricing model distinct from the wholesale model. The retail pricing model may comprise a payment system where a portion of payment given to a content provider is based on the weight of the content value in relation to other content owners in a pool. The payment system may be based on the weight of the amount of content provided by a certain owner in relation to other content owners in a pool. The wholesale and retail pricing models may be implemented in conjunction with each other, or independently. The model may comprise making payments to content owners based on the portion of content that is consumed as well as adjusting payments based on device type, or screen size.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a business model for revenue sharing based on electronic book related activity and device characteristics. The model may comprise implementing different subscription tiers. In a non-limiting example, premium members may have access to samples of new books, or may have preferred access to samples of new books. Likewise, the sale trigger threshold may be different when premium members consume content, as opposed to standard subscribing members. Premium members may have access to restricted content, or more restricted content than standard subscribers. Members may promote, share, or review content in order to unlock restricted content or discounts.
- Content or subscription restrictions may be implemented in various forms, such as, but not limited to, granting licensing or sale rights to different forms of media (e.g. complimentary TV episode for premium subscribers) or devices of a certain screen size (e.g. applications optimized only for devices of less than 6 inches), providing time-limited access to a piece of content in relation to the content's release date, or providing access to different slices of a subscription library. The model may comprise bundling a purchase of complementary pieces of content, such as, but not limited to, allowing users who buy a digital copy of a book to receive a discount for purchase of the print book. In a non-limiting example, a subscriber may have access to Book A on laptop, but may have to purchase an additional set of rights to access Book A via mobile phone.
- In embodiments, access to e-book content, or full access to content that is otherwise limited, may be based on location of the reader, such as detected by GPS, triangulation, or database access techniques, among other methods readily known to the art. For example, a reader may be given full access to textbooks while residing at the user's home (the location being stored and associated with the user's identifying information in a data storage facility associated with the system described herein) or at the user's academic institution, but the content may be locked at other locations, such as to prevent a user from giving away a subscription-based text book to another user. Access to a full version outside designated locations could be allowed only after undertaking additional access verification steps, such as having a user provide additional authentication details. Such digital rights management methods are readily known to the art. In another example, access to business-relevant content could be constrained to a location of a business enterprise. Employee access to sensitive documents may be conditionally provided while the employee is still on company premises, connected to a secure company signal, or both.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise conditional access to an electronic book based on location relative to a partner facility or network. The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise electronic book distribution with access terms based on location. In embodiments and referring to
FIG. 4 , content provided by a subscription service may be sealed, free, priced differently, or otherwise restricted to user access based on a user's 402 network connection information. In a non-limiting example, auser 402 may be able to access a sealed book from anelectronic database 404 when a user is at afirst location 408. The user'sdevice 410 may communicate the user's location via theInternet 412, to thedatabase 404, thus allowing theuser 402 access to the sealedelectronic book 414. In another non-limiting example, a user at asecond location 418 may access thedatabase 404 via theInternet 412 using the user'sdevice 410. The user may connect to theInternet 412 via a local area connection, such as a local Wi-Fi. Thedatabase 404 may detect that thatuser 402 is using the second location's 418 local connection and may grant access tofree content 422. In another non-limiting example, thedatabase 404 may detect that auser 402 is in athird location 420 via GPS and then offers a discount oncontent 424 to theuser 402. - In a non-limiting example of location based conditional access, users may be able to access a full book if they are in proximity to a partnered area or connected to a partner's network, such as, but not limited to, a coffee shop, airport, or mall, among others. Location information may be based on mobile device GPS location, wireless network access, and the like. Likewise, content may be exclusive to certain locations or networks. In another non-limiting example, Book A may be available only in Coffee Shops X, Y, and Z before its actual release date. Similarly, a preview of Book A may be made available if not the entire book. A user's location may also unlock promotional discounts to content. In a non-limiting example of location based discounting, premium services may be made available at a 20% discount when purchased at an airport, or when a user is connected to an inflight WiFi service.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a web-kit based e-book reader facilitating one-click reading on a mobile device. In embodiments and referring to
FIG. 5 , the reader may implement a method similar to “streaming” a book from the database to allow a user to start reading faster, rather than downloading and parsing the entire book file before displaying the book. The reader may provide downloads that occur in conjunction with reading, where initial views are instant. The streaming method may comprise breaking abook file 502 into smaller constituent sections 504 (either by chapter, chapter breaks, or any other logic section division). While the user is reading a section of the book, the next section of the book is passively cached 508 to provide a seamless transition fromsection 504 tosection 504 without having to wait. - In embodiments and in
FIG. 6 , the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a method for controlling user reading speed or jumping (“scrubbing”) 600 based on tracking the extent of content previously viewed. In embodiments, the reading platform may allow users to quickly navigate, scroll, or jump 602 between sections of content. In embodiments, this navigation method, or “scrubbing” may only be activated within the range of content that has been viewed. Users may only scrub (navigate quickly 604) to the farthest point that a user has viewed while reading unviewed material at aslower pace 608. In a non-limiting example, this functionality may prevent users from jumping to the last page of a book, thereby preserving the value of the sale trigger determination function. - In embodiments and in
FIG. 7 , the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a publisher analytics portal. The portal may provide analytics based on in-book user activity. The portal may receive directly or derive analytic metrics from metrics or values measured or determined by the recommendation engine, lifetime value calculator, or notification engine, among others. The portal may comprise aninteractive dashboard 702, where content owners may have access to theanalytics 704 and view graphical representations of data. The dashboard may also provide data in other formats, such as, but not limited to, downloading data in a comma separated values format. In a non-limiting example, the information provided by the analytics may be user demographics such as, but not limited to, age, gender, location, education level, among others, where users are in a book, if users drop off at page X, what makes a user more likely to read or select a book, among others. Content owners may be allowed to see what types ofbooks 710 are read by certain users, and may filterspecific results 708 based on different filter criteria in order to make sense of data. Such filtered results may be displayed graphically and compared with other filtered results so that content owners can easily understand the information provided by the portal. In a non-limiting example, a content owner may be able to use the portal to see not only where most people stopped reading, but where people of a certain age, gender, region, etc. stopped reading. In a non-limiting example, the content owner may be able to see what is popular amongst a population, or what is trending in a favorable or unfavorable direction. In yet another non-limiting example, the content owner may be able to view the relationship between different filtered data sets. The content owner may be able to see where users are in a particular book in real time. The content owner may be able to see where users who are reading a book are physically located in real time. In embodiments, the portal may be used to break down user reading behavior based on location, gender, device type, user acquisition channel, etc. or based on reading episode (such as, but not limited to, time of day, GPS location, whether an individual is commuting). Content developers may also use the portal to see where content is most effective or determine what subject matter draws in the most users via acontent trending indicator 712. The portal may also be used as a marketing tool to determine, among others, effectiveness of cover art, placement of book within a catalogue, pricing, revenue generation, etc. In embodiments, the portal may make recommendations to content owners or publishers about how to improve existing content or guidance on future content based on analytic metrics. In a non-limiting example, the portal may make a suggestion that an author re-write the third chapter if Book A if most readers stop reading Book A in the third chapter. In a similar non-limiting example, if all science fiction books with lead female characters are read avidly on the reading platform, but users still continue to search or look for more science fiction books with lead female characters, the portal may recommend that content owners generate more books of this type or acquire rights to such content. Various algorithms, statistical models, predictive models, simulations, and optimization models may be employed by the analytics portal to derive analytic results about the electronic books, and in-book reading activity, that are known to the art, such as, but not limited to, the various types described throughout this disclosure. Similarity models may account for similarity between books in the collection (based on content characteristics or on reading behavior of users within the books, among many other things) and similarity among readers (based on various demographic and psychographic factors, expressed preferences, and reading behavior within books in the collection). Grouping content and users by similarity may allow use of techniques such as collaborative filtering to generate effective recommendations for a user. An analytics portal may facilitate such grouping by allowing various factors to be used to determine what factors provide the most effective recommendations, for example. Predictive models may be used within the analytics portal to predict future behavior, such as future reading behavior of a user based on input data, such as past reading behavior of the user, past reading behavior of a user. Such models may also predict buying behavior, accounting for variables such as price, rate of abandonment, and the like. Such models may employ various forms of regression, simulation techniques, such as random walks and random forest algorithms, and Bayesian modeling techniques. The analytics portal may include various visualization techniques, such as heat maps and clustering visualization techniques, to show degrees of connection between, for example, items in the collection, readers of such items, and the like. The analytics portal may enable optimization techniques, such as use of machine learning (e.g., using a neural network), to refine and optimize actions, such as recommendations, based on feeding back a desired outcome along with historical data about various data collected within the platform. - In embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a system for displaying usage based on analytics that report the individual and the aggregate behaviors of readers in a subscription based media model. The analytics may derived from a user's reader behavior to that user's interests (such as, but not limited to, a user's FACEBOOK interests or TWITTER hashtags) or non-reading behavior (such as but not limited to, GOOGLE ADWORDS search terms) and targeting new users based on these interests and behaviors. Additionally, a user's reading behavior, in particular the frequency with which they consume media, may be also be used in conjunction with how the user was referred to the media in order to target new users. In embodiments, data from third party resources relating to a book may be gathered in order to augment or facilitate the derivation of e-book related analytics. Such third party resources may be data providers such as FACEBOOK, TWITTER, LIBRARYTHING, or a user's phone contacts, among others. Furthermore, analytics may be derived based on similarities amongst a group of multiple users, including their monitored in-book data as well as other activities. Analytics may be derived for users based on the similarity of other books accessed within the database or similarities between the user's ratings or the user's reading patterns. Such analytics may be derived in conjunction with a user's behavior as reported by the third party resources. Analytics may be used to enable the collaborative filtering to identify users that share preferences for different types of third party resources as they relate to a user's reading preferences or habits. In a non-limiting example, the analytics may be used to filter results to show correlations between users that enjoy murder mystery novels and users that are active on FACEBOOK. Such analytics may be useful for marketing purposes, such as advertising new murder mystery books on the user's FACEBOOK home pages or providing exclusive invitations to a popular murder mystery author's book signing, among other uses.
- In embodiments and in
FIG. 8 , the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a reading platform native to various operating systems, including, but not limited to, iOS and Android. In embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a reading platform with vertical pagination and vertical scrolling 814 based onsuch pagination 800. In embodiments, the platform may allow users to select text across pages. In embodiments, the reading platform may comprise an electronic media data renderer 802 (such as, but not limited to, an EPUB renderer), which is built on top of a layout engine 804 (such as, but not limited to, WebKit). In embodiments, the method of creating a vertically paginated effect may comprise separating content into smaller constituent sections 808 comprisingviewing content 818, such as book text. The method may comprise graphically representing the smaller constituent sections in anon-detailed content format 810, such as a screenshot. The method may comprise using the non-detailed content format in conjunction with the viewing content in order to create the effect of vertical pagination. In a non-limiting example, each EPUB chapter may be split into horizontally laid out columns using programming methods such as, but not limited to, CSS3 columns. The effect may be hidden from the user, by making the columns the width of the screen, only showing one column at a time. The method of creating a vertically paginated effect may comprise taking a screenshot of the previous and next pages and placing them above and below the currently displayed column in the webview 812. The illusion may be maintained through the page turns by replacing the screenshot of the next page with the actual webview text once the text has come onto the screen a certain distance. The text that was previously shown in in the webview may then be replaced with a screenshot. - In embodiments and in
FIG. 9 , the reading platform may determine the extent of reading an electronic book based on device-specific user view page boundary words. Such a determination may require determining the page size and viewable content area for a specific device, such as a page displayed on a tablet device. Such a determination may be standardized, and the formula to determine this standardization may be the same for each book in the collection. In embodiments, the reading platform may comprise a view-page word method 900 to determine the extent of reading an electronic book by determining the page size of a user'scontent viewing device 902, then determining the amount of viewable content that can be displayed based on thedetermined page size 904. The platform may further determine the first word or tuple of words of aparticular page 908. Additionally, the platform may determine the last word or tuple of words of multiplesequential pages 910. By determining the first word or tuple of words of a section viewed and the last word, or tuple of words of the section viewed, the platform may be able to determine the extent of reading that the user read of the electronic book during thecurrent reading session 912. The platform may additionally determine the extent of reading of a book across multiple reading sessions, thus leading to a determination of the total amount of a book the user has read inaggregate 914. The sale trigger determination function may be implemented consistently across different devices. In a non-limiting example, a user's reading habits may be aggregated; a user who reads 2% of a book via phone, 5% via tablet, and 3% via an online web application will be accounted for 10% of the book by the sale trigger determination function. - The threshold in which a sale is triggered may be negotiated with content owners. Content that is referred from users to other users may have higher or lower sale trigger thresholds than content that is directly provided to users from content owners. The sale trigger thresholds may also vary based on other variables, such as, but not limited to, user's subscription type, device settings, demographic, among others. The recommendation and notification engines may account for sale threshold triggers when providing recommendations or notifications.
- In embodiments and as depicted in
FIG. 10 , the electronic content provided by content owners may be updated or changed. Content owners may choose to include alternate endings or rewritten passages, amongother modifications 1002. In such instances, the user's or reader'smodifications 1004 may still be maintained despite changes to the original content by the publisher modifications. A content owner's modifications or publisher's modifications may be downloaded 1008, and the platform may identify and save locations where a user had modified theoriginal content 1010. The user modifications may then be identified 1012 in the updated content and then re-associated with a location in the updatedcontent 1014. In a non-limiting the platform may use keywords or a tuple of keywords to identify the location of user modifications of original content, then identify the location of the corresponding keywords or tuple of keywords within the updated content, and then integrate and display the user modifications of the original content in conjunction with the updated content. - In embodiments, the user modifications may be provided to a content owner or publisher. Once a user modifies content, the publisher or content owner may be alerted to the user's modification. Such an alert may be delivered via the analytics portal, described in later portions of the disclosure herein. Content owners and publishers may then choose to respond to the modifications. Such an interaction may provide publishers and content owners insight into user preferences as well as providing an interactive editing system. In a non-limiting example, a publisher or content owner may put out a manuscript of a book, asking users to comment on the content of the manuscript or ask for suggestions. Such collaborative modification efforts may also be used as a marketing tool. For instance, a publisher or content owner may hold a contest to see which readers can come up with the best ending to a story or create a new character to inject into a book. Content owners may also use the alerts to detect errors in continuity or errors such as typos that may have slipped past the editing process. In embodiments, publishers or content owners may respond directly or indirectly to a user's modifications. Such an interaction may enhance a reader's own experience or provide content owners and publishers valuable insight into their targeted market.
- In embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a method for generating a passive book list based on observed reading behavior. In embodiments, the method may comprise passively aggregating books into lists based on observed reading behavior, the data for which may come from the recommendation engine or lifetime value calculator, among others. In a non-limiting example, a book may be put into a “Read” list after reading a certain percentage or certain amount in the book. The method may comprise analyzing a reader's explicit actions as well as implicit actions, including omissions. In a non-limiting example, a book for which a user views a preview multiple times but does not buy may be put in a “To Read” list.
- In embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may comprise a method for sharing electronic book reading behavior based on passive signals. Methods and systems in this disclosure have provided for sharing behavior based on active signals, such as actively selecting a book to recommend for a friend or posting a user's reading progress to a social media site. Such notifications may be provided based on passive signals as well. In embodiments, the reading platform may provide a collection of electronic books, allowing users to access content view their content viewing devices. The platform may monitor a user's access to an electronic book collection, such as, but not limited to, via a user interface. The platform may also monitor a user's in-book activity as well. Based on the monitored in-book activity and access (e.g. browsing behaviors) the platform may automatically generate a notification to user's contacts that are accessible through an external source, such as a social media account, TWITTER followers, FACEBOOK friends, and the like. Such notifications may alert others to the user's access and in-book activity. The notifications may also be provided to others that have access to the collection of electronic books. The notifications may comprise advertisements or recommendations or indicate that user has previewed or selected a book. Such passive notifications may also be used to encourage games or competitions on the platform. In a non-limiting example, the platform may passively note a user's progress while reading a certain book, notifying a friend, then challenging that friend to exceed that progress.
