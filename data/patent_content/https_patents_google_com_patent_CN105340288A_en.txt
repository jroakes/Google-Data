Embodiment
General introduction
As in the background section mention, traditional program guide arranges the information comprised in the guide by two-dimensional grid.Usually, an axle of grid is relevant with channel identifier, school or certain other classification, and another axle is relevant with the time.Such arrangement is enough, but can improve and/or simplify.Such as, when using channel number, this forces user to remember channel number, channel block or channel name and/or relative position.This also means that all content viewables being derived from specified channel must once be illustrated and can not based on its correlation or significance distribution on guide.In addition, in order to useful and easy to remember to individual content consumer and make to cross over other guide consumer display and reuse these channel numbers, must to whole broadcast area and all subsets to the channel that any one content consumer is subscribed to, by single fixed numbers series arrangement channel.Assuming that these constraints, create the reasonable and noticeable channel order being used for any single content consumer and wish seldom.Dissimilar channel inevitably placed adjacent.In addition, even if when not using channel identifier, to carry out or the program that almost completes may have the weight identical with the program just started or be about to start in guide.This makes to be difficult to the content-based remaining time makes user concentrate on better selection.Such as, also remain 2 hours films of 30 minutes and be endowed the weight equal with just starting 30 minutes programs, assuming that content consumer is unlikely interested in the film almost terminated soon, and more interesting to the program started at present, it is irrational result.In fact, consider that 2 hours films also have 1 hour remaining situation.This cin positive film is carrying out, and therefore, most content consumer is unlikely interested in.On the other hand, the program starting 30 minutes is more noticeable.Even now, presents movie listings by use size actual in the screen of 30 minutes program twices, therefore visually gives higher weight, even if film makes the less possibility of the more interesting existence of content consumer than 30 minutes programs.Therefore, the use of time shaft can be unnecessarily complicated and even anti-directly perceived or do not reach re-set target.
Most of traditional guide also lacking individuality and present identical content for each user.If user shows the preference to some program, school, classification etc., based on the behavior in past, this is not reflected by channel guide usually.Particularly, user can not be directed to the optimal selection relative to the preference exposed usually.In addition, traditional guide also lacks any rank of content usually.
Theme disclosed herein relates to can be more useful than other guides and more effectively and program guide that is simpler, that more intuitively and/or more easily strengthen.Such as, the program guide of enhancing can save traditional channel time grid of relevant field direct broadcast or other suitable contents.On the contrary, can according to for comprising the relevance score/rank of program in the guide, arrange and just to broadcast from multiple channel or the Programming content of schedule broadcast.Although it should be noted that the airtime (or even source channel) can be the factor determining relevance score, presenting of guide can independent of traditional layout axle, i.e. channel and the time.
First and list in order program title can be rendered as ordered list, and in some implementations, and this list can only based on relevance score, and those titles usually with high correlation score value.Can, based on one or more filtering query, the lattice of guide or unit be made to be filled with title.Filter can comprise the school, classification, quality (such as high definition, SD etc.), remaining time, preference or parameter, in real time popularity (such as, a large amount of or tendency spectators just call in), the period factor etc. that are suitable for specific user's (or user profiles).
Example program guide
Various aspects of the present disclosure or feature are described with reference to the drawings, wherein, identical reference number in the whole text in be used to refer to for identical element.In this manual, many concrete details are set forth to provide thorough understanding of the present disclosure.However, it should be understood that can when not having these details or disclosed in some by practice when additive method, assembly, material etc.In other instances, illustrate that very known structure and equipment are so that describe open theme in form of a block diagram.
Should recognize that user can select to exit the personal information, demographic information, positional information, private information, sensitive information, machine information etc. that provide about data acquisition aspect according to one or more realizations described in the disclosure.In addition, one or more realization described herein can provide the anonymous data of collecting, receiving or transmitting.
With reference now to Fig. 1, describe system 100.System 100 especially can create the program guide of the enhancing that can present independent of channel axis and time shaft.The embodiment disclosed herein such as can reduce the various problems be associated with other guides, such as this describe in detail, due to guide presented those problems depending on channel axis or time shaft and produce.System 100 can comprise store computer can executive module memory and perform the computer that stores in memory can the processor of executive module, its example can be found with reference to figure 9.Should recognize that computer 902 can in conjunction with the one or more uses realizing shown in composition graphs 1 and other figure disclosed herein and in described system or assembly.As described, system 100 can comprise data package 102, analytic unit 112 and guide component 118.
Data package 102 can be configured to receive the programme schedule data 104 for one group of channel 106, and it can comprise the individual channel 106 of arbitrary number N substantially
1-106
n, after this separately or be referred to as channel 106, usually only when useful or just adopt suitable subscript when being convenient to outstanding various difference or better informing disclosed concept.The title 108 that programme schedule data 104 can be included in the program of broadcast on channel 106 and the time 110 be associated with the broadcast of program.Usually, the set of channel 106 is by relevant with TV or cable channel, and it is different from single supplier or even multiple suppliers order program service.Such as, be different from the problem be associated for live guide with for not according to the problem that the guide of the order program service of predetermined schedule broadcast content is associated.
Analytic unit 112 can be configured to the correlation rank 114 determining to be associated with program.The determination of correlation rank 114 can be completed in every way, describe in detail further combined with Fig. 5.In some implementations, correlation rank 114 can be determined based on input data 116, also also will describe in detail in this article further combined with Fig. 5.
Guide component 118 can be configured to the title 108 selecting for being included in program guide 120 based on correlation rank 114.Guide component 118 can determine the position of title 108 in program guide 120 based on correlation rank 114 further.Guide component 118 should be understood and can be convenient to present program guide 120 independent of the channel 106 be associated with broadcast and the mode of time 110.Therefore, such presenting is different from the difficulty that other guides and solution or minimizing are associated with other guides, and this is described in further detail combining Fig. 2 A-4 quoted with reference to figure 1.
Forward now Fig. 2 A and 2B to, provide diagram 200 and 210.Diagram 200 describes the single file example of program guide 120.In this case, first listing the first program title 202, is then second program title 204 etc. to the last program title 206.The user interface element (not shown) that can provide and realize rolling with certain form or filter should be provided.Usually, being used for the title 108 of filler cells 202 is associated with the program receiving most high correlation rank 114 from the whole or subset by the set broadcast of channel 106 or the program of schedule broadcast.The title 108 be associated with next most high correlation rank 114 can be supplied to unit 204 etc. until be included in unit 206 by the title 108 of the minimum correlation rank 114 having minimum correlation rank 114 or meet specific threshold (such as numerical ranks threshold value or title quantity threshold limit).
The diagram 210 of Fig. 2 B describes the example based on grid of program guide 120.Diagram 210 is substantially similar with diagram 200, the title 108 be associated with the program with most high correlation rank 114 is present in unit 212, have and be present in unit 214 compared with low correlation rank 114, and there is minimum correlation rank 114 (in visible element) be present in unit 216.
Should realize and understand diagram 200 and 210 and other diagrams of providing at this, not rely on channel dimension or axle or time dimension or axle and present guide 120.Like this, same to a line (or extended formatting dimension) can be arranged in from the title 108 of not homology channel and the title with different broadcast start time can be arranged in same row (or dimension of extended formatting).Such as, unit 212 can be filled in the first title 108 started with the second title 108 same time shown at unit 214, although unit 212 and unit 214 are present in the different lines to other guides normally time shaft, are therefore infeasible concerning other guides.First title 108 and the second title 108 can also be derived from different channel, even if both are all in the same a line concerning being generally channel axis other guides.In addition, because time shaft form is not depended in presenting of program guide 120, the size of unit 202-216 does not directly depend on the running length of the program that is associated and/or the remaining time of the program that is associated.
With reference now to Fig. 3, present diagram 300.Diagram 300 provides the multi-class example of program guide 120.In this example, various classification and/or school 302 can exist, such as, as additional filter.Such as, to " comedy " school 302, the title in existing unit in the same row can be symbolized according to specific genre 302.Before the title 108 with the program of high correlation rank 114 can be positioned at the title 108 had compared with the program of low correlation rank 114 again, but usually, title 108 is only competed in respective classes.Such as, the first module of " love story " school 302 is filled with the title 108 of the correlation rank 114 lower than last unit be associated with " comedy " school 302 usually.
Fig. 4 provides figure to illustrate 400.Figure diagram 400 describes the example physical model of example program guide 120.As shown, various program title 108 can be listed according to the correlation rank 114 be associated.In addition, can filter based on the classification/school 302 selected the title 108 listed.As other examples comprised at this, presenting of title 108 can not rely on source channel or time dimension.Therefore, the title 108 from not homology channel 106 can in the same row and the size of unit and/or title icon can independent of the running time of the program that is associated.
Forward now Fig. 5 and 6 to, illustrate Figure 50 0 and system 600.Figure 50 0 is provided for the various exemplary factor determining correlation rank 114.Such as, analytic unit 112 can adopt these exemplary factor 502-514 and determine the combination in any of other suitable factors of correlation rank 114.Should be understood that exemplary factor 502-514 should not think restriction, but concrete example.In some implementations, analytic unit 112 is used for determining that the data at least partially of correlation rank 114 can be received as input data 116, and it can comprise a part of data relevant with exemplary factor 502-514.
The system 600 that is cited of composition graphs 1 and 5 can provide other feature about analytic unit 112 or details.Analytic unit 112 can determine correlation rank 114 based on data dispatching 104 and input data 116 (can be relevant with factor 502-514).Correlation rank 114 can be determined based on various statistical technique, and described statistical technique comprises such as machine learning, cluster, recurrence etc., and can comprise multiple ranking model, can use wherein any one or all determine correlation rank 114.Usually, can by multiple ranking model (such as, the first ranking model 602
1, the second ranking model 602
2...) be applied to specific to model or the data of specific genre supported by it or the data set of being associated, be hereafter described in further detail.
Still with reference to figure 5, school and/or classification 502 can be in the factor determining to be adopted by analytic unit 112 in correlation rank 114.School is usually relevant with the classification of the theme of program, classify such as comedy, reasoning, news etc., and classification is usually relevant with the school of the works that program is associated, the such as series play of described classification, feature film etc.Classification can also refer to the non-genre classification relevant with content consumer, such as Oscar winner, new product release, present trend etc.School/classification 502, by itself being relevant or being relevant by other factor 504-514, provides its example at this.
In certain embodiments, analytic unit 112 can determine correlation rank 114 based on the time quantum before starting with program or remaining time quantum or the relevant time adjustment 504 of percentage remaining time.Time adjustment 504 can from current time and time started compare or the remaining time of program is determined.Should be understood that program that scheduling starts now or very is soon usually than carrying out maybe by more attractive for the program terminated.
But, there is some exception.Such as, though when broadcast will at the end of, the program relevant with news, weather etc. still has high attraction usually.In fact, some program can have higher attraction, such as sports cast (such as, close to score or play-off competition) or game shows (such as, Jeopardy, AmericanIdol etc.) than during beginning at the end of broadcast closes on.Therefore, in certain embodiments, the time can be adjusted the function that 504 are used as school/classification 502 by analytic unit 112, wherein, with compared with the second school/classification 502, concerning the first school/classification 502, time adjustment 504 can affect correlation rank 114 more significantly.Such as, if program well afoot, the correlation rank 114 for feature film may be punished sharp, and if for correlation rank 114 well afoot of news program, then may run into very little or without punishment.
This has come by the one or more ranking model 602 be associated with analytic unit 112.As an example, the value pair of a series of n length can be provided, such as 10:3,12:5,13:9,15:25,40:50,90:10.First value can represent that the Percent Complete of the program that is associated and the second value can represent the weight be associated with punishment (or award) being applied to the correlation rank 114 that is associated.N length value between, can applicable line or the sweep close to median.Should recognize that only to need 1 value right, because can be inferred other, comprise starting point (representing that program starts, non-Applicative time adjustment weight) and the end point 100:100 of 0:0.In the above described manner, time Dynamic gene 504 seriously can punish such as ongoing film, and not seriously (or not) punish ongoing sports cast.In addition, can pre-determine and the various different profile of the program of specific genre/classification 502 can be upgraded termly.Particularly, different profile can be utilized based on program running time (such as, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes etc.).
Language can be adopted to adjust 506 by analytic unit 112 to determine or weighted correlation rank 114.By checking that the equipment be associated with content consumer or the application be associated with equipment are arranged (such as applicational language setting), determine language adjustment 506.Based on the Internet protocol geolocation techniques for equipment, language adjustment 506 can also be determined.Based on these or other technologies, by punishment or the correlation rank 114 being applied to given program can be rewarded.Such as, the content consumer Spanish being chosen as the U.S. that application is arranged also probably understands some English.Like this, Spanish program can be made to raise supposition 50%, and make english programs punish supposition 50%.On the contrary, in language is arranged, select the content consumer of the U.S. of English to have and understand Spanish lower possibility.Therefore, english programs can be made to raise supposition 80%, and make Spanish program punish supposition 95%.This has the effect making Spanish content shift " frame tail " onto, and can be used in mode cleverly, and such as, in country variant and/or place, what realize language enriches reasoning.Such as, the said multilingual of single country can be supported in, and this can based on relative percentage.In addition, renewal can be provided in real time.
In certain embodiments, analytic unit 112 can determine correlation rank 114 based on media content quality 508 (such as high definition (HD), SD (SD) etc.), and this media content quality 508 can be determined based on the history be associated with the equipment of content consumer or other features be associated with equipment or the feature (such as bandwidth etc.) be associated with network or operator.As an example, if history disclosure consumer is with the browsed great majority of SD or full content, so with regard to media content quality 508 factor, SD program may be more identical or higher a little than HD receiving.But, if content consumer is in the past with the browsed many programs of HD, so can than SD program more heavily Weighted H D program.About other factors of the great majority described in detail at this, can upgrade media content quality 508 in real time.
In certain embodiments, analytic unit 112 can adjust 510 based on personalization and determines correlation rank 114.Personalized adjustment 510 can based on the input data 116 received from the equipment be associated with content consumer, such as program or other gradings, browsing histories, preference or setting etc.In addition, the ranking model 602 that can be different from by application other the ranking model 602 that the input data 116 about other types adopt is determined personalizedly to adjust 510.Should recognize that the ranking model 602 be associated with the media content of other types (such as on-demand content) can be different from the ranking model 602 for content of broadcasting live.Therefore, in certain embodiments, to the program be associated with on-the-spot broadcasting, ranking model 602 is trained clearly.Adjusting 510 technology be associated by adopting with personalization, the another affinity factor can be expressed in conjunction with correlation rank 114.Can according to correlation rank 114, promote the program with similar content and degradation has the program of not similar content.
