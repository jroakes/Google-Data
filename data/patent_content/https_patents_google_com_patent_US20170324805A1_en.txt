- the campaign tool can also include one or more controls for adding a geographic area to a campaign, excluding a geographic area from the campaign, or presenting a map of a geographic area.
- the account management user interface can also present, such as in response to the content provider 108 selecting a particular completion, one or more geographic areas that are nearby the geographic area associated with the completion.
- a nearby geographic location can be, for example, adjacent, proximate or including (e.g., enclosing) the geographic area associated with the completion.
- the content provider 108 can select one or more of the nearby geographic areas to indicate that the selected geographic area(s) are to be added to the campaign or excluded from the campaign.
- the content management system 110 can provide support for classifying geographic information.
- the content management system 110 can provide a flexible geographic hierarchy of labels, which can be represented by geographic information stored in a data store 124 .
- the flexible geographic hierarchy can be used to classify geographic locations.
- the content management system 110 can, for example, classify a geographic location in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy, which can include assigning respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the geographic location, including assigning one or more labels to the geographic location.
- the flexible hierarchy can enable, for example, the content management system 110 to assign a different number of labels to a first geographic location than a number of labels previously assigned to a second geographic location.
- the city of Chicago can be associated with city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States”, respectively, and a country such as Barbados can be represented by a single, country label of “Barbados”.
- the flexible geographic hierarchy is described in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 17 and 18 .
- FIGS. 2 to 13 illustrate example account management user interfaces provided by the content management system 110 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example user interface 200 for developing a content campaign.
- a user such as a campaign sponsor, can select a tab 202 to display a campaign area 204 .
- the user can edit an existing campaign in the campaign area 204 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 206 ) in a campaign list 208 .
- the campaign area 204 or a similar interface can be used to create a new campaign.
- the campaign sponsor can select a control 210 to display campaign settings in the campaign area 204 .
- the campaign settings can include, among other settings, location settings 212 included in a locations and languages settings area 214 .
- the location settings 212 include controls 216 , which allow the campaign sponsor to specify in which geographic location(s) the campaign sponsor desires a user to be present in (and/or, in some implementations, express an interest in) for content items to be presented to the user.
- the campaign sponsor can select a control 218 to specify that the campaign sponsor desires content items to be presented in all countries and territories.
- the campaign sponsor can select a control 220 , 222 , or 224 to specify that the campaign sponsor desires content items to be presented in a particular geographic location (e.g., the United States, the San Francisco metro area, or the city of Mountain View, Calif., respectively).
- a particular geographic location e.g., the United States, the San Francisco metro area, or the city of Mountain View, Calif., respectively.
- the locations that are displayed in the controls 220 , 222 , and 224 can be based, for example, on location information included in a campaign sponsor's profile or can be based on locations otherwise associated with the campaign sponsor (such as locations the campaign sponsor has previously targeted).
- three controls 220 , 222 , and 224 corresponding to geographical hierarchy levels of country, region, and city, are displayed, more or fewer controls that are associated with more or fewer geographical hierarchy levels can be displayed. For example, if the campaign sponsor historically has only targeted entire countries or entire states, then a state-related or a country-related control can be displayed instead of the controls 220 , 222 , and 224 .
- a location associated with the campaign sponsor may be associated with different and/or a different number of geographical hierarchy levels than the country, region, and city levels associated with the controls 220 , 222 , and 224 .
- the campaign sponsor may have historically targeted Philippines users and may have previously identified locations in the Philippines to target by selecting particular villages (e.g., barangays), cities, provinces, and regions with the Philippines.
- village e.g., barangays
- cities, provinces, and regions with the Philippines e.g., barangays
- five controls can be displayed which represent a most frequently targeted village, city, province, and region within the Philippines, and the country of the Philippines, respectively.
- the campaign sponsor can select a corresponding control.
- the campaign sponsor may desire to further customize locations to be targeted by the campaign. In such a situation, the user can select a control 226 to choose one or more other geographic locations.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example user interface 300 which allows the user to provide one or more geographic locations.
- a search control 304 can be displayed. The user can use the control 304 to provide a country name, city name, region name, or the name of some other geographic location.
- one or more search completions can be displayed, where each search completion represents a geographic location which matches the user input.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 400 which includes a search completions area 401 .
- the search completions area 401 includes search completions 406 - 416 (e.g., corresponding to the cities of Chicago, Chicago Heights, and Chicago Ridge, Chicago 0'Hare International Airport, the Chicago metro area, and the unincorporated Chicago Park, Calif., respectively, with the city of Chicago completion 406 being a top match.
- the search completions area 401 also includes completions 418 , 420 , and 422 , corresponding to geographic areas of the Chicago metro area, the state of Illinois, and the United States, each being geographic areas which include the top match of the city of Chicago.
- the search completions area 401 can update automatically in response to each change of the text 402 to show completions corresponding to the current value of the text 402 . In some implementations, if no locations match the text 402 , an error message can be displayed. In some implementations, determining completions for the text 402 can include identifying completions that match a spelling-error correction of the text 402 . For example, if the user enters the text “Chcago” into the search control 404 , the search completions area 401 can display completions for “Chicago”, as shown.
- Each of the completions 406 - 422 can include corresponding estimated reach information.
- the estimated reach information indicates a number of unique users who may be exposed to a particular content item.
- the completion 406 includes reach information 424 which indicates that the city of Chicago includes 2,695,333 unique users who may be exposed to a particular content item.
- Each of the completions 406 - 422 can be selectable, and upon selection of a completion, a corresponding geographic location can be displayed in a map user interface.
- Each completion can include one or more labels, where each label is associated with a respective level in a geographic hierarchy that includes the location associated with the completion.
- the completion 406 includes city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States”, respectively.
- the completion 420 includes state and country labels of “Illinois” and “United States”, respectively.
- Each completion can include an indicator which indicates the type of location associated with the completion.
- the completion 406 includes a city indicator 430
- the completion 414 includes a metro indicator 432
- the completion 420 includes a state indicator 434
- the completion 422 includes a country indicator 436 .
- Other indicators are possible, including one or more badges such as limited reach badges discussed in greater detail below.
- the user can add a geographic location corresponding to a particular completion 406 - 422 to the campaign. For example, the user can add the geographic location of the city of Chicago corresponding to the completion 406 to the campaign by selecting an add control 438 . Similarly, the user can exclude the geographic location corresponding to the completion 406 from the campaign by selecting an exclude control 440 . In some implementations, the user can add the top completion 406 to the campaign by pressing an “enter” key. A list of added (e.g., selected) and excluded geographic locations can be displayed to the user.
- a warning or indicator can be displayed to the user, for example, if the user adds or attempts to add the same location twice or if the user adds and excludes the same location.
- an indicator or warning can be displayed if the user either adds or excludes both an enclosing location (e.g., the state of Illinois) and an enclosed location (e.g., the city of Chicago).
- the indicator can be a “badge” that is displayed next to the location name, such as in a selected locations list or in an excluded locations list.

If locations that the user desires to target are not displayed within the locations-within-target list 1110 (or if too many locations are included), the user can adjust the size of the circle 1108 using the controls 1107 .
- the locations corresponding to the entries 1112 - 1118 can be determined, for example, by determining a relationship of each of multiple candidate locations that are identified as being proximate to the circle 1108 . For example, for each candidate location, it can be determined whether the candidate location is entirely enclosed within the circle 1108 , partially overlapping the circle 1108 , outside of but within a threshold distance of the circle 1108 , or outside of and more than a threshold distance from the circle 1108 . In some implementations, nearby locations can be identified as candidate locations that are entirely enclosed within the circle 1108 , overlap the circle 1108 by more than a threshold amount, or are outside of but within a threshold distance of the circle 1108 .
- Each of the entries 1112 - 1118 include estimated reach information and controls to add the corresponding location to the campaign, exclude the location from the campaign, or to see the location on the map 1106 .

- the map 1202 also includes markers 1224 , 1226 , and 1228 which correspond to the locations of Addison, Villa Park, and Bellwood, Ill., which are each also located within the target area 1215 .
- the markers 1208 - 1214 and 1224 - 1228 are illustrated by corresponding outlines (e.g., an outline 1229 ) which mark the borders of the associated locations.
- the locations-within-target list does not currently display entries associated with the markers 1224 - 1228
- the locations-within-target list 1223 can include entries associated with the markers 1224 - 1228 and the user can use a scroll control 1230 to view such entries.
- the user can select a control 1232 to hide the markers 1208 - 1214 and 1224 - 1228 and associated outlines.
- FIG. 13 illustrates an example user interface 1300 which includes a limited reach indicator or badge 1302 .
- the limited reach indicator can be used as an indicator that the content delivery system has limited information about the location, such as for example, limited information about the estimated reach that is associated with the location.
- the limited reach indicator 1302 is included in an entry 1304 in a selected locations list 1306 , where the entry 1304 corresponds to a location of the barangay of Bilibiran, which is within the city of Binangonan, the province of Rizal, and the region of CALABARZON, in the Philippines.
- a barangay can be, for example, a village that is a subset of a larger municipality.
- a marker 1308 on a map 1310 marks the barangay of Bilibiran and an outline 1312 marks the border of Bilibiran.
- the limited reach indicator can also be displayed for a suggested location, an enclosing location, a nearby location, a location within a target, or other types of locations where the system has limited information about the estimated reach.
- the limited reach indicator 1302 can be shown when a confidence level related to available estimated reach information is less than a threshold level. For example, a confidence level may be reduced if a content management system does not determine a threshold confidence level regarding a user's location based on the IP address of the user. For example, the content management system may not have sufficient data regarding which IP addresses correspond to a specific location, (e.g., the Bilibiran location). Content may still be targeted to users in a limited reach designated location, but the results may be much more difficult to predict.
- a confidence level related to available estimated reach information is less than a threshold level. For example, a confidence level may be reduced if a content management system does not determine a threshold confidence level regarding a user's location based on the IP address of the user. For example, the content management system may not have sufficient data regarding which IP addresses correspond to a specific location, (e.g., the Bilibiran location). Content may still be targeted to users in a limited reach designated location, but the results may be much more difficult to predict.

- a map can include a targeting area defined by a radius selected by a user.
- the user interface 1100 of FIG. 11 includes a map 1106 which includes a targeting area 1108 defined by a location corresponding to user input provided using the control 1102 and a radius provided using the controls 1107 .
- One or more geographic locations that are nearby the one or more geographic locations associated with the campaign are automatically presented to the content sponsor ( 1604 ), including presenting candidate nearby geographic locations and estimated reach information along with each candidate geographic location.
- one or more candidate nearby geographic locations can be identified, where each candidate nearby geographic location is nearby an existing geographic location associated with the campaign.
- nearby can be defined as being either adjacent, overlapping, proximate, or including (e.g., enclosing) an existing geographic area.

- a map e.g., the map 1202
- a location e.g., corresponding to the contents of the control 1206
- a circular targeting area e.g., the targeting area 1215
- one or more candidate nearby geographic locations are identified as being at least partially included in a circle formed by the radius corresponding to the control 1216 centered on the location identified by the marker 1204 .
- a selection of one or more candidate geographic locations for inclusion in the campaign is received ( 1606 ).

- the targeting area 1215 in response to selection of the add control included in the entry 1217 , can be updated (e.g., expanded) so that the targeting area 1215 includes the location representing the city of Bensenville, Ill. marked by the marker 1208 .
- FIG. 17 is a flowchart of an example process 1700 for determining and using labels for geographic locations.
- the process 1700 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- the process 1700 may be performed by one or more computing devices or systems.
- a first geographic location is identified ( 1702 ).
- a geographic location can be identified, for example, in response to a content sponsor entering a search string into a search control. For example, with respect to FIG. 3 , the content sponsor can enter the text 402 representing the city of Chicago into the search control 404 .
- the geographic location can be identified when one or more search completions are provided, such as the completions 406 - 422 .
- the geographic location can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a search completion, such as the completion 406 .
- the geographic location can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a geographic location that is selected for or excluded from the campaign, such as, with respect to FIG. 6 , the entries 608 or 609 in the selected locations list 610 or the entry 613 in the excluded locations list 614 .
- the determining can include associating one or more labels with the first geographic location, where each label is associated with a respective level in the geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic location. For example, if the first geographic location is the city of Chicago (e.g., corresponding to the completion 406 ), city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States” can be associated with the first geographic location.
- the hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location can include country, metropolitan area, city and at least one other hierarchical level (e.g., state).
- the geographic location of Chicago Heights Ill. corresponding to the completion 408 can be associated with country, metropolitan area, city, and state hierarchical levels (e.g., corresponding to United States, Chicago metro area, Chicago Heights, and Illinois, respectively).
- the hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location might not include at least one or more of metropolitan area or city. For example, if the first geographic location is in a small country, such as Barbados (e.g., corresponding to the marker 611 as shown in FIG. 6 ), then one hierarchical level (e.g., just country) may be associated with the first geographic location.
- a small country such as Barbados (e.g., corresponding to the marker 611 as shown in FIG. 6 )
- one hierarchical level e.g., just country
- a hierarchical level associated with the first geographic location may be a political district, and another hierarchical level associated with the first geographic location, may be unrelated to the political district.
- the city of Chicago e.g., outlined by the outline 1010
- the 6 th Congressional district of Illinois e.g., outlined by the outline 1021 . That is, the city of Chicago is related to more than one legislative district, and the 6 th Congressional district of Illinois is related to more than one city.
- a second, different geographic location is identified ( 1706 ).
- the barangay of Bilibiran can be identified, such as in response to the user adding the barangay of Bilibiran to a campaign, or in response to the user selecting the entry 1304 or the marker 1308 .
- the content management system 110 can determine one or more different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy to associate with the second, different geographic location than a number of levels in the geographic hierarchy associated with the first geographic location. For instance, in the example where the first geographic location is the city of Chicago, the first geographic location can be associated with three levels in the geographic hierarchy (e.g., city, state, and country). If the second geographic location is the barangay of Bilibiran, the second geographic location can be associated with five levels (e.g., barangay, city, province, region, and country). The determining can also include associating one or more labels for the one or more different number of levels with the second different geographic location.
- the second geographic location is the barangay of Bilibiran
- one or more of the labels of “Bilibiran”, “Binangonan”, “Rizal”, “CALABARZON”, and the “Philippines” can be associated with the second geographic location, for example, as illustrated by the entry 1304 in FIG. 13 .
- the number of levels associated with the first geographic location may be the same as or different than the number of levels associated with the second geographic location, and the number of levels associated with either the first or the second geographic location can be any number of levels.
- the number of levels associated with a first geographic location can be less than three (e.g., just country, as in the example of Barbados), and the number of levels associated with the second geographic location can be three or more (e.g., as in the examples of using city, state, and country, and using barangay, city, province, region, and country).

Abstract
Configurations for providing a multi-tier hierarchy to manage geographical data are disclosed. The subject technology identifies a first geographic location and determines where, in a geographic hierarchy, the first location belongs, including associating one or more labels with the first location. Each label is associated with a respective level in the geographic hierarchy that includes the first location. The subject technology identifies a second, different geographic location and determines where, in the geographic hierarchy, the second location belongs. One or more different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy are determined to associate with the second location than a number of levels in the geographic hierarchy associated with the first location. The subject technology associates one or more labels for the one or more different number of levels with the second location, and uses respective labels to target content delivered to users associated with the first or second locations.
Description
- The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/587,832, entitled “MULTI-TIER HIERARCHY FOR GEOGRAPHICAL DATA,” filed Aug. 16, 2012, which claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/524,287 entitled “MULTI-TIER HIERARCHY FOR GEOGRAPHICAL DATA,” filed on Aug. 16, 2011, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
- This specification relates to content management.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- Some configurations of the subject technology may be implemented in methods that include a method for determining and using labels for geographic locations. The method comprises: identifying, using one or more computing devices, a first geographic location; determining, using the one or more computing devices, where, in a geographic hierarchy, the first geographic location belongs, including associating one or more labels with the first geographic location, wherein each label is associated with a respective level in the geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic location; identifying, using the one or more computing devices, a second, different geographic location; determining, using the one or more computing devices, where, in the geographic hierarchy, the second different geographic location belongs, including determining one or more different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy to associate with the second, different geographic location than a number of levels in the geographic hierarchy associated with the first geographic location, and associating one or more labels for the one or more different number of levels with the second different geographic location; and targeting, using the one or more computing devices, content delivered to users associated with either of the first or second geographic locations based at least in part on the respective labels.
- These and other implementations can each include one or more of the following features. The first geographic location can be in a first region and the second, different geographic location can be in a second, different region, wherein the first region includes a different number of hierarchal levels in the geographic hierarchy than the second, different region. The first region and the second region can each be associated with a first hierarchical level that is below a second hierarchical level corresponding to a country level in the geographic hierarchy. A number of hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location can be less than three, and a number of hierarchical levels associated with the second, different geographic location can be three or more. A number of hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location can be more than three. At least two of the hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location can be non parent-child relationships. The hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location can include country, metropolitan area, city and at least one other hierarchical level. The hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location might not include at least one or more of metropolitan area or city. Using respective labels can include presenting the labels when presenting information about the geographic location to a user. Targeting content can include using the respective labels for a geographic location to target users as part of a content targeting system. Targeting content can include presenting the respective labels to users in a user interface and enabling selection of a geographic feature associated with the respective label, and upon selection, presenting information relating to the selected geographic feature. A hierarchical level associated with the first geographic location can be a political district.
- Some configurations of the subject technology may be implemented in methods that include a method for classifying geographic features. The method comprises: providing, using one or more computing devices, a flexible geographic hierarchy of labels that includes a plurality of geographic features, wherein geographic features from different regions can be customized to include or be associated with a different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy; identifying, using the one or more computing devices, a first geographic feature; and classifying, using the one or more computing devices, the first geographic feature in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy including assigning to the first geographic feature respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic feature, including assigning a first number of labels to the first geographic feature.
- These and other implementations can each include one or more of the following features. The first number can be more than 4. The first number can be less than 3. The method can include: identifying a second different geographic feature; and classifying the second different geographic feature in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy, including assigning to the second different geographic feature respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the second different geographic feature, and including assigning a second different number of labels to the first geographic feature. The respective labels can be presented when presenting the first geographic feature.
- Some configurations may be implemented in a non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations. The operations include identifying, using one or more computing devices, a first geographic location; determining, using the one or more computing devices, where, in a geographic hierarchy, the first geographic location belongs, including associating one or more labels with the first geographic location, wherein each label is associated with a respective level in the geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic location; identifying, using the one or more computing devices, a second, different geographic location; determining, using the one or more computing devices, where, in the geographic hierarchy, the second different geographic location belongs, including determining one or more different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy to associate with the second, different geographic location than a number of levels in the geographic hierarchy associated with the first geographic location, and associating one or more labels for the one or more different number of levels with the second different geographic location; and targeting, using the one or more computing devices, content delivered to users associated with either of the first or second geographic locations based at least in part on the respective labels.
- Some configurations of the subject technology may be implemented in a system. The system includes a content management system and a flexible geographic hierarchy of labels that includes a plurality of geographic features, wherein geographic features from different regions can be customized to include or be associated with a different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy. The content management system is configured to provide the flexible geographic hierarchy of labels, identify a first geographic feature, and classify the first geographic feature in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy including assigning to the first geographic feature respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic feature, including assigning a first number of labels to the first geographic feature.
- Some implementations may realize one or more of the following advantages. A geographic hierarchy can be used to classify multiple geographic locations, wherein a particular geographic location may be associated with a different number of hierarchal levels in the geographic hierarchy than one or more other geographic locations. The geographic hierarchy can be used to associate multiple levels with a geographic location where at least two of the levels are not parent-child relationships. One or more labels assigned to a geographic location can be used to target content to users associated with the geographic location.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 19 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- A user interface can be presented to a campaign sponsor for enabling the campaign sponsor to identify geographic areas for targeting content in a campaign. A textual description for a targeting area to be associated with the campaign can be received in a search control. One or more completions can be provided based on the received textual description, where each completion satisfies the textual description and where each completion includes a geographic area that is associated with or described by the textual description. A selection of one or more of the completions can be received, and an associated geographic area can be added to the campaign or excluded from the campaign based on the selection.
- The user interface can also include, in response, for example, to the campaign sponsor selecting a particular geographic area, one or more geographic areas that are nearby the particular geographic area. Various approaches can be used to determine nearby geographic areas. The campaign sponsor can select one or more of the nearby geographic areas to indicate that the selected geographic area(s) are to be added to the campaign.
- The content delivery system can also provide back-end functionality which supports the user interface, such as support for classifying geographic information. For example, the content delivery system can provide a flexible geographic hierarchy of labels which can be used to classify geographic locations. The content delivery system can, for example, classify a geographic location and place the geographic location in the flexible geographic hierarchy, which can include assigning respective labels at each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the geographic location. The flexible hierarchy can enable, for example, the content delivery system to assign a different number of labels to a first geographic location than a number of labels previously assigned to a second geographic location.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.

In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response to asearch query 116, thesearch system 112 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. For example, the data representing theresource 105 can include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. An example slot is an ad slot. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - Information about slots can be provided to the
content management system 110. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). Thecontent management system 110 can select some or all of the eligible content items for presentation in slots of aresource 105 orsearch results page 118. Eligible content items may be selected based at least in part on results of an auction. Eligible content items can include content items that have characteristics matching the characteristics of a slot and that are identified as relevant to one or more resource keywords or search queries 116. For example, an eligible content item may be associated with one or more targeting keywords that match a resource keyword or asearch query 116. A targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or asearch query 116 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword orsearch query 116. For example, a content item associated with the targeting keyword “hotels” can be an eligible content item for a content request that is associated with the resource keyword “hotels” or the search query “hotels.” - A
content provider 108 can create a content campaign using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interface can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - The
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interface, providecampaign parameters 120 which define a content campaign. Thecampaign parameters 120 can be stored in aparameters data store 122.Campaign parameters 120 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, a targeted language, and one or more targeted geographical locations. A campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 120 specified by thecontent provider 108. - The account management user interface can include one or more controls for enabling selection of targeting criteria by the
content provider 108. For example, the account management user interface can include a campaign tool for receiving input on campaign details to be executed by thecontent management system 110. The campaign tool can include, for example, a search control for receiving search strings. In response to receiving a search string, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more search completions that represent one or more geographic areas and reach information for each geographic area. The campaign tool can also include one or more controls for adding a geographic area to a campaign, excluding a geographic area from the campaign, or presenting a map of a geographic area. - The account management user interface can also present, such as in response to the
content provider 108 selecting a particular completion, one or more geographic areas that are nearby the geographic area associated with the completion. A nearby geographic location can be, for example, adjacent, proximate or including (e.g., enclosing) the geographic area associated with the completion. Thecontent provider 108 can select one or more of the nearby geographic areas to indicate that the selected geographic area(s) are to be added to the campaign or excluded from the campaign. - The
content management system 110 can provide support for classifying geographic information. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide a flexible geographic hierarchy of labels, which can be represented by geographic information stored in adata store 124. The flexible geographic hierarchy can be used to classify geographic locations. Thecontent management system 110 can, for example, classify a geographic location in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy, which can include assigning respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the geographic location, including assigning one or more labels to the geographic location. - The flexible hierarchy can enable, for example, the
content management system 110 to assign a different number of labels to a first geographic location than a number of labels previously assigned to a second geographic location. For example, the city of Chicago can be associated with city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States”, respectively, and a country such as Barbados can be represented by a single, country label of “Barbados”. The flexible geographic hierarchy is described in more detail below with respect toFIGS. 17 and 18 .FIGS. 2 to 13 illustrate example account management user interfaces provided by thecontent management system 110. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample user interface 200 for developing a content campaign. A user, such as a campaign sponsor, can select atab 202 to display acampaign area 204. The user can edit an existing campaign in thecampaign area 204 by selecting the name of an existing campaign (e.g., a name 206) in acampaign list 208. Thecampaign area 204 or a similar interface can be used to create a new campaign. - The campaign sponsor can select a
control 210 to display campaign settings in thecampaign area 204. The campaign settings can include, among other settings,location settings 212 included in a locations andlanguages settings area 214. Thelocation settings 212 include controls 216, which allow the campaign sponsor to specify in which geographic location(s) the campaign sponsor desires a user to be present in (and/or, in some implementations, express an interest in) for content items to be presented to the user. For example, the campaign sponsor can select acontrol 218 to specify that the campaign sponsor desires content items to be presented in all countries and territories. As another example, the campaign sponsor can select acontrol - The locations that are displayed in the
controls controls controls - As another example, a location associated with the campaign sponsor may be associated with different and/or a different number of geographical hierarchy levels than the country, region, and city levels associated with the
controls controls - If one of the choices represented by the
control 218 or thecontrols control 226 to choose one or more other geographic locations. - For example,
FIG. 3 illustrates anexample user interface 300 which allows the user to provide one or more geographic locations. In response to selection of a control 302 (e.g., where thecontrol 302 corresponds to thecontrol 226 described above with respect toFIG. 2 ), a search control 304 can be displayed. The user can use the control 304 to provide a country name, city name, region name, or the name of some other geographic location. In response to user input in the control 304, one or more search completions can be displayed, where each search completion represents a geographic location which matches the user input. - For example,
FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 400 which includes asearch completions area 401. In response to the user entering text “Chicago” 402 into asearch control 404, thesearch completions area 401 is displayed. Thesearch completions area 401 includes search completions 406-416 (e.g., corresponding to the cities of Chicago, Chicago Heights, and Chicago Ridge, Chicago 0'Hare International Airport, the Chicago metro area, and the unincorporated Chicago Park, Calif., respectively, with the city ofChicago completion 406 being a top match. Thesearch completions area 401 also includescompletions 418,420, and 422, corresponding to geographic areas of the Chicago metro area, the state of Illinois, and the United States, each being geographic areas which include the top match of the city of Chicago. - If the user changes the text 402 (e.g., by deleting or adding characters), the
search completions area 401 can update automatically in response to each change of thetext 402 to show completions corresponding to the current value of thetext 402. In some implementations, if no locations match thetext 402, an error message can be displayed. In some implementations, determining completions for thetext 402 can include identifying completions that match a spelling-error correction of thetext 402. For example, if the user enters the text “Chcago” into thesearch control 404, thesearch completions area 401 can display completions for “Chicago”, as shown. - Each of the completions 406-422 can include corresponding estimated reach information. In some implementations, the estimated reach information indicates a number of unique users who may be exposed to a particular content item. For example, the
completion 406 includesreach information 424 which indicates that the city of Chicago includes 2,695,333 unique users who may be exposed to a particular content item. Each of the completions 406-422 can be selectable, and upon selection of a completion, a corresponding geographic location can be displayed in a map user interface. - Each completion can include one or more labels, where each label is associated with a respective level in a geographic hierarchy that includes the location associated with the completion. For example, the
completion 406 includes city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States”, respectively. As another example, thecompletion 420 includes state and country labels of “Illinois” and “United States”, respectively. Each completion can include an indicator which indicates the type of location associated with the completion. For example, thecompletion 406 includes acity indicator 430, thecompletion 414 includes ametro indicator 432, thecompletion 420 includes astate indicator 434, and the completion 422 includes acountry indicator 436. Other indicators are possible, including one or more badges such as limited reach badges discussed in greater detail below. - The user can add a geographic location corresponding to a particular completion 406-422 to the campaign. For example, the user can add the geographic location of the city of Chicago corresponding to the
completion 406 to the campaign by selecting anadd control 438. Similarly, the user can exclude the geographic location corresponding to thecompletion 406 from the campaign by selecting an excludecontrol 440. In some implementations, the user can add thetop completion 406 to the campaign by pressing an “enter” key. A list of added (e.g., selected) and excluded geographic locations can be displayed to the user. - A warning or indicator can be displayed to the user, for example, if the user adds or attempts to add the same location twice or if the user adds and excludes the same location. As another example, an indicator or warning can be displayed if the user either adds or excludes both an enclosing location (e.g., the state of Illinois) and an enclosed location (e.g., the city of Chicago). The indicator can be a “badge” that is displayed next to the location name, such as in a selected locations list or in an excluded locations list.
- For example,
FIG. 5 illustrates anexample user interface 500 that includes a selected-excludedlocations list 502. The selected-excluded locations list 502 can be displayed, for example, in response to the user adding a geographic location to or excluding a geographic location from the campaign. The selected-excluded locations list 502 includes, in a selectedlocations area 504, geographic locations which have been added to the campaign, and includes, in an excludedlocations area 506, geographic locations which have been excluded from the campaign. For example, the selectedlocations area 504 includesentries locations area 506 includes entries 511 and 512 corresponding to excluded geographic locations of Barbados and Mexico, respectively. - The user can provide user input in a
search control 513 to specify an additional geographic location. In response to user input in thesearch control 513, theuser interface 500 can change to include a search completions area (e.g., an interface similar to thesearch completions area 401 described above with respect toFIG. 4 ). The user can, using the search completions area, add or exclude a geographic location corresponding to the content of thesearch control 513. - Each entry in the selected
locations area 504 and the excludedlocations area 506 can include corresponding estimated reach information. For example, theentry 508, corresponding to the United States, includesreach information 514. A user can select a map control (e.g., a map control 516) to display a map for a corresponding entry. The user can select a remove control to remove a corresponding entry from the selectedlocations area 504 or the excludedlocations area 506. For example, the user can select aremove control 518 to remove the geographic location of Mexico from the excludedlocations area 506, resulting in Mexico no longer being excluded from the campaign. The user can select amap control 520 to see the selected and excluded locations on a map. - For example,
FIG. 6 illustrates anexample user interface 600 for displaying selected and excluded locations on amap 602. Themap 602 includesmarkers entries locations list 610, respectively. Themap 602 also includesmarkers entries locations list 615, respectively. - The user can select a remove control, such as
remove control 616, to remove a location from the selected locations list 610 or the excludedlocations list 615. The user can select a map control, such asmap control 618, to display a map of a location included in the selected locations list 610 or the excludedlocations list 615. The user can provide user input in asearch control 620 to specify an additional geographic location. In response to user input in thesearch control 620, theuser interface 600 can change to include a search completions area. - For example,
FIG. 7 illustrates anexample user interface 700 which includes asearch completions area 701. Thesearch completions area 701 can be displayed, for example, in response to the user entering the text “Chicago” into asearch control 702. Thesearch completions area 701 can be an interface similar to thesearch completions area 401 described above with respect toFIG. 4 . For example, thesearch completions area 701 includes completions which match the text “Chicago” (e.g., acompletion 704, which is a top match) and completions, such as acompletion 706, which enclose thecompletion 704. A user can select a completion to view the corresponding geographic location on a map and to view additional details about the geographic location. - For example,
FIG. 8 illustrates anexample user interface 800 displayed in response to selection of a completion (e.g., theuser interface 800 can be shown in response to selection of thecompletion 704 which represents the city of Chicago). Theuser interface 800 includes amap 802. Themap 802 displays the geographic location of interest (e.g., the city of Chicago), including amarker 804 which marks the geographic location of interest and aborder 806 which forms an outline of the geographic location of interest on themap 802. Theborder 806 can mark, for example, a political border (e.g., an official border as defined by an entity such as a city, county, state, or country) or can mark an approximate area, such as an area that is approximated based on mapping one or more IP addresses to a particular geographic area. The user can select themarker 804 to display a pop-up 808. In some implementations, the pop-up 808 displays estimatedreach information 810 for the geographic location of interest and includes acontrol 812 which can be used to add the geographic location of interest to the campaign and acontrol 814 which can be used to exclude the geographic location of interest from the campaign. - Similar to the
search completions areas FIGS. 4 and 7 , theuser interface 800 includes anenclosing locations list 816 which includes geographic locations of the Chicago metro area 818, the state ofIllinois 820, and theUnited States 822, each of which enclose the city of Chicago. Themap 802 can be updated to display an enclosinggeographic location map control 823. An enclosinggeographic location add control 824 and can be excluded from the campaign by selecting a control such as an excludecontrol 826. - The user can use a
control 832 to add the geographic location of interest (e.g., the city of Chicago) to the campaign and acontrol 834 to exclude the geographic location of interest from the campaign. The user can use asearch control 836 to search for a different location of interest. If the user views more than one location of interest using theuser interface 800, the user can use aback control 838 and a forward control 840 to navigate to previously-displayed locations of interest. - The
user interface 800 includes a nearby locations list 842 which includes locations that are nearby the location of interest. For example, the nearby locations list 842 includes locations near the city of Chicago, such as the city of Evanston, Ill. 844, the state of Indiana 846, the state of Michigan 848, the state of Wisconsin 850, and the city of Gary, Ind. 852. - A particular nearby location 844-852 can be added to the campaign by selecting an add control, such as an
add control 854. A particular nearby location 844-852 can be excluded from the campaign by selecting an exclude control, such as an exclude control 856. A particular nearby location 844-852 can be displayed in themap 802 by selecting a map control, such as a map control 858. All of the nearby locations 844-852 can be simultaneously displayed in themap 802 by selecting acontrol 860. In some implementations, nearby locations can be defined as locations that are either adjacent, proximate, overlapping, or including (e.g., enclosing) an existing geographic selection. Determining nearby locations is described in more detail below with respect toFIG. 16 . - A targeted
locations area 868 indicates that there are currently two locations selected for the campaign and two locations excluded from the campaign. In some implementations, the selected and excluded locations can be displayed on themap 802 along with the location of interest. For example, themap 802 can be zoomed/expanded so that the selected locations, the excluded locations, and the location of interest are each visible on themap 802. In some implementations, selected locations, excluded locations, and the location of interest can each appear differently in themap 802, such as in a different color and/or with a different-looking marker. - The user can select a show locations control 870 to view the selected and excluded locations. For example, in response to selection of the
control 870, themap 802 can be updated to display the selected and excluded locations. As another example, theuser interface 800 can be updated to include a list of selected and excluded locations (e.g., theuser interface 800 can update to be similar to theuser interface 600 described above with respect toFIG. 6 ). - For example,
FIG. 9 illustrates anexample user interface 900 that displays selected and excluded locations. Theuser interface 900 displays selected locations of Indiana and Illinois (e.g., corresponding tomarkers entries 906 and 908 in a selectedlocations list 910, respectively) and excluded locations of Wisconsin and Michigan (e.g., corresponding tomarkers locations list 920, respectively). The user can use asearch control 922 to search for other locations and can select acontrol 924 to return to theuser interface 800 described above with respect toFIG. 8 . -
FIG. 10 illustrates anotherexample user interface 1000 that displays locations nearby a location of interest. Theuser interface 1000 includes amap 1002, an enclosinglocations list 1004, and anearby locations list 1006. Similar to theenclosing locations list 816 described above with respect toFIG. 8 , the enclosinglocations list 1004 includes locations that enclose the location of interest of the city of Chicago. - The
map 1002 includes amarker 1008 which marks the location of interest of the city of Chicago. Anoutline 1010 indicates the border of the city of Chicago. Themap 1002 also includesmarkers marker 1008. As illustrated by asolid outline 1020 marking the boundary of Evanston and adotted outline 1021 marking the boundary of the 6th Congressional district each having a different line style than the dashedoutline 1010, the outline and a color used for a geographic location of interest (e.g., the city of Chicago) can be different than the outline or color of an identified nearby location (e.g., Evanston) and the color or outline of a nearby location can vary based on the type of nearby location. - The markers 1012-1019 correspond respectively to entries 1022-1029 in the
nearby locations list 1006. Each entry 1022-1029 includes estimated reach information and controls to add the corresponding nearby location to the campaign, exclude the nearby location from the campaign, or to see the nearby location on a map. In addition to being presented with locations that are determined to be nearby to a selected location, the user can select acontrol 1030 to view locations that are within a radius distance of a particular, specified location. - For example,
FIG. 11 illustrates anexample user interface 1100 for displaying locations within a radius distance of a selected location. The user can specify a location using a control 1102 (e.g., the user has specified an address of “300 W. North Ave., Elmhurst, Ill.”). Amarker 1104 marks the specified location on amap 1106. The user can specify a radius distance using controls 1107 (e.g., the user has specified a radius distance often miles). Acircle target area 1108 can illustrate, on themap 1106, the specified radius distance around the specified location. - A locations-within-
target list 1110 includes entries 1112-1118 which correspond to locations of the cities of Bensenville, Berkeley, Elmhurst, and Northlake, Ill., respectively, which are each located within or overlap a target area defined by the specified location and the specified radius distance. If locations that the user desires to target are not displayed within the locations-within-target list 1110 (or if too many locations are included), the user can adjust the size of thecircle 1108 using thecontrols 1107. - The locations corresponding to the entries 1112-1118 can be determined, for example, by determining a relationship of each of multiple candidate locations that are identified as being proximate to the
circle 1108. For example, for each candidate location, it can be determined whether the candidate location is entirely enclosed within thecircle 1108, partially overlapping thecircle 1108, outside of but within a threshold distance of thecircle 1108, or outside of and more than a threshold distance from thecircle 1108. In some implementations, nearby locations can be identified as candidate locations that are entirely enclosed within thecircle 1108, overlap thecircle 1108 by more than a threshold amount, or are outside of but within a threshold distance of thecircle 1108. - Each of the entries 1112-1118 include estimated reach information and controls to add the corresponding location to the campaign, exclude the location from the campaign, or to see the location on the
map 1106. The user can select acontrol 1120 to see each of the locations corresponding to the entries 1112-1118 on themap 1106. In some implementations, in response to selection of thecontrol 1120, each of the locations corresponding to the entries 1112-1118 are marked or highlighted on themap 1106 with a marker and are outlined with an outline (e.g., similar to theoutline 1020 discussed above with respect toFIG. 10 ). - For example,
FIG. 12 illustrates anexample user interface 1200 which displays nearby locations on amap 1202. Themap 1202 includes amarker 1204 marking the location specified in acontrol 1206 and includes markers 1208-1214 which correspond to the locations of Bensenville, Berkeley, Elmhurst, and Northlake, Ill., respectively, which are each located within atarget area 1215 defined by the specified location and the specified radius distance (e.g., corresponding to a control 1216) and which correspond to entries 1217-1222 that are included in a locations-within-target list 1223. Themap 1202 also includesmarkers target area 1215. The markers 1208-1214 and 1224-1228 are illustrated by corresponding outlines (e.g., an outline 1229) which mark the borders of the associated locations. Although the locations-within-target list does not currently display entries associated with the markers 1224-1228, the locations-within-target list 1223 can include entries associated with the markers 1224-1228 and the user can use ascroll control 1230 to view such entries. The user can select acontrol 1232 to hide the markers 1208-1214 and 1224-1228 and associated outlines. -
FIG. 13 illustrates anexample user interface 1300 which includes a limited reach indicator orbadge 1302. In some implementations, the limited reach indicator can be used as an indicator that the content delivery system has limited information about the location, such as for example, limited information about the estimated reach that is associated with the location. For example, thelimited reach indicator 1302 is included in anentry 1304 in a selectedlocations list 1306, where theentry 1304 corresponds to a location of the barangay of Bilibiran, which is within the city of Binangonan, the province of Rizal, and the region of CALABARZON, in the Philippines. A barangay can be, for example, a village that is a subset of a larger municipality. Amarker 1308 on amap 1310 marks the barangay of Bilibiran and anoutline 1312 marks the border of Bilibiran. The limited reach indicator can also be displayed for a suggested location, an enclosing location, a nearby location, a location within a target, or other types of locations where the system has limited information about the estimated reach. - In some implementations, the
limited reach indicator 1302 can be shown when a confidence level related to available estimated reach information is less than a threshold level. For example, a confidence level may be reduced if a content management system does not determine a threshold confidence level regarding a user's location based on the IP address of the user. For example, the content management system may not have sufficient data regarding which IP addresses correspond to a specific location, (e.g., the Bilibiran location). Content may still be targeted to users in a limited reach designated location, but the results may be much more difficult to predict. -
FIG. 14 is a flowchart of anexample process 1400 for presenting a campaign management user interface to a campaign sponsor. Theprocess 1400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . Alternatively or conjunctively, theprocess 1400 may be performed by one or more computing devices or systems. - A user interface is presented to a campaign sponsor (1402). For example, the
content management system 110 can present the user interface 400 to acontent provider 108. The user interface includes a control for enabling the user to search for geographic areas for targeting content in a campaign. Presenting the user interface includes presenting a search control for customizing targeting for the campaign. For example, the user interface 400 includes thesearch control 404. - A textual description is received, in the search control, for a targeting area to be associated with the campaign (1404). For example, as shown in
FIG. 4 , thecontent provider 108 can enter thetext 402 “Chicago” into thesearch control 404. - One or more completions are provided based on the received textual description (1406), where each completion satisfies the textual description. For example, the completions 406-422 are provided in the
search completions area 401. Providing the one or more completions includes providing one or more geographic areas that are associated with or described by the textual description and further includes providing reach information describing an estimated reach in terms of the number of users that are associated with the geographic area in a predetermined time period. For example, thecompletion 406 corresponds to the city of Chicago, Ill., and thecompletion 406 includesreach information 424, which indicates that the reach of the city of Chicago is 2,695,333. - A control can be presented, along with the one or more completions, for enabling display of a map for visually presenting on the map a geographic area associated with a given completion. For example, in
FIG. 4 , the text “Chicago, Ill., United States” included in thecompletion 406 can be a selectable control, and upon selection, theuser interface 800 displayed inFIG. 8 can be displayed, which includes amap 802 which presents an area including the city of Chicago. - A selection of one or more of the completions is received (1408). For example, the user can select the completion 422 corresponding to the United States. An associated geographic area is added to or excluded from the campaign based on the selection (1410). For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 5 , the geographic location of the United States is included in the selected locations list 504 which displays geographic locations which have been added to a campaign. -
FIG. 15 is a flowchart of anexample process 1500 for presenting a campaign management user interface to a campaign sponsor. Theprocess 1500 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . Alternatively or conjunctively, theprocess 1500 may be performed by one or more computing devices or systems. - A user interface is presented to a campaign sponsor for customizing targeting information for a campaign (1502). For example, the
content management system 110 can present the user interface 400 to a content provider (e.g., to an advertiser) 108. The user interface includes a search control for discovering locations for targeting. For example, the user interface 400 includes thesearch control 404. - A user input, including a textual description of a location to target, is received in the search control (1504). For example, as shown in
FIG. 4 , thecontent provider 108 can enter thetext 402 “Chicago” into thesearch control 404. - One or more completions that satisfy the textual description and estimated reach information for each completion are provided (1506). For example, the completions 406-422 are provided in the
search completions area 401. Each completion is representative of a geographic feature that can be targeted in the campaign. For example, the completions 406-422 represent the cities of Chicago, Chicago Heights, and Chicago Ridge, Chicago 0'Hare International Airport, the Chicago metro area, and the unincorporated Chicago Park, Calif., respectively. - Providing one or more completions can include providing a control for presenting a map of a geographic area associated with a completion, and presenting the geographic area in a map upon receipt of a selection of the control by a user. For example, in
FIG. 4 , the text “Chicago, Ill., United States” included in thecompletion 406 can be a selectable control, and upon selection, theuser interface 800 displayed inFIG. 8 can be displayed, which includes amap 802 which presents an area including the city of Chicago. - One or more labels associated with each completion can be provided, where the label represents a specific geographic area and includes one or more hierarchical elements that are in a path description for a respective geographic location. For example, with respect to
FIG. 4 , thecompletion 406 includes city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States”, respectively. - User input to select at least one of the completions corresponding to a geographic location is received (1508). For example, the user can select the completion 422 corresponding to the United States. The geographic location is added to or excluded from the campaign based on the selection (1510). For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 5 , the geographic location of the United States is included in the selected locations list 504 which displays geographic locations which have been added to a campaign. -
FIG. 16 is a flowchart of anexample process 1600 for adding a geographic location to a content campaign. Theprocess 1600 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . Alternatively or conjunctively, theprocess 1600 may be performed by one or more computing devices or systems. - One or more geographic locations are identified for targeting content from a campaign, for delivery to users (1602), where the campaign is associated with a content sponsor. The content sponsor can be, for example, the content provider (e.g., an advertiser) 108. A geographic location can be identified, for example, in response to the content sponsor entering a search string into a search control. For example, with respect to
FIG. 3 , the content sponsor can enter thetext 402 representing the city of Chicago into thesearch control 404. The geographic location can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a search completion, such as thecompletion 406. The geographic location can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a geographic location that is selected for or excluded from the campaign, such as, with respect toFIG. 6 , theentries entry 613 in the excludedlocations list 614. - A map including the one or more geographic locations associated with the campaign can be presented. For example, the
user interface 800 ofFIG. 8 includes amap 802 which presents the area that includes the city of Chicago, where theuser interface 800 can be displayed in response to the user selecting a completion (e.g., the completion 406) representing the city of Chicago. In some implementations, a map can include a targeting area defined by a radius selected by a user. For example, theuser interface 1100 ofFIG. 11 includes amap 1106 which includes a targetingarea 1108 defined by a location corresponding to user input provided using thecontrol 1102 and a radius provided using thecontrols 1107. - One or more geographic locations that are nearby the one or more geographic locations associated with the campaign are automatically presented to the content sponsor (1604), including presenting candidate nearby geographic locations and estimated reach information along with each candidate geographic location. For example, one or more candidate nearby geographic locations can be identified, where each candidate nearby geographic location is nearby an existing geographic location associated with the campaign. In some implementations, nearby can be defined as being either adjacent, overlapping, proximate, or including (e.g., enclosing) an existing geographic area.
- The candidate geographic locations can be presented in a list. For example, as shown in
FIG. 10 , locations nearby a location of interest of the city of Chicago are presented in thenearby locations list 1006 and locations that enclose the location of interest of the city of Chicago are presented in anenclosing locations list 1004. - Candidate nearby geographic locations can be presented in a map. For example, the nearby locations included in the nearby locations list 1006 are presented on the
map 1002. As another example, in theuser interface 1200 ofFIG. 12 , locations that are at least partially within thetarget area 1215 are displayed in themap 1202. Theuser interface 1200 ofFIG. 12 is an example of presenting the candidate nearby geographic locations in a map (e.g., the map 1202) along with a location (e.g., corresponding to the contents of the control 1206) and a circular targeting area (e.g., the targeting area 1215), centered on the location, of a user selected radius (e.g., corresponding to the control 1216). In the example ofFIG. 12 , one or more candidate nearby geographic locations (e.g., corresponding to the markers 1208-1214 and 1224-1228) are identified as being at least partially included in a circle formed by the radius corresponding to thecontrol 1216 centered on the location identified by themarker 1204. - A selection of one or more candidate geographic locations for inclusion in the campaign is received (1606). For example, with respect to
FIG. 12 , the user can select an add control included in the entry 1217 to request to add the associated geographic location of the city of Bensenville, Ill. to the campaign. - The selection is added to the campaign (1608). For example, with respect to
FIG. 12 , the geographic location of the city of Bensenville, Ill. can be added to the campaign in response to selection of the add control included in the associated entry 1217. In some implementations, in response to adding a geographic location to the campaign, a representation of an updated targeting area associated with the campaign that includes the selection can be presented on a map. For example, with respect toFIG. 12 , in response to selection of the add control included in the entry 1217, the targetingarea 1215 can be updated (e.g., expanded) so that the targetingarea 1215 includes the location representing the city of Bensenville, Ill. marked by themarker 1208. -
FIG. 17 is a flowchart of anexample process 1700 for determining and using labels for geographic locations. Theprocess 1700 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . Alternatively or conjunctively, theprocess 1700 may be performed by one or more computing devices or systems. - A first geographic location is identified (1702). A geographic location can be identified, for example, in response to a content sponsor entering a search string into a search control. For example, with respect to
FIG. 3 , the content sponsor can enter thetext 402 representing the city of Chicago into thesearch control 404. The geographic location can be identified when one or more search completions are provided, such as the completions 406-422. The geographic location can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a search completion, such as thecompletion 406. The geographic location can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a geographic location that is selected for or excluded from the campaign, such as, with respect toFIG. 6 , theentries entry 613 in the excludedlocations list 614. - It is determined where, in a geographic hierarchy, the first geographic location belongs (1704). The determining can include associating one or more labels with the first geographic location, where each label is associated with a respective level in the geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic location. For example, if the first geographic location is the city of Chicago (e.g., corresponding to the completion 406), city, state, and country labels of “Chicago”, “Illinois”, and “United States” can be associated with the first geographic location.
- As another example, the hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location can include country, metropolitan area, city and at least one other hierarchical level (e.g., state). For example, with respect to
FIG. 4 , the geographic location of Chicago Heights Ill. corresponding to thecompletion 408 can be associated with country, metropolitan area, city, and state hierarchical levels (e.g., corresponding to United States, Chicago metro area, Chicago Heights, and Illinois, respectively). - In some examples, the hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location might not include at least one or more of metropolitan area or city. For example, if the first geographic location is in a small country, such as Barbados (e.g., corresponding to the
marker 611 as shown inFIG. 6 ), then one hierarchical level (e.g., just country) may be associated with the first geographic location. - Although two hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location may be related in a parent-child relationship (e.g., country and state), two or more of the hierarchical levels associated with the first geographic location might not be parent-child relationships. For example, a hierarchical level associated with the first geographic location may be a political district, and another hierarchical level associated with the first geographic location, may be unrelated to the political district. For example, with respect to
FIG. 10 , the city of Chicago (e.g., outlined by the outline 1010) partially overlaps the 6th Congressional district of Illinois (e.g., outlined by the outline 1021). That is, the city of Chicago is related to more than one congressional district, and the 6th Congressional district of Illinois is related to more than one city. - Returning to
FIG. 17 , a second, different geographic location is identified (1706). For example, with respect toFIG. 13 , the barangay of Bilibiran can be identified, such as in response to the user adding the barangay of Bilibiran to a campaign, or in response to the user selecting theentry 1304 or themarker 1308. - It is determined where, in the geographic hierarchy, the second different geographic location belongs (1708). For example, the
content management system 110 can determine one or more different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy to associate with the second, different geographic location than a number of levels in the geographic hierarchy associated with the first geographic location. For instance, in the example where the first geographic location is the city of Chicago, the first geographic location can be associated with three levels in the geographic hierarchy (e.g., city, state, and country). If the second geographic location is the barangay of Bilibiran, the second geographic location can be associated with five levels (e.g., barangay, city, province, region, and country). The determining can also include associating one or more labels for the one or more different number of levels with the second different geographic location. For example, if the second geographic location is the barangay of Bilibiran, one or more of the labels of “Bilibiran”, “Binangonan”, “Rizal”, “CALABARZON”, and the “Philippines” can be associated with the second geographic location, for example, as illustrated by theentry 1304 inFIG. 13 . - In general, given two geographic locations, the number of levels associated with the first geographic location may be the same as or different than the number of levels associated with the second geographic location, and the number of levels associated with either the first or the second geographic location can be any number of levels. As a specific example, the number of levels associated with a first geographic location can be less than three (e.g., just country, as in the example of Barbados), and the number of levels associated with the second geographic location can be three or more (e.g., as in the examples of using city, state, and country, and using barangay, city, province, region, and country).
- A number of levels associated with a particular geographic location or particular labels associated with the particular location can be changed. For example, if a particular region (e.g., a state) is redistricted, different (e.g., differently named, a different number of) political districts may be associated with the region. As another example, if a country is subdivided (e.g., the creation of a new country of South Sudan from the country of Sudan), then a new country and a different number of countries can be associated with the continent (e.g., Africa) that includes the new country.
- In some implementations, respective labels are used to target content delivered to users associated with either of the first or second geographic locations (1710). For example, the labels associated with a geographic location may be presented when presenting information about the geographic location to a user. For example, with respect to
FIG. 13 , the labels “Bilibiran”, “Binangonan”, “Rizal”, “CALABARZON”, and “Philippines” are presented to the user in theentry 1304. As another example, with respect toFIG. 7 , the labels of “Chicago”, “IL”, and “United States” are presented in thecompletion 704. As yet another example, with respect toFIG. 6 , the label “Barbados” is presented in theentry 613. - The respective labels can be presented to users in a user interface enabling selection of a geographic feature associated with the respective label, and upon selection, information relating to the selected geographic feature can be presented. For example, in the
entry 1304, each of the labels “Bilibiran”, “Binangonan”, “Rizal”, “CALABARZON”, and “Philippines” can be individually selectable, and thecontent management system 110 can display information (e.g., a map, reach information) related to a respective geographic location associated with a selected label, in response to the selection. The respective labels for a geographic location can be used to target users as part of a content targeting system. -
FIG. 18 is a flowchart of anexample process 1800 for classifying geographic features. Theprocess 1800 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . Alternatively or conjunctively, theprocess 1800 may be performed by one or more computing devices or systems. - A flexible geographic hierarchy of labels that includes a plurality of geographic features is provided (1802). For example, a flexible geographic hierarchy of labels can be provided by the
content management system 110 based on thegeographic information 124. Geographic features from different regions can be customized to include or be associated with a different number of levels in the geographic hierarchy. - A first geographic feature is identified (1804). A geographic feature can be identified, for example, in response to a content sponsor entering a search string into a search control. For example, with respect to
FIG. 3 , the content sponsor can enter thetext 402 representing the city of Chicago into thesearch control 404. The geographic feature can be identified when one or more search completions are provided, such as the completions 406-422. The geographic feature can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a search completion, such as thecompletion 406. The geographic feature can be identified in response to the content sponsor selecting a geographic feature that is selected for or excluded from the campaign, such as, with respect toFIG. 6 , theentries list 610 or theentry 613 in the excluded featureslist 614. - The first geographic feature is classified in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy (1806). Classifying can include assigning to the first geographic feature respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the first geographic feature, including assigning a first number of labels to the first geographic feature. For example, the first number can be one, two, three, four, or a larger number, such as a number greater than four. For example, with respect to
FIG. 13 , if the first geographic feature is the barangay of Bilibiran (e.g., corresponding to the marker 1308), five labels of “Bilibiran”, “Binangonan”, “Rizal”, “CALABARZON”, and “Philippines”, representing levels of barangay, city, province, region, and country, respectively, can be assigned to the first geographic feature. One or more of these five labels can be presented when the first geographic feature is presented (e.g., as shown in the entry 1304). - A second, different geographic feature can be identified and classified in accordance with the flexible geographic hierarchy, including assigning to the second, different geographic feature respective labels from each hierarchical level in the flexible geographic hierarchy that includes the second different geographic feature, and including assigning a second, different number of labels to the first geographic feature. For example, if the second, different geographic feature is the country of Barbados, a single hierarchical level (e.g., country) and a single label (e.g., “Barbados”) can be associated with the second geographic feature.
