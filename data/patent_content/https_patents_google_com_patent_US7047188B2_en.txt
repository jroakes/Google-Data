Definitions
- the present invention relates, in general, to signal compression systems and, more particularly, to Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP)-type speech coding systems.
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- Low rate coding applications such as digital speech, typically employ techniques, such as a Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), to model the spectra of short-term speech signals.
- LPC Linear Predictive Coding
- Coding systems employing an LPC technique provide prediction residual signals for corrections to characteristics of a short-term model.
- One such coding system is a speech coding system known as Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) that produces high quality synthesized speech at low bit rates, that is, at bit rates of 4.8 to 9.6 kilobits-per-second (kbps).
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- This class of speech coding also known as vector-excited linear prediction or stochastic coding, is used in numerous speech communications and speech synthesis applications.
- CELP is also particularly applicable to digital speech encryption and digital radiotelephone communication systems wherein speech quality, data rate, size, and cost are significant issues.
- a CELP speech coder that implements an LPC coding technique typically employs long-term (“pitch”) and short-term (“formant”) predictors that model the characteristics of an input speech signal and that are incorporated in a set of time-varying linear filters.
- An excitation signal, or codevector, for the filters is chosen from a codebook of stored codevectors.
- the speech coder applies the codevector to the filters to generate a reconstructed speech signal, and compares the original input speech signal to the reconstructed signal to create an error signal.
- the error signal is then weighted by passing the error signal through a weighting filter having a response based on human auditory perception.
- An optimum excitation signal is then determined by selecting one or more codevectors that produce a weighted error signal with a minimum energy for the current frame.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a CELP coder 100 of the prior art.
- CELP coder 100 an input signal s(n) is applied to a linear predictive (LP) analyzer 101 , where linear predictive coding is used to estimate a short-term spectral envelope.
- the resulting spectral coefficients (or linear prediction (LP) coefficients) are denoted by the transfer function A(z).
- the spectral coefficients are applied to an LP quantizer 102 that quantizes the spectral coefficients to produce quantized spectral coefficients A q that are suitable for use in a multiplexer 109 .
- the quantized spectral coefficients A q are then conveyed to multiplexer 109 , and the multiplexer produces a coded bitstream based on the quantized spectral coefficients and a set of excitation vector-related parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ , that are determined by a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 .
- a corresponding set of excitation vector-related parameters is produced that includes long-term predictor (LTP) parameters L and ⁇ , and fixed codebook index I and scale factor ⁇ .
- LTP long-term predictor
- the quantized spectral parameters are also conveyed locally to an LP synthesis filter 105 that has a corresponding transfer function 1/A q (z).
- LP synthesis filter 105 also receives a combined excitation signal ex(n) and produces an estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) based on the quantized spectral coefficients A q and the combined excitation signal ex(n).
- Combined excitation signal ex(n) is produced as follows.
- a fixed codebook (FCB) codevector, or excitation vector, ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 is selected from a fixed codebook (FCB) 103 based on an fixed codebook index parameter I.
- the FCB codevector ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 is then weighted based on the gain parameter ⁇ and the weighted fixed codebook codevector is conveyed to a long-term predictor (LTP) filter 104 .
- LTP filter 104 has a corresponding transfer function ‘1/(1 ⁇ z ⁇ L ),’ wherein ⁇ and L are excitation vector-related parameters that are conveyed to the filter by squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 .
- LTP filter 104 filters the weighted fixed codebook codevector received from FCB 103 to produce the combined excitation signal ex(n) and conveys the excitation signal to LP synthesis filter 105 .
- LP synthesis filter 105 conveys the input signal estimate ⁇ (n) to a combiner 106 .
- Combiner 106 also receives input signal s(n) and subtracts the estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) from the input signal s(n).
- the difference between input signal s(n) and input signal estimate ⁇ (n) is applied to a perceptual error weighting filter 107 , which filter produces a perceptually weighted error signal e(n) based on the difference between ⁇ (n) and s(n) and a weighting function W(z).
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 .
- Squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 uses the error signal e(n) to determine an optimal set of excitation vector-related parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ that produce the best estimate ⁇ (n) of the input signal s(n).
- the quantized LP coefficients and the optimal set of parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ are then conveyed over a communication channel to a receiving communication device, where a speech synthesizer uses the LP coefficients and excitation vector-related parameters to reconstruct the input speech signal s(n).
- ex(n) is a synthetic combined excitation signal for a subframe
- ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) is a codevector, or excitation vector, selected from a codebook, such as FCB 103
- I is an index parameter, or codeword, specifying the selected codevector
- ⁇ is the gain for scaling the codevector
- ex(n ⁇ L) is a synthetic combined excitation signal delayed by L samples relative to the n-th sample of the current subframe for voiced speech L is typically related to the pitch period)
- ⁇ is a long term predictor (LTP) gain factor
- N is the number of samples in the subframe.
- ex(n ⁇ L) contains the history of past synthetic excitation, constructed as shown in equation (1). That is, for n ⁇ L ⁇ 0, the expression ‘ex(n ⁇ L)’ corresponds to an excitation sample constructed prior to the current subframe, which excitation sample has been delayed and scaled pursuant to an LTP filter transfer function ‘1/(1 ⁇ z ⁇ L ).’
- LP Linear Predictor
- Equation (1) For values of L greater than or equal to N, that is, L ⁇ N, equation (1) is implemented exactly.
- a range of L is chosen to cover an expected range of pitch over a wide variety of speakers, and at 8 kHz sampling frequency the range's lower bound is typically set to around 20 samples, corresponding to a pitch frequency of 400 Hz.
- N is the lower bound on the delay range.
- the coder's excitation parameters are transmitted at a subframe rate, which subframe rate is inversely proportional to subframe length N. That is, the longer the subframe length N, the less frequently it is necessary to quantize and transmit the coder's subframe parameters.
- equation (2) ceases to be equivalent to equation (1).
- equation (2) In order to retain the advantages of using the form of equation (2) when L ⁇ N, one idea, proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,781, entitled “Code Excited Linear Predictive Vocoder Using Virtual Searching,” is to modify the definition of c 0 (n) as follows:
- c 0 (n) contains a vector fetched from a “virtual codebook,” typically an adaptive codebook (ACB), where L ⁇ N is allowed.
- ACB adaptive codebook
- equation (5) has the advantages of providing the simplified implementation provided by equation (2) while also permitting L ⁇ N. It does so by departing from an exact implementation of equation (1) when L ⁇ N.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of another CELP coder 200 of the prior art that implements equations (5)–(7). Similar to CELP coder 100 , in CELP coder 200 , quantized spectral coefficients A q are produced by an LP Analyzer 101 and an LP quantizer 102 , which quantized spectral coefficients are conveyed to a multiplexer 109 that produces a coded bitstream based on the quantized spectral coefficients and a set of excitation vector-related parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ , that are determined by a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 .
- the quantized spectral coefficients A q are also conveyed locally to an LP synthesis filter 105 that has a corresponding transfer function 1/A q (z).
- LP synthesis filter 105 also receives a combined excitation signal ex(n) and produces an estimate of the input signal ⁇ (n) based on the quantized spectral coefficients A q and the combined excitation signal ex(n).
- CELP coder 200 differs from CELP coder 100 in the techniques used to produce combined excitation signal ex(n).
- a first excitation vector c 0 (n) is selected from a virtual codebook 201 based on the excitation vector-related parameter L.
- Virtual codebook 201 typically is an adaptive codebook (ACB), in which event the first excitation vector is an adaptive codebook (ACB) codevector.
- the virtual codebook codevector c 0 (n) is then weighted based on the gain parameter ⁇ and the weighted virtual codebook codevector is conveyed to a first combiner 203 .
- a fixed codebook (FCB) codevector, or excitation vector, ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) is selected from a fixed codebook (FCB) 202 based on the excitation vector-related parameter I FCB codevector ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) (or equivalently c 1 (n), per equation (7)) is then weighted based on the gain parameter ⁇ and is also conveyed to first combiner 203 .
- First combiner 203 then produces the combined excitation signal ex(n) by combining the weighted version of virtual codebook codevector c 0 (n) with the weighted version of FCB codevector c 1 (n).
- LP synthesis filter 105 conveys the input signal estimate ⁇ (n) to a second combiner 106 .
- Second combiner 106 also receives input signal s(n) and subtracts the input signal estimate ⁇ (n) from the input signal s(n).
- the difference between input signal s(n) and input signal estimate ⁇ (n) is applied to a perceptual error weighting filter 107 , which filter produces a perceptually weighted error signal e(n) based on the difference between ⁇ (n) and s(n) and a weighting function W(z).
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 .
- Squared error minimization/parameter quantization block 108 uses the error signal e(n) to determine an optimal set of excitation vector-related parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ that produce the best estimate ⁇ (n) of the input signal s(n). Similar to coder 100 , coder 200 conveys the quantized spectral coefficients and the selected set of parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ over a communication channel to a receiving communication device, where a speech synthesizer uses the LP coefficients and excitation vector-related parameters to reconstruct the coded version of input speech signal s(n).
- Salami et al. Another technique for approximating equation (1) when L ⁇ N is proposed in the paper “A toll quality 8 kb/s speech codec for the personal communications system (PCS),” by Salami, R., Laflamme, C., Adoul, J.-P., Massaloux, D., and published in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, Volume 43, Issue 3, Parts 1–2, August 1994, pages 808–816 (hereinafter referred to as “Salami et al.”).
- the idea proposed by Salami et al. is to apply a zero state long-term filter (a “pitch sharpening filter”) to generate the excitation codevector c 1 (n), where
- L may have a value represented with a fraction of a sample resolution (in which case an interpolating filter would be used to calculate fractionally delayed samples), while ⁇ circumflex over (L) ⁇ may be a function of L, where it is set equal to a value of L rounded or truncated to an integer value closest to L.
- ⁇ circumflex over (L) ⁇ may be set equal to L.
- ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ is a constant set to 0.8.
- ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ is initially set equal to ⁇ , but is then limited to be not less than 0.2 and no greater than 0.8.
- the approach set out in the '055 patent is the approach used in speech coder standards Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Alliance Interim Standard 127 (TIA/EIA/IS-127) and Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) standard 06.60, which standards are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
- optimal gain parameters ⁇ and ⁇ are performed in a sequential manner.
- the sequential determination of optimal gain parameters ⁇ and ⁇ is actually sub-optimal, because, once ⁇ is selected, its value remains fixed when optimization of ⁇ is performed.
- ⁇ and ⁇ are not selected and quantized sequentially but instead are jointly selected and quantized, that is, are vector quantized as a ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) pair, a problem arises because gain vector quantization is done after c 0 (n) and c 1 (n) have been selected, but c 1 (n) (equation (13)) is a function of ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ .
- ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ is dependent on the quantized value of ⁇ , which is not available until after the vector quantization of the gains ⁇ and ⁇ is completed, and the quantized ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) gain vector thus identified.
- ⁇ previous in equation (15) represents value of ⁇ used to define the excitation sequence ex(n) at the preceding subframe.

- FIG. 4 is a logic flow diagram 400 of the steps executed by encoder 300 in coding a signal in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- Logic flow 400 begins ( 402 ) when an input signal s(n) is applied to a perceptual error weighting filter 304 .
- Weighting filter 304 weights ( 404 ) the input signal by a weighting function W(z) to produce a weighted input signal s′(n).
- a past combined excitation signal ex(n ⁇ N), where N is a number of samples in the subframe, is made available to a weighted synthesis filter 302 along with a corresponding zero input response of H zir (z), to compute zero input response, d(n), of the weighted synthesis filter for the subframe.
- H zir or H, is an N ⁇ N zero-state weighted synthesis convolution matrix formed from an impulse response of a weighted synthesis filter h zir (n), or h(n) and corresponding to a transfer function H(z), which matrix can be represented as:
- Weighted input signal s′(n) and a filtered version of past excitation signal ex(n ⁇ N), that is, d(n), produced by weighted synthesis filter 302 are each conveyed to a first combiner 320 .

- First combiner 320 then conveys target input signal p(n) to a third combiner 322 .
- a vector generator 306 generates ( 408 ) an initial first excitation vector c 0 (n) based on an initial first excitation vector-related parameter L that is sourced to the vector generator by an error minimization unit 324 .
- vector generator 306 is a virtual codebook such as an adaptive codebook (ACB) and excitation vector c 0 (n) is an adaptive codebook (ACB) codevector that is selected from the ACB based on an index parameter L.
- ACB adaptive codebook
- excitation vector c 0 (n) is an adaptive codebook (ACB) codevector that is selected from the ACB based on an index parameter L.
- vector generator 306 and scaling block 308 may be replaced by an output of a pitch filter based on a delay parameter L, a past combined excitation signal ex(n ⁇ N), and ⁇ , using a transfer function of the form ‘1/(1 ⁇ z ⁇ L ).’
- First weighter 308 then conveys the weighted initial first excitation vector ⁇ overscore (y) ⁇ L (n) to second combiner 316 .
- Second combiner 316 also receives a weighted initial second excitation vector ⁇ overscore (y) ⁇ 1 (n) that is produced as follows.
- An initial second excitation vector ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) is generated ( 412 ) by a fixed codebook 310 based on an initial second excitation vector-related index parameter I that is sourced to vector generator 310 by error minimization unit 324 .

- a second constituent vector generator 506 included in coder 500 and coupled to FCB 310 generates one or more constituent components of initial second excitation vector ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) to produce vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 2 (n) and ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n).
- Vector ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 2 (n), as defined by equation (19), is equivalent to vector ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) and vector ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n), as defined by equation (20), is comprised of zero's (0's) for the first L terms of the vector and the terms of ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n ⁇ L) for the remaining N ⁇ L terms.
- Coder 500 then separately weights each vector ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n), ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 1 (n), ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 2 (n), and ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n) by a respective excitation vector-related gain parameter ⁇ , ⁇ 2 , ⁇ , and ⁇ via a respective weighter 508 – 511 .
- combined excitation signal ex(n) is then filtered by a zero state weighted synthesis filter 318 to produce a filtered combined excitation signal ex′(n).
- Weighted synthesis filter 318 conveys the filtered combined excitation signal ex′(n) to a combiner 322 , where the filtered combined excitation signal ex′(n) is subtracted from the target signal p(n) to produce a perceptually weighted error signal e(n).
- Perceptually weighted error signal e(n) is then conveyed to an error minimization unit 524 , preferably a squared error minimization/parameter quantization block.
- Error minimization unit 524 uses the error signal e(n) to determine a set of optimal excitation vector-related parameters L, ⁇ , I, and ⁇ that optimize the performance of encoder 500 by minimizing the error signal e(n), wherein the determination includes jointly determining an optimal set of excitation vector-related gain parameters, ⁇ and ⁇ , thereby determining optimal gains ⁇ , ⁇ 2 , ⁇ , and ⁇ associated with the constituent components of combined excitation signal ex(n), that is, ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n), ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 1 (n), ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 2 (n), and ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n).
- An optimal set of excitation vector-related gain parameters ⁇ and ⁇ can be jointly determined as follows.
- s′(n) corresponds to perceptually weighted speech
- d(n) corresponds to a zero input response of a perceptually weighted synthesis filter for a subframe.
- the synthetic excitation for the subframe, ex(n), is then applied to the perceptually weighted synthesis filter to produce a filtered synthetic excitation ex′(n).
- An equation for filtered synthetic excitation ex′(n) can be derived as follows. Let vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 ′(n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 ′(n) represent filtered versions of vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n), respectively.
- vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n) are filtered by weighted synthesis filter 318 to produce vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n).
- the filtering of each of vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n) may comprise a step of convolving each vector with an impulse response of weighted synthesis filter 318 .
- equation (25) may be equivalently expressed in terms of (i) ⁇ and ⁇ , (ii) the cross correlations among the filtered constituent vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 ′(n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 ′(n), that is, (R cc (i,j)), (iii) the cross correlations between the perceptually weighted target vector p(n) and each of the filtered constituent vectors, that is, (R pc (i)), and (iv) the energy in weighted target vector p(n) for the subframe, that is, (R pp ).
- the above listed correlations can be represented by the following equations:
- Coders 300 and 500 may each solve equation (31) off line, as part of a procedure to train and obtain gain vectors ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) that are stored in a respective gain information table 326 , 526 .
- Each gain information table 326 , 526 may comprise one or more tables that store gain information, is included in, or may be referenced by, a respective error minimization unit 324 , 524 , and may then be used for quantizing and jointly optimizing the pair of excitation vector-related gain terms ( ⁇ , ⁇ ).
- the task of coders 300 and 500 , and in particular respective error minimization units 324 , 524 is to select a gain vector, that is, a ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) pair, using the respective gain gain information tables 326 , 526 , such that the perceptually weighted error energy for the subframe, E, as represented by equation (30), is minimized over the vectors in the gain information table which are evaluated.
- each term involving ⁇ and ⁇ in the representation of E as expressed in equation (30) may be precomputed by each coder 300 , 500 for each ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) pair and stored in a respective gain information table 326 , 526 , wherein each gain information 326 , 526 comprises a lookup table.
- a value of ⁇ may be obtained by multiplying, by the value ‘ ⁇ 0.5’, a first term of the 14 precomputed terms (corresponding to the gain vector selected) of equation (30). Similarly, a value of ⁇ may be obtained by multiplying, by the value ‘ ⁇ 0.5’, the third of the 14 precomputed terms of equation (30). Since the correlations R pp , R pc , and R cc are explicitly decoupled from the gain terms ⁇ and ⁇ , by the decomposition process described above, the correlations R pp , R pc and R cc may be computed only once for each subframe.
- R pp may be omitted altogether because, for a given subframe, the correlation R pp is a constant, with the result that with or without the correlation R pp in equation (30) the same gain vector, that is, ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) pair, would be chosen.
- equation (30) When the terms of the equation (30) are precomputed as described above, an evaluation of equation (30) may be efficiently implemented with 14 Multiply Accumulate (MAC) operations per gain vector being evaluated.
- MAC Multiply Accumulate
- N 3 ⁇ L , ⁇ N 2 , N 4 ⁇ L ⁇ N 3 , and so on.
- the decomposition process presented above effectively decouples the constituent vectors from the gain parameters, or scale factors, ⁇ and ⁇ for the case when L ⁇ N, with the specific example of N/2 ⁇ L ⁇ N being given.
- the decomposition makes it possible to treat the constituent vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n), once they are defined by equations (17)–(20), as vectors which are independent of one another. This makes it possible to precompute, for a given subframe, the correlation terms R pc and R cc and thus efficiently evaluate equation (30).
- a quantization of the gain vectors and a determination of an optimal pair may instead comprise retrieving each gain vector in gain information table 326 , 526 and evaluating equation (30) over each of the gain vectors stored in the table and selecting a gain vector, that is, a ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) pair, that results in a minimum value of E at that subframe.
- a gain vector quantizer that is, gain information table 326 , 526 .
- a CELP coder may solve a system of simultaneous linear equations in jointly optimizing gains ⁇ and ⁇ , for example.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a exemplary CELP coder 600 in accordance with the linearized embodiment of the present invention. Similar to coders 300 and 500 , coder 600 is implemented in a processor that is in communication with one or more memory devices that store data, codebooks, and programs that may be executed by the processor. Coder 600 is similar to coder 500 except that, in coder 600 , the scale factors, or gain parameters, associated with each of the constituent vectors ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 0 (n) through ⁇ overscore (c) ⁇ 3 (n) are independent. By making the scale factors independent, a linear solution may be obtained for jointly optimal excitation vector-related gain parameters.
- equation (33) is more general formulation of the synthetic excitation function provided in equation (32).
- equation (32) and equation (33) are equivalent.
- the formulation of ex(n) provided by equation (33), when the scale factors are chosen as shown in equation (34), is capable of implementing the CELP excitation synthesis equation (1) exactly.
- coder 600 may be considered to illustration a particular, linear embodiment of coders 300 and 500 .
- Equations (11), (12), and (13) may now be revisited and revised based on the concept of decomposing the combined excitation signal, or vector, into constituent vectors that are each independent of the gains for the case when L ⁇ N. Furthermore, the technique of making the solution for the jointly optimal set of gains a linear problem in the context of that example is also illustrated. Equations (11), (12), and (13) are now restated as the following equations (39), (40), and (41):
- a scheme may be derived whereby error minimization units 324 , 524 , and 624 can determine a jointly optimal gain vector ( ⁇ , ⁇ ).
- a virtual codebook also known in the art as an adaptive codebook (ACB) is used to construct c 0 (n) in this example.
- ACB adaptive codebook
- the use of a virtual codebook to construct c 0 (n) means that a generation of c 0 (n) is based on ex(n), n ⁇ 0 and that c 0 (n) is linearly combined with ⁇ in equation (39).
- the vector c 1 (n) is constructed by applying a pitch sharpening filter, which is a zero state LTP filter defined by parameters ⁇ circumflex over (L) ⁇ and ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ to ⁇ tilde over (c) ⁇ 1 (n) which is the selected codevector.

- Solving for a jointly optimal gain vector, that is, pair of gain terms ( ⁇ , ⁇ ) involves taking a first partial derivative of E, that is, of equation (47) with respect to ⁇ and setting the first partial derivative equal to zero (0), taking a second partial derivative of E with respect to ⁇ and setting the second partial derivative equal to zero (0) and then solving a system of two simultaneous nonlinear equations which results, that is, solving the following two simultaneous nonlinear equations:
- equation (51) is partially differentiated with respect to each of the three gains ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 , and each of the three resulting differential equations is then set equal to zero (0), that is:
- a jointly optimal scale factor, or gain, vector ( ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 ), may then be obtained by solving the system of three simultaneous linear equations represented by the three differential equations provided in equation (52), as shown below:
Abstract
Description
ex(n)=γ{tilde over (c)} 1(n)+βex(n−L), n=0, N−1 (1)
where ex(n) is a synthetic combined excitation signal for a subframe, {tilde over (c)}1(n) is a codevector, or excitation vector, selected from a codebook, such as FCB 103, I is an index parameter, or codeword, specifying the selected codevector, γ is the gain for scaling the codevector, ex(n−L) is a synthetic combined excitation signal delayed by L samples relative to the n-th sample of the current subframe for voiced speech L is typically related to the pitch period), β is a long term predictor (LTP) gain factor, and N is the number of samples in the subframe. When n−L<0, ex(n−L) contains the history of past synthetic excitation, constructed as shown in equation (1). That is, for n−L<0, the expression ‘ex(n−L)’ corresponds to an excitation sample constructed prior to the current subframe, which excitation sample has been delayed and scaled pursuant to an LTP filter transfer function ‘1/(1−βz−L).’
ex(n)=βc o(n)+γc 1(n), n=0, N−1, (2)
where
c 0(n)=ex(n−L), n=0, N−1, (3)
c 1(n)={tilde over (c)} 1(n), n=0, N−1, (4)
and where c0(n) is an LTP vector selected for the subframe and c1(n) is a selected codevector for the subframe. Since L≧N, c0(n) and c1(n), once chosen, are explicitly independent of β and γ in the formulation of equation (2). Moreover, c0(n) is only a function of ex(n) for n<0, which keeps the solution for β a linear problem. Likewise, because L≧N, c1(n) is not affected by long term predictor (LTP)
In equation (6), c0(n) contains a vector fetched from a “virtual codebook,” typically an adaptive codebook (ACB), where L<N is allowed. The definition of c1(n) as given in equation (4) is retained in equation (6), which means that, when L<N, {tilde over (c)}1(n) is exempted from being filtered by an LTP filter. This is another departure from direct implementation of equation (1). Thus, equation (5) has the advantages of providing the simplified implementation provided by equation (2) while also permitting L<N. It does so by departing from an exact implementation of equation (1) when L<N.
It is apparent in equations (8), (9), and (10) that when L<N, c1(n) is periodic in L over N samples.
Note that in equation (12) a “virtual codebook,” or ACB, is being used and the long-term delay {circumflex over (L)}, for the “pitch sharpening filter”, and L, the delay associated with the ACB, are allowed to be different. For example, L may have a value represented with a fraction of a sample resolution (in which case an interpolating filter would be used to calculate fractionally delayed samples), while {circumflex over (L)} may be a function of L, where it is set equal to a value of L rounded or truncated to an integer value closest to L. Alternatively, {circumflex over (L)} may be set equal to L. In addition, in Salami et al. {circumflex over (β)} is a constant set to 0.8.
{circumflex over (β)}=Max(0.2, Min(0.8, β)). (14)
That is, {circumflex over (β)} is initially set equal to β, but is then limited to be not less than 0.2 and no greater than 0.8. The approach set out in the '055 patent is the approach used in speech coder standards Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Alliance Interim Standard 127 (TIA/EIA/IS-127) and Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) standard 06.60, which standards are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
{circumflex over (β)}=Max(0.2, Min(0.8, βprevious)). (15)
βprevious in equation (15) represents value of β used to define the excitation sequence ex(n) at the preceding subframe. Speech coders described in International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation G.729, “Coding of Speech at 8 kbit/s using Conjugate-Structure Algebraic-Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CS-ACELP),” Geneva, 1996 and TIA/EIA/IS-641 employ this approach. While this approach solves the non-causality problem outlined, it is less than optimal because βprevious will not always accurately model β at the current subframe, particularly when the degree of voicing at the current subframe is substantially different from the degree of voicing at the previous subframe, such as in a voiced-to-unvoiced or unvoiced-to-voiced transition region.
Weighted input signal s′(n) and a filtered version of past excitation signal ex(n−N), that is, d(n), produced by
ex(n)={overscore (y)} L(n)+{overscore (y)} 1(n)=βc 0(n)+γ{tilde over (c)} 1(n)+βγ{tilde over (c)}1(n−L). (16)
ex(n)=γ{tilde over (c)} 1(n)+βex(n−L), n=0, N−1. (1)
and which synthetic combined excitation signal ex(n) can be represented by the following equation (21):
ex(n)=β{overscore (c)} 0(n)+β2{overscore (c)}1(n)+γ{overscore (c)}2(n)+βγ{overscore (c)}3(n), n=0, N−1. (21)
{overscore (c)}0(n) is the component of ex(n) for the subframe which is to be scaled by a gain β. {overscore (c)}1(n) is the component of ex(n) for the subframe which is to be scaled by a gain β2. {overscore (c)}2(n) is the codevector contribution to ex(n) which is to be scaled by a gain γ. Finally, {overscore (c)}3(n) is the codevector contribution to ex(n) which is to be scaled by a gain βγ. The decomposition of equation (1) into a linear superposition of four gain-scaled constituent vectors {overscore (c)}0(n) through {overscore (c)}3(n), as shown in equation (21), explicitly decouples the constituent vectors from the gain scale factors β and γ.
p(n)=s′(n)−d(n), n=0, N−1. (22)
ex(n)=β{overscore (c)} 0′(n)+β2 {overscore (c)} 1′(n)+γ{overscore (c)} 2′(n)+βγ{overscore (c)} 3′(n), n=0, N−1 (23)
and a perceptually weighted error energy for the subframe, E, can be represented by either of the following equations (24) and (25), that is:
Rewriting equation (25) in terms of the correlations represented by equations (26)–(29) and the gain terms β and γ then yields the following equation for the perceptually weighted error energy for the subframe E:
Solving for a jointly optimal set of excitation vector-related gain terms (β,γ) involves taking a first partial derivative of E with respect to β and setting the first partial derivative equal to zero (0), taking a second partial derivative of E with respect to γ and setting the second partial derivative equal to zero (0), and then solving the resulting system of two simultaneous nonlinear equations, that is, solving the following pair of simultaneous nonlinear equations:
Those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that a solving of equation (31) does not need to be performed by either
the methodology outlined may easily be extended to cases where
and so on.
ex(n)=β{overscore (c)} 0(n)+β2 {overscore (c)} 1(n)+γ{overscore (c)}2(n)+βγ{overscore (c)}3(n), n=0, N−1, (32)
and, again, it is apparent that determining the jointly optimal gains β and γ, such that the weighted error energy E in equation (30) is minimized, involves solving a system of two simultaneous non-linear equations, that is, solving equation (31). However, as an alternative to solving the system of simultaneous equations for an optimal gain vector, that is, an optimal (β,γ) pair, a quantization of the gain vectors and a determination of an optimal pair may instead comprise retrieving each gain vector in gain information table 326, 526 and evaluating equation (30) over each of the gain vectors stored in the table and selecting a gain vector, that is, a (β,γ) pair, that results in a minimum value of E at that subframe. Alternatively, only a subset of the vectors in the gain vector quantizer, that is, gain information table 326, 526, may be preselected for evaluation so as to further limit the amount of computation related to the selection of the (β,γ) pair.
ex(n)=λ0 {overscore (c)} 0(n)+λ1 {overscore (c)} 1(n)+λ2 {overscore (c)} 2(n)+λ3 {overscore (c)} 3(n), n=0, N−1. (33)
where λ0,λ1,λ2,λ3 are the gains, or scale factors, respectively associated with constituent vectors {overscore (c)}0(n) through {overscore (c)}3(n) and applied to the constituent vectors by
λ0=β,λ1=β2,λ2=γ, and λ3=βλ, (34)
then equation (32) and equation (33) are equivalent. Thus the formulation of ex(n) provided by equation (33), when the scale factors are chosen as shown in equation (34), is capable of implementing the CELP excitation synthesis equation (1) exactly. In this sense,
Expanding equation (35) and expressing it in terms of the correlations results in the following equation:
In order to solve for a jointly optimal gain, or scale factor, vector (λ0,λ1,λ2,λ3), equation (36) can be partially differentiated, with respect to each of the four gains, or scale factors, and each of the four resulting equations can then be set equal to zero (0):
The constraint for the example being considered is that N/2≦L<N and N/2≦{circumflex over (L)}<N.
where vectors {overscore (c)}0(n), {overscore (c)}1(n), and {overscore (c)}2(n) are constituent vectors of the combined excitation vector. An energy of the weighted error, that is, E, corresponding to the combined excitation signal ex(n) represented by equation (42) may then be represented by the following equation:
The energy of the weighted error, E, may also be expressed in terms of signal correlations as follows:
E=R pp−2βR pc(0)−2γR pc(1)−2{circumflex over (β)}γR pc(2)+2βγR cc(0,1)+2β{circumflex over (β)}γR cc(0,2)+{circumflex over (β)}γ2 R cc(1,2)+β2 R cc(0,0)+γ2 R cc(1,1)+{circumflex over (β)}2γ2 R cc(2,2) (47)
The definition of {circumflex over (β)} given by equation (14) is assumed here, that is:
{circumflex over (β)}=Max(0.2, Min(0.8,β)) (48)
Note that {circumflex over (β)} is a function of the gain parameter β used at the current subframe and not of a gain parameter of a previous subframe. Thus equation (47) has two independent variables, that is, β and γ. Solving for a jointly optimal gain vector, that is, pair of gain terms (β,γ), involves taking a first partial derivative of E, that is, of equation (47) with respect to β and setting the first partial derivative equal to zero (0), taking a second partial derivative of E with respect to γ and setting the second partial derivative equal to zero (0) and then solving a system of two simultaneous nonlinear equations which results, that is, solving the following two simultaneous nonlinear equations:
ex(n)=λ0{overscore (c)}0(n)+λ1{overscore (c)}1(n)+λ2{overscore (c)}2(n), n=0, N−1 (49)
The corresponding subframe weighted error E may then be expressed as:
Expanding equation (50) and expressing equation (50) in terms of the resulting correlations produces in the following expression for the subframe weighted error E:
In order to solve for a jointly optimal scale factor, or gain, vector (λ0,λ1,λ2), equation (51) is partially differentiated with respect to each of the three gains λ0,λ1,λ2, and each of the three resulting differential equations is then set equal to zero (0), that is:
A jointly optimal scale factor, or gain, vector (λ0,λ1,λ2), may then be obtained by solving the system of three simultaneous linear equations represented by the three differential equations provided in equation (52), as shown below:
