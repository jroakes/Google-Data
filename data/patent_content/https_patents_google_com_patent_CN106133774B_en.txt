, whether presentation based on third party content item executes whether specific action, third party content item are selected and distributed to user
Bid, and/or other types of bid.For example, whether being selected based on third party content item and the bid distributed can be lower
It bids (for example, $ 0.005), and can be higher bid (for example, $ 5) based on the bid whether user executes specific action.One
In a little situations, it is contemplated that the probability with the type association of bid is to adjust bid, and/or bids for other reasons to adjust.
For example, the probability that user executes specific action can be low, such as 0.2%, and selecting and distribute the probability of third party content item can be for
100% (for example, selecting and the content item that distributes content item if being selected during auction will occur, therefore bids not
It adjusts).Therefore, such as value of score or normalized value can be generated competing based on bid value and probability or another modified values
It is used in bat.In the case where in front, whether is selected based on third party content item and the value of bid or score that distribute can be for
0,005*1.00=0.005, and whether the value of the bid of specific action is executed based on user or score can be $ 5*0.002=
0.01.In some implementations, in order to make maximum revenue generated, content item selection system can select to have from auction
The third party content item of peak.In these cases, content item selection system may be selected be based on user whether execute it is specific
The associated content item of the bid of action, because with the associated higher value of the bid or score.
Once content item selects Systematic selection third party content item, third party content is realized on the display of user apparatus
The data of the presentation of item can be provided to user apparatus using network.Provided by user on user apparatus may be selected or click
Third party content item.In some cases, it quotes another resource with the associated URL of third party content item, such as webpage or logs in
Page.In other cases, URL can return to reference content item selection system, third party content server or content item management.

Breath, Social behaviors or activity, occupation, the preference of user or user current location) or control whether and/or how from can
Content server reception content item that can be more relevant with user.In addition, certain data can be before by storage or use according to one
Kind or more mode handle (for example, by content item select system 112) so that personal can recognize that information is removed.
For example, the identity of user can it is processed so that not can determine whether user individual can recognize information, or obtain location information
In the case where the geographical location of user can be generalized and (such as reach city, postcode or state rank) so that can not
Determine the specific position of user.Therefore, how user controllable information processed is collected (for example, by application, by user apparatus 108 etc.)
And it is used by content item selection system 112.
Resource Server 110 may include multiple computing devices.Computing device can be configured as the service of trustship resource
Device, webpage or other resources (for example, article, comment, music, video, figure, search result, information feeding etc.).Resource
Server 110 can be computer server (for example, file delivery service device (FTP) server, file-sharing server, web
Server etc.) or server combination (for example, data center, cloud computing platform etc.).One Resource Server 110 can to
Family device 108 provides resource data or other contents, for example, text document, Portable Document format (PDF) file and other
The electronic document of form, and another Resource Server 110 can provide third party content supplier and provide together with content item
URL resource to be referred to.For example, Resource Server can trustship publisher webpage or search engine, and another resource
Server can landing page cited in trustship such as advertiser resource；In some cases, a Resource Server 110 can be held in the palm
Pipe two kinds of resources.In one implementation, it is realistic to ask can to access Resource Server 110 via network 101 for user apparatus 108
Now to the data of the presentation of the resource of Resource Server 110.In one implementation, content item management 104 can be via
Network 101 accesses another Resource Server 110 with the URL resource to be referred to for requesting third party content supplier 102 to provide.
It may include any kind of information or data that can be provided through network 101 by the resource that Resource Server 110 provides
Structure.In some implementations, resource can be by identifying with 110 associated resource address (for example, URL) of Resource Server.
Resource may include webpage (for example, html web page, PHP: HyperText Preprocessor (PHP) webpage etc.), word processing file, PDF
File, image, video, programming element, interaction content, streamed video/audio-source or other types of electronic information.By
The resource that Resource Server 110 provides can be webpage, local resource, Intranet resource, Internet resources or other networks
Resource.In some implementations, resource includes when user apparatus 108 and content item select third party provided by system 112
One or more webpages that user apparatus 108 (for example, via hyperlink of insertion) is directed to when content item interaction.
It may include at least one logic device that content item, which selects system 112, the calculating dress such as with data processor
It sets, via network 101 and such as third party content supplier 102, content item management 104, third party content server
106, user apparatus 108 and/or Resource Server 110 communicate.In some implementations, content item selection system 112 can wrap
Include third party content server 106.Content item selection system 112 may include the server of Advertisement Server etc..
In one implementation, content item selection system 112 can be received via network 101 to presenting with resource
The request of content item.Received request can receive from appointing in Resource Server 110, user apparatus 108 and/or system 100

Content item request URL is attached to (for example, contentitem.item/page/contentitem devid=abcl23&devnfo
=A34r0).In some implementations, device information and/or resource information can before being attached to content item request URL quilt
Coding.Request unit information and/or resource information can be selected by content item selection system 112 will be with requested resource one
Act the third party content item on the display for distributing and being presented on user apparatus 108.
Fig. 2 is the flow chart for verifying the implementation of the process of identifier of content provider.Brief overview, the party
Method generally includes: receiving first identifier symbol, content item and URL, the URL mark first resource (210) from content provider；It determines
The domain (215) of URL；Multiple Secondary resources are accessed, each Secondary resource is under identified domain, by the multiple Secondary resource
(220) are stored in memory；And multiple second identifier symbols (230) are detected from the multiple Secondary resource.This method is also wrapped
It includes: by the multiple second identifier symbol and the domain mapping (235)；It will be in first identifier symbol and the multiple second identifier symbol
Each compares (240)；And approved content supplier is used together first identifier symbol (250) with content item.Optionally, the party
Method may include filtering a part of each of the multiple Secondary resource (225).In other implementations, these stages
It can execute in a different order.
In particular, this method comprises: receiving first identifier symbol, content item and URL, the URL mark from content provider
First resource (210).In some implementations, content item is associated with URL.For example, being content by the first resource that URL is identified
The landing page of item.First identifier symbol, content item and URL can be sent and in content item management from third party content supplier 102
It is received at system 104.In some implementations, URL and first identifier symbol are only received, and is marked from the received URL of institute
The first resource of knowledge generates content item.For example, may have access to and store first resource cited in URL, and come from first resource
Various elements can be combined to generate content item.In some implementations, only reception content item and first identifier accord with, and
The content item includes URL.In some implementations, only reception content item and URL, and the content item includes first identifier
Symbol.In some implementations, only reception content item, and the content item includes that first identifier accords with and URL.For example, content item
It can be image, and a part of the image may include first identifier symbol.It is mentioned using such as optical character identification from image
First identifier is taken to accord with.In another example, content item can be text, and a part of the text may include first identifier
Symbol.It is accorded with using such as pattern-recognition or regular expression from Text Feature Extraction first identifier.First identifier is being extracted from content item
In the implementation of symbol, this method may include being accorded with by according with connection content provider using first identifier to verify the first identifier
Effectively.For example, this method may include that advertisement general is clicked in verifying if content item is the advertisement for showing the telephone number of insertion
By dialing the telephone number come call contents supplier.In the implementation with first identifier symbol reception content item,
Content item is verified as not being embedded in one other identification symbol.For example, content item be scanned to verifying content item whether be embedded with it is another
Identifier.In some cases, if content item is embedded with identifier, content provider is not allowed to use the content item.In
In other situations, if content item is embedded with identifier, the identifier, and if extracted identifier and first are detected
Identifier mismatches, then first identifier symbol does not go through to be used together with content item.Otherwise, if extracted identifier and
One identifier match, then method 200 continues.
Identifier can be can be with any contact details of the third party content supplier 102 of content item association.User's dress
Setting the user on 108 can be used identifier to contact or position third party content supplier 102.Identifier can be phone number
Code, address, e-mail address, Fax number, Video chat handle, instant message handle, social media profile, disbursement letter
Breath or any other contact details.Third party content supplier 102 provides contact details and accords with as first identifier, works as content item
First identifier symbol can be display together or be embedded into the content item together with the content item when being displayed to user apparatus 108,
So that the user on user apparatus 108 accords with connection third party content supplier 102 using the first identifier.For example, third party
Content provider 102 can provide sale telephone number with the advertisement for the user being shown on user apparatus 108, so that handy
Family can call third party content supplier 102 by the sale telephone number.
URL quotes the resource of trustship on Resource Server 110 or third party content supplier 102.The received URL of institute can be marked
Know as be used for the webpage of received content item or the resource of landing page.First resource can be by third party content supplier 102
It maintains.Content item can be the advertisement of the product provided on first resource by third party content supplier 102, service, promotion,
Coupon etc..For example, third party content supplier 102 can be online retailer, first resource can be online retailer
Webpage, and content item can be the advertisement of the webpage.
As shown in Fig. 2, this method further includes the domain (215) of determining URL.The domain of URL can be by resolving to text string for URL
To identify.In some implementations, URL can be resolved the domain to identify URL.Regular expression, text search, mould can be used
Formula identification and other means known in the art identify the domain of URL.
In some implementations, domain is rhizosphere.In other implementations, domain is subdomain.For example, URL can be
Sub.example.com, wherein " example " is rhizosphere, " sub " is subdomain.Some URL can have the subdomain of multiple ranks.
In some implementations, it may be determined that multiple domains, each domain have different domain ranks.For example, it may be determined that the son of rhizosphere and URL
Domain.In some implementations, one in quantity selection domain based on available resource in each domain.In some implementations
In, one in the type selection domain based on domain.
In some implementations, one in the domain of URL is selected compared with domain list based on domain.Domain list can quilt
It is stored in content item management 104, content item selection system 112, Resource Server 110 or computer system 100
In any other component.The domain of each rank in URL can be compared with domain list.In some implementations, rhizosphere can
Compared first, and subdomain can compare according to the sequence of domain rank.In some implementations, the domain of lowest level can be first
First compare, and the domain of higher level can compare according to the inverted order of domain rank.Domain list can store domain, the domain may include by
The subdomain of multiple tissues or user's control.For example, list may include example.com, wherein example.com can have subdomain
Parentl.example.com and parent2.example.com, each subdomain is by different tissue or user's control or institute
Have.This method may include a selection domain from rhizosphere or one or more subdomains, so that selected domain does not occur
In domain list.For example, the received URL of institute can be parentl.example.com.It can be first by rhizosphere example.com
It is compared with domain list.The rhizosphere is found in domain, and does not therefore select the rhizosphere.By subdomain
Parent1.example.com is compared with domain list.Possibly the subdomain can not be found in domain list, and therefore selected
The subdomain.
In some implementations, it is selected based on the tissue or user of searching one or more domains in control URL
One in domain.It may be selected only by a tissue or the domain of the highest level of user's control.The tissue in each domain or user can quilts
It is stored in content item management 104, content item selection system 112, Resource Server 110 or computer system 100
In any other component.For example, the tissue of control rhizosphere example.com can be confirmed as Example company, and control son
The tissue of domain parentl.example.com can be confirmed as Parentl company.It can find under rhizosphere and be controlled by different tissues
Another subdomain, such as parent2.example.com.In response, rhizosphere example.com selection subdomain can be crossed
parentl.example.com。
In some implementations, this method may include selecting the domain of lowest level.If not from the resource stored
Identifier is extracted, or if not having identifier match in the multiple identifiers extracted, the domain of higher level may be selected.This
Process is repeatable, until reaching rhizosphere.
In some implementations, the mapping accorded with from database or memory component load domain and multiple second identifiers.
The mapping may include the grade of freshness when instruction mapping is created or updates.Grade of freshness can be compared with predetermined value or threshold value
Compared with to determine whether mapping must be updated or re-create.In some implementations, the mapping that load can be used, instead of
It accesses and stores multiple Secondary resources (220), the multiple second identifier symbols (230) of detection and reflect the multiple second identifier symbol
It is incident upon domain (235).
As shown in Fig. 2, this method further includes accessing multiple Secondary resources, domain with by the storage of the multiple Secondary resource to depositing
In reservoir, each Secondary resource (220) under identified domain.In some implementations, the multiple Secondary resource can quilt
It is loaded into memory.Secondary resource can by with received URL share identical domain the 2nd URL identify.In some realizations
In mode, the database or memory component for being connected to the computing device of network 101 are stored with the received URL of institute in identical domain
Under multiple 2nd URL.Database or memory component can be search engine, content item management 104, third party content
A part of server 106 or content item selection system 112.Database or memory component can be queried to retrieve multiple URL.
For example, database can store the mapping of multiple URL Yu each domain.Web crawler or robot can be loaded by looking into received from database
The resource or webpage for the multiple URL mark ask.In some implementations, URL can be creeped or be navigated in web crawler or robot
Domain and identify each resource or webpage under the domain.
Each Secondary resource under domain can be accessed and store in memory.Secondary resource can be from storage first resource
Resource Server 110 accesses in the different resource server 110 of internet protocol address resolution to identical domain.First
Resource can be accessed and be stored as one in Secondary resource.In some cases, the multiple Secondary resource can only include the
One resource.Content item management 104 can access or request Secondary resource from the Resource Server 110 of trustship Secondary resource.Make
For response, Secondary resource can be sent to content item management 104 by Resource Server 110.In some implementations, second
Resource is stored in memory as text string, for example, as html file.In other implementations, Secondary resource can
It is resolvable to object tree and is rendered as such as webpage.In some implementations, Secondary resource may include on webpage
The reference of other content items of such as image of rendering.In some implementations, the other content items quoted by Secondary resource
Not accessed, storage, load or rendering.For example, other content items can be with webpage accessed, storage, load or
The advertisement of rendering.
For example, access and storage resource may include by by resource resolution at object tree, such as DOM Document Object Model (DOM)
Tree is to load resource.Dom tree can be the hierarchical model of specific resources.Dom tree may include image information (for example, image URL,
Display position, display size, replacement text etc.), font information (for example, font name, size, effect etc.), colouring information (example
Such as, RGB color value, hexadecimal color code etc.) and resource text information.
In another example, access and storage resource may include the snapshot plotting by rendering resources to create the resource of rendering
As loading resource.Snapshot image can be the visual representation of specific resources.Snapshot image can be shown after rendering resources such as
Outside the vision of the resource presented on user's interface device (for example, electronic display, computer monitor, touch-sensitive display etc.)
It sees.Snapshot image may include colouring information (for example, pixel color, brightness, saturation degree etc.).In some implementations, snapshot
Image can be the picture file with any feasible file extension (for example.jpg .png .bmp etc.).
As shown in Fig. 2, optionally, this method includes filtering a part of each of the multiple Secondary resource
(225).In some implementations, entire Secondary resource can be filtered.In some implementations, for multiple Secondary resources
In one, do not filter any part.In some implementations, one of deletion resource stored in memory can be passed through
Divide the part identified for carrying out filtered resources.For example, if the text of Secondary resource is stored in memory, in memory
The part of the middle text for deleting Secondary resource.In another example, if Secondary resource is resolvable to object tree, in memory
It is middle to delete node corresponding with the part of filtering.In some cases, the position of the part of the filtering of Secondary resource is according to list
Or it is stored according to another data structure.In some implementations, the part of filtering can correspond to third party content item or
Advertisement.The corresponding part of first resource can be designated as label or the node of third party content item to detect third party by searching
Content item.
The part of filtering can be user content, that is, by the visitor or user of webpage rather than the publisher of webpage or master
The content that people writes.For example, some webpages can have comment section, any user can be in the comment for wherein writing himself.In
In some implementations, user comment can be detected by searching in the Secondary resource for storing or loading.In some realizations
In mode, the label or node for the Secondary resource for storing or loading can indicate that the corresponding part of Secondary resource is comment.One
In a little implementations, there can be the time of the user name near the part for being identified as comment of Secondary resource by finding
Or date signature is commented on to detect.It is described nearby such as to pass through analytic sheaf by analyzing the Secondary resource for storing or loading
Resource is rendered into webpage by stacking style table (CSS), to determine.It in some implementations, can be by finding insertion second
Third party's Commentary Systems in resource detect comment or comment section.In some implementations, user name or with the use
The associated signature of name in an account book can be detected as repeating in multiple Secondary resources.Content near user name or signature can quilt
Filtering.
As shown in Fig. 2, this method further includes detecting multiple second identifier symbols (230) from the multiple Secondary resource.One
In a little implementations, this method may include extracting from the multiple Secondary resource, identifying or recognizing multiple second identifier symbols.One
In a little implementations, the multiple second identifier symbol can only include a second identifier symbol.When accessing second identifier symbol, second
The part of the filtering of resource is ignored.For example, may have potential identifier in the comment section of webpage, in such case
Under, which accords with accessed not as second identifier.In the realization that the position of the part of filtering is stored according to list
In mode, any potential identifier for being found on Secondary resource according to the list inspection.If potential identifier is located at
Specified position in the list, then the potential identifier is not selected accords with as second identifier.In some implementations,
Second identifier symbol can be accessed from the hidden parts of Secondary resource.The hidden parts of resource can be referred to by the label or node of Secondary resource
It is fixed.As text stored or be loaded into the implementation in memory in multiple Secondary resources, can be used regular expression,
Pattern-recognition and other text searches accord with to find second identifier symbol or multiple second identifiers.It can be resolved in Secondary resource
At in object tree and the implementation of rendering, the second mark can be detected in the Secondary resource of rendering via such as optical character identification
Know symbol.
Second identifier symbol can be any connection letter for the third party content supplier 102 that can be detected from multiple Secondary resources
Breath.Second identifier symbol can be telephone number, address, e-mail address, Fax number, Video chat handle, disappear immediately
Handle, social media profile, payment information or any other contact details are ceased, are to accord with same type with first identifier
Contact details.In some implementations, each of multiple second identifier symbols, which can be, accords with same type with first identifier
Identifier.For example, each of multiple second identifier symbols are also phone number if first identifier symbol is telephone number
Code.Multiple potential identifiers in Secondary resource can be found.Each potential identifier can be classified.For example, one potential
Identifier can be classified as telephone number, and another potential identifier can be classified as e-mail address.Only divided
Class is that the potential identifier for the identifier for according with same type with first identifier is selectable as in multiple second identifier symbols
One.In other implementations, some second identifier symbols, which can be, accords with different types of identifier with first identifier.For example,
First identifier symbol can be telephone number, and one in second identifier symbol can be telephone number, and another in second identifier symbol
One can be Email.Second identifier symbol can be detected using different regular collections according to the type of identifier.For example,
It a regular collection can be used to detect telephone number, and another regular collection can be used to detect address.Some
In implementation, multiple contact details can be detected in a part of webpage.For example, address can be in telephone number in resource
Near.
Regular collection for detecting different types of identifier can be implemented as module.Regular collection can be used for detecting electricity
Talk about number, address, Email, Fax number, Video chat handle, instant message handle, payment information or social media
Profile.For example, detection Video chat handle may include searching for the uniform resource identifier for searching for insertion in Secondary resource
(URI)。
Regular collection for detecting telephone number is described in further detail.In some implementations, when detection the
Various conventions and format are contemplated that when two identifiers.Telephone number convention may specify that potential identifier is valid telephone number
Code.Phone number format may specify the various normal methods for writing telephone number.For example, in the U.S. and other North American Number sides
In case country, telephone number may include tens, and wherein front three is area code.Area code can be placed in bracket or area code can
It is separated with dash or fullstop with other four figures.Tens may include prefix number 1.For example, first resource may include packet
The number of tens is included, wherein first three digit is separated by dash.Then the number can be detected as second identifier symbol.One
In a little implementations, the convention and format of multiple countries and regions can be applied.For example, the telephone number of India is also tens.
When detecting the second telephone number from first resource or multiple Secondary resources, if potential telephone number has tens,
Then it is compared with the regular collection of the regular collection of US phone number and India's telephone number.
In some implementations, the country code top level domain of URL can be detected from URL to determine which regular collection used
To detect second identifier symbol.For example, abiding by the rule of US phone number if the country code top level domain of URL is " .us "
The telephone number of set can be detected as second identifier symbol.In some implementations, domain name can be resolved to Internet protocol
(IP) then the IP address can be used to find the geographical location of Resource Server 110 in address.In some implementations, may be used
Determine the position of user apparatus 108.Geographical location can be used for determining detects second identifier symbol using which regular collection.Example
Such as, it if geographical location instruction Resource Server 110 or user apparatus 108 are located at northern California, may be used for detecting the U.S.
Telephone number regular collection.In another example, detection area code US phone number corresponding with northern California can be used
Regular collection.
Regular collection for detecting address is described in further detail.Address may include one of the following
Or more: country, postcode, county, state, city, town, village, urban district, area, street, street number, unit number, Business Name or
Any other part of address.Address convention may specify the sequence and initial contracting of the different piece of address
It writes, abridge, prefix and suffix.It can be by searching for the second money using regular expression, pattern-recognition and other text searches
The text in source finds one or more parts of address.For example, regular expression search can be in five or nine postal volumes
U.S address is found in code.It is close to the other parts for the address part detection address found.For example, can be in the postal found
Find state abbreviation, such as California CA in political affairs coding front.In some implementations, the object of Secondary resource can be used
Tree is to find address.The label or node of object tree can indicate the mapping of insertion.For example, src attribute is set to be directed toward
The floating frame label of the link of mapping web site can indicate that mapping is embedded into Secondary resource.Can in the label or node or
The label or near nodal detect address.
As shown in Fig. 2, this method includes creating the mapping (235) of second identifier symbol and domain.In some implementations, should
Mapping may include the multiple second identifiers symbol for being mapped to domain.In some implementations, mapping may include being mapped to URL's
Multiple second identifier symbols.In some implementations, mapping does not include duplicate second identifier and accords with.Mapping may also include freshness
Value.When the mapping that grade of freshness can refer to localization updates or creates.Mapping can be stored in database or memory component.In
In some implementations, the mapping stored can be loaded after the domain (215) for determining URL.
As shown in Fig. 2, this method further includes being compared each of first identifier symbol and multiple second identifiers symbol
(240).In some implementations, first identifier is accorded with and multiple the as the identifier with first identifier symbol same type
Each of two identifiers are compared.For example, as each second identifier symbol of telephone number and as telephone number
First identifier symbol is compared.In some implementations, part is subjected to match.For example, a part that first identifier is accorded with
It is compared with a part of each second identifier symbol.If the part of first identifier symbol is matched with the part that second identifier accords with,
And if the part has the identifier of predefined size and field, wherein the class of the predefined size and field by identifier
Type determines, then receives the matching, and this method continues.For example, if first identifier symbol is telephone number, at least eight-digit number
Before predefined size must match, which can just be received.In another example, if first identifier symbol is mailing ground
Location, then other than the scheduled field of apartment unit number, all fields must be matched, which can just be received.
As shown in Fig. 2, this method further includes matching in response to first identifier symbol with one in multiple second identifiers symbol, batch
Standard is used together first identifier symbol (250) with content item.In some implementations, in first identifier Fu Keyu second identifier symbol
One matching.In other implementations, if such as mapping includes repeated entries, first identifier symbol can be with multiple second
More than one matching in identifier.It can be informed to content provider with provided content item and URL verifying first identifier symbol.
In some implementations, by first identifier symbol and the received content item association of institute.For example, first identifier is accorded with insertion content item
In.First identifier symbol can be stored in third party content server 106 with content item.When content item selects system 112
Determination is stored when the content item on third party content server 106 should be distributed to user apparatus 108 during auction, should
Content item is distributed together with first identifier symbol.Identifier can be display together at user apparatus 108 or first with content item
Identifier can also be embedded into content item so that the user on user apparatus 108 can by click the content item or with this it is interior
Hold item interaction to contact content provider.For example, user apparatus 108 can be smart phone, content item can be advertisement, and
First identifier accords with the telephone number that can be advertiser.When the user on smart phone clicks advertisement, smart phone can be to this
Telephone number dials.
In some implementations, content item selection system 112 produces the link be directed toward and click server, and should
Link sends user apparatus 108 to content item.On user apparatus 108, the link for being directed toward click server be can be used as
The mode of connection third party content supplier is shown.It is shown for example, the link can be used as to the mode that advertiser makes a phone call number
Show.When the user clicks on such link, user apparatus can send request to server is clicked.Clicking server will can such as participate in
