Definitions
- This invention relates generally to signal loss recovery of digitally encoded signals, and more particularly to signal loss recovery of signals that are digitally encoded by predictive coders, for realtime and/or interactive communications.
- Predictive coding is widely used for compression of digital signals (e.g., speech, image or video) by removing the statistical redundancy among neighboring samples of these waveforms.
- digital signals e.g., speech, image or video
- predictive coding for example, differential pulse-code modulation, or DPCM, is used in G.721.
- DPCM differential pulse-code modulation
- Predictive coding also finds wide applications in image and video coding.
- image coding the value of a pixel can be predicted from its neighboring pixels and the prediction error is quantized and coded.
- video applications a video frame can be predicted from its preceding frames and the prediction error frame is quantized and coded.
- a replica For each MB, a replica is searched in the previously decoded frame to find an NxN block which minimizes a predetermined error function. Then this block is used to predict the current MB.
- the prediction error block and the motion vector which is defined as the displacement of the position of the prediction block with respect to the original block, are coded and transmitted to the receiver.
- the prediction error block first undergoes a DCT, and then the transform coefficients are quantized, and losslessly encoded by runlength and entropy coding.
- FIG. 1, numeral 100 is a block diagram schematic of a predictive waveform encoder as is known in the art.
- the encoder operates iteratively in the following way: (1) a predictor unit (102) generates a prediction of the input vector r i represented by the vector xi based on n past reconstructed vectors Z i-n , . . . , Z i-1 , where n is the order of the predictor.
- forward adaptation the parameters of Q i and P i are passed to the receiver as side information.
- backward adaptation the parameters are determined at the decoder from previously received information; hence no side information needs to be sent.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram schematic of a decoder as is known in the art. It may be viewed as a subset of the corresponding encoder shown in FIG. 1 (100).
- the reconstructed vector Z i is obtained by summing the two vectors Y i and X i by the adder (204); (4) the reconstructed vector Z i is stored in the memory unit Mi for future iterations.
- the memory capacity is chosen to hold n reconstructed vectors of L dimension.
- the side information is also decoded and used to assist the operations of inverse quantization and the prediction.
- the above decoder will operate perfectly if no error happens in the channel between the encoder and decoder pair. However, any physical channel is never perfect. If any of the information bits are damaged during the transmission, the decoder will have a problem reconstructing the vectors ⁇ z i ⁇ . For example, if the vector Y i is corrupted, then vector Y i will also be damaged. Subsequently, Z i is damaged, which will in turn lead to a wrong prediction vector X i+1 for the next iteration, and therefore a damaged Z i+1 . Because of the prediction loop structure, the error will propagate forever. In order to avoid such devastation, in typical applications, some vectors are chosen to be coded directly, i.e., without using prediction.
- intraframe coding In digital video compression applications, such direct coding is called intraframe coding, or simply intra coding, in contrast to another terminology called interframe coding, which uses the prediction coding as described above.
- interframe coding uses the prediction coding as described above.
- the period between two intra coded frames varies for different applications. In H.261, the maximum of this period is 132 video frames.
- Transmission errors can be roughly classified into two categories: random bit errors and erasure errors.
- a random bit error is caused by the imperfection of physical channels, which results in inversion, insertion or deletion of an information bit.
- Erasure errors include such information loss as cell loss in packet switched networks (e.g., Asynchronous Transfer Mode, or ATM, networks) and burst error in storage media due to physical defects. Therefore, a random bit error usually leads to information damage, whereas a erasure error leads to information loss at the receiver.
- VLC Variable Length Coding
- the state-of-the-art for information loss protection and recovery include Automatic Repeat request (ARQ), error control coding (ECC) and error concealment.
- ARQ Automatic Repeat request
- ECC error control coding
- the transmitter keeps a copy of the transmitted information with a predetermined memory size.
- the receiver detects information damage or loss, it sends a request to the transmitter for retransmission of the damaged/lost portion of information.
- ARQ has been quite successful in data communication, it has generally been thought to be inappropriate for services demanding real-time and/or interactive signal delivery because of the involved delay.
- ECC combats transmission errors by adding redundancy to the bitstream to be transmitted in a controlled way, such that some of the bit errors can be detected and, in some cases, corrected.

- ARQ Automatic Retransmission request
- the present invention introduces an important difference from this known technique by utilizing a device/method that eliminates delay, making the device/method of the present invention highly suitable for realtime and/or interactive communications.
- the output binary bitstream from a predictive source waveform encoder is split into data units (DUs), each DU having at least a header and an information field.
- a data unit can be a transmission frame, a packet, or an ATM cell.
- the size of each DU does not have to be the same.
- SNs sequence numbers
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) codes are also included in DUs in order to facilitate error detection at the receiver. Copies of these DUs are stored in a memory at the transmitter. The capacity of the memory is typically chosen such that it can hold an amount of data that corresponds to the round-trip delay.
- the SN and CRC of each received DU are checked to see whether a DU has been lost or damaged.
- the receiver finds that a DU has been damaged or lost, the receiver sends a retransmission request for that particular DU to the transmitter for retransmission.
- the decoder in the receiver in this invention proceeds to process all the following DUs.
- the receiver adds the information contained in that DU to the decoded signal. Therefore, no buffering delay is introduced at the receiver.
- the receiver holds all the DUs it receives after receiving the damaged DU until the arrival of the retransmitted DU, and then resumes its normal operation. Therefore, an extra delay will be introduced when using the conventional ARQ technique.
- FIG. 3, numeral 300 is a block diagram schematic of one embodiment of a signal loss recovery device in accordance with the present invention.
- the signal loss recovery device of the present invention includes: a transmission receiver (302), a source decoder (304), a signal recovery adder (306), and signal recovery circuitry (308).
- the transmission receiver (302) is operably coupled to receive the plurality of data units from the physical channel and to a signal recovery circuitry and is utilized for detecting whether a data unit has been damaged/lost during transmission, and for generating a retransmission request to a transmitter for retransmission of the damaged/lost data unit, for signaling signal recovery circuitry that the data unit is damaged/lost, and for generating a binary bitstream from the received data units.

- the transmission receiver will detect the event and identify the damaged DU's SN. Where a DU has been damaged or lost, the transmission receiver executes the following operations: (1) sending a retransmission request containing the SN of the damaged/lost DU to the transmitter for retransmission; and (2) signaling the signal recovery circuitry (308) of the event of signal loss such that the signal recovery circuitry (308) starts its operation.
- the signal recovery circuitry (308) generates concealment vectors for the damaged vectors.
- the source decoder (304) Before the arrival of the retransmitted DU, the source decoder (304) continues its normal decoding and generates error corrupted output signal vectors. In this process, the source decoder (304) continuously passes decoded 5 side information to the signal recovery circuitry (308). After the transmission receiver (302) receives the retransmitted DU, the signal recovery circuitry generates a correction signal vector from the information contained in the retransmitted DU, which is first processed by the source decoder (304). The signal recovery adder (306) combines the output signals from the source decoder (304) and the signal recovery circuitry (308) to generate an output waveform for a recovered signal.
- the device includes: (A) a transmission receiver (302) which is operably coupled to receive, process data units from the channel and detect whether data unit (DU) damage/loss occurred during transmission; (B) a source decoder (304) that is operably coupled to receive a bitstream from the transmission receiver (302) and to receive outputs from a state saving unit (404) and an error concealment unit (406) of signal recovery circuitry (402) and is used for decoding the bitstream utilizing information from the state saving unit (404) and the error concealment unit (406); (C) the signal recovery circuitry (402), which is operably coupled to the transmission receiver (302) and the source decoder (304) for, where DUs have been damaged/lost, providing error concealment and signal recovery function, wherein the signal recovery circuitry (402)includes a state saving unit (404), an error concealment unit (406), a predictor tracing unit (414), a correction signal generator (4
- the state saving unit (404) which is operably coupled to the transmission receiver (308) and the source decoder (304), is used to save decoding states and information when DU damage occurs.
- the state saving unit (404) includes: (C1a) a decoding states memory (408) which is operably coupled to the transmission receiver (302) and the source decoder (304) to receive and store decoding state information upon the occurrence of DU loss/damage for provision of said information to the source decoder (304); (C1b) an undecodable binary data memory (410) which is operably coupled to the source decoder (304) to receive and store unprocessable information for the source decoder (304), where unprocessability is due to DU damage/loss, for providing the unprocessable information to the source decoder (304) upon the arrival of a retransmitted DU; and (C1c) a prediction memory (412) which is operably coupled to the source decoder (304), for saving prediction memory upon the occurrence of DU loss/damage and providing the
- the error concealment unit (406) is operably coupled to the prediction memory (412) of the state saving unit (404) and is used to perform error concealment for those samples whose information is contained in the damaged DU and the undecodable data, thus providing error concealment information.
- the predictor tracing unit (414) is operably coupled to the source decoder (304) for tracing the prediction operations performed for each sample vector between the DU damage and the arrival of the retransmitted DU.

- the transmission receiver (302) When incoming DUs are errorless, the transmission receiver (302) outputs a bitstream to the source decoder (304), which performs normal decoding, and the outputs from both the error concealment unit (406) and the correction signal generator (416) are zero. However, upon detecting an error, the transmission receiver (302) sends a retransmission request with the SN of the damaged DU to the transmitter for retransmission. The transmission receiver (302) also signals the state saving unit (404) to save all the information which is necessary to continue the decoding process after receiving the retransmitted DU.
- VLC Variable Length Coding
- the source decoder (304) searches for a predetermined search point in the DUs following the damaged DU to facilitate restoration of its decoding operation.
- a predetermined search point may be a start code in H.261 or MPEG.
- the source decoder (304) does not generate output sample vectors; instead, the error concealment unit (406) generates replacement sample vectors so that an output device (e.g., a microphone in speech applications, a TV monitor in video applications) is supplied with continuous waveforms to be played out.
- an output device e.g., a microphone in speech applications, a TV monitor in video applications
- a simplest concealment scheme is the repetition of the last sample vector in the prediction memory.
- Other more sophisticated concealment techniques may also be used.
- For video applications see e.g., Q.-F. Zhu, et al., "Coding and cell loss recovery for DCT-based packet video," IEEE Trans. CAS for Video Technology, pp. 248-258, June 1993. Because the output from the source decoder (304) for these vector sample times is zero, the output waveforms are only the error concealed vectors output from the error concealment unit.
- the predictor tracing unit (414) is operably coupled to the source decoder (304).
- the correction signal generator (416) is operably coupled to the source decoder (304), the prediction memory (412) of the state saving unit (404), the error concealment unit (406) and the predictor tracing unit (414).
- correction signal generator (416) The function of the correction signal generator (416) is to add the information contained in the retransmitted DU and the undecodable DUs stored in the undecodable binary data memory to the error corrupted output signal from the source decoder (304) to provide a signal to the signal recovery adder (420) such that all the future samples will be the same as those without any signal damage.
- the method and device of the present invention restore error corrupted sample vectors to corresponding original vectors without signal loss by utilizing the retransmitted DU in a novel scheme that eliminates delay, as described more fully below.
- the predictor P r at sample time r (for example, the motion vector and macroblock type (Mtype) information in H.261), where forward adaptation is used at the encoder, and the predictor order are each equal to 1. Since the prediction, transformation, and all the other operators are linear in the source decoder, the cases of multiple samples' damage and the predictor order other than 1 can also be shown in the same way.
- a r and Q r be the concealment vector and predictor used to replace Y r and P r to obtain the concealment vector w r . Then the output of the device at sample time r is:
- Z r-1 is the output vector of the source decoder (304) at sample time r-1.
- the vector w r is also saved into the frame buffer of the source decoder (304) to generate the output at sample time r+1.
- d be the delay between the DU damage and the retransmission arrival. Then from sample time r+1 to r+d, the error corrupted output of the source decoder (304) is derived as follows: ##EQU1##
- Y r and P r are obtained from the information contained in the retransmitted DU, the undecodable binary data memory (410), and the decoding states memory (408).
- the predictor tracing unit (414) provides the multistage linear prediction operator P r+1 ,r+d or, alternatively, the information to form the operator.
- Z r-1 is obtained from the prediction memory (412).
- w r is obtained from the error concealment unit (406).
- the function of the predictor tracing unit (414) is to obtain the multistage linear prediction operator P r+1 ,r+d.
- P r+1 ,r+d one of two schemes is typically used to implement P r+1 , r+d :
- the linear predictor operation is accumulated at each sample time from r+1 to r+d. Therefore, when receiving the retransmitted DU at sample time r+d, the operator P r+1 ,r+d is ready to be used to generate C r+d by the correction signal generator.
- this procedure may be quite complicated to implement.
- the source decoder (304) first processes the received DU and the data stored in the undecodable binary data memory to generate the vector Y r and the linear predictor P r . Then the correction signal generator forms the vector s r , and applies the linear predictor P r+1 , . . . , P r+d , sequentially, to this vector to obtain the correction signal vector c r+d .
- FIG. 5, numeral 500 shows a flowchart of the operations for a signal loss recovery device in accordance with the present invention wherein the first scheme of implementation of P r+1 ,r+d is utilized.
- the linear predictor P is updated to incorporate the linear predictor P i (506).
- any P i is found to be zero, i.e., no prediction was used to encode the sample vector Y i , then the process takes an early exit and no further signal correction is performed as explained above (508). Then, the device for signal loss recovery determines whether retransmission of a damaged/lost DU has been received (510). Where a damaged/lost DU is unreceived (510), the device recycles to determining whether Pi is equal to zero (504).
- signal recovery is performed (512): (1) The correction generator signal (416) first forms the vector S r based on the information contained in the retransmitted DU, the undecodable binary data memory, the prediction memory and the error concealment unit; (2) the linear operator P is applied to s r to obtain the correction signal vector c r+ d; and (3) the error correction vector c r+d is added to the error corrupted output z' r+d of the source decoder to form the output of the whole device f r+d . From this point on (514), until a next damaged DU or signal loss occurs, the output of the signal recovery device is zero since the source decoder generates the identical output vectors to those without any DU damage.
- FIG. 6, numeral 600 shows the flowchart of the operations involved in the signal recovery device based on the second scheme of implementation of P r+l ,r+d. It is different from the method based on the first scheme shown in FIG. 5 in that during the period of sample time from r+l to r+d, the predictor tracing unit (414) saves the operator P r+1 , P r+2 , . . . P r+d . Based on the same reasoning, P i is checked to determine whether P i is equal to zero (604), and where any P i is found to be zero, no further signal correction is performed (606).
- the device and method of the present invention may be utilized to perform signal loss recovery for a realtime and/or interactive video communication system which is based on any hybrid video coding algorithm, such as H.261 and MPEG.

- the input to the encoder is a sequence of video frames.
- Each frame consists of a luminance component Y and two chrominance components Cb and Cr.
- the Cb and Cr components usually have only half of the resolution of Y in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- the size of the video frames and the frame rate depends on the specific application.
- Each video frame is first partitioned into non-overlapping segments called macroblocks (MB's).
- MB consists of four Y blocks, one Cb and one Cr block, where each block is a square block of 8 ⁇ 8 pixels.
- the scheme searches the luminance component of the previous reconstructed frame b i-1 stored in the frame buffer (718) for a 16 ⁇ 16 square block B i-1 in a predetermined search window such that it minimizes an error function.
- the maximum search window is 31 ⁇ 31 with the upper left pixel of the MB at the center.
- the motion vector v i ,k is defined as the spatial displacement between B i and MB i . Because the search can be only performed in the search window, the range of the motion vector is known given the search window. For H.261, both v.sub.(i,k)x, v.sub.(i,k)y have the range from -15 to +15.
- the pixels that lie in B i-1 form the motion-compensated prediction vector u i ,k. Note that motion estimation can be performed down to fractional pixel precision by using interpolation for the prediction vector u i ,k.
- the motion estimation unit is operably coupled to the frame buffer and provides a motion vector to the motion compensation unit (720), which is also operably coupled to the frame buffer (718).
- the inter/intra mode selection unit (730) that is operably coupled to receive the input vector r i ,k and the motion compensated prediction vector u i ,k makes the decision that whether MB i ,k should be coded in intra or inter mode.
- the prediction vector x i ,k of the input vector r i ,k is obtained from u i ,k based the output of the inter/intra mode selection unit:
- the element of u i ,k is filtered by a predetermined two-dimensional filter, and the output of the filter is set to x i ,k.
- loop filter is application dependent. In MPEG, there is no loop filter. In H.261, the use of the loop filter is also optional.
- a DCT transform is applied to each block contained in the vector e i ,k to generate the DCT coefficient vector E i ,k.
- the quantizer (706) is operably coupled to receive the vector E i ,k and quantizes the elements of E i ,k using scalar quantization to generate a quantized DCT coefficient vector Y i ,k.
- the variable-length encoder (710) is operably coupled to perform the lossless encoding of the vector Y i ,k and the side information such as the coding mode and the motion vector v i ,k.
- a buffer (712) and the quantizer control unit (708) are usually used to generate a bitstream of predetermined bitrate characteristics such as constant bitrate (CBR) or variable bitrate (VBR).
- the buffer is operably coupled to receive the binary bits output from the variable-length encoder.
- the quantizer control is operably coupled to monitor the buffer fullness of the buffer and adjustment quantization stepsize of the quantizer to ensure that the buffer suffers neither overflow nor underflow.
- the quantized vector Y i ,k is also inverse quantized and undergoes an inverse DCT to generate the vector Y i ,k.
- the vectors x i ,k and Y i ,k are summed to form the reconstructed vector z i ,k, which is stored in the frame buffer (718) to form a reconstructed frame b i for use of the motion estimation and compensation for the coding of the next video frame.

- FIG. 10, numeral 1000 is a flow chart of an embodiment of steps for signal recovery in a video communications system in accordance with the method of the present invention.
- the transmission receiver detects an error in frame r, it sends a retransmission request to the encoder for the retransmission of the damaged DU and also signals the state saving unit to save all the decoding states, undecodable data and the frame buffer content b r-1 .
- the error concealment unit For each damaged MB r ,k, the error concealment unit generates a concealment vector w r ,k to output to the external terminal for display (1002).
- the vector w r ,k is also stored into the frame buffer of the source decoder, and the variable i is initialized as r+1.
- the side information memory saves all the side information ti,k for each MB (1004).
- the source decoder After receiving the retransmitted DU, the source decoder decodes the information contained in the DU and the undecodable data, assisted by the decoding states saved in the decoding states memory. The result of the decoding is the side information t r ,k and the vector Y r ,k for all the damaged MBs in frame r. For all the MBs in frame r, in the first step (1102), the vector S r ,k is formed in the following way:
- S r ,k Y r ,k +M r ,k (b r+1 )-w r ,k ;
- M r ,k (b r-1 ) represents the motion compensated vector with the motion vector contained in t r ,k and the last reconstructed frame b r-1 in the frame buffer.
- the vectors S r ,k are stored in the frame buffer to form b' r and the variable j is initialized to r+1.
- the vector S r ,k is formed by using the side information t j ,k in side information memory in the following way:
- s j ,k M j ,k (b' j-1 ); where M j ,k (b' j-1 ) represents the motion compensated vector with the motion vector contained in t j ,k and the last reconstructed frame b' j-1 in the frame buffer.
- the vectors s j ,k are saved into the frame buffer to form b' j for the next iteration. Then, in the third step (1106), the device determines whether j is greater than r+d.
- the device recycles to performing the second step (1104).
- j is incremented by 1 each time step 2 (1104) is performed, until j reaches r+d+1.
- the resulting vector S r+d ,k is the signal correction vector C r+d ,k for MB r+d ,k (1108).
- the tracing of the multistage linear predictor P r+l ,r+d is very complicated if either loop filter (such as in H.261) or fractional pixel motion compensation is used, e.g., in MPEG, wherein half pixel motion compensation is used, since such an operation will make the prediction of one pixel in the current frame involve multiple pixels in its previous frame. Part of the multiple pixels may be contaminated while the rest are not contaminated.
- the encoder may be implemented without the loop filter to reduce complexity. If only integer pixel motion estimation is used without utilizing a loop filter in the encoder, the tracing of the prediction becomes simple.
- FIG. 12, numeral 1200 is a flowchart showing the steps for another embodiment of the signal loss recovery method of the present invention when only integer pixel motion compensation is used without a loop filter at the encoder. Since only integer pixel motion compensation is used in this embodiment, the predicted vector for a MB is obtained by copying a vector specified by the motion vector in the previously reconstructed frame. However, note that the prediction vector typically comes from several vectors in the previous frame. In order to simplify the description below, all operation is described on a pixel basis instead of on a vector basis. For example, yi(m,n) represents the prediction error signal for pixel (m,n) in frame i.
- Tracing the prediction of a pixel is equivalent to summing the motion vectors along its route from the start frame to the end frame. Note that during this process, if a pixel is coded in intra mode, then the error propagation stops. In this case, instead of storing the sum of the motion vectors, a flag G is stored. Due to the limited range of the motion vector, the flag can be stored in one of the two motion vector components without introducing any ambiguity. In FIG. 12, the x component of the motion vector sum is used to store the flag G.
- two frame buffers g ix , g iy , are created for tracing the motion of each pixel from frame r+1 to r+d in the x and y directions, respectively.
- decoding states are saved in decoding states memory
- undecodable data is saved in the undecodable binary data memory
- the frame buffer b r-1 is saved in the prediction memory.
- the error concealment unit operates to generate concealment vectors and save them in the frame buffer of the source decoder:
- step 2 (1204) from frame period r+1 to r+d, the motion vector sum for each pixel is traced as follows:
- g ix (m,n) g ix (m,n)+v.sub.(i,k)x
- g iy (m,n) g iy (m,n)+v.sub.(i,k)y.
- step 2 (1204) the variable i is incremented by 1 until the arrival of the retransmitted DU.
- step 3 (1206) of FIG. 12 the device determines whether a DU retransmission has arrived. Where no DU retransmission has arrived, the device recycles to implementing step 2 (1204). Upon the arrival of the retransmission, in step 4 (1208), the error correction signal for each pixel is generated as follows:
- c r+d (m,n) y r (m+g.sub.(r+d)y (m,n), n+g.sub.(r+d)x (m,n))+b r-1 (m+v.sub.(r,k)y +g.sub.(r+d)y (m,n), n+v.sub.(r,k)x +g.sub.(r+d)x (m,n)) -w r (m,n).
- the correction signal for each pixel c r+d (m,n) is added to the corresponding pixel of the source decoder output z' r+d (m,n) to generate the output for the device f r+d (m,n).
- signal recovery is completed (1210), and for each subsequent frame, the signal recovery circuitry will be inactive until the next DU damage/loss.
