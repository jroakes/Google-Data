Embodiment
Fig. 1 shows the portable set (for example, cell phone, PDA etc.) 10 that the illustrative embodiment according to the present invention is shown in general manner.Active display burns screen corrective system 12 and is included in portable set 10.
At portable set 10, be in cellular situation, portable set 10 can comprise so: for and the base station (not shown) radio frequency transceiver 16 of receiving and sending messages, for the treatment of the CPU 22 of information and for loudspeaker 24 and the microphone 26 of switched voice information between user and base station.
Equipment 10 can also comprise: active display (for example, OLED etc.) 14, driver 20 and as the keyboard 18 of user interface.In this case, user can input the telephone number or the acceptance that dial with keyboard 18 and enter calling.Number and the status information that can on display 14, show input.In order to show number and the status information of input, CPU 22 can activate via the operation of driver 20 each pixel 15 of display 14.
Burning screen corrective system 12 comprises: the use of each pixel in monitor scope 14 is to detect the CPU (central processing unit) (CPU) 30 of burning screen.Can determine use in this case with opening time of each pixel or with the product of time and the electric current by each pixel.The electric current that can also be used for each pixel by measurement is determined with respect to the curve of voltage.The respective pixel of the opening time of each pixel 15 in the pixel memories 36 of CPU 30 used in file and accumulated.
Figure 21 has described one group for the treatment of step that CPU 30 can follow.In order to understand the present invention, with reference to Figure 21.
As known in the art, along with pixel ageing (time or time and electric current based on using), the light output (that is, brightness) of each pixel 15 reduces.But also known, known cumulative maximum intensity map (profile) is followed in advance in the reduction of brightness or chart 32 carries out.As used herein, cumulative maximum brightness is the high-high brightness of using nominal input signal to be produced by pixel.
For example, initial when manufactured when display 14, the output of each pixel can have the light output of " a " lumen.In pixel, be activated Da Teding accumulated time section " b " afterwards, pixel may only have the light output of " c " lumen, and wherein c is less than a.In this case, can, by making the time period b in index of reference access cumulative maximum lightness dimension 32 for retrieving c, pre-determine the light output at time period b.
In order to monitor each use 102 of pixel 15, with processor 34, can come termly via the message that sends to display driver 20 (for example, every 100 milliseconds) to sample to the state of display 14.Driver 20 responds by each unlatching or closed condition of pixel 15 successively.Once receive the state of each pixel 15, just can increase progressively to add up to total opening time by being used in the corresponding stored position of each on-pixel 15 with processor 34.During the sampling period, do not have the pixel activating not to be incremented.
Similarly, can also be by the electric current of the activation pixel 15 during definite each sampling period and the use of definite pixel 15 of opening time.In this case, electric current can be for adjusting increment value.Then, the increment value of adjustment can be added to the corresponding stored device position of the pixel 15 in storer 36.
Termly, modulated processor 38 can be used the use value of retrieving each pixel storer 36 from pixel, and and then from cumulative maximum brightness chart 32, retrieves the cumulative maximum brightness value of pixel 15.After having retrieved the cumulative maximum brightness value of each pixel 15, can be stored 104 in modulation the corresponding position in Figure 40.
According to above step, determine each whole features of residue lightness of the pixel 15 of display 14.For example, Figure 20 is the chart with respect to opening time hour for the brightness of one type of pixel of particular display.From Figure 20, can be for the brightness of any use value retrieval pixel.
For example, for example, when having determined that based on modulation index (, xx%) experienced while burning screen (, lightness is from original brightness value decline yy%), display 14 has reached lightness threshold to given number percent so.When estimating whether to surpass lightness threshold, this process comprises and determines whether that any pixel groups has lower than the required lightness level that surpasses critical size.If no, system 12 turns back to supervision pixel.
Generally speaking, when determining whether to surpass threshold value, can consider four kinds of situations.The first, if pixel groups has the lightness modulation lower than specific lightness level, this group does not meet the needed criterion of correction.The second, if group has the lightness modulation that is greater than specific lightness level, but region is less than critical size, and this group does not still meet and proofreaies and correct needed criterion.In the 3rd situation, if group has the lightness modulation that is greater than specific lightness level, and region is greater than critical size, and this group does not also meet the needed standard of proofreading and correct.In the 4th situation, if pixel groups has the lightness modulation lower than specific lightness level, and region is greater than critical size, should correction pixels group.
Alternatively, modulated processor 38 is the original brightness value in comparison chart 32 simply, and calculates how many pixels 15 lower than yy% threshold value.Then, modulated processor 38 can make number of pixels lower than threshold value divided by the total pixel number in display 14.If business is lower than the threshold value of xx%, system 12 is proofreaied and correct and is burnt screen distribution plan, to reduce the observability of burning screen image element 15.
Xx% and yy% threshold value provide criterion 106, can this criterion 106 be set according to the received demonstration outward appearance of any level of determining for equipment 10.Can also these threshold values be differently set according to the image type showing.For example, in the multimedia application such as picture viewer, threshold percentage is arranged lowlyer, to improve picture quality.
Once find that display 14 surpasses threshold boundaries, just can carry out filtering processing to display 14, to reduce the observability of burning screen.It should be noted that aspect this, the burning of pixel screen is irreversible.Like this, in this respect, filtering means: at one's leisure for example, during section (, when equipment 10 is charged), to carrying out additional activation as contiguous pixel of burning screen image element.During section, burn at one's leisure the lightness that screen neighborhood pixels has also reduced neighborhood pixels, to reduce the observability of any burning screen pattern on display.
In order to understand digital filtering processing, how to operate to improve the picture quality of burning on panel type display, why understand human eye is useful to burning screen sensitivity like this.At Van Nostrand ReinholdCo., N.Y., in (1985) are edited by L.E.Tannas Jr. " Flat Panel Displays and CRTs (flat-panel monitor and CRT) ", H.L.Snyder " The Visual System:Capabilities and Limitations (vision system: ability and restriction) " furtherd investigate this problem.The two determines the observability of display homogeneity (wherein burning screen is a kind of heterogeneity) size of modulation by display brightness and the spatial frequency of modulation.For example, if 5% be modulated in large area of space and occur, it may be invisible; Yet 0.5% be modulated at may be easily visible in less region.
Generally speaking, the modulation of display brightness is as given a definition
Wherein, L
maxthe high-high brightness on given viewing areas, and L
minit is the minimum brightness on viewing areas.
Fig. 2 has described the threshold value with respect to the modulation observability aspect the logarithm of spatial frequency at the logarithm of intensification modulation.Curve relates to the human eye ability of the modulation in discrimination display lightness.The burning screen image of the value (brightness, spatial frequency) of (for example, some A) will be seen and be had curve top to human eye, and human eye is for example, to having the burning screen image of value (brightness, spatial frequency) of curve bottom (, some B) insensitive.In curve bottom, modulation is sightless for human eye.Therefore, for given spatial frequency Fa, modulation positions A is visible, and position B is invisible.
Use the human eye response curve shown in Fig. 2, digital filter 42 for: 1) identification will for example, to burn panel type display visible (, point Q in Fig. 3) intensification modulation in image, and 2) change image, make by its modulation being reduced under curve (path A in Fig. 3) or changing spatial frequency (path B or C in Fig. 3), making to burn screen can not identify.Path C is possible, because system 12 can be coated with erase (smear out) in lower frequency, burns screen; Yet, be difficult to advance along path B, because display pixel has limited size.For example, in the situation that painting is erased, the relatively narrow line that burns screen on display may have relatively high spatial frequency.Spatial frequency can represent the only rotation of 180 degree, and rotation may still have relatively high spatial frequency.On online both sides, deliberately burn screen image element 15 and to reduce slope, reduced the spatial frequency of line.
Next digital filter 42 will be described.In NEURAL DISCHARGE BY DIGITAL FILTER 42, to proofread and correct in the first step that burns screen, by fourier transform processor 44, carried out the Fourier transform of the spatial frequency of 104 pairs of displays.In this respect, Fig. 4 has described to use the example of the maximum lightness of each pixel or modulation Figure 40 of cumulative maximum brightness B (i, j).In the example of Fig. 4, modulation Figure 40 has circular burning screen region in the centre of Fig. 4.The Fourier transform of the spatial modulation of Fig. 4 is kept in Fourier transform file 46, and produces the figure of the Fourier components shown in Fig. 5.Fourier transform is shown size and the spatial frequency of burning screen modulation with the typical attribute of display 14.Needed attribute will be distance as applied definite user distance display (for example, being 20 centimetres for mobile phone, is 5 meters etc. for televisor) and pel spacing (for example, the pixel of every centimetre).
The observability curve of Fig. 2 is applied to the Fourier number of Fig. 5 according to having produced the data shown in Fig. 6.In this case, Fourier transform data provide modulation size and spatial frequency.
For any given amplitude, in the Fourier number certificate of the corresponding Fig. 5 of the curve with Fig. 2, there is k_max and k_min.By the data of the value of the k_max of Fig. 5 and k_min and Fig. 2 are made comparisons, the curve mapping of Fig. 2 can be become to the Fourier number certificate of Fig. 5, obtain two dotted line circles shown in Fig. 6, wherein inner ring is low frequency limit visibility and outer ring is high-frequency limit visibility.For the given amplitude of Fig. 4, causing the Fourier components of burning screen image is those components between two circles of Fig. 6.Due to two circles of Fig. 6 are mapped to Fourier space, therefore the indication of the region between two circles of Fig. 6 110 causes the pixel of burning screen image.
Therefore, the first step of filtering is that identification causes the pixel of burning screen image.Second step is definite how many to the cumulative maximum brightness adjustment of neighborhood pixels in order to eliminate burning screen image.Once identify, cause the region of burning screen, as shown in Figure 7, have two kinds of methods to proofread and correct and burn screen.
The first method relates to the Fourier number certificate of using Fourier inversion processor 48, this Fourier inversion processor 48 to exchange in drawing 40 and takes Fourier inversion 112, but by the position phase shift π of the pixel of identification.Make position phase shift π produce the dotted line shown in Fig. 8.This is corresponding with the path A of reduction modulation amplitude in Fig. 3.If on the large region of display 14, burn screen image and there is pseudo-periodicity modulation pattern, the method is preferred.
In fact, solid line and the difference between dotted line in the lightness axis along Fig. 8 defined the change of proofreading and correct the cumulative maximum brightness of burning needed each respective pixel of screen.Position along the position axis of Fig. 8 has defined the position of the pixel changing by different value.
The data of Fig. 8 can be sent to difference signal processor 50, wherein, for each pixel 15, in comparer 60, from solid line, deduct the lightness of dotted line, to determine the gamma correction that will be applied to pixel 15.Intensity correction values and pixel logo symbol can be sent to adjustment processor 52, wherein, intensity correction values and pixel logo symbol can be stored in one or more adjustment Figure 54.
In order to adjust cumulative maximum brightness, adjust the charged state 29 that processor 52 can monitor battery 28.When adjusting processor 52 detection charged state 29, adjust processor 52 and can activate driver 20 according to one or more adjustment Figure 54.In this case, the activation of driver 20 has the effect of further burning the pixel 15 of screen identification with luminance correction factor, thereby has reduced the cumulative maximum brightness of the pixel 15 of identification.
In another embodiment, can to burning screen, proofread and correct by the erase region of 114 burnings screens of painting, make to burn spatial frequency that screen zone definitions is lower therefore no longer visible.If it is local burning screen pattern, this will be suitable.This degree (that is, wavelength) changing by prolongation lightness is corresponding with the path C of Fig. 3.
In this case, process can as above be carried out, and wherein, modulation Figure 38 as above carries out Fourier transform, and makes comparisons to detect with the data of Fig. 2 the visible component burning in screen.
As shown in Figure 10, along x axle and at coordinate C place, lightness is changed into lightness α from lightness β.The lightness of display 14 can be disperseed by smearing processor 56, to create longer spatial modulation according to following spread function equation.
Wherein, f (x) is the lightness as the function of x, and " erf " is error function, and δ smears the factor.It should be noted that α and β are known from contrary Fourier inversion data or modulation figure.Error function is known mathematical function.Can be from Fig. 2 determined value δ.Spread function equation is applied to the data of result generation Figure 11 of Figure 10.
Although it should be noted that and can carry out expansion with error function, other possibility modes of carrying out this work be also available.For example, Gaussian function can also be for providing identical function.
Although it should be noted that 11 curve may be effectively, be not attainable.Due to (as shown in figure 11) left side (x position) at C, can not increase the cumulative maximum brightness of pixel, so be not attainable.
Therefore, the curve of Figure 11 must be displaced to the right.Be displaced to the right shown in Figure 12, and can realize according to following movable expanded function equation,
Wherein, as mentioned above, f
s(x) be that " erf " is error function as the lightness of the displacement of the function of x, δ smears the factor, and η is the translocation distance along x axle.It should be noted that and can allow the step κ of brightness to minimize along the degree of axle displacement.Can be from following equation determined value κ,
As mentioned above, can be based on sightless maximum step function is come from Fig. 2 determined value κ.
By using function f
s(x), smear processor 56 and can calculate position and the cumulative maximum brightness for each pixel 15.Smear processor 56 and can use function f for Fig. 9 right side noncontinuity
s(x) carry out the process of double counting cumulative maximum intensity correction values.Similarly, smear processor 56 and can carry out same steps along y axle.
Once complete the process of calculating cumulative maximum brightness, smeared processor 56 and just intensity correction values and pixel logo symbol can be kept in above-mentioned one or more adjustment Figure 54.Adjust processor 52 and can proofread and correct as mentioned above cumulative maximum brightness.
Among another embodiment shown in Figure 22, burn screen corrective system 10 and can, based on normally used user interface screen and the main image that shows, by the adjustment Figure 54 with predetermined, proofread and correct and burn screen.In this case, main image is be shown than other image longer times and caused the image of the pixel quick aging that defines image.
In this case, can how long carry out to determine the 200 cumulative maximum brightness for each pixel based on the common demonstration of each user interface screen.For example, after cellular user Enters Number and activates transmission button, the dialing screen of Figure 13 can show 15 seconds.In this case, use processor 34 to the number of calling out, to count simply, to determine the use of each pixel 15.
As mentioned above, can be modulation Figure 40 by the use conversion 202 of each pixel 15 for each interface screen.Similarly, can be the modulation index for each location of pixels of figure by modulation figure conversion 204, and when modulation index surpasses one group of threshold value, when display enters screen protection program pattern, can adjust 206 to the luminosity of neighborhood pixels.
In another illustrative embodiment, Figure 14-19 show uses screen protection program from interface screen, to proofread and correct the method for burning screen.In this case, equipment by User Activity while using, carry out the adjustment to cumulative maximum brightness.
In order proofread and correct to burn screen under this embodiment, said process can be when being created in screen protection program under the control of base for proofreading and correct a series of adjustment Figure 54 that burn screen.For example, after user activates transmission button, the word of Figure 13 " DIALING " can be displayed on display 14 and reach 15 seconds.After 15 seconds, screen protection program processor 58 can be retrieved a series of adjustment Figure 54, to smear otherwise may be by the burning that demonstration the was produced screen of word " DIALING ".In this case, to burning smearing and can carrying out as follows of screen: first as shown in figure 14, reverse image (pixel " is closed " in for example, deactivation " unlatching " pixel and activation), and then, as shown in Figure 15-19, around the region that may produce burning screen, make to show and fade out.This has information when image fades out and retains the extra benefit showing.
The remarkable advantage of the present embodiment is, does not need directly to follow the tracks of the use of each pixel.And the present embodiment prevents the image the most often using---such as the burning screen of image shown between any typical case operating period of equipment.Last image shown in when any user's input command completes (for example, DIALING) usually retains a lot of seconds on screen.These image most probables cause and burn screen.The situation that the present embodiment has avoided such burning to shield.
In order to illustrate with it, to carry out and use method of the present invention, having described for proofreading and correct the specific embodiment of the method and apparatus that burns screen.Should be appreciated that for a person skilled in the art, the realization of other variations of the present invention and modification with and each side will be apparent, and the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiment of description.Therefore, expectation is contained the present invention and is fallen into the practicalness of open and claimed ultimate principle and any and all modifications, variation or the equivalent in scope herein.
