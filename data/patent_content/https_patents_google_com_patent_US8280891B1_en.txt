Definitions
- Any set of inputs may be classified in connection with some target criteria. For example websites, images, books, etc. may be classified in accordance to whether the input references a particular word, business, topic, etc. (e.g., target criteria). Some of the inputs will correspond more strongly with some target criteria. Accordingly, it is possible to compare multiple inputs with a particular target criterion to determine which input has the strongest correlation with that target. For example, it is easy to determine which websites contain the most references to a particular word.
- An aspect of the invention provides for a method and apparatus for calibrating a scoring function.
- the method includes receiving a first classification and accessing a scoring function, wherein the scoring function provides a score indicating a degree to which an input relates to a classification; accessing a set of background inputs that have no more than an incidental relation to the first classification; applying the scoring function to each of the background inputs in connection with the first classification so as to create a first distribution of background scores; receiving a first input that is not included in the set of background inputs; altering the scoring function in accordance with the first distribution of background scores so as to create a first calibrated scoring function; and determining a first calibrated score for the first input in connection with the first classification using the first calibrated scoring function.
- the first input and the set of background inputs are images
- the classification is an establishment
- the score from the scoring function relates to the amount of evidence that exists as to whether the establishment appears within a particular image.
- the first input, the set of background inputs, and classification are websites, and the score from the scoring function relates to the number of users that visited both the first input website and one or more classification websites.
- the first input and the set of background inputs include text
- the classification is a phrase
- the score from the scoring function relates to number of times the phrase appears within a particular input.
- the first input and the set of background inputs are documents, websites, or books.
- the determining of the calibrated score includes creating a cumulative distribution function (CDF), the CDF indicating, for a subset of potential scores, the probability of the distribution of background scores being higher than each of the potential scores. Also, determining the calibrated score may include smoothing the CDF, such as by using one of a Hamming filter or Gaussian filter, and calculating the ⁇ log 2 (CDF).
- CDF cumulative distribution function
- the method includes receiving a plurality of classifications, wherein the scoring function provides a scores indicating a degree to which inputs relate to the classifications; applying the scoring function to each of the background inputs in connection with the classifications so as to create distributions of background scores; altering the scoring function in accordance with the each distribution of background scores so as to create a plurality of calibrated scoring function; determining calibrated scores for the first input in connection with the plurality of classifications using the calibrated scoring functions; and comparing the plurality of calibrated scores.
- the calibrated scores may be for different inputs in connection with the plurality of classifications.
- the method may include transmitting data over a network based on the comparison of the calibrated scores.
- the method includes accessing a set of default classifications; applying the scoring function to each combination of background inputs and default classifications, so as to create a default background distribution; altering the first calibrated scoring function in accordance with the default background distribution; comparing the default background distribution to the first distribution of background scores; and wherein the altering of the first calibrated scoring function only occurs if the first distribution of background scores indicates a higher score than the default background distribution.

- some set inputs e.g., a website, image, book, etc.
- some of the inputs will correspond more strongly with some targets.
- the correlation between each input and each target could be given a score using some scoring function S(input, target).
- This scoring function could be used to compare multiple inputs with a particular target to determine which input has the strongest correlation to that target.
- the scoring function S(input, target) could be used in connection with a set of websites to determine which website references a particular business the most.
- the scoring function could be used in connection with set of targets and only one input. For example, one website may be selected, and the scoring function is performed for that website to determine it's correlation with multiple businesses. In this instance, it is possible that certain targets might be more likely to create a higher correlation than other targets based solely on the nature of the target, rather than the nature of the input. For example, if the input is a website and the targets are business names, the scoring function S(input, target) will likely create a higher correlation value for a business name that uses common words (e.g., “City Diner”) compared to a business without any common words. Accordingly, the benefit of comparing the scoring function for a particular input with various targets is diminished due to the (partial) false positives that are created by some of the targets, or based on the target common to most inputs.
- common words e.g., “City Diner”
- aspects of the method and system disclosed herein allow for the calibration of the scores produced by particular targets by scaling the scoring functions of those targets. Specifically, the scoring function for a particular target is scaled so as to create a calibrated scoring function S′(input, target). This calibration process will be described in more detail below.

- aspects of the invention are not limited to any particular manner of transmission of information.
- information may be sent via a medium such as an optical disk or portable drive.
- the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system.
- functions are indicated as taking place on a server and others on a client, various aspects of the system and method may be implemented by a single computer having a single processor.
- the server 110 includes data 134 , which may represent inputs 136 and targets 138 to which the inputs may be classified.
- the inputs 136 and targets 138 may take the form of any data structure and may represent any number of entities or objects.
- the data representing inputs 136 may include websites, images, books, lists, video, etc.
- the targets 138 may include any type of classification that could be made for a set of inputs.
- the inputs 136 may be a set of street-level images, including image 360 shown in FIG. 3 .
- image 360 includes signs 310 and 350 that represent businesses or other establishments within the image.
- the server 110 may detect potential text regions in an image, such as regions 310 , 320 , 330 , 340 , and 350 in FIG. 3 .
- the server then performs a process for recognizing the text strings using optical character recognition (OCR) technology.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the server searches for known establishments near the location of the image 360 and extracts phrases from information related to the signs for the nearby establishments.
- the server 110 compares the text strings recognized in the image with the names from the data of nearby establishments. If any establishment data matches a text string in the image, the establishment may be associated with that particular image 360 .
- all images that show at least part of the establishment's sign may be tagged as being associated with a particular establishment. Accordingly, based on signs 310 and 350 , image 360 may be tagged as being associated with the establishments for “City Diner” and “Fashion by Elizabeth”.
- server 110 will have access to numerous images for a particular location.
- the sign for a particular establishment will be at least partially obscured by other objects such as trees or buildings.
- the lighting and sharpness of the image may cause some of the characters within the sign to be misidentified by the server during the OCR process.
- the server may implement a scoring function S (image, establishment) to determine how well a particular establishment (the target) appears in a particular image (the input). This scoring function may take any form and may be based on any number of factors.
- the scoring function is based on the sign's visibility, and may be calculated by determining the percentage of OCR'ed characters within a particular text string that match an establishment's name. For example, a first image may contain a sign for which the OCR'ed text string contains all nine characters of “City Diner”, while a second image contains an OCR'ed text string that contains only seven characters (e.g., “City Din”). The first image would be given a score of 1 (9/9), while the second image would be given a score of 0.778 (7/9). Accordingly, by using the scoring function S (image, City Diner) for each of the images that are tagged as being associated with City Diner, server 110 will be able to identify which image, from any set of images, that has the highest visibility score.
- S image, City Diner
- image 360 contains the City Diner sign and the Fashion by Elizabeth sign. Accordingly, server 110 may tag image 360 as being associated with both the City Diner and Fashion by Elizabeth establishments. In addition, server 110 may use the visibility scoring function S(image, establishment) as a way to determine which of the two establishments has a higher visibility in image 360 . Specifically, server 110 would compare the visibility scores for S (image 360 , City Diner) and S (image 360 , Fashion by Elizabeth). However, in many instances, the scoring function will not produce a meaningful result. For example, establishments with shorter names will likely create higher visibility scores compared with longer named establishments.
- establishments containing a set of commonly used words will likely produce a higher score in a given input than an establishment with a unique combination of characters. Therefore, in circumstances where server 110 is comparing multiple targets (e.g., establishments) contained in a single input (e.g., image), the server will need to calibrate the scoring function based on the nature of the targets that are being compared.
- targets e.g., establishments
- a single input e.g., image
- the calibration of the scoring function S(input, target) for any particular target (T) may be performed by analyzing the distribution of scores produced by that target (T) for a set of inputs.
- server 110 may access a set of “background” inputs and calculate the scoring function S(input, T) for each of the background inputs contained in the set.
- These background inputs are preferably “fake”, in that they do not contain any actual relationship with target T.
- the target that is being calibrated is the business “City Diner”
- the set of background inputs, or images would include a plurality of street level images that contain buildings and signs, but preferably none of the background images would contain an image of the City Diner itself. Accordingly, image 360 would not be used in the set of background inputs in an instance where the target (T) is the “City Diner”.
- server 110 may create a distribution of the calculated background scores. For example, the server may create a histogram of the background scores, as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the x-axis of histogram 400 represents the potential scores resulting from the scoring function S (background input, T), wherein the background input is a street level image (“background image”) and T is the establishment “City Diner”.
- background images will be given a score based on the degree to which an OCR'ed text string within the image matches the name “City Diner”.
- a score of 0 represents that the image does not contain any text string that even partially matches the name “City Diner”, while a score of 10 represents a complete match.
- the y-axis represents the number of background images, from the set of background images, that receive a particular score. Accordingly, histogram 400 illustrates the “background distribution” of the City Diner establishment. As can be seen in FIG. 4 , most of the scores for the background images are between a range of 0 and 3. This is to be expected as the set of background images are “false”, in the since that none of the images are of the City Diner establishment.
- the background distribution for a target may be “higher” or “lower” relative to the background distribution of another target.
- a higher background distribution indicates that the target is likely to produce higher scores in connection with the background inputs. Accordingly, a “high” background distribution is one where more of the histogram contains larger bins H i at the higher scores.
- the number of background inputs accessed by server 110 is large, such as being on the order of a thousand or more inputs.
- server 110 may calculate the probability of target (T) obtaining a score higher than x for a given set of background inputs. This probability can be referred to as T's “cumulative distribution function”, or CDF(x). Given n scores for a target T against n background inputs, the scores for T will be collected into a histogram having N bins H i , each with a width W.
- the CDF(x) for histogram 400 is shown in FIG.
- the CDF has been normalized so that the probabilities run between a range of 0 and 1.
- the CDF results represented in graph 500 may be smoothed so as to create a smoothed CDF (SCDF).
- the smoothing of the CDF may be performed using a Hamming filter or Gaussian filter having a width that is significantly less than N.
- a representation of the SCDF is shown in FIG. 6 as graph 600 .
- server 110 uses the data represented in the SCDF, creates a calibrated scoring function S′(input, T).
- the server may take the ⁇ log 2 (SCDF i ), so as to create a set of calibrated scores as shown in FIG. 7 .
- the x-axis of graph 700 represents the raw scores created by S(input, T), while the y-axis represents the calibrated scores for S′(input, T). For example, if a test input creates a score of 3 using S (test input, T), then calibrated score S 1 , as shown in graph 700 , will be approximately 2.3. Likewise, a test input that creates a score of 7 in connection with target (T) will be given a calibrated score S 2 of approximately 9.5.
- the score produced by a scoring function S(input, target) will only be meaningful at or above some threshold t.
- the scoring may inherently include background noise, or may return a value of zero if enough evidence of the target is not found within the input.
- the server 110 may evenly distribute the count for all scores lower that t among each of the histogram bins H i that represent scores lower than t.
- the background distribution for a particular target (T) may not have enough scores above some minimum score (“min_score”) in order to provide a meaningful calibration.
- server 110 may, in such cases, replace the results of the background distribution for target (T) with some “default model” for all scores above min_score.
- the default model may be created by collecting the background distribution for some large set of targets.
- the scoring function S background input, target
- targets with a higher than average background distribution would have their calibrated scores lowered relative to other targets, while targets with a lower than average background distribution would not have their calibrated scores increased relative to other targets.
- the calibrated scoring function S′(input, T) may also be limited so that the calibrated score does not go above some predetermined maximum value (e.g., 10) or below some predetermined minimum value (e.g., 0).
- server 110 may take both the “City Diner” and “Fashion by Elizabeth” establishments as targets T 1 and T 2 , respectively for a scoring function S (image 360 , T 1 ) and S (image 360 , T 2 ).
- server 110 determines each target's background distribution. Accordingly, sever 110 will calculate the scoring function for “City Diner” in connection with a set of background images. This will create a background distribution for “City Diner”.
- server 110 will perform the scoring function for “Fashion by Elizabeth” in connection with a set of background images, so as to create a background distribution for “Fashion by Elizabeth”.
- the two background distributions may then by used to create a calibrated scoring function S′ (image 360 , T) that makes use of the calibration model described above. For example, if City Diner produces a higher background distribution compared with Fashion by Elizabeth (City Diner's histogram contains more images with higher scores), then it indicates that City Diner is more likely to produce “false positives” under the scoring function. Accordingly, the calibration of City Diner's score will cause it to be lowered relative to the score for Fashion by Elizabeth.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a process that may be performed in accordance with one particular embodiment.
- server 110 may access a scoring function S(input, target) that provides a score indicating the degree of correlation between an input and a target to which the input can be classified (Block 810 ).
- Server 110 may also access a particular target (T) that can be scored using the scoring function S(input, target (T)) (Block 820 ).
- the server 110 accesses the set of “background inputs”. As set forth above, these background inputs are “fake” in that they do not have any direct relationship with target (T).
- Server 110 may then create a distribution of background scores for target (T) by applying each of the background inputs to the scoring function S(input, target (T)) (Block 840 ). Server 110 may then receive an input (I) that is to be scored using scoring function S(input (I), target (T)) (Block 850 ). Input (I) may already exist on the server 110 , or may be transmitted to the server from a device, such as client device 160 . Server 110 then determines the calibrated score for input (I) in connection with target (T) (Block 860 ).
- the determination of the calibrated score is based, at least in part, on the distribution of background scores created in Block 840 .
- server 110 may use the distribution of background scores to create a calibration model, as described above. This calibration model may then be used to create a calibrated score based on a calibrated scoring function S′(input (I), target (T)).
- server 110 may transmit the calibrated score over a network (Block 870 ). For example, server 110 may transmit the calibrated score over network 150 to device 160 , as provided in FIG. 1 . It should be appreciated that while the process in FIG. 8 is shown in a certain order, the series of blocks may be performed in a different order. In addition, some blocks may be added or omitted in the process.
- server 110 may provide the client device 160 with turn-by-turn directions along a desired route that include an indication of landmarks or establishments along the route. For example, server 110 may transmit directions to device 160 that include the instruction to “Turn right at City Diner”. In order to determine which establishment to use, server 110 may compare the calibrated scores for establishments shown in a particular image taken at a location along the route. The establishment with the highest calibrated score may then be selected by the server to be incorporated into the turn-by-turn directions.
- the scoring function S(input, target) could relate to any set of data structures.
- a scoring function f(B, C) could be used to score the relevance of the set B to website C. This relevance could be based on the number of times that a user visits both website C and a website in set B within a particular time period or within a particular on-line session.
- the above described method for calibrating the score for C can be used. Specifically, the calibration will be based on the distribution of scores for small subsets of A (e.g., A i ) using the scoring function f(A i , C).
- a scoring function f(C, B) may be used that determines the number of times a term B appears within a website C.
- the above described calibration method could use the distribution of scores for f(X, B) over many random websites X, for term B.
- the inputs and scoring functions are not limited to images, but may relate to any data structure, such as websites, documents, books, video, etc.
- a specific input (I) and target (T) may be provided to server 110 via a client device 160 of FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- a user of device 160 may wish to determine whether a particular term has a high correlation with a particular website. Accordingly, the user may use the user input 164 to input or select the desired term and website, and then transmit the term and website to server 110 via network 150 .
- server 110 may provide the user with a calibrated score that indicates the degree of correlation between the selected term and website.
- the user may provide server 110 with multiple websites and in response, server 110 would provide client device 160 with a ranking of the terms based on their calibrated scoring functions in connection with the selected website. This information may be provided to the user on the display 162 .
Abstract
Description
M i=min(K*M i all ,U,−log2(SCDFi))
Mi all represents the default model for all scores of all targets. K represents the optional limiting factor, and U represents the optional upper limit on calibrated scores. Given this model Mi any raw score S(input, T) can be calibrated using any known interpolation method. For example, the following linear interpolation may be used:
S′=(1−k)M i +k*M i+1
Where k=x−i, x=S/W, and i=floor(x). However, for x≦0, then S′=0, and for x≧N, S′=MN.
