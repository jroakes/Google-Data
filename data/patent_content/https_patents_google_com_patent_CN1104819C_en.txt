Specific embodiment:
The present invention is directed to and can serves or send a kind of selective calling communication system of message to all receivers of roaming between several covering area.An example of a kind of selective call signaling standard involved in the present invention is disclosed the U.S. Patent No. 5,128,665 of generally transferring the possession of (commonly assigned).U.S. Patent No. 5,128,665 full text and accompanying drawing are inserted into this as a reference.Yet the present invention is not confined to the signaling protocol of particular type, and has effectiveness in the communication system of all polymorphic types, and paging or message transmission system only are examples.
Referring to Fig. 1-3, they show a selective calling communication system that the present invention relates to.Shown signaling standard comprises 128 frames, and each frame number is 0-127.Send all frames with per minute 32 frames, thereby whole 128 frame periods continue 4 minutes.Be divided into 15 cycles that are numbered 0-14 in one hour.It is a synchronization slot agreement that relies on the generalized time benchmark.Frame 0 is synchronized to starting point hourly, makes receiver to derive the real time according to present frame and periodicity, thus need not regulate in this hour provide precise time for receiver.
In addition, this agreement is supported division multiplexing " phase place " for a long time, wherein becomes the data flow of four 1600bps such as the data flow time division multiplexing with one 6400 bits per second (bps).A kind of like this signaling structure is disclosed U.S. Patent No. 5,168,493, and its full text and accompanying drawing are inserted into this as a reference.Therefore, the general frame structure of the single-phase that shows among Fig. 1 is identical to four phase places each.
Every frame comprises a sync section and several pieces.This sync section further comprises synchronous 1 part (S1), frame information (FI) word and synchronous 2 parts (S2).
From the set (set) of 128 frames that come across a radio frequency (RF) channel, be that each receiver distributes a basic frame (base frame).Distribute more than a frame to monitor by phase weekly, receiver can exchange more frequent information delivery with the life-span of battery for, and this can be by changing the collapse value or indication carry unlatching (carry-on) realize.In any case, in case receiver obtain with this RF channel synchronously, it expects its distribution frame in a very tight time window.The application of 4-level (4-level) FM doubles (FM compares with the 2-level) every symbol data transfer rate, and this helps to reduce effect and other effect of the propagation time difference between multiple signals of broadcast distribution error simultaneously in the capture range of receiver.
As shown among Fig. 3, synchronous 1 (S1) part of every frame guarantees frame timing, symbol timing and indicates the speed of this frame remainder.Frame information (FI) word is loaded with frequency and the out of Memory that has roaming service in the network enabled scope for 11 bits of frame number and cycle numbering usefulness, for 5 bits of low professional time division multiplexing phase place indication usefulness, 1 bit that is called as the netsurfing channel bit with indication.The netsurfing channel bit is used to trigger the identification to the particular network roaming information, and this will be described in conjunction with Fig. 4.
Synchronous 2 (S2) part get ready frame piece speed synchronously, decompose and to all decoding to allow correct multichannel.
Block message (BI) field is that first the most preceding 1-4 word that inserts piece---is called as block message word (original text is block information worlds)---and contains frame information and system configuration information, and wherein some relates to the present invention and obtains more detailed description afterwards.
Address field (AF) starts from being right after after all block message words and by several short addresses and several to be formed the location longways.The vector field keeps with address field--correspondence.This vector font points to the banner word of related news.Message field (MF) contains several specified message words of this vector field.On behalf of several, IB be not used and is filled out the free block of appropriate bit pattern.
Fig. 4 is the structure of descriptor frame information word in more detail.Various parameter-definitions in the frame information word are as follows:
The C cycle was numbered (0-14) c3c2c1c0 15/ hour
F frame number (0-127) 128/ cycle of f6f5f4f3f2f1f0
N netsurfing channel bit n=1 indication is to the network support of roaming, and the not network support to roaming of n=0 indication
R repeated paging designator
If r=1 then keeps t3t2t1t0 and has a repetitive mode with indication
If r=0 then is the low service feature position of each phase place in the frame with tt3t2t1t0
Its definition of t depends on the value of " r "
T3=t2 and t1=t0 represent that two phase places are arranged in this frame on 3200 bps
T3=t2=t1=t0 represents that a phase place is arranged in this frame on 1600 bps
T=1 indication address field is comprised in the piece 0
T=0 indication address field extends beyond piece 0
These Q-characters provide so early stage indication, and promptly slightly professional and all addresses are comprised in the piece 0.
X standard 4 bits are checked character
An example of Fig. 5 description block information word 1.6 " v " bit v5v4v3v2v1v0, the indicating services that block message word 1 has 2 " a " bit a0a1, an indication vector field starting point of indication address field starting point overflow 2 " c " bit c1c0 entering next (some) frame, indication 3 " m " bit m0m1m2 and 4 " P " bit P3P2P1P0 with the number of all rank frame number bit of conductively-closed, and they begin to locate to indicate the number of priority address in address field.
Fig. 6 description block information word 2,3 and an example of 4.The word format type is represented by form bit f2f1f0, and the s representative data is checked character and x is still standard 4 bits.
Below be such table, this table is described the bit mode definition of all f shown in Figure 6 and s bit.According to the value of bit f2f1f0, data bit s13-s0 has specific meaning or purposes.When f2f1f0 is set to (000), bit s13-s0 represents 9 bit locals sign (LID) number (i8-i0) of 512 possibilities of identification LID, and one 5 bit regions number C4C3C2C1C0,32 possibility overlay areas that its representative is relevant with certain specific LID.

As shown in Figure 7, when f2f1f0 was set to (001) and (010), data bit pattern s13-s0 represented month, day, year and second, divide, the time information.F2f1f0 bit mode (101) is distributed preliminary data bit s13-s9, system message A3-A0 and time-zone information Z3-Z0.
At last, f2f1f0 bit mode (111) is very important, one 10 bit country code c9-c0 of its indication and 4 bits that are called as professional disruptive features position, and they all will be described in detail in down.
Country code is continued to use such as on record ccitt standard in the technology.Continue to use the ccitt standard allocation rule, provide this 10 bit country code to allow in country variant, to reuse all LID.Which country is positioned at by at first discerning receiver, country code information helps non-reservation (non-subscribing) receiver to simplify a kind of more efficiently search.
Referring to Fig. 7, the minimum of covering area 100 is divided into a while broadcast system sign (SSID) and defines.A SSID is made up of several like this identifiers and identification uniquely: LID, zone, country code, several professional disruptive features positions (all TSF) or a service message Q-character (all TMF) and a frequency.Each zone 110 has unique SSID.Thereby if a user wants to receive message in more than one zone, then the receiver that this user carried will be stored each corresponding SSID.All zones shown in Figure 7 need not be adjacent one another are geographically.
512 possibility LID are arranged in the example shown in Figure 7, and each has 32 Probability Areas.One " zone " be one can be by all other single broadcast regions simultaneously of being associated of broadcast region simultaneously in a public LID and the covering area.For example, give the given LID123456789XXXXX of ISP.This ISP has 32 different choices of dividing this LID being distributed to covering area or zone.The north of one ISP's covering area can be zone 1 and send 12345678900001, and certain south is zone 2 and sends 12345678900010.
All professional disruptive features position (all TSF or all TMF) indication is distributed to a frequency (channel) with 4 groups of services of roaming.Seek one and carry one of each only corresponding 4 professional disruptive features position of roaming receiver of effective LID frequency.When the assigned characteristics position of a receiver equaled 0, this receiver search had same LID and assigned characteristics position and is set to another frequency of 6.
SSID information is encoded into two words:
First word (000) 9 bit=512 LID
A zone, 5 bits=32
Second word (111) 10 bits=1024 country code
4 bits=all professional disruptive features position
First word hereinafter referred to as LID1, be equivalent to first block message word (000) of indication among Fig. 3, and second word is called LID2, is equivalent to block message word (111).
During transmission, time and calendar information (block message word f2f1f0=001,010 and 101) are defined and appear in the frame 0, perhaps appear in frame 0 first valid frame afterwards.In the system that can roam, LID occupies second and the 3rd block message word in the frame 0 with zone, country code and all professional disruptive features position.The 4th block message word carries three existing times and calendar information word, and in 3 consecutive periods, to send on every next block message word of order by turns, the 4th the block message word location in frame 0.This per hour allows all block message words in 001,010 and 101 are upgraded 5 times.
An advantage of this scheme is to send these message not need the address.Use system message, given its an attached vector and message.
As shown in the following table, the class receiver that the type of bit A 3-A0 definition message and the plan of this message are mail to.As example, all receivers should be checked this then message, using all receivers of SSID frequency information should only check this then message, and/or all receivers that only are being to use network identifier information (NID) (will in following description) to be locked on this channel should be checked this then message.Be changed instruction and the time-zone information that turns to which frequency if also can send several relevant professional disruptive features positions.

1111 give over to the usefulness in future
When system message of indication, an additional vector quantity is added to the end of vector field.One receiver decoding block message 4, and definite instruction type and which receiver should be checked the message with this block message word associated.After this receiver determined that it should check this message, it handles address field and vector field routinely but this vector field end will have an additional vector quantity.Only be that designated all receivers of searching message will be checked this vector, this is to be positioned in this vector several message words afterwards because all address/vectorial combinations will point to, and this vector in fact is positioned at the position of first information word of this message field.By this, a specific bank of receivers has been notified a piece of news, and what type is expection message be and where search this then message.In case this receiver enters this message field, then it decode this message and according to the type of process of this message it.
An example of system message is to send to the hello messages that a roaming enters the receiver of the covering area outside its ownership covering area.
Utilize another example of system message relevant with all professional disruptive features position.When having two systems (being redundant system) of same covering area or have the lap of several covering areas and be ready business, an ISP carries out following process when a system moves to another system.
Send an aforesaid system message, the notice receiver will have a professional variation and should the business change information be a new frequency XXXXXX.Receiver is added to it with this new frequency and searches on the list.Receiver should go to the XXXXXX frequency and search one and distribute SSID or NID on this another frequency.In the transmission afterwards, this may be after one month or after one minute, and professional disruptive features position is resetted and is arranged in this another redundant covering area system a frequency.Receiver detects that services of roaming no longer are supported on this channel, and goes to the frequency that it is turned to by this message instruction.This moment, receiver determined whether SSID or NID and professional disruptive features position are set correctly.When SSID in being stored in receiver or NID information were complementary with corresponding transmission information, receiver rested on (also this frequency being added to it searches on the list) on this frequency.In the time can not realizing mating, receiver will return its original residing frequency to guarantee that this is not once a mistake.When that frequency is no longer supported the services of roaming of this receiver, this receiver will begin oneself (scanning this frequency band) to search a SSID or NID coupling.
Another approach of division of managing business is that system resets professional disruptive features position and makes receiver find one to send the SSID of this receiver or the new system of NID.
According to above-described, should be understood that identical LID and regional value can the uses on several other channels by same supplier or several other suppliers.
Have one in each receiver and be called as the table of searching list, it contains a SSID at least.In each zone, a SSID sends in the frame of predetermined number, and this point will described below in conjunction with Figure 13.
Forward Fig. 8 now to, under a kind of like this situation, wherein receiver is wanted to cover a bigger zone or is received message and these frequencies will be used wall scroll identification information rather than many NID by many SSID definition on multi-frequency.This is called as network identification information (NID).Define " network " 200 as the set of many service areas 210 and service area 210 be one will be by the covering area of a plurality of SSID definition.NID is made up of the 3 bit NID multipliers that a network address, a service area (SA), several professional disruptive features positions and are intended to expand the single network number.
A network can form based on the agreement between the ISP of several separation, perhaps can be single big ISP.A plurality of service areas are arranged in one network, and in the described example here, have in the network 32 may service areas, discern them with one 5 bit mode, but a network may be defined to by more or less service area and forms.
Fig. 9 and 10 describes the mode that NID is encoded to the signal that sends in each coverage.Figure 10 describes conventional 32-21 binary coding hexadecimal (BCH) address word, and it is on record technically.As an example, the first 21 bit d0-d20 that rise of this word are used to define a NID, and wherein 12 bits are used to discern uniquely 4096 network addresss.
The structure of the vector font that the address word of Figure 10 description and Fig. 9 interrelates.Below table provide all bit definitions that the vector font with Figure 10 interrelates.

Bit V0V1V2 is used to indicate the vector type, such as numeric type, pure tone key type (tone-only) or the like.When V0V1V2 was set to the value that is equivalent to a particular type, such as short message/pure pitch, this was indicating 12 bit d0-d11 indication service area, several professional disruptive features positions and a network multiplier.For example, the a0-a4 definition a5-a8 of service area's (32 probable values) is that professional disruptive features position and a9-a11 are network multiplier positions.Network multiplier position allows nearly 8 to take advantage of 4096 unique NID.
Under certain conditions when giving a network address attached system message, this 12 bit definitions resides at the additional NID information in this message field, and the vector that this vector will be worked in another way and be pointed to system message in this message field as, aforesaid 12 bits also reside in this message field.
In each service area, the signal that is sent comprises the identifier that is associated with this service area.The layout structure that shows this each different piece of identifier in the signaling protocol among Figure 12 and 13.Store such frequency searching list in the receiver of roaming in a network, it comprises a table of being made up of several frequencies that very likely obtain identifier match.The layout structure of Figure 13 provides a prediction where can find the approach of identifier information.Under any circumstance, when certain coupling can not be found out from the search of being deposited is single, then receiver was searched in the bandwidth of its whole synthesizer.In case this receiver is locked on the frame 0 at a specific frequency, then approval or do not approve (qualify ordisqualify) Candidate Frequency apace.
The layout structure of the SSID information under a kind of (time-multiplexed) 4 that Figure 11 describes frame structure shown in Figure 1 expands mutually.When using single phase system, then last all information of phase place A, B, C and D folding (collapse) are advanced phase place A.When using binary system, then phase place A and B fold and form a phase place and phase place C and D fold and form another phase place.
As on record in the technology, the time-division multiplex system with leggy A, B, C and D provides specific several Business Processing advantages for the ISP.When beginning to serve, the ISP distributes a particular phases for the receiver that only can decode from the information of single phase place.Some receivers can once be decoded from the information of a phase place, but can switch to different phase places.Under this situation, the ISP can distribute to receiver a particular phases at the beginning, but can notify this receiver to send message in certain out of phase every now and then by above-described system message.Finally, leggies also can be locked on the distribution phase place than single-phase receiver as shown in figure 11 quickly thereby some reception functions are decoded.
For roaming service is provided, require all channels (frequency) in the system that to roam fully to send the frame of predetermined number.For example, require all roaming channel transmit frames 0 to 15, aim at four minutes marks with frame 0.Stipulate that in this example frame 0-15 must occur, and these frames contain LID word LID1 and LID2 and all phase places as shown in figure 11 in each frame.
Make LID1 and LID2 be offset a frame, cross over all phase places, make the receiver be assigned to certain particular phases determining existing of SSID that it is wanted with balance in the middle of minimum search time and all phase places or distributed intelligence expense on each channel.
Layout structure shown in Figure 11 provides known time position fast processing to all Candidate Frequencies when allowing the receiver roaming.If can only make roaming judgement on the basis of all LID, then per four minutes of 16 channels can be once processed.Because frame 0-15 must occur, use chip rate to detect to discern all channels that to roam to make that fast searching becomes possibility in the broadband.LID2 only sends once on each phase place in phase weekly, and per four frames of LID1 are sending once (at least in frame 0-15) on each phase place.
On all frequencies that can roam (channel), only there is frame 16-127 to share with all other ISPs or to substitute with another kind of alternative agreement.When a frame was issued, it must contain a predetermined SSID pattern, for example such as the LID that follows after the pattern that frame 0-15 is set up.
As mentioned above, be instruction time and calendar information selectivity existence in " T " representative frame 0 based on three block message words that alternating mode sent.The block message word of " T " type is to send on 4,2 or 1 all phase places according to system works speed.Refresh a receiver (per hour upgrading 5 times) fully with complete one group of time and calendar information and need occupy 3 cycles.Time/calendar instruction is optionally, but when being carried, require to follow the rotation pattern of each cycle selection by system.This form provide that a kind of crowd knows time/all Candidate Frequencies are handled apace to allow receiver in the calendar position in roaming.Order is variable by turns, makes " T " block message word format 101 be used to send a roaming system message when needing.
Figure 12 describes first kind of layout structure of the NID information that identifies into N1-N10.The same with all LID, SSID information, require NID information between frame 0-15, to occur once.Thereafter, this model selection ground continues at those existing additional frames.When an ISP selected to make this NID layout sequence to continue to surpass frame 15, this sequence must be included in all movable on this channel NID.Per four minutes (1 cycle), this pattern was crossed over all phase places and all frames with displacement, allowed the single-phase beep-pager of a certain channel of synchronous decoding see this NID finally in its distribution frame.Detect certain NID for twice and signifying to observe all NID.
The layout that to demonstrate 10 NID among Figure 12 be N1-N10 is as example.All NID are provided with in proper order by all phase places with offset manner to the SSID layout structure among Figure 11 is similar.Send certain when single-phase, then full detail folds into one and single-phasely makes a different N ID come across on each of frame 0 to 9.So handle this structure and make this sequence in next frame, be offset at least one frame, to avoid causing the problem of shade.
Forward Figure 13 to, will describe second layout sequence of NID information.In this sequence, require all NID that supported on the channel between frame 0-15, to occur once at least.Yet according to this structure, the expectation of a NID or predicted position are by determining with next group rule:
(a) each frequency or channel are by one in 0-15 scope numbering expression.M=mould 16 rounds [frequency kHz/ channel spacing kHz]
(b) N=mould 16NID (minimum 4);
(c) the C=cycle is numbered (0-15); And
(d) expected frame=F=mould 16N+M+C
According to these rules, might be during each 30 seconds (16 frame) when began period in 4 minute in 16 of search in succession frequency find same NID.It also makes this NID frame of phase displacement weekly, and this has alleviated receiver and has been positioned at " shade " problem that may occur under the situation at two system overlaid places.This layout sequence carries at channel and has lower NID " burden " under the various situations that are less than 16 NID.
Figure 14 describes a kind of like this vertical shift mechanism, and it can search a receiver to depart from as shown in every frame all frequencies of its ownership frame.Stride across at receiver under the situation in the area that two or more possible matching frequencies are arranged in same covering area, this vertical shift method is useful.In order to reach coupling on the frequency any, to each frequency of wanting to cover, select such frame, in this frame, receive function coupling SSID or NID information, this information is different from the frame that is used for all other frequencies.For example, as shown in Figure 14, vertical shift one frame that will from each frequency, select.Also can select all other frames.As a result, this receiver can detect all SSID, this be because its each be assigned to one should be in the cycle a different frame.
Forward Figure 15 now to, will describe the process of roaming receiver so as to the decoding a piece of news.Start anew, should be understood that, various receivers are arranged according to the present invention, comprise single frequency receiving and the multifrequency receiver that can be locked in any frequency in the bandwidth.And, the receiver of all stationary phase, variable phase or the leggy of these receivers.
No matter receiver type, when entering so new area, a receiver still need be locked in one according to formulating the signal that agreement sent in this area, might be to obtain the approximation that frame 0 occurs on certain frequency according to last this receiver of message pick-up phase, the precision of this approximation be relevant with the crystal oscillator of receiver.
In step 300, this receiver is attempted the energy in the detection protocol on last frequency of its work.When receiver had a SSID reservation, process was carried out along the right of flow chart.When receiver had a network coverage reservation, process turned to the left side of flow chart.
In step 310, in case find the frame 0 of one-period, receiver can detect and will be coded in the SSID information comparison of the SSID information that sends in the signal and its storage.Placement rule described in conjunction with Figure 11 is carried out this processing.When finding a coupling shown in step 320, receiver can be located its distribution frame, with (all) message of being sent out to it in step 330 decoding.
Yet, do not match if send the SSID in the signal and be stored in the SSID that (occupies the current frequency of receiver) in the receiver, in step 340, if receiver switches to another frequency--it can be done like this.When receiver is a single frequency receiving, then it can not be tuned to another frequency, and will enter timing and exceed pattern and/or a piece of news optionally is shown on the display of receiver, and indicate it on this current location of receiver, to receive message.
When only having NID information in the receiver, then consider the NID placement rule of Figure 12 or Figure 13, process turns to step 350 from step 300, and seeks a NID coupling.When finding a coupling shown in step 360, receiver is located its distribution frame, and issues its (all) message in step 370 decoding.
Yet, do not find in step 360 under the situation of a coupling, in step 380, by the recent frequency meter that had before once found plurality of matching therein with reference to, receiver be tuned to another frequency.When not having such table in the receiver, then receiver begins to cross over its frequency band search, with the energy of searching agreement, and should handle and repeat from step 300.
When a single frequency receiving adopts the network coverage, if do not find coupling in step 350, then optionally be shown in a piece of news on the receiver: this user has walked out presumptive area, operation of receiver is undesired or ISP's transmission information on this frequency not.Later overtime phase of initialization in the trial of seeking the NID coupling, and should handle and repeat a period of time.
Illustrate one below and search single example.Usually, first in the table is the last frequency and the relevant SSID or the NID of receiver locking.Next lists all SSID, lists all NID at last, with a relevant frequency together.So, on last frequency that receiver is attempted to be locked in to receive information thereon and the relevant SSID or NID, by SSID information, proceed by NID information at last then.

Frequency 1------NID1
Frequency 2 SSID2

After, will a different scheme be described, wherein receiver is attempted locking frequency and relevant SSID that has limit priority or NID.
Figure 16 shows according to receiver 400 of the present invention, especially, and a typical electrical block diagram example of a selective call receiver.Receive the encoded messages signal that sends by an antenna 402 of receiving the input 403 of receiver section 404.Receiver section 404 is preferably a FM receiver.The encoded messages signal that is received is handled in the mode that technical crowd knows by receiver section 404, and provides as a binary message stream in output 405.I/O (I/O) port 406 of microcomputer 408 is received in output 405.Receiver section 404 comprises received signal Length Indication (RSSI) device 438 alternatively, and this device is also received the I/O port 406 of microcomputer 408.
Microcomputer 408 is embodied as, for example, the microcomputer of a Motorola MC68HC05 series, it carries out various functions, comprises the decoding binary message.Microcomputer 408 comprises a CPU410, oscillator 412, timer conter 414, random-access memory (ram) 416, read-only memory (ROM) 418 and alarm tone generator 420.The encoded messages signal that work and processing received of CPU410 receiver control 400.Oscillator 412 provides clock for the work of CPU410, and provides reference clock for timer conter 414.Oscillator 412[translator annotates: the original text mistake is 414] control by the crystal (not shown).Transmission time slot that distributes and channel logo information and pager address are stored in the code plug-in (code plug) 422, and this code plug-in is a programmable read only memory, such as an Electrically Erasable Read Only Memory (EPROM).In addition, SSID information also is stored in the code plug-in 422 with NID information and any relevant priority order information (describing later on).RAM416 is used for storage code plugin information when initially connecting receiver 400, and stores received message.ROM418 comprises the firmware of control microcomputer work.This firmware comprises such program, such as the decoding that is used for control transmission time slot mark information, channel logo information, receiver address, receiver frequency searching list, NID information, SSID information and other receiver function.Alarm generator 420 produces an aural warning when the reception of a piece of news.
When receiver 400 was initially connected, microcomputer 408 was operated as a synchronizer, after receiver detects the information in the frame 0 and is synchronized with the transmission signal, made receiver 400 synchronous with the transmission time slot that distributes.Microcomputer 408 is also as the decoder operation that is used for decode channel identification information, LID information, NID information and pager address information.Microcomputer is with frequency synthesizer 424, as channel selector 426 operations that are used for the search of receiver control 400.Microcomputer 408 is with power switch 428, for receiver 400 provides the saving battery functi on.
Figure 17 describes the example of the transmitting station according to the invention 500 of a practicality.Transmitting station 500 comprises that a call terminal 502 is used for the overlay area ownership of input receiver or the originating information of local, as shown in 504, is perhaps just roaming in all message of the receiver outside its local, as shown in 506.The message that originates from the ownership of a receiver or the roaming receiver outside the local-area coverage territory by one with ownership or local in the rigid line that interconnects of a call terminal, such as dialing or hard-wired telephones line, perhaps by means of a RF signal, such as a satellite receiver, be delivered to call terminal 502.
In order to transmit, all Message Processing that are input into call terminal 502 to be become agreement in signaling format or the described above and mentioned in front patent, or be processed into another kind of suitable signaling protocol.These information by row advance corresponding to a receiver be assigned with in all formations of frame extremely.The output of call terminal is connected to RF transmitter 508, to transmit by antenna 510.What make us appreciating is that as same wide area while broadcast system, call terminal 502 is controlled the transmitter more than alternatively, and provides the multi-transmitter in the while broadcast system synchronous.The whole bag of tricks that is used for synchronous all transmitters is ready-made, such as the U.S.Patent No.4 that belongs to people such as Breeden, described in 718,109.
In addition, in order to guarantee the global synchronization of all transmitters and aforesaid frame 0, a synchronization module 512 is connected to call terminal 502.This synchronization module comprises a global positioning system (GPS) receiver 514 and a time block 516, and they make call terminal 502 can determine the generation of an accurate frame 0 together.Replace a GPS receiver 514, monitor another time standard signal with suitable surveillance equipment.
As mentioned above, subscriber equipment that allows multifrequency of FLEX protocol definition.The search single storage many significant notations (IDs) that are used for frequency selection of such subscriber equipment in the device interior memory.This search can be used for other sign that frequency confirms single can comprising.This equipment is selected to monitor a channel (frequency), because a Tag ID and an indicia matched that is stored in the search list that is presented on that channel.For FLEX, this mark can be a NID (network ID) or a SSID (broadcast system ID simultaneously).
Subscriber equipment by search movable all FLEX channels and make decision monitor carry one be stored in (all) channel acquisitions channel of searching the ID that an ID in single mates.When finding two or more channels to carry the ID of coupling, this subscriber equipment selects to monitor wherein one or more channels based on an algorithm of its inside.
Now, prior protocols distributes the ownership input terminal that ID and each transmission of messages of subscriber equipment are delivered to the o controller terminal together.Those ID by the control of o controller terminal on the table of all ID that this o controller terminal will receive and the channel compare.This o controller terminal sends this message and carries a channel from the ID of the common factor of this comparison at all that.When an o controller terminal has a plurality of channels that carry a known ID of those subscriber equipmenies of coupling, and this subscriber equipment be can only lock one of them channel the time, and this method causes the RF channel invalid.
Suppose all frequencies in the output controller controls area of coverage Z (Figure 18).Suppose that an input equipment (for example terminal) attempts to send the subscriber equipment (Figure 19) of a piece of news to the area of coverage Z.The present art distributes this input equipment that user-id table and message are sent to output control equipment with other sign (message-length, type of message etc.).This output control equipment will have a responsibility for making message three frequencies then, promptly frequency 3 (SSID B), frequency 1 (NID A), and frequency 4 (SSID C) be sent out, can be received by subscriber equipment to guarantee this message.This effect causes message to be sent out on three frequencies, although because its internal processes designs this subscriber equipment only at monitoring frequency 3.
The present invention describes a kind of like this method, and this method allows output control equipment to make a valid decision that is monitoring which channel about subscriber equipment in by the area of coverage of o controller service.Preferably be, the present invention is each ID assign a value or the priority order in the customer data base, and preferably, input equipment is sent to the o controller terminal with this information, so as controller can determine it carry one the coupling ID a plurality of channels in which will be used to send this message transfer.These values are according to all inner ID that stores in the subscriber equipment and how designing user equipment is definite to work in the knowledge in the environment when finding more than one ID on all channels in a zone.The behavior of these subscriber equipmenies can be based on the subscriber equipment producer or model and is changed.In the example of Figure 19, as long as occur, subscriber equipment carries locking the channel of SSIDB.Do not having under the situation of SSIDB, needing only appearance and carry NIDA and SSIDC (priority of these two ID equates), subscriber equipment will monitor 2 channels.
When system so was arranged so that big area of coverage that a NID is used to be made of many less systems that carry SSID, the present invention was especially valuable.If subscriber equipment is designed to have a SSID and a NID who is used for " roaming " operation who is used for " ownership " operation, then o controller need only send this message on the SSID channel in Home System, and send it in all other systems on the NID channel.
The application of the invention, an input equipment can send to the single message request one and have the network (for example satellite) that one-to-many distributes, and each node in the network (o controller terminal) can be selected appropriate minimum channel or the channel group that sends message thereon.Perhaps, the ownership input terminal, it knows some information of the existing all channels (identifier and frequency) about the o controller end at least, can select appropriate minimum channel table.
The priorization of all ID (Prioritization) also can be used in the search list of subscriber equipment.In this case, when an equipment found a plurality of channels to have coupling ID, it presented supervision all channels of the coupling ID with limit priority.The use quadrature of this improved use and above mentioned priority preface permutation table.In many cases, the priority preface of subscriber equipment is arranged the ID table and is sent to all output nodes with can not making change.
Referring now to Figure 20,, display packing 1000, efficient multi-frequency roaming and message that this method is used for a plurality of selective call receivers of such selective call message transmission system send, and this system uses by all identifiers on the various communication resources of at least one identification in a plurality of selective call receivers.Method 1000 comprises: step 1001, will distribute to a customer data base that deposits ownership input terminal place for the priority value of at least one identifier in all identifiers of at least one usefulness in a plurality of selective call receivers in; And step 1002, with at least one coupling in this at least one identifier and all identifiers on the existing communication resource that provides an o controller end with identifier of highest priority value to find.Can be before this priority value and related news and identifier be forwarded to the o controller terminal in succession, step 1002 carry out in the place at the ownership input terminal.In using the most widely,, having these related news of transmission on the existing communication resource of identifier with highest priority value then in step 1003.To be understood that also communication resource can comprise any combination of the code in frequency, phase place, time slot, service message flag bit (TMF) even the CDMA type system.This method can further comprise step 1004, before the o controller end is finished the coupling step priority value identifier and related news is forwarded to the o controller terminal.Above-described identifier is a netsurfing identifier (NID) relevant with all frequencies of network range preferably, or a broadcast system identifier (SSID) relevant with the local system frequency time.
Referring to Figure 21, show other method 1010, efficient multi-frequency roaming and message that this method is used for a plurality of selective call receivers of such selective call message transmission system send, and this system uses all netsurfing identifier (NID) relevant with all frequencies of network range and all while broadcast system identifier (SSID) relevant with the local system frequency.Method 1010 comprises: step 1011, distribute to a customer data base that deposits ownership input terminal place for the priority value of at least one NID of at least one usefulness in a plurality of selective call receivers and at least one SSID in one; And step 1012, this priority value and related news are transmitted to outlet terminal.When specific selective call receiver user report should ownership input terminal this user will zone at a specific o controller terminal in the time, perhaps when this specific selective call receiver user report should ownership input terminal this user will ownership input terminal zone the user outside the time, transmit step.Then, in step 1013, this at least one NID of coupling or this at least one SSID at least one in all existing frequencies of o controller terminal.At last, in step 1014, at least one frequency in all existing frequency of this highest priority value of coupling, related news are sent at least one NID or at least one SSID that has highest priority value.Preferably, in step 1014,, then on more than one frequency, send these related news if all priority values among this at least one NID or this at least one SSID are equal.
Referring to Figure 22, be presented on the various information resources efficient multi-frequency roaming and the selective call message transmission system 600 that use at least one identifier.This identifier is by at least one receiver storage and identification of being used in a plurality of selective call receivers in this selective call message transmission system, and preferably relevant with all frequencies of network range netsurfing identifier (NID) or the broadcast system identifier (SSID) relevant the time with local system all frequencies.This system preferably comprises an ownership input terminal 725, and the priority value that is used for distributing at least one identifier of at least one usefulness that supplies a plurality of selective call receivers deposits a memory in, preferably a customer data base.This system further comprises an o controller terminal of networking with this ownership input terminal, be used to distribute all communication resources, this ownership input terminal will have the known identifiers coupling at least one identifier of highest priority value and the existing communication resource that o controller terminal (635 or 835) is located there, and this ownership input terminal identifier and related news that will mate are forwarded to the o controller terminal then.In addition, this system can comprise a transmitter, be used for at least one frequency of the existing frequency of highest priority value coupling on these related news are sent at least one NID or at least one SSID that has highest priority value.
The selective call message transmission system of Figure 22 or communication system 600 preferably comprise a plurality of communication subsystems 605,610,615 by ISP's operation, are used for giving information in the represented predetermined geographic area of dotted line sending service.Each subsystem 605,610,615 comprises at least one terminal 725,630,835, is used for message is sent to all portable communication devices, and such as beep-pager 640, all equipment receives and all message is presented to all system users.Beep-pager 640 receives message usually in a particular locality.Yet according to the present invention, a beep-pager 640 can " be roamed " other zone, and still can receive message.For example, subscribe the beep-pager 640 general message that sent by the terminal in first area 725 that receive of an ISP in first subsystem 605, this terminal is called as " ownership " terminal or ownership input terminal.When the beep-pager of service in reservation first subsystem 605 roamed into second subsystem 615, predetermined to this roaming paging machine 640, promptly temporarily by 835 transmissions of the terminal in second area, this terminal was called as " local " terminal to all message of ramber.
Preferably, systems 605,610,615 can pass through a communication link communication.As example, all terminals 725,630,835 can be passed through a telephone network, connect as public switched telephone network (PSTN) 620.Utilize such one to call out part all message that starts, this calls out part by with connection relevant with paging receiving machine 640 in all terminals 725,630 or 835, and information is passed in the communication system 600.For example, call out partly and information and beep-pager identification information as pager address, can be offered a terminal 725,630 or 835 by 650, one of a plain old telephone that are connected to PSTN 620.Alternatively, by using other input equipment, be connected to the personal computer 645 of PSTN 620 by a modulator-demodulator (not shown), a piece of news that comprises information and beep-pager identification information can be provided such as one.
Although only described three subsystems 605,610,615, what will be appreciated is that communication system 600 can comprise any amount of subsystem 605,610,615 that is associated with different service provider.And systems 605,610,615 do not need geographical closer to each other.For example, first subsystem 605 can provide service in Miami, and second subsystem 610 can provide service in Tokyo.
Figure 23 is an electrical block diagram that is used for normally sending the ownership terminal 725 of all message to one beep-pager 640 in the communication subsystem 605 (Figure 22).This ownership terminal 725 preferably comprises a data port 705, is used to receive the information that comprises message.What will be appreciated is, other information receiving device such as modulator-demodulator, the direct link that is connected with miscellaneous equipment or wireless receiver, also can be used for reception information outside the terminal 725.FPDP 705 is connected with controller 710, is used for process information, and a transmission database is connected to controller 710, be used to store the message of the transmission usefulness that is fed to beep-pager 640.
Terminal 725 further comprises one and is used to clock 715 that controller 710 provides time value and one to be used for the memory location that stores the user's of pass system information about the form of " user record " of all identifiers and priorities associated information thereof preferably to comprise, such as customer data base 755.A data input equipment 720 is connected to controller 710, is used to upgrade all user records.The beep-pager 640 storage all records (comprise all identifier and priority) of ramber's database 760 that are connected to controller 710, and all telephone numbers of all ownership terminal storage for being associated with the ramber for roaming into subsystem 605.
Further be included in being and being used for storage code, value, and the system storage 765 of the firmware that uses at operating terminal 725 in the terminal 725.Preferably, system storage 765 is stored in all telephone numbers that send in other subsystem 610,615 of communication system 600 and the position of terminal 630,835.To be understood that, when all terminals connect by PSTN 620, all telephone numbers be described so that use when other terminal of contact.When all terminals connect by dissimilar communication links, alternatively, can store and utilize other terminal identification information.For example, when all terminals are when linking together with rigid line, suitable is identification information rather than telephone number.
Preferably, system storage 765 is the storage initial and response code that is used to confirm or refuse to continue as the affirmation of roaming paging machine 640 services and refusal code and use when forwarding information to other terminal further, this explanation in more detail below.According to the present invention, validator 770 is used and is confirmed and the refusal code, and confirming or denial of service based on the charge information in the user record that is stored in roaming paging machine 640, and transponder 775 is transmitted all user records of rambers.The form of firmware that validator 770 and transponder 77 5 can be stored in the system storage 765 realizes, or alternatively, realizes with the form of the hardware that can finish equivalent operation.
Preferably, terminal 725 is used conventional FLEX
TMSignaling protocol sends all message, and according to this agreement, a radio signal is divided into all cycles of 128 (128) frames, and every frame comprises a predetermined synchronous mode (synchronously) and a plurality of word.For example, when radio signal is when sending with per second 1600 bits, each FLEX
TMFrame comprises 88 words.With these 88 words be divided into one comprise message just sending the address field of address of beep-pager 640 extremely, a vector field of following after this address field, and the message field that information was positioned at.Numeral or alphanumeric information are represented such as those in some address, relate to a vector that is included in the vector field, the clear and definite zone that is positioned at message field wherein at corresponding information of this vector.
Controller 710 is according to FLEX
TMAgreement will arrive address, vector and message field in per image duration of information accumulation to be sent.Then, this information is coupled to message buffer 745 subsequently so that temporarily store this information in will further handle and transmit.All frames are transmitted with digital form, make that the information that will transmit is in the message buffer 745 when transmitting a present frame in next frame, and the information that will transmit in following next frame is by controller 710 accumulation.At reasonable time, the information that is stored in message buffer 745 is sent to encoder 750 so that this information is encoded into such as FLEX
TMConventional signaling format.
Next step enables a frame synchronization generator 730 controller 710, and the predetermined synchronous mode that will will be transmitted when every frame transmission beginning takes place for its.Synchronous mode and coded message are multiplexed by serial data connector 735, and message flow takes place this connector 735.Message flow is sent as wireless signal by a transmitter 740 so that be positioned at beep-pager 640 receptions that the geographic area of service is provided by subsystem 605 by all.Certainly, 725 behaviors of " ownership " terminal and an output control terminal are very similar, but can all forwards be given one of all output control terminals of networking by other device that FPDP 705 or technical crowd know if desired.
Next referring to Figure 24, description can be deposited in a user record 780 of customer data base 755.User record 780 preferably comprises the beep-pager identification information, and it can be a user ID number or an address.User record 780 further comprises information type---such as numeric type, sound type, alphanumeric and pure tone key type---that several addresses relevant with beep-pager 640, some kinds can paged machine 640 receive and the relevant charge information with beep-pager 640.In addition, distribute to the ownership frame of beep-pager 640, all folding values (collapse values), can receive all frequencies of message and the deviant relevant with each frequency also deposited in user record 780 for one.User record 780 preferably comprises and is used to handle all message and is that a specific beep-pager gives information and sends all necessary informations of service, comprises according to several identifiers of the present invention and priority.
According to the present invention, the ownership terminal 725 of beep-pager 640 is according to all message being provided normally for beep-pager 640 for the user record of those beep-pager 640 usefulness.When the user of that beep-pager 640 wants to travel to another position and still receives all message, the information of this customer call terminal 725 and his travelling position of input indication.This can be with city name, selected ISP, such as the identification information of area code or country code or be enough to discern this user and plan the subsystem that will the roam into any out of Memory such as subsystem 615.
Arrive new place once this user, people just can get in touch such as by making a phone call, so that give roaming paging machine 640 transmission information with local area terminal 835.When determining the entrained beep-pager 640 of user not normally from local area terminal's 835 reception message, local area terminal 835 sends to all other terminals that all paging functions are roamed therefrom with a record request that comprises the beep-pager identification information at least automatically.The ownership terminal 725 of beep-pager 640 is come the response record request by sending to local area terminal 835 for the complete user record of beep-pager 640 usefulness automatically.By this way, local area terminal 835 can store this user record and this message of appropriate formatization so that be transferred to the ramber.In addition, all message that will be transferred to this ramber that terminal 835 received thereafter can not need advantageously to be handled with the added communications that belongs to terminal 725.
When angelica terminal 725 received a message that will be transferred to this ramber before user record is transferred to local area terminal 835, ownership terminal 725 was automatically with local area terminal 835 gets in touch and this message and the user record of using for this ramber are transmitted to local area terminal 835 in the lump so that stored by it.Local area terminal 835 can receive that with message and all other transmitted message sends to this ramber in the lump subsequently easily, never must propose to want the request of user record.
On the other hand, in all general communications system, the user record of using for beep-pager never entirely is transmitted to the ramber and has been roamed the subsystem that enters.For it, whenever a local area terminal, promptly roamed and entered the terminal that the zone is associated, when receiving the message that will send to this beep-pager, for message this local area terminal of coming into force must get in touch with the ownership terminal with beep-pager.Particularly, local area terminal will beam back the ownership terminal will for ramber's message.The ownership terminal is consulted the user record of using for the ramber subsequently, and suitably formats this message.Thereafter, the ownership terminal is returned local area terminal with formatted message.In addition, the ownership terminal provides to local area terminal and sends the required additional information of this message.
In some conventional systems, the ownership terminal " is known " all transmission characteristics of the systems that the roaming of paging function enters, such as all transmission frequencies.In other words, need a large amount of memories so that store the transmission characteristic of several other subsystems in the ownership terminal.Because each local area terminal's used all frequency of emission is belonged to terminal storage, the ownership terminal must only use all frequencies to send ramber's frequency offseting value to local area terminal.Yet, also must send out of Memory such as ownership frame, address and folding value.As can be seen, sending single message for a ramber needed message to come into force before message can be issued to add a large amount of relatively information to local area terminal is provided.This processing consuming time can cause the delay of message, and these are incured loss through delay can be the long-drawn-out pass of life to the roamer in some cases, such as when the user is a doctor or a police officer.In addition, this processing must be repeated once when local area terminal will send a piece of news to the ramber, causes the poor efficiency of system to use, and this can cause work to be overstock and further system delay.
In some other conventional system, for each other local area terminal's required a large amount of memory of storage transmission characteristic is unpractical.In such system, come into force when request when receiving message, the ownership terminal still formats this message, returns this message and sends additional information for the local requesting terminal.Yet the transmission characteristic of requesting terminal is unknown, and the ownership terminal must provide all frequency offseting values and relevant all frequencies and ownership frame, folding value and address to local area terminal.Although this conventional method is saved the memory space in the ownership terminal, it causes bigger poor efficiency, and this is because more a large amount of information must be offered local area terminal in the time will sending a piece of news to the ramber.
An advantage according to system 600 of the present invention is: because only user record is sent to service is provided in beep-pager 640 has been roamed the area that enters local area terminal 835 once, ramber's information of user record form is offered all requesting terminals effectively.Thereafter, local area terminal 835 handles all further message of giving the ramber and must not get in touch with ownership terminal 725.Therefore the user of roaming paging machine 640 receives all message in mode timely, is not introduced into system 600 by all delays of excessive signal post generation between terminal 725 and 835.In addition, ownership terminal 725 must not wasted memory space because of storing transmission characteristics for all other terminals 630 and 835.
A further advantage according to system 600 of the present invention is: local area terminal 835 can handle charge information easily, and this is because ownership terminal 725 has been transmitted complete user record.Charge information can be updated periodically by local area terminal 835 simply, and sends to ownership terminal 725 in non-peak period.Calculate after user's the charging state, the follow-up paging service to the ramber can be ratified or refuse to ownership terminal 725.
Next referring to Figure 25, the electrical block diagram of local area terminal such as local area terminal 835 described.Local area terminal 835 comprises that first-selectedly a data port 805 or miscellaneous equipment such as a modulator-demodulator, are used for reception information.Be connected to reception information that a controller 810 of FPDP 805 handles and the operation of controlling local area terminal 835.Also be connected to the clock 815 that is used for providing time value that has of controller 810 to controller 810, a transmission database 825 that is used for storage all reception message that will the geographic area of subsystem 615 (Figure 22) in, send, and the data access device 820 of operator data of being stored so as to modification terminal 835.
Local area terminal 835 further comprises the customer data base 830 of the relevant all user records of a beep-pager that is used to store and normally receives message from local area terminal 835 640, and ramber's database 835 that is used to all user records of those beep-pagers of having roamed the subsystem 615 that enters local area terminal 835 640 storages.In the time will being handled by local area terminal 835 all rambers' charge information, ramber's database 835 preferably also comprises can be so as to the identification information of the ownership terminal of discerning all rambers.This identification information can comprise, such as, one attach to the user record used for this ramber or even as information be included in the user record, the telephone number of indication ramber's ownership terminal.
A system storage 840 is connected to controller 810 and is used to store all running parameters, and is connected to the firmware that uses in local area terminal's 835 operations.First-selected ground, all other terminals 725 and 630 identification information in the system storage 840 storing communication systems 600 (Fig. 1), such as all telephone numbers and/or all positions, also storage is used to all codes of communicate by letter with 630 with all other terminals 725, such as affirmation code, setup code, refusal code and response code.
According to the present invention, a requester 880 is connected to controller 810, is used for when determining that beep-pager 640 is the user records of request beep-pager 640 automatically will provide the ramber of service for it by local area terminal 835 time.A funds device 875 also is connected to controller 810, is used to upgrade and periodically will send to the ownership terminal that sends message usually to the ramber about all rambers' charge information.Requester 880 and the funds device 875 storage availability firmware in system storage 840 is realized, or is alternatively realized with the hardware that can carry out all same functions.
Controller 810 is according to FLEX
TMAgreement becomes address field, vector field and message field to the information accumulation that will send in every frame.This information is coupled to message buffer 845 subsequently so that temporarily store this information in will further handle and transmit.All frames are transmitted with Serial No., make that the information that will transmit is in the message buffer 845 when transmitting a present frame in next frame, and controller 810 is accumulating the information that will transmit in following next frame.At reasonable time, the information that is stored in message buffer 845 is sent to encoder 850 so that this information is encoded into such as FLEX
TMConventional signaling format.
Next step enables a frame synchronization generator 855 controller 810, and its produces the predetermined synchronous mode that will will be transmitted when every frame transmission beginning.This synchronous mode and coded message are multiplexed by serial data connector 860, and message flow takes place this connector 860.Message flow is sent as wireless signal by a transmitter 865 so that be positioned at beep-pager 640 receptions that the geographic area of service is provided by subsystem 615 by all.
Also can draw together reference to the normal process of the message that is about to send to the ramber to the charge information within the user record that is contained in this ramber.When charge information contains the unaccepted indication of further service to this ramber, such as this user during, this message can be abandoned from transmission database 825 or certain hour internal memory and not sending out so that allow this user charges or revise billing errors in ownership terminal 725 as yet not to services pay.
Referring to Figure 26, show such a kind of multi-frequency roaming efficiently and selective call message transmission system 900, it has an ownership input terminal 901 and an o controller terminal 902.Broadcast system identifier (SSID) when first-selected ground, system's 900 uses are associated with the netsurfing identifier (NID) of the interior all frequency dependence connection of network range and with all local system frequencies is so that give a plurality of selective call receivers with transmission of messages.Ownership input terminal 901 preferably is assigned at least one NID of at least one usefulness that supplies a plurality of selective call receivers with one or the priority value of at least one SSID deposits customer data base in.The o controller terminal is networked to the ownership input terminal and receives priority value and related news from the ownership input terminal.The o controller terminal is mated at least one NID or at least one SSID at least one existing communication resource, and if at this at least one communication does not detect congested on existing resource then o controller allows at least one these related news of existing communication transmitted over resources.System 900 is preferably in output control terminal 902 and comprises so congested control list 904, and it contains at least one and is considered to congested existing communication resource.As the terminal among Figure 23 and Figure 25 725 and 835 shown in respectively, the message transmission system of a similar system 900 also comprises a transmitter, is used on the existing communication resource of at least one coupling highest priority value these related news being sent at least one NID or at least one SSID that has highest priority value.Again, the first-selected ground of the communication resource is from comprising frequency, phase place, basic frame family (base frame family) and service management group's FLEX
TMChoose in the protocol communication resource series, in scope and spirit of the present invention, can use other communication resource certainly.
Referring to Figure 26, a piece of news can be directed to several multi-frequency/channel ids once more, even if these frequencies in roaming FLEX system, have with identical shown in Figure 18 in broadcast coverage areas.In general, when a piece of news can be directed to many output points, between ownership input terminal and o controller terminal, need a kind of method or communication protocol to indicate which output point (communication resource or more specifically, the frequency in the example shown) by congested.The ownership input terminal is the message on all congested output points of retry (all frequencies) just then.For the FLEX system, also thirst for congested control is applied on phase place, basic frame family and the service management group/Q-character.
By means of the present invention, ownership input terminal (being shown as MS-H among Figure 26) determines that a node table is with, one group beep-pager search regular and register information transmission paging single according to the beep-pager search.It is single that this forms purpose ID/ frequency.Belong to input terminal then and preferably use SSID (while broadcast identifier/TMG (service management group; Very similar to service message Q-character (TMF) or professional disruptive features position (TSF))) show and/or show specified NID (network identifier/TMG), paging is sent to (all) destination nodes.O controller terminal (being designated as MS-O among Figure 26) then sends to paging has SSID/TMF, the NID/TMF (service management Q-character) that are complementary with limit priority and/or the forward channel of frequency.Subsequently, for each forward channel of choosing, message must be placed on correct phase place and the basic frame.This can finish by the scheduler program shown in Figure 26.
When if the o controller terminal is sending to a plurality of channel with message, in the phase place of a channel/basic frame family or for whole Channel Detection to congested, by the o controller terminal is put into all ID/ frequencies and phase place/basic frame family in the channel congestion list, can realize better congested control.As the part to the response of ownership input terminal, the o controller terminal indicates each channel/phase/retry period of basic frame suggestion in the congested control list of congested channel Dan Bingwei.
Single based on the congested control of being returned by the o controller terminal, the ownership input terminal can be all by congested ID/ frequency plot/basic frame according to the lucky retry of all retry period that the o controller terminal is advised.Below be possible a single example of congested control.
ID1: retry period 60 seconds
ID2/ phase place a: retry period 36 seconds
ID3/ base frame bf: retry period 50 seconds
Frequency 1: retry period 120 seconds
What make us appreciating is that in general same thought can apply to multinode/district management and apply to many output points same message.
Referring to Figure 27, show the flow chart of a kind of jamming control method 1030 of the message transmission system be used to have a plurality of search selective call receivers with roaming capacity.This method preferably comprises such first step 1021: will distribute to the customer data base that a priority value that supplies at least one identifier of at least one usefulness in a plurality of search selective call receivers deposits ownership input terminal place in.Subsequently in step 1022, with this at least one identifier at least one coupling with all identifiers on the existing communication resource that provides an o controller terminal with identifier of highest priority value to be found.In step 1023, if do not send related news detecting congested on this communication resource then having on the existing communication resource of identifier with highest priority value.Subsequently, in step 1024, if think this communication resource by congested, it is single that then this communication resource is put into the congested control of the communication resource.Method 1020 can comprise further and be transmitted to the step 1025 of ownership input terminal from the o controller terminal with the congested control of the communication resource is single that wherein the o controller terminal proposes relevant suggestion that is used for the new communication resource of this transmission of messages of retry.Subsequently, if on the new communication resource, do not detect congestedly, then send these related news having on the existing communication resource of identifier with highest priority value.In addition, this method can further comprise such step: reinitialize the relevant message of the communication resource congested control this communication resource of Dan Shangyu in the ownership input terminal on a new communication resource.As explained before, the communication resource preferably frequency, phase place, basic frame or service management group with FLEX
TMThe combination in any of protocol architecture, but can use all other communication resources to hold all other agreements.
Referring to Figure 28, the flow chart that shows a kind of jamming control method 1030, this method are used to have all netsurfing identifiers (NID) of all frequency dependence connection in a plurality of uses and the network range and all simultaneity factor identifiers (SSID) of being associated with all local system frequencies and possess the message transmission system of the search selective call receiver of roaming capacity.This method 1030 preferably comprises such first step 1031: will distribute to at least one NID of at least one usefulness in a plurality of search selective call receivers or the priority value of at least one SSID and deposit a customer data base that belongs to the input terminal place in.Subsequently in step 1032,, provide a identifier with highest priority value with this at least one NID or at least one SSID and all identifier match at least one of all existing communication resources that the o controller terminal is found.Subsequently in step 1033, related news are not sent to the identifier with highest priority value if detect congested at this at least one existing frequency then have in coupling at least one of existing communication resource of identifier of highest priority value.In step 1034, if think at least one existing communication resource by congested, it is single that this at least one communication resource is put into congested control.This method can further comprise such step: reinitialize the relevant message of the communication resource congested control this communication resource of Dan Shangyu in the ownership input terminal on a new communication resource.Subsequently, if on the new communication resource, do not detect congestedly, then send these related news having on the existing communication resource of identifier with highest priority value.First-selected ground, this method comprise further and are transmitted to the step 1035 of ownership input terminal from the o controller terminal with congested control is single that wherein the o controller terminal proposes relevant suggestion that is used for the new communication resource of this transmission of messages of retry.
Referring to Figure 29, show another flow chart of describing according to jamming control method 1040 of the present invention.In step 1041, deposit several preferential levels in memory with the identifier that is associated, preferably a customer data base.Alternatively, in step 1402 all priority and all identifiers are transmitted to a suitable o controller terminal.Next at judgement frame 1403, if find a coupling between the existing identifier on the identifier of in memory, being stored and the communication resource then this method proceeds to judgement frame 1044, if do not find coupling then this method is returned and adjudicated frame 1043.In step 1044, determine whether coupling is limit priority.If do not find highest priority match, then this method can be returned judgement frame 1043.If find (several) highest priority match, whether then this method proceeds to judgement frame 1045, determine to exist on this communication resource congested there.If on this communication resource, do not have congestedly, then send message in step 1046.If discovery is congested on this communication resource, then in step 1047, this communication resource is placed on the congested list.Alternatively, in step 1408, with the congested ownership input terminal that singly is transmitted to.Under any circumstance, in step 1049, again with this communication resource distribution such as typically give another time cycle, frequency, basic frame or phase place.
Referring to Figure 30, an a kind of method 1050 that is used for receiving the enrollment status indication of flow chart description at unidirectional roaming selective call receiver.This method comprises such step 1051 first-selectedly: search a predetermined set of communication resources, seek the identifier of broadcasting on such communication resource, the identifier match that this identifier and this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver are stored.If find a coupling at judgement frame 1052, and determine that at judgement frame 1053 this pager carrier registers, then in step 1054, if " ownership " realm identifier being stored in the identifier that is sent on this communication resource and this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver is complementary, then logining " ownership " realm identifier with one shows, otherwise, show an ownership but unregistered indication in step 1055.The demonstration of " ownership, but unregistered " can be represented several things.At first it can represent not belong to the registration beginning of having no way of, and perhaps it can represent that the user once was registered as proper or registered " roaming " user, registered but never switch back " ownership ".If do not find coupling at judgement frame 1052, then this method is transferred to judgement frame 1056, determine there the identifier that sent on the communication resource whether with this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver in " roaming " realm identifier being stored be complementary.If find a coupling at judgement frame 1056, and determine that at judgement frame 1057 this pager carrier registers, then in step 1058, if " roaming " realm identifier being stored in the identifier that is sent on this communication resource and this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver is complementary, then logining " roaming " realm identifier with one shows, otherwise, show a roaming but unregistered indication in step 1059.The demonstration of " roaming, but unregistered " can be represented several things.It can represent that this user does not possess the ability of roaming, and perhaps the user does not notify it to belong to him will to roam.It can be represented that also the user is just roaming and be sitting in different random zone of registration report of other needs ownership input terminal to this pager carrier of attributed region information representation in a zone.Finally, at judgement frame 1060, selective call receiver determines whether it goes beyond the scope.If then selective call receiver will provide an off-limits indication.Otherwise this method is restarted this process.Above method can be further to the user provide one about registration will to a period of time in the indication that makes mistakes or will in a period of time, begin.With this approach, the user is warned and is provided chance and taked correct action by calling out their corresponding ownership input terminals.
Referring to Figure 16 and 19, show a unidirectional roaming selective call receiver unit that has an enrollment status indicating device again.This unit comprises a selective call receiver (404) that is used to receive all selective call message first-selectedly, one pair of antenna (402) that is connected to receiver, and one be connected to receiver be used to the to decode decoder such as the processor 408 of all selective call message.Further, this receiver unit preferably comprises such enrollment status indicating device, it comprises first perception alarm---the indication that an identifier being stored in the identifier that provides on the communication resource to be broadcasted and this unidirectional selective call receiver is complementary is logined one " ownership " area to represent this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver, the indication that an identifier of being stored in second perception alarm---the identifier that provides on the communication resource to be broadcasted and this unidirectional selective call receiver is complementary is logined one " roaming " area with expression this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver, and the 3rd perception is alarmed---when reaching, " ownership " realm identifier of being stored in the identifier that is transmitted on the communication resource and this unidirectional roaming selective call receiver provides the indication that is in unregistered state when " roaming " realm identifier does not all match.In addition, the enrollment status indicating device can comprise such the 4th perception alarm, and the signal strength signal intensity of the communication resource that it is being searched at the roaming selective call receiver provides off-limits indication when being not enough to decode.Alternatively, the 4th perception alarm can be indicated when this roaming selective call receiver and be roamed to second of " roaming " realm identifier of a coupling of the broadcasting situation when regional from first zone of " ownership " realm identifier of broadcasting a coupling, wherein should roam selective call receiver to second regional registration; Perhaps indication roams to second of " ownership " realm identifier of a coupling of the broadcasting situation when regional when this roaming selective call receiver from first zone of " roaming " realm identifier of broadcasting a coupling, wherein is somebody's turn to do and roams selective call receiver to second regional registration.Selective call receiver also can have such the 4th perception alarm, and it enters indication under the situation in the zone that another this user is not registered there " roaming, but unregistered " in the zone roaming that the user is registered there from this user.More preferably, all perception alarm is to select the group icon from display, comprising the various alphanumeric message on the display, various discrepant sound alarm or discrepant tactile alert.
