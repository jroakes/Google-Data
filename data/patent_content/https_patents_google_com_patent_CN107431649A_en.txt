Resident family perceives
After discussing resident family's strategy and can reach the mode of intelligent apparatus environment 30, discuss turning now to from intelligent apparatus
10 acquisition related datas are used for implementation strategy.
As previously discussed, the stock and its ability of intelligent apparatus and/or sensor can be used for construction strategy.Figure 13
It is that diagram is used for the attribution data from intelligent apparatus 10 in the activity in intelligent apparatus environment 30, event according to embodiment
And/or the schematic diagram of the graphic user interface 400 of attribute.In the illustrated embodiment, interface 400 includes various in house
The instruction of intelligent apparatus and/or sensor.For example, basic household's mock-up 402 can provide the diagram 404 and intelligence in room
The placement 406 of energy device and/or sensor.In addition, graphic user interface 400 can provide intelligent apparatus and/or sensor
The instruction of ability.For example, Figure 13 embodiment includes functional ability cloud 408 of indicating intelligent device and/or sensor.
In illustrated example, ability cloud 408 ' provides the ability of the camera of ceiling installation.Ability includes audio playback (such as by raising one's voice
Illustrated in device icon), video monitor (as illustrated in eye icon) and audio surveillance be (as illustrated in microphone icon
).Ability cloud 408 " diagram can lock/unlock door lock intelligent apparatus (as indicated by padlock icon) and lock is provided
Occupancy detect (as indicated by " OD " icon).
The ability of intelligent apparatus 10 may be used to provide the perception in intelligent apparatus environment 30.For example, in an intelligence
The audio signal received at the microphone of device 10 can be associated with specific resident family occupant.As Figure 10 discussion in carry
And, the speech tone (for example, audio signature 312) detected can be with specific resident family occupant (or certain types of resident family
Occupant (for example, man or girl)) it is associated.In other examples, optical identification is (for example, face recognition or other be based on
The identification of image), (for example, presence of the electronic installation associated with particular person) or other inputs be present in digital device can be with
Specific resident family occupant or certain types of resident family occupant are associated.
In Figure 13 example graphical user interface (GUI) 400, perceive prompting 410 and be generated.Perceiving prompting 410 can be with
Whether prompt GUI 400 custom system should be attributed to resident family by one or more inputs 412 from intelligent apparatus 10
Specific activities, event and/or attribute 414.For example, prompting 410 be used to determining audio signature 412 and entitled Sydney it is specific live
Relation between the member of family., can when perception prompting 410 is identified (for example, selecting " Yes (YES) " icon 416 by user)
Regular 418 (for example, in databases or data file 420) are perceived with generation so that 412 specific activities, things with resident family will be inputted
Part and/or attribute 414 link.In certain embodiments, when perception prompting 410 is rejected (for example, selecting " No by user
(no) " icon 420) when, regular 422 (for example, in the databases or data file 420) of perception can be generated to refuse to input
Linking between 412 and the specific activities, event and/or attribute 414 of resident family.
In certain embodiments, sensing module 422 (for example, hardware circuit and/or via processor from tangible non-transitory
The software that storage part performs) generation it can perceive rule 422 in the case of no perception prompting 410.For example, sensing module
422 can receive input 412 (for example, from one or more intelligent apparatus 10) and the user's not from GUI 400
Perception rule 418 is automatically generated in the case of input.When exist input 412 should with the specific activities of resident family, event and/or
Automatic sensing rule 418 can be useful during the high confidence level that attribute 414 is associated.
Once it is appropriate to perceive rule 412, it is possible to creates report and/or control rule 424.Report and/or control rule
424 (for example, resident family is tactful) can provide report when some specific activities, event and/or attribute 414 of resident family occur.Separately
Outside, these rules 424 can be based on specific activities, event and/or attribute 414 come trigger event.For example, in illustrated implementation
In example, rule specified goalkeeper in front door keeps locking when Sydney is individually in.Therefore, independent occupancy of the Sydney in resident family
Perception triggering front door at permanent locking.Any amount of event can be triggered by rule 424.Rule 424 can trigger
The feature of intelligent apparatus (for example, intelligent apparatus 426), the feature based on processor are (for example, send Email, in society
Hand over and comment, setting calendar puted up on media, cell phone notice etc. is provided) etc..
As scrutable, report and/or control based on resident family's strategy can rely on the sensor that relevant resident family perceives
Confidence level.Figure 14 to Figure 16 illustrate according to some embodiments be used for provide sensor confidence and/or sensor confidence changes
The process entered.Figure 14 is the process 480 that is used to provide with specific policy relevant sensor confidence of the diagram according to embodiment
Flow chart.First, sensor senses confidence level is determined for Existing policies (for example, staying in the rule 424 realized in resident family)
Level (block 482).Sensor senses confidence level is that particular sensor input 412 can be accurate for strategy to be achieved
The level of the ground confidence level associated with specific activities, event and/or attribute 414.For example, in Figure 13 rule 424 of locking a door,
Sensor senses confidence level can be related to a) detection Sydney be present in household and/or b) whether current only one people (for example,
Sydney the household) is taken.For some embodiments, each sensor senses level of confidence can be expressed as single scalar percentage
Than measurement, but for other embodiments it can be expressed as its component can be processed with reach single scalar percentage measurement or
Can individually or according to subgroup it be handled to reach the multiple features vector that the horizontal confidence level of various components determines.
Once level of confidence is determined, the determination for whether meeting confidence threshold value on the level of confidence is just made
(decision block 484).For example, tactful specific activities, event and/or attribute to be achieved can be belonged to by observation
414 additional input 412 increases confidence level.If environment not yet undergoes enough data of input 412 to provide follow-up perception
Threshold level (for example, level of confidence is still unsatisfactory for confidence threshold value), then can continue to monitor and can occur pair with
The adjustment (block 486) of the associated scope of input 412 of tactful specific activities, event and/or attribute 414 to be achieved.
Once perceiving level of confidence meets threshold confidence level, it is possible to realizes using the Existing policies (block perceived
488).For example, in Figure 13 example of locking a door, can be locked a door when intelligent environment fully firmly believes that Sydney is individually in.
When in particular sensor confidence threshold value in addition to implementation strategy, predict and pass before the realization of specific resident family strategy
Sensor confidence level can be favourable.Figure 15 is the sensor confidence that is used to for new strategy present prediction of the diagram according to embodiment
The flow chart of the process 500 of degree.First, specific resident family's strategy or set of strategies (block 502) are selected.Next.Make on identification
The determination (block 504) for the attribute sensor (for example, input from intelligent apparatus 10) that condition needs.For example, Figure 13's
In example of locking a door, it may be necessary to Sydney 1) being identified as into occupant and 2) mark occupant is individually in relevant sensor
Attribute.Therefore, can be obtained in the determination step of block 504 available for video data, the sound that occupant is identified as to Sydney
Frequency evidence, infrared data etc. and/or the quantity of occupant.In certain embodiments, can be by for specific resident family's strategy shape
Required attribute sensor is recognized into the polymerization for perceiving rule 418.
Once attribute sensor is determined, the water of the precision on being observed that identified attribute sensor is just made
Flat determination (block 506).For example, low quality audio and/or video sensor are especially being seen in having noise and/or low luminous environment
Can be less accurate when examining audio and/or video attribute.In addition, infrared sensor precision can be influenceed by environmental variance.
Therefore, in order to determine the precision of attribute sensor observation result, sample data can be obtained from intelligent apparatus 10, it can be divided
Analysis is for the quality of data (for example, precision of the details in data).
Based on identified precision, the sensor confidence for the prediction for strategy acquisition attribute sensor can be provided
The instruction (block 508) of degree.For example, the sensor confidence instruction predicted, which can include living room camera, can have 50% machine
Sydney can be correctly identified to the instruction for occupant.
The sensor confidence predicted is it is determined that the potential modification arranged to sensor arrangement and/or environment allows to
Can be useful when obtaining increased sensor confidence.For example, can change placement, sensor quantity etc. biography
Sensor variable is to increase sensor confidence.Furthermore it is possible to the environmental variance for changing illumination, noise level etc. is passed with increasing
Sensor confidence level.Figure 16 is that diagram is used to suggest modification to improve the stream of the process 520 of sensor confidence according to embodiment
Cheng Tu.
Process 520 starts (block by determining predicted sensor confidence (for example, process 500 via Figure 15)
522).It is next determined that the variable (block 524) that sensor confidence will be increased.For example, in certain embodiments, it can provide
Change many variables associated with specific device of the precision of sensor.For example, the noise attribute of audio sensor and/or regarding
The light of video sensor.In some embodiments, it is also possible to the environmental variance that can change sensor accuracy is provided, such as environment temperature
Degree, room-size etc..
Next, variable modification can be suggested to obtain more preferable attribute observation (block 526).For example, in audio sensor
In, interference (for example, audio-frequency noise) can cause lower sensor accuracy., can based on the sample obtained during process 500
To determine there is noisy component (for example, ceiling fan) near audio sensor.Therefore, can suggest moving audio sensor
Move the region of more low noise.
Amending advice can be made in many ways.In certain embodiments, user interface is (for example, graphical user circle
Face, audio interface etc.) suggestion can be provided.Furthermore it is possible to filled via the intelligent apparatus 10 associated with resident family or other electronics
One or more of put and suggestion is provided.Figure 17 be diagram according to embodiment can for Figure 16 process result suggestion
540th, the schematic diagram of 542,544 and 546 example.It is recommended that 540,542,544 and 546 can be available to one or more resident families
The communication information of member.Such as, it is proposed that 540,542,544 and/or 546 can be the smart phone or other via resident family member
Text message, eject notification or the audio tracks that electronic installation provides.
As mentioned above, it is proposed that sensor can be included and/or environmental variance is changed.Such as, it is proposed that 540,542 and
544 each diagram sensor modifications, and suggest 546 illustrated environments amending advices.It is recommended that 540 provide for the increased degree of accuracy and
Add the suggestion of additional sensor.It is recommended that 542 suggestion sensors are repositioned in alternative position (for example, from bathroom 1 to bath
Room 3).It is recommended that 544 suggestion sensors are redirected, there is provided orientation diagram 548.
By contrast, environment amending advice 546 suggests that environment changes.In exemplary proposed 546, ambient light modification can increase
Add sensor the perception degree of accuracy (its can for example increase video monitoring devices produce have can be used for preferably identification face
The image of more preferable dynamic range or the ability of image sequence).Other environment, which change, may include temperature adjustment, noise adjustment
Deng.
Additionally, it is proposed that can provide approximate improved instruction (such as, it is proposed that 72% in 540 improves and/or suggests
Confidence level from 63% to 98% in 542 is improved) or can provide it is improved generally indicate (such as, it is proposed that 544 Hes
546).In certain embodiments, it is proposed that modification can be provided in the case of without providing improved instruction.
When (for example, suggestion based on Figure 17) makes modification to intelligent household's environment, it may be necessary to which adjustment is with suitably
Make attribute sensor associated with policy condition.Figure 18 is that diagram makes tune according to embodiment based on the manual amendment to strategy
The flow chart of whole process 560.It is possible, firstly, to as on Figure 13 as described above according to Association Rules and control come
Implementation strategy (block 562).It is made as to whether to detect the determination (decision block 564) of modification in environment.For example, system can be with
Determine the orientation of sensor, the position etc. of sensor has changed.
When being not detected by change, strategy, which is realized, continues (block 562).However, when detecting modification, make on modification
Whether determination (the decision block of change to tactful (for example, to for report in strategy and/or correlation rule of control) is ensured
566).In one example, when audio sensor is moved to a bathroom from a bathroom, there may be supplemental audio interference
(for example, carrying out the kitchen sink of self-operating).Therefore, correlation rule can be updated to make sensing data and specific policy condition phase
The audio signal for carrying out self-operating kitchen sink is filtered out during association.
If the modification to strategy is unwanted, strategy, which is realized, continues (block 562).However, when modification is desirable
When, measurement can be adjusted (block 568).For example, in audio sensor example, audio can be filtered and be added to audio
The correlation rule of sensor.In the case where additional sensor is added to system, new correlation rule can be added to illustrate to pass through
The data obtained by new sensor.Once adjustment is made that, just by new adjustment implementation strategy (block 562).
Perception embodiment based on situation
Turning now to being discussed more fully for specific perception, Figure 19 is that diagram is used to monitor and become according to embodiment
Perceive the flow chart of the movable process 590 of resident family.First, the sensor input (block 592) of detection instruction specific activities.Example

Data are used to provide light to system.Additionally and/or alternatively, can via infrared sensor and/or video (for example,
Imaging sensor) detection light use.
The characteristic (block 864) that relevant light uses can also be determined.For example, it may be determined that at the time of in one day, occupied information
(for example, who is taking the area), ambient lighting conditions, illumination level adjustment, illumination duration etc..It can be reported in system
And/or record these and find (for example, for carrying out subsequent control and/or report by resident family's policy manager 154) (block 866).
Figure 33 diagrams are directed to the example of the process 880 of the perception about the activity of bathroom area 618.Specifically, Figure 33 implementation
Example is brushing their tooth to start (block 882) by the occupant of detection zone 618.For example, audio signature and/or video label
Name can be associated with the sound brushed teeth in area 18 and/or image.Next it may be determined to bells and whistles is (for example, kitchen sink
834 be kept open, duration for brushing teeth, the speed brushed teeth etc.) (block 884).It can be reported in system and/or record this
It is a little to find (for example, for carrying out subsequent control and/or report by resident family's policy manager 154) (block 886).
Report and/or activity/discovery of record can be compiled so that the discovery of complexity can be obtained.Figure 34 is diagram root
According to the flow chart for being used to report the movable process 900 of compiling of embodiment.Process 900 is supplied to being reported for system by compiling
Accuse and/or record discovery (for example, any discovery in each room and/or device in house) and start (block 902).
Compiled discovery can be filtered based on common activities, event and/or characteristic.For example, can be based on being aprowl related to
Specific resident family member (for example, all Allie activity), based on resident family member activity (for example, brushing teeth), and/or event (example
Such as, movable internet using and/or the lamp that enables) find to filter.
Compiled discovery is determined for individual activity distribution (for example, all Allie movable or all Allie
Brush teeth) (block 904).In addition, compiled discovery is determined for resident family's activity distribution (for example, resident family's public utility disappears
Take) (block 906).It can report and/or the movable distribution (block 908) of recording individual activity distribution and/or resident family is for by system
Use.For example, Figure 35 is the schematic diagram according to the movable graphic user interface 910 that can be used for report compiling of embodiment.
In interface 910, (for example, Allie) activity of resident family member is shown by pie chart 912.In addition, pie chart part 914 provides
The further characteristic and/or details relevant with the part 916 of chart 912.In the illustrated embodiment, in part 914
More particularly it is described in detail and uses relevant details with Allie internet.
The activity of reasoning
In some cases, it was observed that characteristic, behavior and/or activity can be used for the other characteristics of reasoning, behavior and/or
Activity.For example, some activities monitored can not be direct observable, but can be via passing through resident family's policy manager
The reasoning made monitors indirectly.
For example, in one embodiment, can the activity based on the individual observable in resident family come reasoning mischief.Figure
36 be the flow chart that is used to detect child mischief-making process 930 of the diagram according to embodiment.Specifically, process 930 passes through inspection
Survey the occupancy of the occupant of child's occupancy or other classifications to be monitored and start (block 932).In certain embodiments, can be with base
These classifications are determined in audio surveillance, optics (for example, video) monitoring or other monitoring (for example, infrared occupancy monitors)
Occupant.For example, the characteristic of the audio signature of speech pattern, tone etc. can be used for recognizing child's occupancy.Next, can
To monitor occupant while occupant is movable (for example, moving or perform other actions), specifically intercept
Low-level audio signature (for example, whisper in sb.'s ear or silence) (block 934).Based on pair combined with the monitored occupant of activity these are low
Mischief (for example, should not be in activity of generation) (block can occur with reasoning for the detection of level audio signature, system
936)。
In certain embodiments, some specific activities or other situations can be used for reasoning mischief occur, or
For excluding that mischief-making reasoning is occurring.For example, it is contemplated that some activities are undisturbedly performed, so as to indicate quiet work
It is dynamic to be unlikely to be mischief.For example, reading, conciliation etc. are undisturbedly performed often.Additionally, the situation letter of such as engaged position
Breath can be used for excluding mischief-making reasoning.If for example, it can be desirable to library, study or the other regions of quiet activity
It is middle to take, then it can exclude mischief-making reasoning.Therefore, when these activities are performed, system can not sent out with reasoning
Raw mischief, but regardless of the low-level audio signature parallel with movable occupant how.
Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, specific activities or other contextual informations may be used to provide evil
Make acute stronger reasoning.For example, when child individually near wine cabinet or in the bedroom of their father and mother when, system can be with reasoning
It is likely to that mischief is occurring.
When mischief occurs for reasoning, system can report and/or record discovery and use (block 938) for follow-up.
For example, it was discovered that can be used in resident family's report, near real-time notice, or can be used for controlling the intelligent apparatus (example in household
Such as, the mischief-making verbal warning about reasoning is provided via the loudspeaker of intelligent apparatus (for example, smoke-detectors)).Therefore,
It was found that the further mischief-making prevention in household can be caused.
The emotional state for monitoring the occupant in resident family can be favourable.Figure 37 is that diagram is used to push away according to embodiment
Manage the flow chart of the process 960 of the emotional state of occupant.Some situation queues of individual occupant can be used for reasoning resident family
The emotional state of occupant.For example, the emotional state that can represent sad of crying, and laugh at the emotional state that can represent happy.
Furthermore it is possible in the generally emotional state of reasoning resident family occupant using can generally associate to resident family position
Some general cultural criterions.For example, upper and lower nod of the resident family in the first country in the world can agree state,
But left and right shake the head can be represented in terms of the resident family in the second country in the world identical agree to state.
As mentioned above, can be by understanding the situation of occupant more accurately reasoning emotional state.Therefore, process
960 can start (block 962) alternately through the identity or classification (for example, sex, age, nationality etc.) of identification occupant.
Process 960 also includes detection mood context data (block 964).For example, the facial expression of occupant, head it is mobile or its
The optical indicator of its activity can be used for reasoning emotional state.Additionally, cry, laugh at, raising the audio signature of voice etc.
Audio queue can be used for reasoning mood.Furthermore it is possible to infrared information, body temperature etc. is used in emotional state reasoning.
Based on the mood context data obtained, the reasoning of the emotional state on occupant can be made.Such as institute above
Refer to, can (for example, situational clues of the occupant based on whole classification) make reasoning vague generalization or can be that specific account for
The particularly customized reasoning of user.For example, when obtain laugh visually indicate and/or the audio of laugh indicate when can make occupancy
The vague generalization reasoning of the happy emotional state of person.By contrast, particularly customized reasoning can with view of especially occupant
Know characteristic and check mood context data.For example, system is known that Sue both cried when she is happy or when she is sad.Therefore,
It will be insufficient that system, which can recognize and be based solely on the reasoning cried to Sue emotional state,.However, system it will also be appreciated that
Sue generally smiles when she is happy and kept a straight face when she is sad.Therefore, show that Sue is being cried and plate when visually indicating
During face, system can be sad with reasoning Sue.This reasoning can be different for other occupants, because especially fixed
The example of system uses Sue specific emotional index.
In the emotional state of reasoning occupant, system can report and/or record discovery and use (block for follow-up
968).For example, it was discovered that can be used in resident family's report, near real-time notice, or the intelligence dress that can be used for controlling in household
Put.
In certain embodiments, monitoring bullying and humiliation can be favourable.Figure 38 is that diagram is taken advantage of according to embodiment for detection
The flow chart of icepro and/or the process 980 of other unexpected actions.Since process 980 monitoring context data (block 982).For example,
Audio surveillance, Optical Monitoring, infrared surveillance etc. can be used for recognizing the occupancy of occupant and unexpected activity.In one embodiment
In, context data can include the audio signature of instruction " bullying and humiliation " keyword of derogatory sense title address, rise voice etc..Cause
This, system can monitor and detect the use (block 984) of such " bullying and humiliation " keyword.Additionally, in certain embodiments, feelings
Border data can include the audio signature used for indicating filthy language.Therefore, system can be monitored and detected and be made by occupant
With such filthy language (block 986).In certain embodiments, context data can include the individual body interacted with each other
Part.Therefore, system, which can detect, takes and the individual identity (block 988) in unexpected movable space may occur.Based on feelings
Border data, it can make and bullying and humiliation and/or other unexpected movable reasonings (block 990) occurs.It can report and/or record
The discovery of this reasoning uses (block 992) for follow-up.
In certain embodiments, it may be desirable that detection interacts with undesirable substance.For example, it may be desirable to understand occupant
When interacted with undesirable substance.Figure 39 is that diagram is used for reasoning and the phase interaction of undesirable substance according to embodiment
The flow chart of process 210.Process 210 is started (block 212) by detecting the occupancy in environment.Additionally, process 210 is wrapped
Include monitoring and the context data relevant with the interaction of undesirable substance (block 214).For example, chemical detection system/volatility
Organic compound sensor can be used for the presence for detecting unexpected movable (for example, poisonous compound, alcohol, tobacco etc.).
Additionally, context data can include：Close to the position for being stored with such undesirable substance occupancy (for example, in wine cabinet
Nearby, the occupancy near the kitchen cabinet comprising poisonous kitchen cleaning product etc.)；It is mutual between occupant and undesirable substance
Effect visually indicates；Deng.Based on context data, system can be with reasoning occupant and the interaction (block of undesirable substance
216).Therefore, reasoning can be reported and/or record for follow-up report and/or control (block 218).
Additionally, system can be used for monitoring that housework is completed.Figure 40 is that diagram is complete for detecting housework according to embodiment
Into the flow chart of the process 240 of state.Since process 240 monitoring the context data associated with daily housework (block 242).Example
Such as, in refuse collection day, system can monitor the number such as with removing the associated audio of refuse bag and/or video from dustbin
According to.Another example can include audio and/or video that monitoring dusts off activity, dust catcher activity, erasing activity etc..In addition, feelings
Border data can include the audio and/or video data of instruction study/household's activity, musical instrument exercise etc..Based on situation number
According to can make on the whether completed reasoning (block 244) of housework.Reasoning can be reported and/or recorded for follow-up report
Accuse and/or control (block 246).
Figure 41 is the flow chart that is used to monitor the process 250 of medical symptom of the diagram according to embodiment.It is possible, firstly, to monitor
The context data (block 252) associated with medical condition.For example, some Move Modes Ahl tribulus sea silent sickness
(Alzheimer's disease) is associated.In certain embodiments, system can monitor the Move Mode of resident family occupant simultaneously
And by these Move Modes with and associated those Move Modes of Alzheimer disease compare.In other embodiments, it is
System can track the audible and/or visual cues associated with disease of cough, sneezing, pain etc..
Next, based on the context data monitored, the doctor of one or more occupants about resident family can be made
Learn the reasoning of diagnosis.For example, when the associated Move Mode of the Move Mode and Ahl tribulus sea silent sickness of occupant those
Timing, system can suffer from the relatively high likelihood of disease with reasoning resident family occupant.In addition, for example it is being attributed to by resident family occupant
Cough and/or during with snuffing gas, system can just caught cold with reasoning occupant and/or influenza.Can report and/or
Reasoning is recorded to use for follow-up in systems.
Situation is observed
In some instances, when there is particular condition, it may be desirable that additional monitoring/reasoning.Figure 42 is diagram according to reality
Apply the flow chart of the process 260 for being used for situation monitoring of example.Process 260 by recognize whether to ensure additional monitoring/
The situation of reasoning and start (decision block 262).If being not detected by such generation, routine monitoring continues (block 264).
However, when detecting the situation for ensureing additional monitoring/reasoning, the situation number associated with situation monitoring/reasoning can be monitored
According to (block 266).System can be based on context data inferring motion (block 268).Can report and/or record these reasonings for
Follow-up report and/or control (block 270).
In one embodiment, additional monitoring can occur when child is individually in.Can be when child be individually in
Make any amount of additional monitoring task and/or reasoning.For example, system may be made when child is individually in it is more sensitive
Reasoning, presence of unexpected occupant etc. can be detected.
Figure 43 is the flow chart for the process 290 that diagram monitors according to the situation of the child for being individually in of embodiment.
First, system can detect that child is individually in (block 292).For example, take sensor, which can recognize, takes and identifies number
It is entirely child according to can be used for recognizing occupant.Therefore, system can recognize child and individually be in.
In Figure 43 embodiment, when child is individually in, strategy is configured to close and/or into room in occupant
Father and mother are notified during room.Therefore, system can detect occupant's (block 294) at front door via take sensor.Such
During detection, system can be notified close to occupant (block 296) to father and mother.
Another situation that additional monitoring can be ensured can be to the prison of child by third party (for example, nurse or grand parents)
Superintend and direct.Figure 44 is the flow chart for the process 310 that diagram monitors according to the situation supervised for non-father and mother of embodiment.First, system
Determine whether third party (for example, nurse) is providing supervision (decision block 312).Taken for example, system can recognize father and mother
House with child, so as to indicate that father and mother supervise.Alternatively, system can recognize only third party and take the room with child
Room, so as to indicate third party supervision.
If there is no third party supervision, then customary monitoring continues (block 314).Detect that third party supervises however, working as
When superintending and directing, additional monitoring can occur.When detecting third party supervision it can be desirable to any amount of additional monitoring task.Example
Such as, it can strengthen alerting the sensitivity of reasoning (for example, interaction with unsuitable content and/or material), the can be changed
The action of tripartite, additional move of child etc. can be monitored.
In Figure 44 embodiment, situation strategy is configured to monitor the interaction (block between third party and child
316) electronic installation (for example, TV, the flat board or computer) usage amount of child, is monitored and/or using characteristic (for example, consumption
Content) (block 318), and monitor unexpected occupant (block 320) that is close and/or entering house.Can report and/or
The discovery about these additional monitoring tasks is recorded for follow-up report and/or control (block 322).
Another situation that additional monitoring/reasoning can be ensured is to make asserting/the situation of promise.Figure 45 and Figure 46 is diagram
According to the flow chart for being used to monitor the process 350 and 390 for the activity of asserting of embodiment.Process 350 is directed to based on the prison asserted
Depending on general process and process 390 be relevant appointment assert based on the strategy particularly asserted.First from Figure 45 process
350 start, and process 350 asserted by detection/and promise starts (block 352).In certain embodiments, system is by monitoring resident family
Voice conversation on interior and/or portable electron device (for example, flat board, computer or cell phone) recognizes such promise
Speech.In certain embodiments, can be detected by monitoring text message transmission (for example, SMS text etc.) such disconnected
Speech/promise.In certain embodiments, can be asserted from Email, calendar or other electronic device applications.
On asserting monitoring process 390 based on appointment, system can detect appointment and assert (block 392).In an example
In, " I'll be home by 5 can be said by resident family member:00 (I will go home before 5 o'clock) " provides text message.Cause
This, can be asserted by monitoring the text message transmission of electronic installation to detect.Alternatively, appointment may reside in electronics dress
In the electronic calendar application put, the electronic calendar application can be used for identification appointment.
Process 350 is returned to, is made on asserting/promise determination (Figure 45 decision block 354 and the figure that whether can complete
46 decision block 396).For example, return to " I'll be home by 5:00 " asserts, system can determine working as resident family member
Front position and from current location return to occupant house will spend how long (Figure 46 block 394).If can be at 5 o'clock
The preceding house for reaching occupant, then it is made as to whether to have met to assert/determination (Figure 45 decision block 356 and figure of promise
46 decision block 400).For example, in " I'll be home by 5:During 00 " asserts, whether system can determine occupant
Get home.If having met to assert, routine monitoring continues (Figure 45 block 358 and Figure 46 block 402).If however,
Still it is unsatisfactory for asserting, then process 350 returns to decision block 354 and process 390 returns to block 392 to determine whether disclosure satisfy that
Assert/promise.
If can not meet to assert/promise (for example, the house of occupant can not be reached before 5 o'clock), can report
And/or record the discovery (Figure 45 block 360 and Figure 46 block 398) that can not meet to assert.For example, it can be carried via electronic installation
For paying attention to no longer meeting to assert/the notice of promise.
In certain embodiments, can assert close to reported when can not meet/record mesne notice.For example, about
, can be 30 minutes before it can not keep appointment, 15 minutes, the notice of the transmission such as 5 minutes in meeting process 390.Therefore, Ke Yiti
Show that affirmant goes to appointment position before it can not make appointment.
Report and control based on resident family's strategy
Once monitoring and/or inference data, resident family's tactical management are reported and/or have recorded at resident family's policy management system
System can facilitates further resident family to report and/or control.Figure 47 is that diagram is used to provide to intelligent dress according to embodiment
Put the flow chart of the process 420 of report and the control of environment.Process 420 is found (for example, as described herein from resident family is received
As report and/or record those discovery) start (block 422).It is specific based on what is realized in resident family's policy management system
Resident family's strategy, resident family's policy management system can provide the report (block 424) of discovery and/or provide the control (block based on discovery
426)。
It is turning initially to report, the notice of discovery can be provided via multiple informing mechanisms as report.If Figure 47 is provided
The example of dry informing mechanism.For example, the notice of some discoveries can be provided via intelligent illuminating system 428.For example, it will can live
Family strategy is set to dodges lamp by intelligent illuminating system color change for red and whenever the discovery for ensureing warning is received
It is bright.
Additionally, report can be provided via other intelligent apparatus.Such as can via tablet computing device 430, via
Audio tweeter (for example, in intelligent smog detector 432), via (for example, intelligent thermostat 434) display panel and/
Or the personal intelligent apparatus of such as activity monitoring wrist strap 436 provides report.Can be via social networking site (for example, Google+
437) or other websites provide report.Report can be supplied to application in certain embodiments.For example, report can be supplied to
Nest software applications and/or hardware are fed back (for example, the energy-conservation from Nest applications and/or hardware for Nest Leaf 438
Feedback instruction).
Turning now to control, received resident family finds to can be used for controlling any amount of intelligent apparatus.For example, live
Family is had found that it is likely that for controlling 440 (for example, door lock) features of lock.For example, if it find that instruction child is individually in, then can be with
Actuating lock 440 arrives latched position so that house is guaranteed from unexpected visitor (it is assumed that resident family's strategy is for such work(
Can property and realize).
In certain embodiments, received discovery can control to content 442 (for example, the content based on internet,
Television content, allow DVD etc.) access.For example, if it find that excess is not yet completed and/or consumed to instruction housework
Content, then resident family's policy handler can limit access to further content 442 (it is assumed that resident family's strategy is for such work(
Can property and realize).In certain embodiments, can based on find limit and/or allow to content reproduction apparatus (for example,
TV 444 and/or computing device 446) access.For example, when finding that instruction housework has been completed, can permit to device 444
And/or 446 and/or content 442 access.
In certain embodiments, can be found based on received resident family to control lighting apparatus 448 or other family expenses
Furniture.For example, lighting apparatus 448 can be turned off when resident family's policy manager is observed and is not present and takes in particular room
(it is assumed that resident family's strategy is realized for such feature).Additionally, can be controlled based on received discovery
Controllable home appliances, such as washing machine and/or dryer 450.For example, if it find that suggest in washing machine and/or drying
Machine 450 nearby uses TV or wireless device, then washing machine and/or dryer can be made to perform cycle delay, so that
TV and/or wireless device can be used in the case of the noise not from washing machine and/or dryer 450.
Report/informing mechanism and controlled device mentioned above is notified and how may be used as just how can provide
It is provided with the example of control device.The example provided is not intended to the model for limiting indoor informing mechanism or controlled device
Enclose.
Turning now to particular report and/or control strategy, Figure 48 is that diagram is directed to the report based on situation according to embodiment
The flow chart for the process 470 accused and/or controlled.Process 470 starts (block 472) by receiving the strategy based on situation, described
Strategy based on situation is such as by the third party supervision of the child discussed on Figure 49 and/or as will be discussed on Figure 50
Taboo foot.
Once receiving resident family's strategy based on situation, resident family's policy manager begins to the monitoring feelings associated with strategy
The generation (block 474) of shape (for example, third party supervision or taboo foot).When detecting the situation, the resident family based on situation is realized
Strategy (for example, realizing the report and/or control based on strategy) (block 476).Realize resident family's strategy based on situation until no longer
Untill detecting the situation (for example, no longer by third party supervision).Once no longer detecting the situation, recover normally to live
Family strategy realizes (block 478).
Figure 49 is that diagram is used for the control intelligent apparatus environment under third party's (for example, non-father and mother supervise) according to embodiment
Process 490 flow chart.In Figure 49 embodiment, the non-regulation of father and mother's supervision strategy 492, which stays in, detects non-father and mother's supervision
When the specific action taken.For example, the regulation of strategy 492 is in such generation, it should increases substrategy sensitivity (block 494).
For example, if there is when using for 5 times that filthy language occurs, notice is provided to the strategy of father and mother under normal supervision, then may be used
To increase sensitivity so that notify father and mother when using for 2 times that filthy language occurs under being supervised in non-father and mother.
Additionally, the regulation of strategy 492 should be present by realizing increased monitoring (block 496) during third party supervision.For example,
It can ensure that increased sensor uses, so as to realize increased monitoring in the case of the supervision of less trust.Increased sensing
Device utilization can help the activity protected child and also monitor superintendent.
Strategy 492 also regulation should during third party supervision limits device use and/or device context (block 498).Example
Such as, although father and mother can make child comfortable when being exposed to fearful content, third party supervision people may be by not such as
This is assembled well.Therefore, strategy 492 can specify that that fearful content is limited when father and mother supervises child is (or any other interior
Hold).Contacted with addition, father and mother may want to child with third party supervision people rather than their electronic installation.Therefore, strategy 492
Limiting electronic device it can be used when third party supervision people be present.
Also regulation should send special notification (block 500) to strategy 492 in third party supervision child.For example, father and mother may
Wish to be notified some movable generations when third party supervises child rather than when father and mother supervise child.Example
Such as, the notice of child outside can be useful when third party supervises child, but supervise child in father and mother
When can be unnecessary.Therefore, special notification (block 500) can be realized when the situation defined in strategy occurs.
Turning now to foot strategy is prohibited, Figure 50 is the mistake that for the taboo of intelligent apparatus environment enough controls of the diagram according to embodiment
The flow chart of journey 520.In process 520, prohibit foot strategy 522 and received by resident family's policy management system.It can be based on by with making
The instruction that the resident family occupant that other occupants of resident family prohibit enough authorities of foot is provided prohibits foot strategy 522 to enable.Can be with
Such as instruction is supplied to resident family's policy manager via the use of graphic user interface, voice command or both.
Once it is implemented, one or more characteristics of tactful 522 cans control resident family.It can control in many ways
The control of resident family's characteristic.For example, control can particular room/area based on house, can be based on being associated with specific occupant
Deng.In the present example, the regulation of foot strategy 522 is prohibited when active, electronic installation uses and/or available electron device context will
It is limited in and prohibits in the room that sufficient occupant is located at (block 524).In certain embodiments, can be based on the occupant to prohibiting foot
The identification in the particular room/area taken determines these rooms.In other embodiments, can be based on the occupancy with prohibiting foot
Room that person is associated (for example, game room and/or bedroom of occupant) determines these rooms.
Prohibiting foot strategy 522 can also provide it should be ensured that to prohibiting the monitoring of sufficient occupant position and prohibiting the occupancy of foot
Person provides notice when leaving the sufficient position of specific taboo.For example, the occupant for prohibiting foot can be ordered individually to be spent in their bedroom
Their taboo foot time.The position for the occupant for prohibiting foot can be monitored and in the position for the occupant for prohibiting foot by prohibiting foot strategy 522
Superintendent is notified during the bedroom for deviateing the occupant for prohibiting foot.
Prohibiting foot strategy 522 can also provide enable " light-off " pattern (block 528) in special time.For example, " light-off "
Pattern can include：Control lighting apparatus shutdown and/or control electronics shutdown.Can it taken in the occupant for prohibiting foot
Particular room/area and/or the associated particular room/area of occupant (for example, prohibiting bedroom of the occupant of foot) with prohibiting foot
In enable this " light-off " pattern.
Resident family's behavior change
Figure 51 is flow of the diagram according to the process 540 of the control based on reward for intelligent apparatus environment of embodiment
Figure.Process 540 is started (block 542) by defining target.For example, system can one or more demographics based on resident family
And/or pattern provides the suggestion of relevant " improved confinement " that it is generally desirable to available for resident family.Based on these suggestions, resident family can
To select the target in one or more future.For example, based on the resident family's pattern observed, system can notify the member of resident family
Spend less time with public demographic other households and have a meal together.Based on this observation result, system can suggest
Resident family struggles to reach this target.If resident family is agreed to, target is set to the target of definition.The other examples of target may
Energy including reduction uses, to the changing of the dispensing of electronic installation " screen time ", filthy language and/or " raising voice " meeting
Reduction of words etc..
Then system will monitor target-bound progress (block 544).Such as will in further detail below on Figure 54 to Figure 58
Discuss, target-bound progress can be gradual, be gradually carried out accordingly it is also possible to monitor towards final goal.It is based on
Surveillance operation, make on having met, partly meet the determination (decision block 546) of being still still discontented with foot-eye.
If not making progress, the prompting of moving target can be supplied to resident family's (block 547).If for example, resident family
Indicate to take more time do together activity and system monitoring instruction resident family just taking less time together or or
More or less take more time together, then system can by resident family's target be supplied to resident family it is one or more into
Member's (for example, via the audible and/or visual alarm in resident family, via text message for the smart phone for being supplied to user etc.).
If having reached target-bound progress enough, progress reward can be provided to one or more members of resident family
(block 548).For example, in target together mentioned above, if household spent for 20 additional minutes one in a week
Rise, then when target is to spend within one week one additional small together when, progress can be provided to the household and rewarded.In addition, if
The part of household spends additional hour together, but a part does not spend additional hour together, then reach target into
The part of member can receive progress reward, and the part for not reaching the member of target will not receive progress reward.
If having reached target, the reward (block to reaching target can be provided to one or more of resident family member
550).For example, if all resident family members spend additional hour to do activity together, target can be reached, so as to cause to up to
Into the presentation of the reward of target.
The target that is in progress can be simple as text, audio and/or video messaging is encouraged, or can be more meticulous.
For example, in certain embodiments, the increase dispensing of part limitation activity can be provided.For example, it can be provided when reaching target
The increase of screen of electronic device time.In one embodiment, resident family sing one's own praises license can be reward, by being participated in other
Family offer neighbours message, statement resident family towards specific objective advance and/or have reached specific objective.
Figure 52 is diagram according to the offer of embodiment to reaching the signal of the system 570 of the reward based on dispensing of target
Figure.In Figure 52 embodiment, defined Benjamin should take more time outside and spend resident family keeper
The less target of time on the electronic device.
Therefore, Benjamin action can be monitored based on defined target, system, so as to how recognize Benjamin
Distributing his time.For example, the camera in resident family can determine Benjamin be inside house or outside house,
On the electronic device etc. whether Benjamin.In addition, electronic installation uses and/or electronics can be used in Benjamin position
The function of device 572 (for example, Benjamin smart phone) directly obtains.
Using this data, system 570 can determine whether Benjamin is taking more time outside.If system is true
Determine Benjamin not yet outside to advance towards taking more time, then system can provide prompting, such as in electricity at the time 574
Illustrated in sub-device 572.In certain embodiments, remind (or other mechanism in system) can by for not towards
Target, which is advanced, forces limitation and/or other punishment to encourage to advance to target.For example, because of Benjamin in the time 574 from still
Do not advance towards target, so system can force " screen time " block feature, so as to encourage Benjamin towards before target
Enter.
Once being made that enough progress (for example, Benjamin is outside up to 15 minutes), can be presented to Benjamin
Such as " screen time " blocks the progress target for the clock that successively decreases.In addition, once reached Benjamin target (for example,
Benjamin spends 30 minutes outside as being indicated by clock 578 in the time 576), electronic installation can be disabled
572 " screen time " block feature, as shown in the time 580.Consequently, because Benjamin has reached target, so
He is assigned additional " screen time ".
In certain embodiments, when target is based on dispensing, some flexibilities can be realized by system.For example, figure
53 be the process of control based on dispensing of the diagram according to the intelligent apparatus environment for that can allow to turn knot dispensing of embodiment
600 flow chart.First, system can determine a part (for example, dispensing of the screen time of electronic installation) for dispensing
By budget, but (block 602) is not used.For example, if resident family member was allocated " during screen of two hours altogether in one day
Between ", but a hour is used only, then the screen time of a hour is added by budget, but is not used.
Then system can determine to realize whether the strategy of the dispensing of budget allows to turn knot (decision block 604).For example, one
In a little examples, the dispensing of next period can be applied to the unused dispensing for a period for allowing to turn to tie
More flexible mode implementation strategy.Alternatively, in certain embodiments, turning knot does not allow, so that it is guaranteed that dispensing is specific
It is maximum dispensing in period.
If turning knot does not allow, standard dispensing (block 606) is maintained.However, if turning knot is allowed, do not make
Dispensing is added to the dispensing (block 608) of the budget for next period.Therefore, in resident family member without using budget
Two hours dispensings a hour above-mentioned examiner in, will be three hours for the dispensing of next day because be not used
A hour be added to two hours dispensings.This can reduce the rigidity of strategy realization, so that is realized tactful has
Effect property extends.
As mentioned above, in certain embodiments, target-bound gradually progress can be reach target effective
Mode.For example, by making target-bound actually non small incremental progress, resident family can become to gradually become accustomed to
The action of target.Figure 54 is stream of the diagram according to the process 620 of the gradual control being used in intelligent apparatus environment of embodiment
Cheng Tu.Process 620 is started (block 622) by the target for determining to treat incrementally to realize.For example, some targets and other targets
Compared to can be easier to realize according to gradual mode.It is relevant with highly changing the customary activity occurred on consistent basis
Target can be good candidate for gradual realization.In addition, the target relevant with resident family's modification to notable amplitude
Can also be good candidate for gradual realization.
After being determined for the target of gradual realization, system can be that specific objective determines acceptable progress threshold
It is worth (block 624).For example, when presence will reach the time predefined of target, progress threshold value can exponentially gradual change so that
Before advance request is got into the way of towards target with resident family and then it is very fine first and followed by more keeps forging ahead.It can replace
Change ground, progress threshold value can be evenly distributed in target realization reach target time predefined between period it
In so that the progress of equal quantities will be made during each period.
It is not assigned in the embodiment up to the time predefined of target, system can very be incrementally increased progress will
Ask, so as to provide the substantial not sentience being in progress.This can be by allowing resident family little by little to adapt to very much change
Become and cause the additional success for realizing resident family's target.
The acceptable progress based on determined by for specific objective, system can be defined for reporting progress and/or control
The progress threshold flip-flop (block 626) of system processed.For example, wishing to reduce the example that uses of internet using resident family, will can match somebody with somebody
To reducing daily one minute, so as to be actually non for resident family.For limiting the trigger of internet access
Untill one minute desired amount used until reaching internet can be moved daily.Once trigger is determined, it is based on triggering
Device realizes the strategy (block 628) based on target.Therefore, report and/or control can become gradually as resident family advances towards target
Enter formula sensitivity.
Figure 55 is data drawing list 650 of the diagram according to the example of the control via incremental control threshold of embodiment.Line 652
Represent the threshold triggers point (for example, y-axis 654) become according to the time (for example, x-axis 656).As shown, line 652 is incrementally increased
Untill having reached target 658.Therefore, the report and/or control carried out by system can little by little be implemented into target 658
Progress.
This can see in Figure 56 embodiment.Figure 56 is illustrated according to the offer of embodiment with resident family's member's direction
Become before target and then incrementally to be difficult to the schematic diagram of the system 670 of the reward received.
Target 658 in Figure 56 is to arrive specific destination the specific week of resident family member one on time (for example, working and/or living
Family) 5 times.In order to realize the strategy for reaching target 658 according to gradual mode, system 670 can incite somebody to action at time 656A
The threshold value 656A for receiving reward (for example, praise message 672A) is set as 1 (for example, instruction will be when resident family member be punctual one time
Receive praise message 672A).As resident family member is towards target 674 (for example, punctual one times 676) of advance, threshold can be increased
Value.For example, at time 656B, threshold value 654B needs 678 to praise message 672B to receive twice on time.Therefore, can be with ingenious
Ground and little by little encouragement resident family member continue to advance towards target 658.
Figure 57 is that diagram reaches the data drawing list of the control of target 658 according to embodiment via control threshold is successively decreased
680.Line 652 represents the threshold triggers point (for example, y-axis 654) become according to the time (for example, x-axis 656).As shown, line 652
It is incrementally increased untill having reached target 658.Therefore, the report and/or control carried out by system can little by little be implemented
To the progress of target 658.Data drawing list 650 with Figure 55 contrasts, and data drawing list 680 has the triggering of successively decreasing become according to the time
Point.
This can see in Figure 58 embodiment.Figure 58 is that diagram is directed to resident family member over time according to embodiment
Incrementally remove the schematic diagram of the system 710 of internet dispensing.
Target 658 in Figure 56 is that internet use is reduced to daily three hours of maximum by resident family.In order to realize use
In the strategy for reaching target 658 according to gradual mode, system 710 be able to will be used to control resident family's attribute at time 656A
The threshold value 656A of (for example, internet access) is set as 7 (for example, instruction will recall interconnection after the use of 7 hours is reached
Net accesses).As resident family is towards target advance 674 (for example, starting to reduce internet use), threshold value can be reduced.For example,
At time 656B, threshold value 654B is set to 3 hours, and the maximum dispensing that instruction internet uses is three hours now.Threshold
Any granularity of value modification can be used for reaching target 658.For example, can be such as the annual, moon, week, day, modification threshold hour
Value.In addition, the degree of threshold modifying can depend on any amount of factor and change.For example, for the mesh that will be difficult to
Mark, each threshold modifying can be very small degree.Therefore, resident family can dexterously and be little by little encouraged to continue towards target
658 advance.
As scrutable, target-bound gradually progress can effectively help resident family and/or resident family member to reach group
And/or individual goal.System presented herein is target-bound by progressively challenging resident family and/or resident family member continuation
Come in encourage such target to reach before completion.System presented herein goes for any amount of target.One
Such target is dispensing modification target, such as：Resident family's energy is reduced to use, reduce resident family member and/or whole resident family
