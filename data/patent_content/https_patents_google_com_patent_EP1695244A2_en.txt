Definitions
- Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention relate generally to providing items, and more specifically, to assigning geographic locations to the provided items.
- the World Wide Web contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) to the user based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are "hits" and are returned to the user as links.
- a search engine may attempt to sort the list of hits so that the most relevant and/or highest quality pages are at the top of the list of hits returned to the user. For example, the search engine may assign a rank or score to each hit, where the score is designed to correspond to the relevance or importance of the web page.
- keyword-based search engines are not always suitable for finding web pages associated with establishments within a specific geographic area or region. Such web searching fails primarily because keyword-based search engines typically cannot assign an address or other geographically descriptive information to those web pages not actually including such information.
- a search engine is configured to maintain a central database binding URLs to one or more geographic locations.
- search engine owners manually assign locations to web sites, and/or make available to web site authors mechanisms by which they can explicitly request locations be assigned to their web sites.
- the search engine may define a set of HTML meta-tags with which web site authors can explicitly assign one or more geographic locations directly to each of their web pages.
- a third method includes configuring a search engine to parse existing postal addresses or other geographic information from web pages, and allow users to search for web pages that contain both certain keywords and at least one postal address within or close to a given geographic region.
- This concept remains of limited use because relevant postal addresses often do not appear on the same web page as do the relevant search keywords.
- a method may include identifying a set of web documents; identifying geographic location identifiers included within at least some of the plurality of web documents; assigning the identified geographic location identifiers to web documents that include the identified geographic location identifiers; and assigning the identified geographic location identifiers to other web documents based on a relevancy of the web documents including a geographic location identifier to the other web documents.
- a system may include means for identifying a set of web documents; means for identifying a geographic location identifier included within a first web document in the plurality of web documents; and means for assigning the identified geographic location identifier to a second web document in the plurality of web documents that based on a relevancy of the first web document to the second web document.

- Fig. 9 is a flow diagram of yet another exemplary process for assigning geographic location identifiers to a collection of web pages in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- Implementations consistent with the invention enable assignment of geographic location identifiers to web documents, such as web pages.
- geographic location identifiers included within web pages may be assigned to additional web pages that may or may not include geographic location identifiers based upon several relevancy criteria. In this manner, web pages that either do not include geographic descriptive information or include unrefined or incomplete geographic location information may nonetheless be searched or identified based on an assigned geographic location identifier.
- document relevancy may be determined based on several factors, such as relative distance between documents, terminology used, and local or web site determination. Accordingly, geographic location identifiers maybe accurately assigned to web documents.
- a document is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may be an e-mail, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, etc.
- a common document is a web page. Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.).
- Network 100 may include multiple clients 110 connected to one or more servers 120 via a network 140.
- Network 140 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, or a combination of networks.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network
- IP Internet
- a client may perform the functions of a server and a server may perform the functions of a client.
- Clients 110 may include client entities.
- An entity may be defined as a device, such as a wireless telephone, a personal computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices.
- Server 120 may include server entities that process, search, and/or maintain documents in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention.
- Clients 110 and server 120 may connect to network 140 via wired, wireless, or optical connections.
- server 120 may include a geographic location engine 125.
- geographic location engine 125 may identify and assign geographic location identifiers to web sites available via network 140.
- Fig. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a client 110 or server 120 according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.

- server 120 may perform geographic document locating operations through geographic location engine 125.
- Geographic location engine 125 may be stored in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 230.
- a computer-readable medium may be defined as one or more physical or logical memory devices and/or carrier waves.
- the software instructions defining geographic location engine 125 may be read into memory 230 from
- Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an implementation of geographic location engine 125 in additional detail.
- Geographic location engine 125 may include a geographic location identifier assigning component 340.
- the documents on which geographic location identifier assigning component 340 operates may be stored in a database 330.
- Database 330 may be implemented in many different forms, such as a distributed database, a relational
- database 330 is generated from web documents available via the world wide web.
- geographic location identifier assigning component 340 may assign a geographic location identifier to the documents in database 330. Consistent with aspects of the invention, the geographic location identifier may be a partial or complete postal address, telephone number, area code, etc or any combination thereof.
- the geographic location identifier may be based on links, such as hyperlinks, that connect the nodes in the collection of documents in database 330.
- Fig. 4 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary set of documents 400 indexed by server 120.
- a document may refer to a web page or other searchable document.
- the set of documents may refer to a web page or other searchable document.
- database 330 may include many billions of documents. For ease of explanation, however, only nine documents, labeled as documents 401-409, are shown as being included in the set of documents 400.
- the documents in set 400 can be thought of as forming a network graph in which each documents is connected by its respective links.
- the links may be in the form of
- a line originating from a first document and leading to a second document may be called a forward or outbound link relative to the first document and indicate that the first document is a linking document.
- a link from the first document to the second document may be characterized as a backlink from the second document to the first document.
- Document 40 originating from the second document and leading to the first document may be called an inbound link relative to the first document and indicate that the first document is a linked document.
- Document 401 for example, has a single outbound link leading to document 402 and three inbound links originating from documents 402, 403, and 406.
- Fig. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process for assigning geographic identification information to web documents included within search results provided to a client 110 in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. While the following description focuses on providing search results, it will be appreciated that implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are equally applicable to other types of information, besides search results. For example, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are equally applicable to associating location identifiers to web documents referenced by or included within other sources, such as directories, etc.
- Processing may begin by initially identifying, collecting, locating, or otherwise indexing a number of web documents, such as those in database 330 (act 500).
- web documents may be located and collected irrespective of a specific search query using, for example, automated search bots or web crawling technology.
- relational linking information for each document is also collected, indicating those documents that link to or from each collected document.
- Geographic location identifiers appearing in the documents may then be identified (act 510).
- a document may include a partial postal address, such as 1234 Anywhere Lane, Fairfax, VA.
- the partial address may be identified and associated with the document from which it was retrieved.
- suitable geographic location identifiers may include partial or complete postal addresses, although alternative geographic location identifiers may also be used, such as area codes, telephone numbers, aiiport codes, geographic landmark identifiers, etc.
- a pattern matching technique may be utilized for locating geographic location identifier.
- the web documents may be examined for text that matches a standard format for an address, a partial address, a telephone number, etc. or additional terms that indicate the presence of geographic descriptive information.
- the identified geographic location identifiers may then be standardized into a common, predefined format (act 520). For example, partial or non-standardized addresses failing to include zip codes may be standardized to include an appropriate zip code. Alternatively, identifiable misspellings or other errors or deficiencies may be corrected so as to ensure that the geographic location identifiers associated with a document are in an accurate, standardized format for each document.
- standardization may be used to identify geographic location identifier refinement and equality. Identifying geographic location identifier refinement refers to determining whether one geographic location identifier further narrows another geographic location identifier, such as 1234 Anywhere Drive, Fairfax, VA further narrowing Fairfax, VA. Additionally, standardization may operate to extract information included with a geographic location identifier into predefined categories that may assist subsequent usage of the identifier. Such categories may include street number, street name, street type, city, state, county, country, zip code, etc.
- a geographic location identifier may be initially assigned to web documents on which the geographic location identifier appears (act 524). Additionally, a geographic location identifier may be assigned to documents not already assigned or including a geographic location identifier or assigned a different geographic location identifier (act 530). In accordance with one implementation consistent with principles of the invention, such an assignment may be accomplished by assigning each document a geographic location identifier associated with another document which is linked, either directly or indirectly (through a predetermined number of links), to the document. Additional specifics regarding the assignment of geographic location identifiers will be set forth in additional detail below. Once a geographic location identifier has been associated with each document, the location identifiers may be used in performing subsequent searches or ranking of search results. Alternatively, results incorporating the documents may indicate the associated geographic location identifiers, thereby assisting users in sorting through the returned results.
- Fig. 6 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process for standardizing and assigning geographic location identifiers to a collection of web documents P in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. Initially, for each web document P, it is determined whether a partial or complete postal address A is found on the document (act 600). If no address is found, the process proceeds to act 614 described below. However, if an address A is found on document P, the address is standardized, as described above, to place the address into a consistent format (act 602). This may include data correction or supplementation, or any such suitable standardization technique.
- an address A' has been previously associated with document P (act 604). For example, an address A' may have previously appeared on document P. If not, the process proceeds to act 612 described below. However, if an address A' has been previously associated with document P, it is then determined whether address A' either further refines address A (e.g., adds a street address to city, state information) or is equal to address A (act 606). If so, the process proceeds to act 614 described below, for processing of the next document. However, if it is determined that address A' does not further refine address A and is not equal to address A, it is next determined whether address A refines address A' (act 608).
- address A' refines address A'
- address A' is then dissociated from document P (act 610) and address A is associated with document P (act 612). P is then incremented to P+l (act 614) and the process returns to act 600 for examination of the next available document.
- Fig. 7 is a flow diagram of an exemplary process for assigning geographic location identifiers to a collection of web documents P, in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention. Initially, it is assumed that web documents having geographic location identifiers present thereon have already had those identifiers assigned to the document in accordance with the implementations set forth in detail above. Accordingly, the process may begin by identifying, for each document P, those documents P' that include a geographic location identifier and are "relevant" to document P from a geographic identification standpoint (act 700).
- relevant documents P' may be defined as relevant to the question of the geographic location(s) of web site owners where 1) document P' is "local” to document P, meaning that document P' is a different document on the same web site as document P, and 2) the anchor appearing on document P linking to document P' contains one or more terms from a small, heuristically determined set of terms.
- anchor refers to the part of an HTML hyperlink that is visible on a web document.
- Exemplary terms used in determining relevancy may include, but are not limited to, for example, “location(s)", “direction(s)”, “find”, “finder”, “locate”, “locater”, “store(s)”, “branch(es)”, “about”, “company”, “contact”, “information”, etc. See below for more detail on this heuristically determined “relevance” of hyperlinks.
- a link to a document P' may be considered relevant if its anchor includes a complete or partial postal address.
- a document P' may be considered relevant if its URL includes either a complete or partial postal address or any of the above listed terms.
- a document P' may be considered relevant by examining the contents of document P' directly.
- a hyperlink failing each of the above tests may still be considered "relevant” if the HTML title of the target document includes any of the terms listed above, or a complete or partial postal address.
- An actual implementation using this test would undoubtedly include in its first pass the detection of all web documents in the archive that pass this target document test. More detailed heuristics may be deployed to determine if the target document makes a hyperlink "relevant".
- the process proceeds to act 730 for advancement to the next relevant document P'.
- the geographic location identifier(s) associated with document P' may be associated with document P (act 720).
- the process then continues to act 730 where P' is incremented to the next potentially relevant document (if any).
- the process then returns to act 710.
- Fig. 8 is a flow diagram of another exemplary process for assigning geographic location identifiers to a collection of web documents P in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- at least one web document P is identified having at least one standardized geographic location identifier associated therewith, such as those described above, with respect to Fig. 6 (act 800).
- the geographic location identifier(s) associated with document P may be assigned to each relevant document P' connected by a backlink from document P (act 810).
- relevancy may be determined heuristically, and may include those documents common to a particular web site and reachable within a predetermined number of backlinks.
- Fig. 9 is a flow diagram of yet another exemplary process for assigning geographic location identifiers to a collection of web documents P in an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- i sets of postal addresses Ai(P) appearing on document P' and reachable from document P following i "relevant" hyperlinks are identified (act 900).
- each set Ai(P) (for i from 0 to N, with N being the maximum number of links) includes addresses included on documents reachable from i links away and associated with document P.
- N 3
- Ai(P) sets i.e., AO(P), Al(P), A2(P), and A3 (P) are identified, where each set includes the addresses reachable from document P from the particular number of links away (e.g., 0-3).
- addresses associated with document P' one less link removed e.g., Ai-I(P')
- link distance i e.g., Ai(P)
- all sets Al(P) through AN(P) are built for each document in turn by following "relevant" hyperlinks, but gain in performance by storing sets Ai(P') computed for neighboring documents.
- Fig. 1OA is a graphical depiction of an exemplary web document 1000 that does not include geographic location identifiers directly usable in searching or otherwise identifying web document 1000 among a set of web documents.
- web document 1000 may be a web page relating to a menu for "Joe's Diner" and may include various menu items 1002 including, e.g., a tuna melt sandwich.
- a search for "tuna melt” and "Fairfax, VA" using a conventional search engine would fail to return web document 1000.
- a "Directions" link 1004 may point to an associated web document that does include a suitable geographic location identifier, e.g., address, telephone number, etc.
- Fig. 1OB is a graphical depiction of an exemplary web document 1100 associated with link 1004 on web document 1000 that includes geographic location identifiers. More specifically, such geographic location identifiers may include a business address 1102, a telephone number 1104. In addition web document 1100 may include driving directions 1106, and map 1108 for assisting users in accurately locating the business. As described in detail above, one or more of geographic location identifiers 1102 and 1104 associated with web document 1100 may be assigned to web document 1000.
- web document 1100 may be identified as "relevant" to web document 1000 because 1) it is "local” to web document 1000 in that it is part of the same web site, 2) link 1004 on web document 1000 associated with web document 1100 includes one or more of the geographically descriptive terms described above, and 3) web document 1100 is within a predetermined number of links removed from web document 1000 (one link, in this example). Accordingly, one or more of geographic location identifiers 1102 and 1104 associated with web document 1100 may be assigned to web document 1000, thereby facilitating searching of web document 1000 based on the one or more geographic location identifiers.
- CONCLUSION Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention facilitate assignment of geographic location identifiers to web documents not including geographic location identifiers thereon.
- Figs. 5-9 may be performed by server 120 or another device (or combination of devices). While a series of acts has been described with regard to Figs. 5-9, the order of the acts may be varied in other implementations consistent with the invention. Moreover, non-dependent acts may be implemented in parallel.
