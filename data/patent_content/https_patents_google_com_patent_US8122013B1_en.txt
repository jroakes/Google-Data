Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to document searching, and, more particularly, to systems and methods for enhancing local search performance.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search systems attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search systems base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search system is to provide links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) to the user based on the search query.
- the search system accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are “hits” and are returned to the user as links.
- a method may include receiving a local search request including at least a search term and a geographic identification; identifying business listings matching the received local search request; determining a webscore associated with each identified business listing; and ranking the identified business listing based on the webscore associated with each identified business listing.
- a system may include means for receiving a local search request including a search term and a geographic identification; means for identifying business listings matching the search term and an expanded geographic region including at least an area identified by the received geographic identification; means for calculating a location prominence score for each identified business listing; means for ranking the identified business listings based on the location prominence scores; and means for presenting the ranked business listings to a user.
- a method may include determining a webscore for each of a plurality of business listings, wherein the webscore includes a number of web documents referencing a business listing title; receiving a local search request from a user via a computer network; identifying business listings based on the local search request; ranking the identified business listings based on the webscore for each listing; and presenting the ranked business listings to the user over the computer network.
- a computer-readable medium that stores instructions executable by a client device.
- the computer-readable medium may include instructions for receiving a local search request from a user, wherein the local search request includes a search term and a geographic identifier; instructions for identifying business listings based on the local search request; instructions for calculating a location prominence score for each identified business listing, wherein the location prominence score is based on a webscore for each identified business listing; instructions for ranking the identified business listings based on the location prominence scores; and instructions for presenting the ranked business listings to the user.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an exemplary information retrieval network in which systems and methods consistent with principles of the invention may be implemented;
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an exemplary client or server of FIG. 1 according to an implementation consistent with principles of the invention
- FIG. 3 is flow chart of exemplary processing for performing a local search according to an implementation consistent with principles of the invention
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of exemplary processing for determining a webscore for a business listing in accordance with principles of the invention
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of exemplary processing for generating webscores for redundant business listings in accordance with principles of the invention.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart of exemplary processing for performing a local search in accordance with principles of the invention.
- Local searching may involve identifying business listings associated with a particular geographic area. Some geographic areas may include a large number of business listings associated with a given query. For example, a search of “universities near New York” may result in a large number of listings. In addition, proximity-based search results may fail to provide potentially relevant or important search results in an initial result set, thereby adversely impacting the search's apparent success.
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may identify matching business listings within a defined geographic region and present the identified listings based, at least in part, upon webscores associated with the listings.
- each listing's webscore is calculated to reflect the listing's popularity or importance within a larger data set, such as the Internet at large. In this manner, popular or important listings may be elevated above listings that have lower popularities.
- FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram of a network 100 in which systems and methods consistent with principles of the invention may be implemented.
- Network 100 may include multiple clients 110 connected to multiple servers 120 - 140 via a network 150 .
- Network 150 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), an intranet, the Internet, a memory device, another type of network, or a combination of networks.
- PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network
- Clients 110 may include client entities.
- An entity may be defined as a device, such as a wireless telephone, a personal computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices.
- Servers 120 - 140 may include server entities that gather, process, search, and/or maintain documents in a manner consistent with principles of the invention.
- Clients 110 and servers 120 - 140 may connect to network 150 via wired, wireless, and/or optical connections.
- server 120 may optionally include a local search system 125 usable by clients 110 .
- Server 120 may crawl documents (e.g., web pages) and store information associated with these documents in a repository of crawled documents.
- Local search system 125 may facilitate searching of collected or aggregated business listings in response to received search queries from clients 110 . Identified listings may be sorted, ranked and presented in the manner set forth in detail below.
- Servers 130 and 140 may store or maintain documents that may be crawled by server 120 . While servers 120 - 140 are shown as separate entities, it may be possible for one or more of servers 120 - 140 to perform one or more of the functions of another one or more of servers 120 - 140 . For example, it may be possible that two or more of servers 120 - 140 are implemented as a single server. It may also be possible that a single one of servers 120 - 140 is implemented as multiple, possibly distributed, devices.
- a “document,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web site, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, etc.
- a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.).
- a “link,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document.
- FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a client or server entity (hereinafter called “client/server entity”), which may correspond to one or more of clients 110 and/or servers 120 - 140 , according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- the client/server entity may include a bus 210 , a processor 220 , a main memory 230 , a read only memory (ROM) 240 , a storage device 250 , an input device 260 , an output device 270 , and a communication interface 280 .
- Bus 210 may include a path that permits communication among the elements of the client/server entity.
- Processor 220 may include a processor, microprocessor, or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions.
- Main memory 230 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor 220 .
- ROM 240 may include a ROM device or another type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use by processor 220 .
- Storage device 250 may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.
- Input device 260 may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to the client/server entity, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc.
- Output device 270 may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc.
- Communication interface 280 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables the client/server entity to communicate with other devices and/or systems.
- communication interface 280 may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such as network 150 .
- the client/server entity may perform certain operations, as will be described in detail below.
- the client/server entity may perform these operations in response to processor 220 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 230 .
- a computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave.
- the software instructions may be read into memory 230 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 250 , or from another device via communication interface 280 .
- the software instructions contained in memory 230 may cause processor 220 to perform processes that will be described later.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of exemplary processing for performing a local search.
- processing may begin by receiving a local search request from client device 110 at local search system 125 (block 300 ).
- the local search request may include one or more search terms and may specify a geographic area or address.
- the specification of the geographic area or address may be explicitly identified in the search request. Alternatively, the specification of the geographic area or address may be implied based on a default search area, a displayed map, etc.
- business listings matching the received search terms may be identified within a broad geographic area including the specified geographic region (block 310 ). For example, a search for “auto parts near Bethel Park, PA.” may result in identification of business listings matching “auto parts” in geographic regions proximate to, but other than Bethel Park, Pa.
- a webscore may be determined for each listing (block 320 ). The web score may be determined as described below with respect to FIG. 5 . As will be set forth in additional detail below, each listing's webscore is reflective of the listing's popularity or importance.
- the identified business listings are ranked based on at least the identified webscores (block 330 ).
- the ranked listings are then presented to the user in a set of search results (block 340 ).
- popular listings proximate to the received geographic area or address may be elevated in presented search results, thereby improving search performance.
- additional listing features may be applied to webscore or location prominence scores.
- review scores or sources of reviews associated with the listing may be used to increase or decrease a listing's location prominence score or web score.
- language included within a review for a listing may also be used to increase or decrease a listing's location prominence score or web score.
- financial information associated with the listing may be incorporated into the listing's location prominence score or web score determination. For example, information regarding annual sales, employment base, longevity, etc. may be used to adjust a listing's location prominence score or web score. In this manner, local search results may provide the most relevant and helpful information possible.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary processing for determining a webscore for a business listing. Initially, the number of words or characters in the business listing's title are identified (block 410 ). Next, it is determined whether the number of words or characters in the listing's title meet or exceed a predetermined threshold (block 420 ). In one implementation, the predetermined threshold may be three words. Alternatively, a suitable threshold may be 10 characters. Suitable alternative thresholds may also be implemented, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.
- a document search (e.g., Internet or other web search) may be performed using the listing's title as search terms (block 430 ).
- the repository of crawled documents stored at server 220 may be searched using the listing's title as search terms.
- a number of matching documents returned in the search may then be identified as a raw webscore for the business listing (block 440 ).
- a business listing entitled “NAPA Auto Parts” may meet the title length threshold.
- a subsequently conducted document search may result in 755,000 results. Consequently, the raw webscore for the listing is set to 755,000.
- a document search (e.g., Internet or other web search) may be performed using a combination of the listing's title and city as search terms (block 450 ).
- a business listing entitled “Bill's Tavern” may include fewer than a required number of words or characters.
- an Internet search may be performed for “Bill's Tavern” AND “Bethel Park, PA.”.
- a number of matching documents returned in the search may then be identified as a raw webscore for the business listing (block 460 ).
- a final webscore may be log 10(raw_webscore)*webscore_weight, where the webscore weight may reflect a relative importance of the webscore to overall business listing ranking.
- webscore_weight may be 0.2. It should be understood that the above scaling methodology is exemplary. Other suitable methods for scaling may be similarly employed.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary processing for generating webscores for redundant business listings in accordance with principles of the invention.
- the processing of FIG. 5 may be contemporaneously performed along with the webscore generation processing described above in FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- processing may begin by receiving a local search request from client device 110 at local search system 125 (block 500 ).
- business listings matching the received search terms may be identified within a broad geographic area including the specified geographic region (block 510 ).
- it may be determined whether multiple listings having a same business name are identified (block 520 ).
- a total number of listings having the same business name may be identified (block 530 ).
- a webscore for each listing may be determined the manner set forth above in FIG. 4 (block 540 ).
- An adjusted webscore may then be determined based on the number of listings having the same business name (block 540 ).
- a single listing among the number of business listings having the same business name may be promoted above the other listings (block 550 ).
- the promoted business listing may be identified by its proximity to the originally received geographic area.
- the business listing identified for promotion may receive a supplemented webscore commensurate with the level of promotion.
- Other methods for promoting business listings such as using review data, sales numbers, etc. may also be used.
- webscores for the identified business listings may be identified in the manner set forth above with respect to FIG. 4 (block 560 ). Following adjusted webscore determination and potential promotion for each identified business listing, the identified business listings may be ranked based on at least the identified and possibly adjusted webscores (block 570 ). The ranked listings may then be presented to the user in a set of search results (block 580 ).
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating alternative processing for performing a local search in accordance with principles of the invention.
- processing may begin by receiving a local search request from client 110 at local search system 125 (block 600 ).
- business listings matching the received search terms may be identified within a broad geographic area including specified geographic region (block 610 ).
- a location prominence score may be determined (block 620 ).
- the location prominence score may be a linear combination of several distinct factors including: a search ranking value for an authority page associated with the business listing; a highest search ranking value for any page referencing the listing address; the number of pages referencing the listing address; the number of scraped page references; the number of reviews for the listing; and the scaled webscore for the listing (as described in detail above).
- the authority page for the listing refers to the “best” web document identified in association to the listing address.
- Search ranking values refer to web rankings or scores as identified by a search engine.
- One exemplary search ranking value may be “PageRank” from Google, Inc., although other suitable ranking methodologies may be similarly employed.
- a “scraped page” refers to a business listing source, such as CitySearch, SuperPages, etc., with the number of references in scraped pages reflecting the popularity of listings associated with the listing address. By generating a location prominence score for each listing, factors such as popularity, and relative location may be incorporated into presented results.
- the identified business listings may be ranked based on at least the identified location prominence scores (block 630 ).
- the ranked listings may then be presented to the user in a set of search results (block 640 ).
