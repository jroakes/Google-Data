Show, then data processing system can distribute higher selection priority to content item.
Data processing system can execute load balancing techniques to avoid load resource.Load balancing techniques can be to avoid mistake
Resource is loaded into the determinant of another available resources by early ground.Load balancing techniques may include smoothing technique.For example, smooth
Technology can equably be divided by the remaining duration based on content item number to be displayed and desired display content item
Cloth content item impression (for example, number that content item has been checked) and load balance.For example, data processing system can be based on interior
Hold item residue degree divided by remaining time to be displayed to determine value.Then, data processing system can be incited somebody to action based on these values
" movable (campaign) " of content item is grouped into five groups, wherein the group with peak corresponds to for selecting purpose
Highest priority.It should be appreciated that content item number to be displayed can determine any one of in many ways, and
It can be determined based on budget associated with the content item.
Data processing system can receive the request to content from computing device.When data processing system receives request
When, data processing system can determine the highest level group with the content item for possessing the position that can be checked.Data processing system
The high priority content item in this group can also be identified (for example, not yet providing the content for showing on the computing device
).Then, the feature of content item or score can be input to grader (for example, Naive Bayes Classification by data processing system
Device) in, to select content item with centering from highest group/priority.In order to minimize in providing contents in real time item in figure ring
Stand-by period during being shown on border, data processing system can precalculate (precompute) one in processed offline
A little scores and feature.Then, data processing system can be in response to the request to content item, by predetermined score and real-time score
Combination is input in grader.Score or feature can be based on the following contents：
Identify the search term searched near position.For example, if data processing system receives pair in history
The quantity or frequency of the search inquiry of Garden (park) near Fendalton, then when data processing system reception is only right
When the search inquiry of " Fendalton ", data processing system can increase the possibility of the content item in the shops selection Garden.
Increase the possibility that selection corresponds to the content item in suburb/region around position, and if region of search
Too specific (such as home address) can then use the distance to region of search in ranked content item.
Increase the possibility for selecting content item corresponding with top shop according to the volume of the flow of passengers.

When setting includes the content activity of content item, content provider can provide additional indicator.Content provides
Person can provide content selector 135 can by using about candidate content item information execute search and identify content live
Dynamic or content group rank information.For example, candidate content item may include unique identifier, content group, interior may map to
Appearance activity or content provider.Content selector 130 can be based on the content activity data knot being stored in data storage bank 155
Information in structure determines the information about content provider 125.
However, in non-textual graphics environment, graphical content may not include the correlation that can be used for selecting content item object
Keyword, term or phrase.For example, the map of the geographic area of San Jose etc. can have inhomogeneity
The incoherent point of interest of type, such as restaurant, cafe, retail shop, museum, park, garden, educational institution.Therefore, data
Processing system is big including such as Pizza, meaning in response to location finding inquiry (such as " San Jose ") selection
The content item of the topic keywords such as profit, jewelry, shoes, jeans may be challenging.This may be challenging
Because data processing system can identify with including the corresponding a large amount of not phases in the geographic area of San Jose
The different points of interest closed.Bulk information in analysis and processing geographic area may be in selection for being presented in graphics environment
(presentation) lag (lag), delay (delay) or stand-by period are introduced when content item object.
Therefore, for the ease of reduction, minimize, prevent or eliminate stand-by period in content selection, data processing system
120 (for example, via content selectors 135) can identify or recognize content item, each content item has to meet to be believed by position
Cease the entry in the location field on the boundary formed.For example, content provider 125 can be with one or more content items or content
Group establishes content activity.Content activity may refer to one or more content groups associated with theme (theme).Content group can

One or more fields of content selection or the content activity of data are carried out according to processing system 120.In order to minimize selection content
Stand-by period, data processing system 120 (for example, via location engine 130) can determine boundary or range.Data processing system
System can compare the position in content activity data structure to determine the position whether on the boundary determined by location engine 130
It is interior.Data processing system 120 can filter out content item based on this comparison.
In the example shown in table 1, it is holy that data processing system 120 can determine that boundary corresponds to such as California
The city or town of He Sai.Then, data processing system 120 can filter out the content item not in identified boundary.This
In the case of, data processing system 120 can identify content item A1, A2, B1 and C1.Data processing system 120 can determine A1, A2
Correspond to San Jose with B1, but C1 corresponds to the Anaheim except identified boundary.Therefore, data processing system
120 subsets that content item can be established based on boundary are used as { A1, A2, B1 }.Data processing system can use established it is interior
The subset for holding item is further processed.
Using the subset of filtering, data processing system 120 can select the second subset of content item based on classification information.Example
Such as, data processing system 120 can select to be assigned to one or more based on the load balancing techniques of such as smoothing function
The second subset of the content item of first category in classification.Load balancing techniques may include smoothing technique or be configured as improving
The function or strategy of resource allocation.Load balancing techniques can contribute to reduce the resource of waste or inefficient resource allocation, or
Optimize resource to use.
Data processing system 120 can be configured with load balancing techniques, be based on such as active duration, budget or money
The movement parameter of source availability establishes classification.For example, data processing system 120 can be based on remaining lasting in content activity
Remaining amount of budget establishes classification in time quantum and content activity.The category can be based on duration and budget ratio.
Duration may include remaining time interval, remaining number of days, hour in the percentage or content activity of remaining duration
Number, the number of minutes or number of seconds.Remaining time can refer to the content activity established by the movable content provider of set content
And end.For example, content activity can with 1 week, 2 weeks, 30 days, 1 month, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days duration or certain
A other times interval or duration.Duration can be defined as { begin_date_time, end_date_time }
({ beginning _ date _ time, end _ date _ time }).Duration can be stored in active data structure.Data processing system
System 120 can determine residue by monitoring current time and determining the difference between current time and end date_date_time
Duration, and divide that difference by by between end_date_time and begin_date_time difference determine it is lasting when
Between.It is for example, completed if there is 7 days and 4 days, then 3 days remaining, or residue about 43% duration.
The budget of content activity can be established by content provider.It is content activity that budget, which may refer to content provider,
The stock number or the amount of money of distribution.Budget can be currency (for example, dollar or other currency), point (points), token or instruction
The other unit of stock number.Budget can be stored in content activity data structure.
Table 2 shows the content activity data structure including budget and Duration field.
Table 2：The example illustration of content activity data structure
In order to determine duration and Resource Availability, data processing system 120 (for example, content selector 135) can be with
Determine the stock number and each content activity remaining duration that each content activity is consumed.Data processing system 120
Money that content activity is consumed can be determined using the resource allocation of monitoring content activity or one or more technologies of consumption
It measures in source.For example, data processing system 120 can be configured with the metering module of monitoring resource consumption.In some cases, at data
Reason system 120 can be with the movable performance metric of meter content, and resource consumption is calculated or determined based on performance metric.For example,
Data processing system 120 can store the impression record of the quantity of the selection of instruction content activity and the quantity of conversion
(impression record)。
Impression record data structure 165 can be stored in data storage bank 155.Impression records data structure 165 can be with
Include the table format or other data formats for storing, maintaining, organize or manipulating impression record.Impression record may refer to
The example of content item is shown on webpage.Impression (impression) may include the letter about the webpage for showing content item thereon
Breath is (for example, the key of the position (location) of the uniform resource locator of webpage, interior tank/positioning (position), webpage
Word), be input to by user the keyword and/or webpage for leading to the selected search inquiry of content item, content item of search engine
Keyword or cause content item be selected for display search inquiry (for example, via extensive, phrase or exactly match or its
His correlation or similarity measurement), timestamp associated with impression, show thereon content item computing device 110 geography
The type of position or equipment.
Data processing system 120 can provisionally by content item impression record storage in data storage bank 155, and
(for example, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.) remove or delete impression note after one section of duration
Record.Data processing system 120 can remove impression record in response to event, condition or triggering.For example, data processing system
120 can in response to delete impression historical information request, or calling (call) associated with impression termination after
Impression record is deleted after time interval or duration.
Data processing system 120 can based on conversion or selection quantity come determine spend in conversion or selection on it is pre-
It calculates.In another example, data processing system 102 can determine spent amount of budget based on acceptance of the bid quantity.For example, content
Selector 135 can initiate to be auctioned online to select content item, wherein content provider that will bid associated with content item.It can be with
Selection content item associated with the bid of top ranked is for being shown in information resources.The bid amount of this top ranked
Resource is can correspond to, and is deducted from the resource account of content provider.
Therefore, data processing system 120 can be based on residual amount and remaining duration in given time determination pair
In the ratio of content activity.Data processing system 120 can as follows be established based on the ratio of residual and remaining duration
Classification：Residual divided by ("/") remaining duration；Residual (%)/residue duration (# days)；Residual
(%)/remaining duration (# minutes)；Or residual (%)/residue duration (%).Table 3 shows that storage is remaining pre-
The sample data knot of the ratio of calculation, remaining duration and each content item for meeting San Jose boundary
Structure.
Table 3：Store residual, remaining duration and the residual of each content item and remaining duration

Classification.In some embodiments, data processing system 120, which can use, is more or less than five classifications and different classes
Not Xian Zhi or boundary.
In some cases, data processing system 120 can also be that each content item distributes priority value.Data processing system
System 120 can access the impression record data structure 165 of set for content item, to retrieve more than first in field from checking
The priority value of each in a content item.Priority value can indicate whether content item previously has been provided for calculating
It presents in equipment or is presented via computing device.For example, higher priority value can correspond to not provide for showing previously
Content item, and lower priority value instruction content item have been provided to be presented to computing device.
Whether data processing system 120 can be shown based on content item or content item be displayed on it is specific
In equipment, it is shown to user or is shown in the number on any computing device to distribute priority value.Data processing system
120 whether can be shown based on content item or during time interval content item be shown on a particular device,
It has been displayed to user or has been shown in the number on any computing device to distribute priority value.For example, if corresponding to
Content item A1 is not yet shown to computing device 110 during the duration of the content activity of content item A1, then data processing system
Priority value 1 can be distributed to content item A1 by 120.Priority value 2 (can be less than by data processing system 120 with ranking
1) content item A2 is distributed to.Data processing system 120 can select the content item with higher priority rather than with relatively low
The content item of priority so that the content item not presented on the computing device previously quilt before the content item being presented
It presents.
Data processing system 120 can the combination based on priority value from the first subset of content item (for example, being wrapped in table 4
Those of include content item) in determine the second subset of content item.Data processing system 120 can be based on highest classification and priority
It matches to select second subset.For example, classification 1 can be the classification of the top ranked based on load balancing techniques.Classification 1 can be with
Including three content items A1, A2 and A3.In classification 1, content item A1 and A2 can have high priority, because they are previous not
It was presented, and content item A2 can have low priority, because it was previously presented on the computing device.
In order to select to provide the content item for display, data processing system 120 can be from number stored in memory
According to retrieval value (or feature or score) corresponding with the subset of content item in structure.These values can be by data processing system
120 are generated using processed offline.These values can be the possibility interacted with content item, the click-through (click such as predicted
Through) rate or the conversion ratio of prediction.
Data processing system 120 (for example, via content selector 135) can be defeated by the value, feature or score of content item
Enter into grader 140, to select content item with centering from highest group/priority.It in some cases, can be by only handling
Content item corresponding with second subset minimizes the stand-by period, and second subset may include content item A1 and A2.In order into
One step minimizes stand-by period during providing contents in real time item object on graphics environment to show, data processing system
System 120 can precalculate some features or value in processed offline.The value of the feature precalculated can be stored in Value Data
In structure 170.Data processing system can be in response to the request of the content item to lacking keyword, by predetermined characteristic or value and in fact
The combination of Shi Tezheng or value is input in grader 140.Exemplary value or feature may include：
Value is determined based on the history word by multiple and different computing devices for position input.For example, data processing system
It can identify the search term searched near position.For example, if data processing system received in history for San Jose it is attached
The quantity or frequency of the search inquiry of close Garden are then looked into when data processing system receives the search only for " San Jose "
When inquiry, data processing system can increase the selected possibility of content item in the shops Garden.
Increase the possibility that selection corresponds to the content item in suburb/region around position, and if region of search
Too specific (such as home address) can then use the distance to region of search in ranked content item.
Increase the possibility for selecting content item corresponding with top shop based on the volume of the flow of passengers.
The number (more fewer better) of computing device presentation content item object
The quantity (more fewer better) of the computing device of presentation content item
Based on access with the quantity of the HTML request of each corresponding resource in more than second a content items come really
Definite value.For example, accessing the quantity (The more the better) of movable information resources or the HTML request of website within past 30 days
The shop that the movable owner or content provider were possessed within past 30 days access times (it is more more more
It is good)
Whether user is (be is more preferable) interested in movable classification (such as ship)
When user finally studied movable classification (such as ship) (more closer better)
It is predicted based on the Doppler radar for position to determine value.For example, environmental condition (time, weather etc.) whether
It is suitble to activity (the more matching the more good)
The click-through rate previously shown
Grader 140 can be configured with or including machine learning techniques or engine.For example, grader 140 can be configured with
