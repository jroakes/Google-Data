- the following description relates to systems and techniques for targeted advertising to users.
- Internet advertising has gained significant popularity in recent years. Internet users frequently search the internet for products and services of interest. In turn, advertisers rely extensively on the internet to target audiences interested in the products and services that the advertisers offer.
- An example of internet advertising is the presentation of advertisements to users in response to users' searches for topics of interest using a website, e.g., www.google.com.
- the website can present results as well as advertisements pertaining to the query string. The advertisements can be received from advertisers.
- Another example of internet advertising is the presentation of advertisements on websites that users view. For example, an automobile manufacturer, e.g., Nissan, can display advertisements related to Nissan brand automobiles on websites such as www.cars.com.
- the publishers of the websites can obtain financial benefit for displaying the advertisers' products while the advertisers can target audiences that frequently view the contents of the website.

- FIG. 4 depicts an example of a flow chart of a process for providing user attributes to an advertiser.
- a value of an attribute related to a user of a first system is determined at 405 .
- the user can be connected to a network.
- the network can be the internet and the network location can be a web page on the internet.
- the user can be connected to the network through any suitable instrument, e.g., a computer.
- the attribute can be a network address of the first system, e.g., the internet protocol (IP) address.
- IP internet protocol
- the attribute can be related to the user's geographic location.
- the attribute can be “Postal code” and the corresponding value can be “22903.”
- the geographical location can include one or more of a city, a metro, a state, a country, a postal code, a latitude, a longitude, and a telephone number.
- the attribute related to the first system can be determined when a user interacts with a web page of a web site on the internet using the first system.
- the value can be determined based on a query string that the user can provide to the first location.
- the value can also be determined based on a network address of the instrument, e.g., the IP address of the computer using which the user searches the internet.
- a network location identifier based at least in part on the determined value of the attribute can be generated at 410 .
- generating the network location identifier can include building a uniform resource locator (URL) by inserting the determined value into a predetermined URL format.
- the determined value can be inserted into the predetermined URL format by encoding the value into a syntax of the URL.
- the predetermined URL format can be specified by an entity associated with the second system on the network.
- the predetermined URL format can be received from an advertiser. The URL can point to a landing page designed and maintained by the advertiser at a second network location.
- the generated network location identifier e.g., the URL encoded with the values related to the user's attribute
- a token representing the generated network location identifier can be presented to the user.
- the token can also be a URL pointing to the landing page to which the URL received from the advertiser points.
- the token can include text, graphics, or a combination of both.
- the token can include a clickable link.
- the format of the syntax of the generated network location identifier including the values may render the appearance of the first syntax cumbersome.
- the token representing the generated network location identifier can have comparatively simpler syntax and appearance.
- the token can be the same as the generated network location identifier.
- the token which is a URL
- the URL can be displayed as a hyperlink which the user can click on to be led to a second system which can be a landing page of a web site of the advertiser.
- the token can be provided by the advertiser.
- each generated network location identifier can have a corresponding token.
- a plurality of generated network location identifiers can be represented by the same token.
- a user can be presented with the token representing the generated network location identifier.
- the user can be presented with one or more tokens representing one or more generated network location identifiers generated from predetermined URL formats received from one or more advertisers.
- the selection of the generated network location identifier can be detected at 420 .
- the token representing the generated network location identifier e.g., a URL
- the token representing the generated network location identifier can be presented as a hyperlink to the user at the first location.
- the user can click on the hyperlink using a cursor operated by a pointing device, e.g., a mouse. This can be an indication that the user has selected the generated network location identifier.
- the generated network location identifier can be provided to a second system at 425 .
- the second system can also reside on the network at a location corresponding, at least in part, to the generated network location identifier.
- the generated network location identifier can be provided to the second system by transmitting the generated network location identifier from the first system to the second system. For example, when a user clicks on a token representing a predetermined URL syntax with encoded values, the URL can be transmitted to the advertiser's location. Information including the determined value can be organized into the predetermined URL format such that the information can be extracted by the advertiser's computer and used to present customized content to the user.
- Such customized content can be based on the user's location. Additionally, such customized content can include dynamically generating a customized web page to be presented to the user. For example, when the advertiser's computer receives the URL including a postal code associated with the user, the advertiser's computer can generate a web page identifying the advertiser's products and services available in that postal code and present the generated web page to the user. In other implementations, the advertiser's computer can direct the user to a pre-existing web page regardless of the values associated with the user's location. For example, if the user's attribute values indicate that the user is in a location where the advertiser does not provide services, the advertiser's computer may redirect the user to a home page of the advertiser's web site.
- the user can search for information, products, services, and the like, on the internet by entering a search query at an appropriate location in the first web page.
- the user can be presented with search results and advertisements related to the search results.
- the search results and advertisements can be URLs of landing pages containing relevant information, products, and services, that are displayed on the first web page as hyperlinks.
- the user can access the information, products, and services by clicking on the hyperlink.
- values for attributes related to the user's geographic location can be determined. These values can be encoded in one or more URLs pointing to advertiser's landing pages.
- the advertiser can be provided with the URL including the attribute values pertaining to the user's geographic location. Based on the attribute values, advertisers can design their landing pages to more specifically target users.
- the user may be a member of an online social network.
- the user may have a profile on the social network which is a web page including information related to the user.
- the web crawler in the external engine can crawl the user's profile web page to collect information relevant to the user.
- the profile can include attributes describing the geographic location of the user.
- the profile can also include the user's interests.
- the external engine 105 can capture the attribute values.
- the advertisements presented to the user can be based on the contents of the user's profile.
- the advertisements presented to a user and the attributes collected from the user can be determined by a combination of the contents of a user's profile as well a query string provided by the user.
- the user attribute values related to the user's geographic location may not be precise and/or may be ambiguous.
- College Station, Tex., and Bryan, Tex. are geographically too close to each other that a user attributes determination system may be unable to determine exactly which town the user is interested in.
- Vancouver, Wash., USA, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada are also geographically close to each other.
- the external engine can determine an indication of precision, which the external engine can encode into the syntax of the received URL that is provided to the advertiser.
- certain user attribute values may be inaccurate.
- the external engine can specify a distance metric so that a level of inaccuracy of the attribute value can be specified. For example, the external engine may determine a value for the attribute “Latitude” and associate a distance metric of 95%. This may convey to the advertiser a 95% confidence level that the latitude value for the user is accurate. A lower value can indicate lower confidence.
- an attribute may have more than one value.
- the query string entered by a user can be “Coffee shops New York New Jersey.”
- the attribute “State” has two values—“New York” and “New Jersey.”
- the advertiser can configure the received URL to accept more than one value for the same attribute.
- the external engine can re-configure the syntax of the received URL to include the more than one attribute values.
- the external engine can be configured to request, from the advertiser, a received URL for each attribute value that the user attributes determination system captures. Each attribute value can be encoded into the syntax of the corresponding URL.
- the external engine can be configured to determine an unknown attribute based on a determined attribute.
- the user attributes determination system can determine a value of “22903” for the attribute “Postal code.” Based on this value for the postal code, the external engine can further determine that the value of the attribute “City” is “Charlottesville” and the value of the attribute “State” is “Virginia.”
- a user's language preference can be the attribute.
- the external engine can be configured to determine a value of an attribute related to a user. Subsequently, the external engine can generate an identifier, e.g., a URL, that can include the determined value.
- the external engine can display the generated URL to the user.
- the external engine can provide content that correspond, at least in part, to the determined value. For example, the external engine can retrieve advertisements that are determined to be relevant to the user based on the determined values.
- the user attributes determination system can determine a value of “22903” for the attribute “Postal code.”
- the external engine can generate a URL that includes the determined postal code and display the link to the user.
- the external engine can retrieve advertisements from the first advertiser, other advertisers, or both, who have advertisements for products and/or services in the same postal code. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
