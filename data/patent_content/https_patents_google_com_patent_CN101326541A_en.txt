§ 4.3.3 improves and selects
Get back to the operation 410 of Fig. 4, can before distributing (for example, broadcasting, multicast, clean culture, transmission etc.) audio documents, provide correlation information by the audio frequency publisher.If preserved described audio documents (for example, writing down), and then can before it is distributed, analyze before before to it.If described audio documents is distributed by live, then can when distributing, it analyze (may before client device is decoded to it and play, carry out at once) to it.
Get back to the operation 420 of Fig. 4, can be independent of audio documents before distributing audio documents by the audio frequency publisher provides advertisement position.As selecting or in addition, can information encoded be determined advertisement position in audio documents based on (for example, before advertisement position occurs, perhaps just before the advertisement position).Therefore, for example, audio documents thus can before 20 minutes, 40 minutes and 3 two minutes advertisement positions locating in 55 minutes are encoded among the described document.As another example, audio documents can be encoded to two minutes advertisement positions in 10 seconds, 19 minutes and 50 seconds in the described document.Such coding can be in (can hear and can not hear) audio tones, audio packet or the audio stream grouping text message, be used for calling out Advertisement Server executable code (for example, Javascript) etc.
Notice, owing to can download audio documents as required in some cases, so the length of audio documents can change to adapt to more or less advertisement position.For example, if by a plurality of very relevant advertisements, and/or the advertiser is ready to go into overdrive to push away to put, and the more advertisement position time then can be provided.Therefore, can be according to the degree of (A) advertisement correlativity, (B) have the income of more advertisement positions, the user's effectiveness that (C) has more advertisement positions and caused reduces (for example, user's worry).(D) the user's request grade of content, (E) the one or more ratios that increase or reduce audio content time and time spot among scope of terminal user's fund of content etc.Therefore, can between terminal user's effectiveness and advertising income, carry out balance.
If preserved described audio documents (for example, record) before before, then can distribute (for example, broadcasting, multicast, clean culture, transmission etc.) at audio documents and judge to determine the advertisement that to distribute in each advertisement position before.If described audio documents is distributed by live, then described judgement can be carried out (may carry out at once) before client device is decoded to it and play when it is distributed.If audio documents is downloaded (for example, using some host-host protocols such as FTP), then described document can comprise be used for when playing described audio documents (for example, when beginning to play) initiate the executable code judged.In either event, can after judging, utilize described audio documents (for example, the stream of carrying audio content) that (for example, inserting wherein) advertisement is provided.If preserved described audio documents before, then can judge all advertisement positions in the described audio documents simultaneously.By this way, the advertisement position (for example, when audio documents begins) that has the part of higher demand in the described audio documents can be filled to have the more advertisement of high score.
Audio documents can be divided into a plurality of fragments, and each fragment comprises advertisement position.In such embodiments, each fragment can be considered to audio documents itself.Can on the basis of particular audio piece, determine relevant advertisements, perhaps on the two basis of particular audio piece (for example, weight is bigger) and all audio frequency document (for example, weight is less), determine relevant advertisements.
Advertising message can comprise whether the advertiser wishes or agree that its advertisement carries out more than distributing once in given audio documents (example).For example, the advertiser may specify and utilize audio documents example (for example, clean culture audio stream) to no more than N time of its ad serve.As selecting or in addition, advertising network and/or audio documents publisher can carry out the policy that example that restriction utilizes audio documents is distributed the number of times of given advertisement.
Though under the background that pushes away the quotation (or highest quotation) of putting, described many examples at every turn, but can consider other quotation according to embodiments of the invention, (for example select such as each user, call out or send message etc.) the quotation (or highest quotation) of quotation (or highest quotation), each conversion (for example, call, project are bought, project is predetermined etc.).Similarly, scoring can be the function of the possibility of one or more quotations and possible one or more user actions.Push away the expectancy of putting (for example, at every turn pushing away the valency of emitting, each bid * selection rate or probability, each conversion bid * conversion ratio or probability etc. selected) though advertisement scoring can reflect at every turn, can use other to be used for the technology that advertisement is marked.These technology can be considered terminal user's effectiveness (for example, correlativity, bored coefficient etc.) of advertisement.
Though described according to some embodiments of the present invention and insert audio advertisement in audio documents, advertisement can and can utilize audio documents to distribute for other forms.For example, can have on the display screen MP3 player play mp3 file before, during or distribute text advertisements afterwards.As another example, can be before playing mp3 file on the MP3 player displaying video or animated advertising.Therefore, though the form of advertisement can be complementary with utilizing its audio documents of distributing described advertisement, the form of advertisement need not to be complementary with audio documents.
Determine relevant advertisements though Fig. 4 and 10 has described for given audio documents, can be used to determine the audio documents relevant (or its advertisement position) with given advertisement according to embodiments of the invention.For example, can provide the document that is considered to relevant to the advertiser with its advertisement.Can use such correlativity that described document is sorted.The advertiser can select to utilize one or more documents (or utilizing its (a plurality of) advertisement position) to distribute its advertisement.The advertiser can select such (a plurality of) express as the quotation that utilizes (a plurality of) document serve ads.Other advertiser can do equally like this.When distributing audio documents, can be to utilizing competition between the qualified advertisement that described audio documents distributes make a determination (for example, utilizing auction).
Income based on advertisement can be shared between ad serve network and audio frequency publisher.Described audio frequency publisher can charge from the terminal user to order, to download and/or be rendered as the basis at every turn at every turn.The ad revenue of being shared by the audio frequency publisher can be used to subsidy (for example, reduce or cancel) customer charge.In fact, ad revenue (for example, advertising network share and/or audio frequency publisher share) can be used to the expense paying user's download or present the audio documents that comprises advertisement.For example, if under the normal condition, the user is for downloading 1 dollar of a first MP3 song payment, and then the user may be collected the following carrier of less expense (or do not collect the charges, or actual cost) the MP3 song of one or more advertisements.Ad revenue can be used to subsidize other content and/or service, such as voice mail, live chat, the tinkle of bells, download of songs, playback of songs, audio program download, audio program broadcast, telephone service, intercom service etc.
Can broadcast at each according to the judgement in the embodiments of the invention on the basis of (or each multicast) and carry out, perhaps each distribute or the basis of each download on carry out.Each distribute or the basis of each download on carry out and judge to produce and more overcharge benefit.For example, under each Radio Broadcasting Agreements of the audio documents with 100000 advertisement positions, if advertiser A be ready to pay 5.00 dollars/push away and put, be limited to 50000.00 dollars in the budget, advertiser B be ready to pay 2.00 dollars/push away and put, be limited to 60000.00 dollars in the budget, and advertiser C be ready to pay 1.00 dollars/push away and put, be limited to 100000.00 dollars in the budget, then advertisement C will be distributed 100000 times, proceed 100000.00 dollars.On the other hand, under each advertisement position is judged, advertisement A will be distributed 10000 times, and advertisement B will be distributed 30000 times and advertisement C will be distributed 60000 times, proceed 170000.00 dollars (50000.00 dollars+60000.00 dollars+60000.00 dollars).
