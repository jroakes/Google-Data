Definitions
- the disclosure relates to generating promotional messages communicated to mobile communication devices and in particular to identifying promotional messages to be communicated to mobile communication devices based on distances between the devices and physical locations of entities associated with the promotional messages.
- An increasing number of services use location-based information to determine content provided to mobile communication devices. For example, using location-based information, a service provider or other entity may indicate points of interest within close proximity to (i.e., within a particular distance of) the mobile communication device. In this manner, a user of the mobile communication device may determine nearby points of interest such as restaurants, shopping centers, or other points of interest.
- Some conventional systems use location-based information to identify promotional messages to be delivered to mobile communication devices.
- these systems typically are one-dimensional in that location without interest-based information is used to identify the promotional messages.
- conventional location-based systems fail to incorporate interest-based information when identifying promotional messages that are communicated to the mobile communication device.
- a promotional message may impose a feeling of “spam” to the user. For example, a vegetarian may not be interested in a promotional message such as an advertisement for a steak-house merely because the vegetarian is nearby the steak-house.
- Conventional systems also fail to analyze and/or provide metrics on the effects of distance on a promotional campaign.
- the distance between a mobile communication device and a physical location of an entity such as a brick-and-mortar store of a retailer may affect success rates of a promotional campaign.
- a promotional message communicated to a mobile communication device may be more effective when the mobile communication device is closer to a physical location than when the device is farther from the physical location.
- different types of promotional messages may be more effective than other types of promotional messages when the mobile communication device is closer to a physical location than when the device is farther from the physical location.
- Various embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed to an apparatus and method for transferring promotional messages to a mobile communication device.
- a promotional message is generated for display on a mobile communication device.
- the promotional message is associated with an entity having a physical location.
- the promotional message comprises a plurality of different types of content each associated with a different distance between the mobile communication device and a physical location of the entity.
- the generated promotional message is thereafter stored in a memory.
- a controller selects and transfers the promotional message to the mobile communication device responsive to a detected distance between the mobile communication device and the physical location.
- the transferred promotional message displays, on the device, a selected one of the different types of content corresponding to the detected distance.

- system 100 may include, but is not limited to, a promotional message serving system 110 , a metrics analysis system 120 , a mobile communication device 102 (illustrated in FIG. 1 as a plurality of mobile devices 102 A, 102 B, 102 N), and a client device 104 (illustrated in FIG. 1 as client devices 104 A, 104 B, 104 N).
- promotional message serving system 110 may be coupled to one another via a network 106 .
- Network 106 may include a Local Area Network, a Wide Area Network, a cellular communications network, a Public Switched Telephone Network, and/or other network or combination of networks.
- promotional message serving system 110 may receive a request associated with mobile communication device 102 .
- the request includes a request for a promotional message to be delivered to mobile communication device 102 .
- the request is associated with a “pull” request where mobile communication device 102 requests information.
- the request may include or otherwise originate from the pull request such that results from the pull request can include the promotional content.
- the pull request may include, but is not limited to, keyword search terms for conducting an online search, a request for promotional messages from an application executing on mobile communication device 102 , and/or other request for information originating from mobile communication device 102 .
- a user of mobile communication device 102 may be near a shopping district and enter a keyword search term “jeans” in order to find retailers that sell jeans.
- the pull request may be associated with a location-based application executing on mobile communication device 102 .
- the location-based application when executed by mobile communication device 102 may, for example, find nearby points of interest.
- the request may include or originate from the pull request (such as the search request or the location-based application request) to cause one or more promotional messages to be displayed with the results of the pull request.
- the request is associated with a “push” request where information is communicated to mobile communication device 102 based on predefined settings.
- the push request may include a subscription to one or more promotional messages of an entity such as a clothing retailer.
- the subscription may, for example, include pushing to mobile communication device 102 promotional messages that: indicate sales events, include coupons, or otherwise conveys promotional messages.
- promotional message serving system 110 may determine a location of mobile communication device 102 and at least one potential interest of a user of mobile communication device 102 .
- the location is determined based on location-based information.
- the at least one potential interest of the user is determined based on interest-based information.
- the location may be directly determined based on the location-based information.
- the location-based information may include, but is not limited to, latitude and longitude coordinates.
- the location may be determined based on an approximation based on the location-based information.
- the location-based information may include, but is not limited to, an identifier that identifies a cellular tower in communication with mobile communication device 102 . The range and/or location of the cellular tower may be known so that an approximate location of mobile communication device 102 may be determined.
- the location-based information may include, but is not limited to, Global Positioning System (GPS) information, Wireless Local Area Network information such as WiFi information, cellular tower information, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, prior keyword search information (which may suggest a location), map application information (such as a geographic map or directions displayed at mobile communication device 102 ), and/or other information from which the location may be determined.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- Wireless Local Area Network information such as WiFi information
- cellular tower information such as GSM
- IP Internet Protocol
- prior keyword search information which may suggest a location
- map application information such as a geographic map or directions displayed at mobile communication device 102
- other information from which the location may be determined may include, but is not limited to, Global Positioning System (GPS) information, Wireless Local Area Network information such as WiFi information, cellular tower information, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, prior keyword search information (which may suggest a location), map application information (such as a geographic map or directions displayed at mobile communication device 102 ), and/or other information from which the location may
- the location may be determined based on a hierarchical ranking of location-based information based on reliability, accuracy, precision, and/or other performance metric. For example, a first location-based information may be more reliable, accurate, precise, or otherwise more effective for determining the location than a second location-based information. When the first location-based information is not available, the second location-based information may be used. A third location-based information may be used when the second location-based information is not available, and so-on. In some implementations of the disclosure, when the user of mobile communication device 102 grants permission to communicate the location-based information, the granted location-based information may be hierarchically higher than (i.e., preferentially used over) other location-based information.
- interest-based information may include actions or other behavior of the user of mobile communication device 102 that potentially indicates content that is interesting to the user. In other words, actions or behavior of the user may indicate interests of the user.
- interest-based information may include, but is not limited to, one or more keywords of a search, prior selections of promotional messages (i.e., promotional messages and/or types, such as coupons, advertisements, etc., of promotional messages that the user has previously selected), a history of web pages visited by the user, and/or other information that may indicate one or more interests of the user.
- promotional message serving system 110 may determine that the user is potentially interested in astronomy. Based on a history of user selections of promotional messages that advertise shoe specials, for example, promotional message serving system 110 may determine that the user is potentially interested in shoes (or more generally, that the user is interested in shopping). Based on a history of user web page visits to sports scores, for example, promotional message serving system 110 may determine that the user is potentially interested in sports. Thus, based on interest-based information, potential interests of the user may be determined.
- selecting or “selection of”promotional messages includes, but is not limited to, clicking with a finger, a stylus, or other object; shaking or tapping mobile communication device 102 ; uttering a verbal command; and/or taking any other action in relation to mobile communication device 102 to indicate a selection of a promotional message.
- the interest-based information may be stored at mobile communication device 102 (and subsequently communicated to promotional message serving system 110 ), at promotional message serving system 110 , and/or other location accessible by promotional message serving system 110 to identify an appropriate promotional message.
- promotional message serving system 110 and/or mobile communication device 102 may store or otherwise have access to a user profile that identifies the user and includes the interest-based information of the user.
- promotional message serving system 110 may identify, based on the location of mobile communication device 102 and the at least one potential interest of the user, a promotional message from among a plurality of promotional messages.
- the plurality of promotional messages is included within a queue of promotional messages that are to be communicated via a promotional or advertising network. Because the promotional message is identified based on a combination of the location of the user (as determined from the location of mobile communication device 102 ) and a potential interest of the user, the identified promotional message may have a likelihood of being selected by the user that is greater than a promotional message identified based on only one of the location or the interest of the user.
- a user may, for example, enter a search key word “shopping” using mobile communication device 102 .
- promotional message serving system 110 may identify a particular promotional message that indicates a special on shoes from a shoe store that is within close proximity to (i.e., a specified distance from) the user. In this manner, both the interest of the user and the location of the user is used to identify the particular promotional message.
- conventional systems may communicate a promotional message for fishing gear merely because a fishing goods store is nearby even though the user has not indicated interest in such gear. In these conventional systems, the promotional message may have a feeling of “spam” to the user.
- promotional message serving system 110 may communicate the promotional message to be displayed at mobile communication device 102 . In some implementations of the disclosure, promotional message serving system 110 may communicate the identified promotional message to a third party that subsequently communicates the promotional message to mobile communication device 102 . In some implementations of the disclosure, promotional message serving system 110 may communicate the identified promotional message to mobile communication device 102 .
- promotional message serving system 110 may generate, based on the location and the at least one potential interest, a plurality of predictions each corresponding to one of a plurality of promotional messages. Each prediction may indicate a probability that a corresponding promotional message will be selected by a user of mobile communication device 102 .
- the location of mobile device 102 and the interest of the user may affect the probability that a promotional message will be selected. For example, a first promotional message having a higher probability of being selected than a second promotional message may be identified to be delivered or communicated to mobile communication device 102 instead of the second promotional message.
- promotional message serving system 110 may identify a promotional message based on the predictions. In other words, promotional message serving system 110 may identify promotional messages that are more likely to be selected by the user than other promotional messages based on the location and user interests.
- promotional message serving system 110 may determine, based on the location of mobile communication device 102 , a distance between mobile communication device 102 and a physical location of an entity associated with the promotional message. In these implementations, a prediction corresponding to the promotional message may be based on the distance and the interests of the user. For example, at least some of the plurality of promotional messages (such as the messages in the queue of promotional messages) may be associated with or otherwise originate from an entity such as a retailer that operates a physical location such as a retail store. In some implementations of the disclosure, promotional message serving system 110 may determine a distance between mobile communication device 102 and the physical location of the entity.
- the probability that the user will select a particular promotional message may increase as the user gets closer to the physical location of the entity.
- promotional message serving system 110 may use the distance between mobile communication device 102 and the physical location of the entity when determining the prediction corresponding to the promotional message from the entity.
- a first promotional message may be associated with or otherwise originate from a first entity having a physical location that has a first distance from the user (i.e., mobile communication device 102 ).
- a second promotional message may be associated with or otherwise originate from a second entity having a physical location that has a second distance from the user that is greater than the first distance.
- a third promotional message may be associated with or otherwise originate from a third entity such as an Internet-only retailer that has no physical locations.
- promotional message serving system 110 may determine a higher prob ability of being selected by the user for the first promotional message than the second promotional message and a higher probability of being selected by the user for the second promotional message than the third promotional message.
- the prediction may be based on a balancing of distance/location and interest-based factors.
- each of the plurality of promotional messages may be associated with a bid.
- the bid may include a value or other indication that indicates a dollar or other currency amount that an originator, such as an advertiser, of a promotional message is willing to pay to have the promotional message displayed in the advertising network to which promotional message serving system 110 has access.
- promotional message serving system 110 may receive or otherwise obtain the bid.
- promotional message serving system 110 may determine an expected revenue return value based on the bid value and the prediction corresponding to the promotional message and may identify a promotional message based on the expected revenue return value.
- promotional message serving system 110 may identify promotional messages in a manner that is expected to maximize fees from entities such as advertisers that wish to promote their goods and/or services via promotional messages.
- E is the expected revenue return value (obtained by the product of p and b);
- p is the probability that the promotional message will be selected by the user;
- b is the bid.
- the expected revenue return value may be based on a combination of the prediction/probability of being selected (which itself may be based on the location and the interest of the user) and the bid.
- the bid may be sufficiently high to overcome a prediction with a low probability and vice versa.
- x may include, for example, distance from physical location, interest-based information, historical performance of promotional messages (such as whether a promotional message was selected by the user), and/or other predictive factors described below. Based on one or more of the predictive factors, a probability that a promotional message will be selected by the user may be generated.
- promotional message serving system 110 may associate different bids of a promotional message for different distances.
- an entity such as an advertiser may be willing to pay more for a promotional message delivered to the user via mobile communication device 102 when the user is at a closer distance from a physical location than a farther distance.
- the entity may submit—and promotional message serving system 110 may receive—different bids for different distances.
- content of the promotional message is changed as a function of the distance.
- promotional message serving system 110 may cause different content of the promotional message to be communicated to mobile communication device 102 based on the distance between mobile communication device 102 and a physical location of an entity associated with the promotional message.
- an entity such as an advertiser may choose to display different content based on different distances from a physical location of the entity.
- the content may include, but is not limited to, walking directions to the physical location, an input to make reservations, an input to search product availability, one or more images associated with the physical location, one or more promotional offers, a restaurant menu, a business update, a phone number call-to-action, an ad check-in, one or more upcoming events, and/or other promotional content.
- promotional message serving system 110 may cause coupons to be delivered to mobile communication device 102 .
- promotional message serving system 110 may cause directions to be delivered to mobile communication device 102 .
- different permutations of different content at different distances may be used. The different permutations may be specified by the entity and/or be determined by promotional message serving system 110 .
- the distance is associated with accuracy information that indicates an accuracy of the distance.
- the prediction corresponding to the promotional message may be based on the accuracy information.
- promotional message serving system 110 may increase or decrease the probability that the user will be interested in a promotional message based on the accuracy of the location-based information used to determine the location of mobile communication device 102 .
- promotional message serving system 110 may determine a weight factor for at least one of the distance and the interest-based information. In these implementations, the plurality of predictions is based on the determined weight factor. The weight factor may increase or decrease a weight given to the distance and/or interest-based information when generating a prediction of the probability that a user will be interested in a promotional message. In some implementations of the disclosure, the weight factor is used to emphasize more important or otherwise more predictive factors. For example, the location of mobile communication device 102 may be more heavily weighted than a history of web page visits. In this non-limiting example, promotional message serving system 110 may generate a prediction that relies more on the location of mobile communication device 102 than the history of web page visits. In this manner, different (location and interest) variables may be weighted differently so that the corresponding effect of each variable on the overall predication may be controlled.
- promotional message serving system 110 may receive an indication that the promotional message was selected at mobile communication device 102 and may generate a plurality of subsequent predictions based on the indication. In other words, one or more user actions associated with mobile communication device 102 may be collected for subsequent analysis and predictions. Thus, the predictions generated by promotional message serving system 110 may change over time based on interest-based information.
- the predictions are based on logistic regression analysis. For example, a prediction that a particular promotional message will be selected by the user may be generated. The prediction may be based on a variety of predictive factors such as different types of user-based interest described herein, distance from physical locations, and/or other factors used to predict whether the particular promotional message will be selected. One or more predictive factors may be assessed according to a click-through rate or other indication that the user selected the particular promotional message.
- future predictions generated by promotional message serving system 110 may be based on a weighting of the predictive factors relative to one another based on whether the particular promotional message was selected by the user.
- more important predictive factors i.e., better predictors
- more important predictive factors may affect the prediction outcome to a greater degree than less important predictive factors. For example, if smaller distances between a user (measured via mobile communication device 102 ) and a physical location is correlated with higher click-through rates than larger distances, then distance information may be weighted accordingly so that it is a relatively important predictive factor.
- a history of prior promotional message selections by the user is a weak predictor of future selections by the user, then the history of the particular user may be assigned a lower weight. By fine-tuning the weights of these and other predictive factors, predictions that adapt to observed behavior may be achieved.
- weighting of the predictive factors may be fine-tuned in this manner until an acceptable level of accuracy (such as a particular click-through rate) is achieved or otherwise until fine-tuning is no longer necessary.
- the predictive factors may be fine-tuned indefinitely as data becomes available.
- promotional message serving system 110 may include a processor 112 , a memory 114 , and/or other components that facilitate the functions of promotional message serving system 110 described herein.
- processor 112 includes one or more processors configured to perform various functions of promotional message serving system 110 .
- memory 114 includes one or more tangible (i.e., non-transitory) computer readable media. Memory 114 may include one or more instructions that when executed by processor 112 configures processor 112 to perform the functions of promotional message serving system 110 .
- metrics analysis system 120 may generate one or more reports that illustrate effectiveness of location-based promotional messages delivered to mobile communication devices 102 .
- a promotional message may be “effective” or otherwise successful based on whether the promotional message increases virtual accesses (such as web page visits) to a virtual location such as a web page, enhances virtual access duration, enhances click-through-rates (CTRs), and/or otherwise causes increased sales or increased exposure of goods/services.

- a user's web browsing history (using the mobile communication device and/or other device) may be combined with the location of the user's mobile communication device to identify promotional messages to be communicated to the user's mobile communication device.
- the potential interest may based on types (i.e., content) of promotional messages.
- types i.e., content
- process 200 may determine both the location of the user and potential interests (at various levels of specificity and types) of the user.
- process 200 may determine, based on the location of the mobile communication device and the at least one potential interest, predictions each corresponding to a promotional message. Each prediction may indicate a probability that a corresponding promotional message will be selected by a user of the mobile communication device. In other words, using both the location of the user (as measured by the location of the mobile communication device) and the interest of the user, process 200 may identify a likelihood that a promotional message will be selected by the user. In the foregoing example, a promotional message from a sporting goods retailer may be more likely to be selected by the user than a promotional message from a bakery. Also in the foregoing example, a promotional message from a sporting goods retailer that has a store nearby the user may be more likely to be selected by the user than a sporting goods retailer that has a store that is far from the user.
- process 200 may identify a promotional message from among the plurality of promotional messages based on the plurality of predictions. In other words, based on the probability or likelihood of being selected by the user, process 200 may identify one or more promotional messages. For example, process 200 may identify a promotional message associated with the sporting goods retailer that has a store nearby the user. In an operation 210 , process 200 may communicate the promotional message to be displayed at the mobile communication device.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 300 of reporting effectiveness of location-based promotional messages delivered to mobile communication devices, according to various implementations of the disclosure.
- process 300 may receive distance information that indicates a distance between a mobile communication device (such as mobile communication device 102 ) and a physical location of an entity. For example, a user of the mobile communication device may be within a distance such as 500 meters of a physical location such as a store of an entity such as a retailer.
- Process 300 may receive distance information (such as a location of the mobile communication and/or location of the physical location).
- process 300 may receive virtual information that indicates a virtual access by the mobile communication device to a virtual location of the entity. For example, a user of the mobile communication device may select a location-based promotional message and/or visit a web page of the entity. The virtual information may indicate the selection and/or the visit. In this manner, process 300 may receive information that the user via the mobile communication device has selected or otherwise accessed information related to the entity associated with the location-based promotional message.
- process 300 may generate an association between the distance information and the virtual information. In other words, process 300 may determine a correlation between the location of the mobile communication device and the virtual access. As would be appreciated, process 300 may perform operations 302 , 304 , and 306 in one or more operations. For example, process 300 may receive an association of the distance and the virtual access in a single operation (or in multiple operations as described).
- process 300 may determine, based on the association, a distance between the physical location and the mobile communication device when the mobile communication device accessed the virtual location. In other words, process 300 may determine the distance between the mobile communication device and the physical location of the entity when the device made the virtual access to the virtual location of the entity.
- process 300 may generate a report that includes at least a portion of the distance information and at least a portion of the virtual information based on the determined distance from the physical location.
- process 300 may provide metrics that includes the location of the mobile communication device and information related to the virtual access so that a viewer of the report may determine the effect of distance on promotional messages communicated to the mobile communication device.

Abstract
Description
E=pxb (1)
In equation (1): E is the expected revenue return value (obtained by the product of p and b); p is the probability that the promotional message will be selected by the user; and b is the bid. Thus, in some implementations, the expected revenue return value may be based on a combination of the prediction/probability of being selected (which itself may be based on the location and the interest of the user) and the bid. In these implementations, the bid may be sufficiently high to overcome a prediction with a low probability and vice versa.
p=f(x) (2)
In equation (2), x may include, for example, distance from physical location, interest-based information, historical performance of promotional messages (such as whether a promotional message was selected by the user), and/or other predictive factors described below. Based on one or more of the predictive factors, a probability that a promotional message will be selected by the user may be generated.
b=g(d) (3)
In other words, promotional
