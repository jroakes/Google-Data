Abstract
A system and machine-implemented method for providing a visual cue of overscrolling displayed content on an electronic device. When the end of a scrollable page or content has been reached, the visual cue corresponds to the user's physical scrolling input. The content in the window is effectively attached to the window so that when the end of the content is reached in one direction, the window containing the content is pulled in the same scrolling direction. The pulling in the scrolling direction occurs in a logarithmically decreasing manner, providing a tactile-like visual effect that the outer frame of the window is resisting the attempt to scroll further in the scrolling direction. The visual resistance effect may include squishing or stretching portions of the window without distorting the content within the window.

Detailed description of the invention
In the description that lower section purposes of illustration are the various configurations as subject technology, detailed description of the invention is not intended to represent that can realize only having of this subject technology configures. Additional figure is incorporated in this and constitutes a part for detailed description of the invention. Detailed description of the invention includes the detail of the purpose for providing the deep understanding to subject technology. But, subject technology is not restricted to detail described herein and can be put into practice when not having these details, and this is evident from and significantly for a person skilled in the art. In some instances, structure and assembly are shown for avoiding the concept of fuzzy subject technology in block diagram form.
As noted above, user attempts excessively rolling in one direction webpage or the content end through content. Such as, user can navigate to news website rolling news content until arriving the last News Stories being in bottom webpage. User can continue to roll to search more content in the same direction, has had arrived at bottom webpage without recognizing, only because content keeps static state when user excessively rolls in the same direction. Webpage or content can have starting point in page top, have end bottom the page, have ultra-left point on the page left side and have rightest point on the right of the page. User can upwards, downwards, attempt excessively rolling webpage or content through end in any one in direction to the left or to the right.
When excessively rolling the end of webpage or content in particular directions, a problem of this static state display of content is that user may be not easily seen and has arrived at content end. Such as, when user is when reading the content being displayed on company web page, user is likely to the company web page scrolling down through on the electronic equipment being displayed on user lentamente. But, if user reaches the bottom of company web page and continues to attempt in company web page and scroll down through, user is likely to be not easy to notice the change slowly moved up until no longer moving from web page contents. Further, the static state display of web page contents does not provide corresponding the visually indicating of amount of the excessive scrolling gesture with user. Therefore, user may continue to excessively roll webpage through end, tries see additional web pages content and become in this process to baffle.
The disclosure theme provides display user and has begun to excessively roll in particular directions the visual cues of webpage or content. One detects and excessively rolls input, and visual cues just can start, and continues along with excessively rolling input, and visual cues can strengthen at least one of visual movement of properties window. Visual movement can provide a user with the visual experience of the class sense of touch corresponding with the scrolling gesture of user. Such as, user can roll the article based on web until mobile computer mouse on the direction of the beginning of article. After the beginning having arrived at article, mouse is moved further constantly in the same direction in response to user, show a part of browser window of article and illustrate that the website tools hurdle opening browser label can shift further, and illustrate that a part of browser window of window control toolbar can keep fixing, therefore upwardly enter to control toolbar by content and label tool hurdle. Therefore, the class sense of touch visual impression of the trial excessively rolling content that the visual cues extruding content and label tool hurdle in browser window can provide browser window refusing user.
Fig. 1 illustrates the example of the browser window 200 being shown on panel computer 106. Browser window 200 includes window control portion 230, and described window control portion 230 has the toolbar with browser window control 232 (such as, close, minimize, maximize). Browser window 200 also includes browser control portion 240, and described browser control portion 240 has and indicates when front opening is based on the label 210,212,214 of tag activity. In the example of fig. 1, label 210 and 212 indicates the front opening of user or initiation browser movable (such as, search, guidance to website, internet, applications). Label 214 indicates youngest/current browser movable, and it is indicated by content 224 further in the content portion 250 of browser window 200. Such as, the homepage that label 214 is the internet hunt of news website and content 224 is news website. Label 210 and 212 also has the content 220 and 222 of correspondence, and when content 224 is shown, described content 220 and 222 is hidden. If user selects label 220 or 222, then shown and content 224 are hidden by corresponding content 220 or 222.
Content 224 can in content portion 250 scroll-up/down. Such as, illustrating in FIG, content 224 is the homepage of news website. The various types of other multiple labels starting to include news website mark and instruction news item of content 224. Webpage is to continue the various News Stories on the window being displayed on screen further downward so that user must scroll down through to read other story in the news stream of content 224. Distance between top and the top frame 202 of browser window 200 of label 210,212,214 is shown as height h1 in FIG.
Fig. 2 illustrates the example of browser window 200, and wherein user's trial rolls the content 224 beginning (such as, excessively rolling) through content 224 further up. Such as, user can place a finger on and pull down in touch screen displays and on screen to attempt being rolled into other content 224 over the display further up. Here, panel computer 106 can be configured as rolling in the opposite direction when finger is pulled on touch screen so that when finger is pulled downwardly and takes, the viewpoint in content 224 is scrolled up and content 224 shifts downwards. Alternately, panel computer 106 can be configured to scroll up in the side identical with finger motion, in order to when finger is pulled downwardly on screen and takes, the viewpoint in content 224 is scrolled down through so that content 224 upward displacement. Additionally, roll the finger or object (such as, pencil), the movement of mouse, keypad arrow on keyboard that input can be across touch screen or Trackpad is pulled, etc.
As illustrated in fig. 2, when user excessively scrolls through beginning or the top of content 224, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 shift downwards in browser window 200. Here, label 210,212,214 and content 224 all in browser window 200 displacement downwards and be held in place (such as, static) with the window control portion 230 of window control 232. Distance between top and the top frame 202 of browser window 200 of label 210,212,214 is shown as height h2 in fig. 2, and its camber h2 is more than height h1. Therefore, window control portion 230 launches (such as, stretching) and content portion 250 to be compressed in the bottom frame 204 of browser window 200. Content 224 shown in Fig. 2 and label 210,212,214 are not twisted, and be instead shifted down so that multiple bottom pixel row of content 224 are blocked or covered by bottom frame 204.
The compression in the stretching in window control portion 230, the displacement in browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 can on the basis of logarithmic decrease or be functionally done. Such as, when user starts the beginning excessively scrolling through content 224 in an upward direction first time, the displacement downwards in browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 can be the most significant, and excessively rolling lasting in an upward direction causes browser control portion 240 to shift downwards slight increment with content portion 250 until browser control portion 240 stops displacement downwards together with content portion 250. Browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 shift downwards, this logarithmic decrease in stretch to window control portion 230 and compressed content portion 250 provides the class sense of touch visual cues that browser window 200 is refusing the trial excessively rolling content 224 of user.
The amount of the amount stretched regardless of window control portion 230 and content portion 250 compression, when top excessively rolls input stopping (such as, user lifts finger or stops mobile mouse), the identical amount that browser control portion 240 shifts downwards with browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 with content portion 250 back upward displacement. Therefore, window control portion 230, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 close suddenly or spring back to the original size that the excessive rolling process in top starts to show. Here, window control portion 230, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 spring back to the positions and dimensions shown in Fig. 1, and wherein, the distance between top and the top frame 202 of browser window 200 of label 210,212,214 is again height h1.
Fig. 3 and 4 illustrate the excessive rolling process on other (such as, bottom) ends of news web page or content 224. Distance between label 210,212,214 top and the top frame 202 of browser window 200 is height h1 as shown in Figure 3. As when discussed above when the beginning of content 224, when when the end of content 224, window control portion 230, browser control portion 240 can have similar size with content portion 250. The end of content 224 can include news item last on news home and advertisement and the link to other regions of news website.
Fig. 4 illustrates the example of browser window 200, and wherein user attempts excessively rolling content 224 further downward through the ending of content 224 or bottom. When user excessively scrolls through the ending of content 224, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 upward displacement in browser window 200. Here, label 210,212,214 and content 224 all in browser window 200 upward displacement and control the window control portion 230 of 232 with browser window and keep fixing. Distance between top and the top frame 202 of browser window 200 of label 210,212,214 is shown as height h3 in the diagram, and its camber h3 is less than height h1. Therefore, window control portion 230 is compacted (such as, shrink) and browser control portion 240 is moved among window control portion 230 at the bottom position excessively rolled. Content 224 shown in Fig. 4 and label 210,212,214 are not twisted, and instead by upward displacement to top frame 202. Here, content portion 250 can be controlled portion 240 by upward displacement more than browser, and wherein, the top pixel line number of content 224 is blocked or is covered along (such as, the bottom sides edge on label tool hurdle) by the bottom sides of label 214.
As further illustrated in Figure 4, bottom frame 204 is all right upward displacement in the excessive rolling process in bottom, shrinks the size of browser window 200. As shown in Figure 3, the distance between top frame 202 and bottom frame 204 is shown as height h4. As shown in Figure 4, the distance between top frame 202 and bottom frame 204 reduces and is shown as height h5. Alternately, in order to by bottom frame 204 upward displacement in the excessive rolling process in bottom, bottom frame 204 can keep fixing and along with browser control portion 240 is by upward displacement to window control portion 230 in position, browser control portion 240, content portion 250 or both can launch.
Be similar in the excessive rolling process in top above discuss, in the excessive rolling process in bottom, any or whole displacement of browser control portion 240, content portion 250 and bottom frame 204 can be done on the basis of logarithmic decrease. Such as, the displacement in browser control portion 240 can be done on the basis of the first logarithmic decrease, and the displacement in content portion 250 can be done on the basis of the second logarithmic decrease, thus explaining browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 each how many gap by upward displacement. Therefore, browser control portion 240, content portion 250 and bottom frame 204 can each with different rates upward displacements, and wherein, any or all rate of shift can be on the basis of logarithmic decrease. On the other hand, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 can each using phase same rate upward displacements and may occur in which as a part upward displacement being integrated together.
No matter browser control portion 240 compresses the amount into window control portion 230, when bottom excessively roll input stop time, browser control portion 240 shifts the amount identical with browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 upward displacement back down with content portion 250. Therefore, window control portion 230, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 close suddenly or spring back to the original size that bottom excessively rolling process starts to show. Here, window control portion 230, browser control portion 240 and content portion 250 spring back to the positions and dimensions shown in Fig. 3, and wherein, the distance between top and the top frame 202 of label 210,212,214 is again height h1. If additionally, bottom frame 204 is by upward displacement, then, after bottom excessively rolls input stopping, bottom frame 204 also rebounds. Therefore, browser window 200 returns to bottom and excessively rolls the size that input is had by browser window 200 before reception, and wherein, the distance between top frame 202 and bottom frame 204 is again height h4.
Fig. 5 examples shown process 500, described instantiation procedure 500 provides the visual cues excessively rolling shown content. When the window with scrollable content is shown on an electronic device, process 500 starts from step 502. Scrollable content has beginning end (such as, the top of content) and terminates end (such as, the bottom of content). Content can also is that in this case, scrollable content also will have most left-end point and the rightest end from while rotatable to another side. Scrollable content can be from the webpage of website, article, map, etc. In step 504, electronic equipment determines that scrollable content is at end. For example, it may be determined that shown content is being rolled into beginning or the top of scrollable content. In step 506, the user rolling content in a first direction inputs the end of the determination that have passed through scrollable content. Such as, user tries to roll content further across the beginning of scrollable content or top, or before the beginning or top of scrollable content.
In step 508, electronic equipment display visual cues, described visual cues is that user tries to exceed the end of scrollable content by excessively rolling scrollable content. Visual cues is the class sense of touch visual display of browser window, and it is corresponding to the physical scroll gesture of user or action. Such as, the top of browser window or window control portion have window control (such as, close, minimize, maximize) browser window toolbar, it is in browser control portion (such as, label, navigation bar) and content portion (such as, web page contents) be likely to be dependent on the direction of excessive scroll actions and move to static tool hurdle or keep static state during away from static tool hurdle. The movement of label and/or content can provide window be extruded (such as, being compressed) or stretch the eye impression of (such as, launching). Additionally, the frame of the outer perimeter of a part or browser window can also move during excessive rolling process, thus compressing or launching whole browser window.
When electronic equipment shows the second visual cues, process ends at step 510, and described second visual cues illustrates the movement on other direction of browser control portion and content portion, and the input that excessively rolls indicating user stops. Second visual cues can be the reversion of First look prompting so that the frame of browser control portion and content portion and/or browser window is back displaced to the home position before excessive rolling process starts. Such as, during excessive rolling process browser control portion and content portion can upward displacement to window control portion, and spring back to browser control portion and the content portion position at place before upward displacement. Second visual cues can pass through excessively to roll the stopping of input or mobile be triggered. Such as, after seeing browser window extruding, user can cease attempt to roll in a first direction so that electronic equipment no longer receives rolling input, and then the label of browser window and content are closed suddenly or spring back to the top of content.
Visual cues can include user and try excessively to roll other visions of content and present. Such as, visual cues can include changing over a part for browser window a kind of color, and wherein said color is based on the color of particular row in scrollable content (such as, first or last pixel column). In step 508, when excessively rolling at the top of content, when moving away from static tool hurdle along with the browser control portion of browser window and content portion, window control portion can keep the area change color the being unfolded color with the top pixel row of matching content in static and content portion. In step 510, browser control portion and content portion spring back to pre-excessively scrolling position and the zones vanishes of new colouring is compressed in the region that is unfolded along with content portion. Similarly, when excessively rolling in the bottom of content, the content portion new region in the content portion that bottom up shifts and bottom of window moves into the visual field of window changes the color color with the bottom pixel row of matching content. Additionally, when content portion springs back to pre-excessively scrolling position, color disappears. Therefore, depending on excessive rotating direction, color disappears at the top of browser window or bottom visual and trails. And, rebound when excessively rolling content portion when input stops, causing browser window change the zones vanishes of color or become hiding.
Such as another example, visual cues can include the part changing browser window and design with the wallpaper mating display. Such as, the process of the similar discussed above color changing browser window region, the reformed region of browser window is (such as, the content portion being unfolded or the new region in content portion) can illustrate that wallpaper background, described wallpaper background instead of the wallpaper design illustrated on particular color coupling display.
Or in another example, visual cues can include by outwardly or inwardly shifting the compression of one or more browser window frame or launching whole browser window. Such as, top frame can by upward displacement, and bottom frame can be shifted down or both, therefore launches browser window extremely bigger size. Along with browser window launches, the content in browser window is also deployable so that same content is shown, but with bigger form. Similarly, top frame can be shifted down, bottom frame can by upward displacement or both, therefore shrink or compression browser window be to less size. Along with browser window shrinks, the content in browser window is also collapsible so that same content is shown, but with less form. Additionally, such as, left frame and left frame also can outwardly or inwardly be shifted. When excessively rolling input and stopping, browser window also can rebound from state that is that be unfolded or that compressed.
