- the displays can also help to overcome the input interface size limitation on mobile devices by displaying virtual input devices, such as keyboards.
- One technology used for micro-projection is laser scanning, in which red, green and blue laser beams are scanned across a surface to form a full color image. To provide the user of the device with optimum mobility and ease of use, these devices must be small in size, lightweight, and battery powered. However, the requirements necessary to achieve portability result in severe constraints on space, weight, and power dissipation, and increase the amount of heat energy generated by the components of the portable device.
- the conventional solutions for minimizing power consumption in laser-scanned projection require an increase in peak laser output power and peak laser drive current.
- This increase in laser drive current increases the generation of radio frequency (RF) noise.
- RF radio frequency
- the scanning of the projector laser beam is achieved by one or two mirrors that reflect the beam and move in such a way as to create a raster pattern on a screen.
- the raster is created by a horizontal fast movement and a slower vertical movement.
- the vertical movement is linear, creating on the screen a spot that moves at constant velocity.
- the mirror creating the horizontal movement oscillates in a resonance mode which enables a much faster movement of the spot on the screen.
- the penalty of resonance movement is that the mirror moves as a harmonic oscillator and, consequently, the spot velocity is sinusoidal. This requires a higher light output from the lasers during the time when the mirror moves faster.
- the higher current required for driving the lasers during this time can generate higher RF noise. Therefore, there is a need to make the speed of the horizontal movement of the mirror essentially constant, to minimize the generation of excessive RF noise.

Abstract
Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- The present invention relates to image projection systems, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for reducing RF noise generation or required laser output in an image projection system.
- 2. Introduction
- A portable projector or micro-projector can provide an image larger than the hosting projecting device dimension. Such displays have the potential to overcome the display size limitation on mobile devices and can be used to display documents and images, for example. The displays can also help to overcome the input interface size limitation on mobile devices by displaying virtual input devices, such as keyboards. One technology used for micro-projection is laser scanning, in which red, green and blue laser beams are scanned across a surface to form a full color image. To provide the user of the device with optimum mobility and ease of use, these devices must be small in size, lightweight, and battery powered. However, the requirements necessary to achieve portability result in severe constraints on space, weight, and power dissipation, and increase the amount of heat energy generated by the components of the portable device.
- In order to accommodate the brightness and image quality requirements, the conventional solutions for minimizing power consumption in laser-scanned projection require an increase in peak laser output power and peak laser drive current. This increase in laser drive current increases the generation of radio frequency (RF) noise. The effects of this additional RF noise could be particularly significant if the projector is integrated within a portable phone. The noise could exacerbate the problem of desense, or loss of receiver sensitivity, leading to a significant degradation of radio performance.
- For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for reducing peak laser output power and associated RF noise generation in laser-scanned projection.
- The scanning of the projector laser beam is achieved by one or two mirrors that reflect the beam and move in such a way as to create a raster pattern on a screen. The raster is created by a horizontal fast movement and a slower vertical movement. The vertical movement is linear, creating on the screen a spot that moves at constant velocity. The mirror creating the horizontal movement oscillates in a resonance mode which enables a much faster movement of the spot on the screen. The penalty of resonance movement is that the mirror moves as a harmonic oscillator and, consequently, the spot velocity is sinusoidal. This requires a higher light output from the lasers during the time when the mirror moves faster. The higher current required for driving the lasers during this time can generate higher RF noise. Therefore, there is a need to make the speed of the horizontal movement of the mirror essentially constant, to minimize the generation of excessive RF noise.
- The patent to Barnea (U.S. Pat. No. 7,042,613) describes a method of linearizing the movement of the mirror consisting in a bouncing mechanism that reverses the movement at the end of its range. This mechanical solution complicates considerably the construction of the mirror.
- The patent to Bridgelall (U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,269) describes an optical scanner for reading two-dimensional indicia such as bar code symbols and the like and includes a scan element arranged to create a two-dimensional raster pattern which may be scanned across the indicia to be read. In order to improve linearity of response in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the direction of the scan lines, the scan element is driven in that direction by a modified triangular waveform in which the amplitude and/or the phase of at least one of the harmonics has been altered. However, this prior art only applies linearization orthogonal to the fast scanning direction and not parallel to the fast scanning direction. And this prior art is only applied to improve the linearity of response within a two-dimensional raster patter across indicia to be read, and not to minimize RF noise generation associated with image projection near high RF sensitivity communications equipment.
- It is the object of this invention to provide a means of reducing the laser peak power, peak laser drive current, and generated RF noise by improved linearity of the mirror movement.
- A method and apparatus that projects a two-dimensional image is disclosed. The method may include emitting a laser beam, sweeping the laser beam with a first scan mirror along a first scan direction to form a scan line on the projection surface, and sweeping the scan line with a second scan mirror along a second scan direction generally orthogonal to the first scan direction to form a raster pattern of scan lines on the projection surface. The scanner for the first scan mirror is driven with a stimulus waveform, wherein the stimulus waveform has a fundamental frequency that is substantially equal to the resonance frequency of the scanner but also contains harmonics to achieve a nearly constant velocity of the laser beam spot during its scan across the projection surface. The stimulus thereby reduces peak laser output power and corresponding noise generation while maintaining image brightness and image quality.

FIG. 2 shows a more detailed exemplary block diagram of animage projection arrangement 200 which may implement one or more modules or functions of the laser power monitoring process. Three lasers 225, 230, 235 produce laser beams of different colors—red, blue and green—respectively. The laser beams are reflected bymirrors screen 280. If more than one laser is powered simultaneously, then the spot on thescreen 280 will have the mixed color of all the actuated lasers. The use of red, blue, and green lasers enables a wide range of colors to be formed. The spot of the desired color is swept in mutually orthogonal directions by the X-mirror 250 and Y-mirror 270. The mirrors are moved by the X-scanner 245 and the Y-scanner 265, respectively. The scanners are controlled by theirrespective drives laser drive 220 is connected to each laser and pulses the lasers (225, 230, 235) on and off to form a bit-mapped image onscreen 280. The color of the bit-mapped image is a function of the lasers that were actuated for each pixel of the image. Hence, the entire image can be colored all red, blue, or green, or any mixture of these colors. In addition, each pixel can be separately provided with a desired color so that the entire image comprises multiple colors. - A light source such as lasers 225, 230, and 235 energized by
laser drive 220 emit a laser beam to a first X-mirror 250 oscillatable by an X-scanner 245 for horizontally moving the laser beam back and forth at a first sweep frequency along a first direction, commonly termed “X-axis” sweeping, and, in turn, to a second Y-mirror 270 oscillatable by a Y-scanner 265 for vertically moving the laser beam up and down at a second sweep frequency along a second direction, commonly termed “Y-axis” sweeping. The first and second directions are mutually orthogonal. The first or horizontal sweep frequency is generally much faster than the second or vertical sweep frequency. Acontrol processor 205 is operative for controlling theX-scanner drive 240 and the Y-scanner drive 260 to insure that the X-mirror 250 and the Y-mirror 270 oscillate at the correct phases. AnX-scanner feedback signal 290 and a Y-scanner feedback signal 295 transmit information about the mirror positions toprocessor 205 that monitors the sweep frequencies of themirrors drives scanner 265 sweeps the spot at the vertical frequency along the Y-direction to form a second scan line. The formation of successive scan lines proceeds in the same manner. In a preferred embodiment, for a display area or aprojection screen 140 the resolution of the displayedimage 160 inFIG. 1 is a function of the raster pixels along the height Y-direction) and pixels along the width X-direction). - The
image 160 is created in the raster pattern by pulsing the lasers 225, 230, 235 on and off at selected times under the control ofprocessor 205, which, in turn, controls thelaser drive 220. The lasers 225-235 produce visible light and are turned on only when a pixel in the desired image is desired to be seen.Input device 210 provides content to be displayed as animage 160. An X-mirror feedback circuit and a Y-mirror feedback circuit (not shown) monitor the sweeps of themirrors drives output signal 290 from the X-mirror feedback circuit is used by thecontrol processor 205 to synchronize the signals to theX-scanner drive 240 and laser drive 220 with the position of the X-mirror 250. - In common practice the electromechanical combination of
X-scanner 245 and X-mirror 250 commonly exhibits a strong electromechanical resonance versus the frequency of the applied electrical stimulus fromX-scanner drive 240. For a fixed amplitude of the applied electrical stimulus fromX-scanner drive 240, the amplitude of the displacement response ofX-mirror 250 is a strong function of the frequency of this applied electrical stimulus, where the maximum amplitude of the displacement response occurs at a resonance frequency ωo. In order to minimize electrical drive power to X-scanner drive 340,X-scanner drive 240 is commonly driven by a sinusoidal waveform at the resonance frequency ωo. While the application of this sinusoidal frequency stimulus at ωo achieves the target amplitude of displacement of the X-scanner 245 and X-mirror 250 with the least applied electrical power, the resultant displacement ofX-mirror 250 becomes substantially sinusoidal in time. Consequently, the velocity of the laser beam that is swept across the projection surface also becomes substantially sinusoidal, exhibiting its highest velocity in the center of the screen, and its lowest velocities near the left and right sides of the screen. This is illustrated graphically bygraph 300 atFIG. 3 , where the spot velocities of both linear 305 and sinusoidal 310 sweeping are plotted versus the relative position on the screen, where the sinusoidal 310 sweep is defined to exhibit that same area over the span of the sweep as the linear sweep. It can be seen inFIG. 3 that the peak sinusoidal velocity is approximately 50% higher than the constant velocity of the linear sweep. In order to maintain a constant spot brightness across each horizontal line despite the sinusoidal velocity variations, the optical power to the lasers also needs to be modulated in a sinusoidal manner, outputting a peak laser power in the center of the screen, and reduced laser power near the left and right sides of the screen. Analyses have shown that the peak laser output power under this sinusoidal variation is approximately 50% higher than the constant laser output power that would be required to produce the same screen brightness if the velocity of the spot across each horizontal scan line were constant. Consequently, the peak drive current to each laser is also 50% higher than the constant drive current that would be required to produce the same screen brightness if the velocity of the spot across each horizontal scan line were constant. Since the radio frequency (RF) noise associated with the laser drive current is proportional to the magnitude of this current, the RF noise is also 50% higher than the RF noise that would be generated for the same screen brightness if the velocity of the spot across each horizontal scan line were constant. This RF signal can interfere with the operation ofelectronic device 100. This noise, additionally, could exacerbate the problem of desense leading to a significant degradation of radio performance functions inelectronic device 100. In general, desense is a loss of receiver sensitvity most often caused by a strong unintended signal that swamps or overloadsportable device 110. Such a strong signal will cause the portable device phone) 110 to become practically non-functional. In such a conditionportable device 110 can hardly respond to any weak signals. RF noise from the increase drive current will increase the potential for desense inportable device 110. - There is a need to linearize the scanning pattern of X-mirror 250 because doing so leads to reduced peak laser power consumption, reduced peak laser drive current, and reduced RF noise. In the preferred embodiment, the linearity in the horizontal direction (x) is improved by driving the X-scanner 245 with a modified triangular waveform stimulus as shown in
FIG. 4 . This stimulus waveform will produce a near-linear response fromX-scanner 245 and a near-linear sweep of the laser beam along the horizontal direction of theprojection area 140. - The drive waveform is a modified triangular waveform in which the harmonics are defined in magnitude and phase to compensate for the natural sinusoidal response of the
resonant X-mirror 250. -
FIG. 4 is an exemplary stimulus waveform 400 in accordance with a possible embodiment of the invention. In particular, thefirst view 410 of the waveforms shows thestimulus signal 420 andresponse 430 from the X-mirror 240 inFIG. 2 . Acloser view 440 with smaller amplitude scale shows thestimulus signal 440 andresponse 460. Thefirst view 410 shows thestimulus signal 420 as a triangular pulse waveform and theresponse 430 as a triangular waveform. Thesecond view 440 clearly shows that the stimulus signal is a modifiedtriangular waveform 440. The modified triangular waveform is 440 consists of a triangular waveform with a triangular pulse or spikes superimposed at certain intervals. - This stimulus waveform S(t) and the response R(t) can be mathematically described by the following equations:
-
- Where Am is an amplitude, φm is a phase, Q is the “Q factor”, ωo is the fundamental frequency of the X-scanner 245
plus X-mirror 240, t is time, and m is a summing index. As can be seen inequation 1, this stimulus pattern S(t) has a fundamental frequency of ωo, and has additional harmonics. The application of the stimulus pattern S(t) to X-scanner 244 will produce a near-linear response R(t) of the X-mirror 250. Stimulus waveform S(t) may be generated, for example, by a lookup table contained withinROM 215. - Embodiments within the scope of the present invention may also include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination thereof to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the computer-readable media.
- Computer-executable instructions include, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Computer-executable instructions also include program modules that are executed by computers in stand-alone or network environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, and data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer-executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.
- Although the above description may contain specific details, they should not be construed as limiting the claims in any way. Other configurations of the described embodiments of the invention are part of the scope of this invention. For example, the principles of the invention may be applied to each individual user where each user may individually deploy such a system. This enables each user to utilize the benefits of the invention even if any one of the large number of possible applications do not need the functionality described herein. In other words, there may be multiple instances of the embodiments in
FIGS. 1-4 , each processing the content in various possible ways. It does not necessarily need to be one system used by all end users. Accordingly, the appended claims and their legal equivalents should only define the invention, rather than any specific examples given.
