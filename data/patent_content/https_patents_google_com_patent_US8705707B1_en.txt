- a communication device such as a smart phone or another communication device with call capabilities
- the mobile device industry has improved the capabilities of communication devices.
- the present disclosure improves organization of call identification information in an easy to use and retrievable format, so that a user may identify a call after a call was answered, missed, or terminated.
- a call may be any communication, such as a phone call, Short Message Service (SMS) (e.g., text message), email, or any data transfer.
- SMS Short Message Service
- an example of a phone call is used as a non-limiting example of a communication for illustrative purposes.
- a user of the communication device may not be able to identify a caller solely from viewing the associated phone number, but may be able to identify the caller by remembering what events and activities happened when the call occurred.
- An occurrence of the call may be any incoming (i.e., received) or outgoing (i.e., sent) communication.
- a contextual identifier may be generated when a call is “answered, missed, or terminated.”
- a contextual identifier may be generated when a text message is received or sent by the communication device.
- a contextual identifier may be generated before, during, or event after a call has occurred. Some information used in a contextual identifier may be provided by a device in a communication device network.
- a communication device network may have information about the caller, such as the name of the person or business being contacted or trying to contact.
- a graphical user interface of the communication device may also include this information in call history list format.
- the compiled caller identification may be displayed to the user at a graphical user interface in a call log, which allows the user to scroll through the list and may allow the user to select an entry for additional information, such as the specific telephone number identified along with the name of the caller or business at the specific date and time.
- the communication device may add tags to each entry in a call log to expand the information related to each call in the call log based on information available to the communication device regarding the call.
- the communication device may be, for example, a server or a client device.
- the tags associated with the call log entry may help identify the activities and environment of the communication device around the time when the communication device logged the call.
- Tags associated with each call log entry may be searchable such that a user may find a particular call by searching the tag information, allowing a particular call entry to be located by identifying the contextual tag information.
- Techniques of this disclosure label entries in call logs with contextual identifiers that may be searchable. Techniques may also include determining when the communication device logs the call and prompting the user to create contextual identifiers that may appear in the call log entry to help the user identify the call. If the user does create a contextual identifier to add to the call log, the user may input data about the user's activity when the call log entry was created or other information that the user associates with the call or call log entry. Additionally, a server may generate call log identifiers too and associate the generated identifiers with the call log entry. Allowing the user to create call identifiers and providing the user with the server generated identifiers allows the user an improved ability to remember the context of the call and more control of their call history.
- the mobile communication device may request data from a server implementing techniques of the present disclosure.
- the server may apply location techniques to identify the location of the mobile communication device at a time the call is logged.

- the tags may be navigable (e.g., searchable) by user input through a GUI.
- the server device and the mobile computing device may generate the contextual identifiers and the tags when the mobile communication device logs the call. For example, when the mobile computing device receives the call, the mobile computing device may determine that the user is running and may begin capturing video. Capturing data associated with the call entry, such as audio data, may begin upon receiving, placing, or terminating a call. For example, when a call is received, the computing device initiates recording audio and video with on-board input devices including a microphone and a camera, respectively.
- the searchable tags which include the indications of the call being answered, missed, or terminated, entered at the client device (such audio, images, video, and texts) are also known as contextual identifiers.
- Contextual identifiers may identify what the user was engaged in approximately around the time of the call.
- a user can browse or search the call log contextual identifiers associated with one or more calls. For instance, the user may retrieve all call log contextual identifiers associated with one or more call entries by typing terms associated with the contextual identifiers at GUI or by scrolling through lists of contextual identifiers displayed at GUI, such as photos.

- a user may be carrying a communication device, such as a smartphone.
- the smartphone may send information associated with itself to a remote server implementing techniques of this disclosure.
- the information associated with the smartphone may include a device identifier, location information, time information, and various applications executed by the smartphone.
- the remote server may, based at least in part on the geolocation information, activity of application use, or associated time information, determine if other smartphones are located within a predetermined distance to the smartphone for a period of time exceeding a threshold time.
- the server may determine that the user is associated with an event (e.g., a meeting, conference, party, etc.).
- the user may take photos, record audio, record video, or input text that the communication device associates with a call entry that can be used later to help identify the call within the call log.
- the communication device may allow the user to enter a tag to label the photo.
- the communication device may save this tag in the data structure and use this stored tag as a searchable contextual identifier.
- the user may take a photo while out shopping, around the time the user receives a call. The user may be prompted to enter a text to label the photo and may enter “Home Improvement Store” to identify the location at the approximate time of the call. This label is then saved as a contextual identifier.
- the communication device may use voice recognition techniques to translate recognized audio into text.
- the text may be included in a tag that may be saved as a contextual identifier in a call log. For example, the user may receive a call from “The Phone Company.” The user may record an audio file of the user stating, “Phone Company,” which the communication device translates. The communication device may store the text “phone company” as a contextual identifier associated with that call in the call log.
- the call log is a data structure that lists the contextual identifiers, including tags, metadata, user services data, location data, and any user input data such as photos, video, audio, and text.
- the server or the communication device may compile the data and generate the data structure with the contextual identifiers.
- the server stores the data structure in a searchable format and adds each entry, with associated contextual identifiers, at a time that is approximately when the call is answered, missed, or terminated. All of the contextual identifiers may be added after the call was missed, for example, when the user takes a photo that is associated with the call as a contextual identifier.
- the server may retrieve information about a user associated with the mobile communication device, and may automatically generate a call log including at least a portion of the retrieved information about the user.
- the call log may include information associated with an event, such as pictures, maps, an event name, the time and location of the event, and the like.
- activities that the user was engaged in on the smartphone around the time of the call such as playing games or checking email, may be tagged as a contextual identifier.
- the contextual identifier is associated with the call and listed with the related call entry in the call log.
- activities that the user was physically participating in at the time of the call such as at an event that the server may identify, may be tagged as a contextual identifier and associated with the call entry.
- the server may perform actions such as searching for other users in proximity to the mobile communication device or posting information included in the call log in a social network associated with one or more of the users.
- the server then stores the retrieved contextual identifiers and sends the retrieved contextual identifiers back to the mobile communication device to be displayed at the GUI in the call log.
- the call log may be navigable (e.g., searchable) by a user. For instance, a user may retrieve all call log contextual identifiers associated with each call entry by typing in terms associated with the contextual identifiers or by scrolling through lists of contextual identifiers, such as photos.
- the user has the ability to set up the call log to display at the GUI certain contextual identifiers as preferred by the user, or the smartphone may select contextual identifiers for the user based on confidence information.
- the user also has the ability to isolate certain types of contextual identifiers as a different technique for searching. For example, the user may wish to search for a photo associated with a call entry. In response to the user's command, the GUI may display only the photos in the call log. The user may then scroll through the list of photos and select a photo to display as additional call log data associated with the call entry.
