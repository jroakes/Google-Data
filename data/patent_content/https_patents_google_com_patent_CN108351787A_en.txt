Abc123＆devnfo=A34r0).In some implementations, such parameter can be such as " devid=abc123 " and/or
The coded string of " devnfo=A34r0 ".
If selecting the selection for the third party content project of system progress distributed for resource that can be based on by content item
Dry influence factor, prediction click-through rate (pCTR), prediction conversion ratio (pCVR), bid associated with content item etc..It can
Generate the value of such as score to use such influence factor, by inch of candle can by content item select system by its with
Other scores of other content project are compared.
Can be various the by third party content provider during the auction of the content item position of the resource of such as webpage
Tripartite's content item uses several different types of bid value.For example, auction can include whether to click third party based on user
Content item, user whether based on the presentation of third party content project come execute specific action, third party content project whether by
The bid and/or other kinds of bid for selecting and distributing.For example, whether being selected and being distributed based on third party content project
Bid can be relatively low bid (for example, $ 0.005), and the bid that specific action whether is executed based on user can be higher
It bids (for example, $ 5).In some cases, can adjust bid with consider probability associated with bid types and/or due to
Other reasons are adjusted.For example, the probability that user executes specific action may be relatively low, such as 0.2%, and selected and distributed
The probability of third party content project may be 100% (for example, if selected during auction, to be selected and sent
The content item of hair will occur, so bid does not adjust).Therefore, bid value and probability or another modified values next life can be based on
At the value of such as score or standardized value for auction.In exemplified earlier, whether selected based on third party content project
It can be $ 0.005*1.00=0.005 with the value of bid or score distributed, and whether going out for specific action is executed based on user
The value or score of valence can be $ 5*0.002=0.01.In order to maximize generated income, content item selects system can be with
Third party content project of the selection with peak from auction.In aforementioned exemplary, content item selection system can be based on
It is associated with the bid to select whether user due to high value associated with bid or score executes specific action
Content item.

The link of the login page of application shop).Since broad category of client terminal device can be used for consumer, certain movements are answered
With may be incompatible with one or more client terminal devices.For example, mobile application is potentially based on one or more client terminal devices
Operating system, operating system version, hardware configuration etc. and it is incompatible with one or more client terminal devices.If client fills
Set it is incompatible with the mobile application associated by content item, then selection and the content item be distributed to the client filling
Setting may be less useful.In addition, its can before the auction for executing qualified content item, reduce to remove with to client
The time delay of the associated content item of the incompatible mobile application of end device.That is, based on the client with request
The incompatibility of device can reduce the number of the qualified content item in auction to remove content item, to increase content item
Mesh selection system can select and distribute the speed of content item in response to the request from client terminal device.
In order to remove content item based on the incompatibility of corresponding mobile application and client terminal device, ratio can be passed through
Compared with for corresponding mobile application required feature set and come several known mobile devices of self-identifying data structure data and
