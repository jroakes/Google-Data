Abstract
The application relates to configurable point of interest alerts. Receiving, on a user device, a point of interest region and a reminder includes transmitting, by the user computing device, a request to a remote computing device for point of interest data corresponding to a point of interest in proximity to the user device; presenting the received point of interest data; identifying a specific point of interest; and outputting a reminder regarding the particular point of interest. Receiving the point of interest region on the user device includes transmitting a request for point of interest data; receiving the point of interest data from a remote network device, wherein a size of the point of interest region is determined based on a density of points of interest in a vicinity of a user, and wherein a shape of the point of interest region expands in a direction of travel and contracts in an opposite direction; and presenting the received point of interest data.
Description
Description of the cases
The application belongs to divisional application of Chinese invention patent application No. 201480023923.7 with application date of 2014, 3 and 5.
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to point of interest identification, and more particularly to delivering server-controlled point of interest zones and reminders to user computing devices.
Background
Location data from a mobile device may be used for a number of applications. Applications exist that use location data to determine friend locations, play games, and assist users in determining directions. The location data may also be used to alert the user when the user and the user's device are near a point of interest ("POI"). A POI is any commercial, institution or other location in which the user is interested or in which the user may have a coupon or other offer.
In one example, the user may choose to be reminded each time the user approaches a particular store or restaurant, or the server may identify the POI as a store that the user is frequent and is currently in the vicinity of making a promotion or benefit. Such reminders are examples of geo-fences. A geofence is a virtual perimeter or region of a real-world geographic area. The geofences may be dynamically generated-such as within a radius around the store or point location. The device receives the generated notification when a user of the location-aware user computing device enters or leaves the geofence. A geo-fence notification can be sent to the user computing device.
Unfortunately, POI information is constantly changing. New stores are under construction, promotions are up to date, and user locations are changing. A user may want POI information that is constantly updated, but a mobile device is typically not able to maintain a database of all POIs and POI marketing data. Attempting to maintain such data may adversely affect the data storage capacity of the device, the battery life of the device, the required data transfer capabilities, or other aspects of operating the mobile device.
Conversely, monitoring the location of the user device by the server and continuously providing updates of POI data as the mobile device changes location can also adversely affect the battery, storage capacity, and data transmission capabilities of the device.
In addition, conventional geo-fence alerts provide the same alert to a user whenever the user comes within proximity of a point of interest. If the point of interest is in a location that is frequently passed by the user, the reminder may become an annoyance. For example, the point of interest may be located near the user's home or office. A user may enter the geo-fencing perimeter of a point of interest multiple times during a day. Receiving a reminder each time the user passes a point of interest may cause the user to ignore the reminder or even delete the point of interest.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
Exemplary embodiments provide a point of interest ("POI") alert application that can utilize location data of a user to deliver server-controlled POI zones to a mobile device. In some embodiments, the user must engage in a particular activity in order to use the user's location in the techniques described herein. For example, a user may install a POI alert application on their mobile device and/or configure an account on a server in order to participate in the techniques described herein. The POI alert application can provide a user interface for entering configuration information. The POI alert application may gather the user's location from any location identification technology available to the user device. For example, a user device may identify the location of the user device using Wi-Fi transmissions in a given location. Additionally or alternatively, the POI alert application employs global positioning system ("GPS") location technology or other location identification technology of the user device to determine the location of the device, and thus the user. This location may be transmitted to a server located in the POI monitoring system. The POI alert application may gather location data directly from the user device operating system, or the POI alert application may request the location from another location-based application operating on the phone.
The POI location system receives location data from the user device and identifies a geographic location of the device. The POI location system then accesses the database to find POI information in the vicinity of the user device. The POI information may be anything of interest to the user. The categories of POI information accessed may be user-configured or may be selected by the POI location system server based on the user's prior activities, interests, or suggestions.
Examples of POIs for transmission to a user device that may be identified by a server may include, but will not be limited to, restaurants, shops, or other businesses frequented by the user, businesses presently at a reduced price or promotion, businesses presently offering electronic coupons, tourist attractions, museums, friends identified by their device, or any other identifiable entity that may be of interest to the user.
The POI information may be any data, offer, or other information that may be of interest to the user. The POI information may be a coupon, rebate, or other offer. The POI information may be a prepaid offer that the user has paid. The POI information may be a prepaid pass such as a movie ticket, boarding pass, ticket for a race, subway ticket, or other pass paid for by the user. The POI information may relate to a loyalty program to which the user belongs. For example, the POI information may be an update in the user's loyalty points or other indication of the user's loyalty status.
The POI location system identifies the POIs in the vicinity of the user and uses the density or quality of the POI information to establish the size and boundaries of the POI zone for transmission to the user device. The POI location system may limit the size of the POI zone to prevent any adverse effects caused by transmitting an amount of data that is too large for the user device and system to operate efficiently. For example, if the amount of transmitted POI data is too large, the data may require the data storage unit of the device to have sufficient capacity to enable proper operation of the device. Alternatively, if the POI zone size is too small, the POI location system may be forced to transmit new POI zones to the device too frequently, which is not practical. For example, if POI zone data is transmitted too frequently, battery life of the device may be consumed.
In an example embodiment, the POI location system may alter the shape of the POI zone based on an estimated or proximate condition of the user and the user device. For example, the POI location system may recognize how fast the user device is moving. The POI location system can determine the speed of the user by monitoring changes in the location of the user device over a period of time. In one example, the POI location system can categorize the speed of the user into a set of categories. The user may be determined to be moving at walking speed, cycling speed, low driving speed, high driving speed, or not moving.
the size and shape of the region may be altered based on the speed of the user. For example, if the user is driving a car on an interstate, the user's condition is placed in a high driving speed category. The POI zone for a user in a high driving speed category may be adjusted to better predict POIs that the user may be more interested in. For example, a user may be more likely to visit POIs in the direction of travel than POIs behind the direction of travel. Additionally, the user may be more likely to visit POIs farther forward in the direction of travel than POIs that are closer to the user but not in the direction of travel. For example, the user may plan a farther next station in advance when traveling at a high rate of speed than when walking.
Thus, an example POI zone for a user traveling at high driving speeds may be larger in the direction of travel than behind the direction of travel. Additionally, the entire POI zone may be larger farther in the direction of travel and smaller closer to the user.
In another example, the POI location system may determine a road on which the user is traveling and limit the POI zone to POIs within a configured distance from the road. For example, the POI location system may receive a series of locations of the user device and compare the locations to maps of interstate highways, and other suitable roads. If the POI location system determines, based on the comparison, that the user is traveling on a particular interstate, the POI location system may limit the POI zone to an area within a configured distance from the particular interstate. The shape of the POI zone may be altered to follow the direction of the particular interstate. That is, the POI zone may follow the turns and changes in direction of the particular interstate on which the user is traveling.
In another example, the user may be categorized into walking. That is, based on the positions received by the POI location system over a period of time, the POI location system determines the speed of travel and determines that the speed of the user matches the characteristics of the user while walking. The POI zone can be adjusted accordingly. For example, the POI zone may be larger in the direction of travel than behind the direction of travel. In this example, the width of the POI zone in the direction of travel may be closer to the width of the POI zone behind the direction of travel than a user traveling at a high driving speed. Because a user on foot may turn directions more easily than a user traveling at high driving speeds, the POI location system may determine that POIs behind the user may be nearly as relevant to the user as POIs in the direction of travel.
The POI location system can additionally prioritize the POI data. Based on user input or analysis of user historical data (e.g., purchase history or website usage), the POI location system can provide a ranked list of POIs to the user device. This ranked list may be used by the POI alert application to determine when or how to alert the user to the proximity of a particular POI. For example, the POI alert application may display all POIs on a map of the area, but alert the user only when the user approaches one of the top ten ranked POIs.
Another example of a prioritization factor may be the value or quantity of coupons or offers for POI promotions. For example, if a nearby business offers a better promotion, the POI alert application may not alert the user 101 to nearby POIs.
In another example, the POI location system may provide POI data on a map and highlight higher ranked POIs. Higher ranked POIs may have larger icons or logos, appear in a different color than lower ranked POIs, or be highlighted in any other way on the map.
The POIs on the user device alert the application to the recipient area boundaries and POI information. The POI alert application may be an application running on the user device that is configured for any type of POI location activity. For example, the POI alert application may be an application configured to alert the user to restaurants or stores that the user likes or currently offers coupons. The POI alert application may alert the user to a museum or tourist attraction. The POI alert application may alert the user to other devices operating in the area that may be contacts of the user. The POI alert application may be focused on any other business or entity that alerts the user or the server to configure the POI alert application to monitor.
In an alternative example, the POI alert application is an application that provides POI data to other applications. The POI alert application may receive the POI zone and POI information and provide the POI information to other applications operating on the user device. For example, the POI alert application may save POI information and provide the information to a second application that provides the user with a meal coupon. When the user approaches a restaurant associated with a coupon received by the POI alert application, the POI alert application can alert the second application of the location of the POI and provide the coupon to the second application. Alternatively, the POI alert application may provide all nearby POIs to the second application after receipt from the POI location system. Any suitable interaction between the POI alert application and any other application can be made to provide POI information to the user.
After receiving the POI and region information, the POI alert application may display the information on a map or other grid via a user interface of the POI alert application. Additionally or alternatively, the POI alert application may display the information to the user in any other format that may convey the information, such as a simple list of each POI and the distance of the location of each POI from the user. The POI alert application may also provide a route to the POI after a request to the user.
If the information is displayed on a map view, the POI reminder application can expand or collapse the data displayed to the user depending on the density of the data. For example, if a large number of POIs are located in a localized area, the POI alert application may group POIs together and display the groups in a single icon or label. An example of such a situation may be a complex mall containing too many POIs to be displayed on the user device. The display may show only a marker for the mall and list the number of POIs contained at the location or any other way of representing the grouping of POIs. As the user approaches a dense POI, the grouped POI may expand to show individual POIs in the area.
After receiving the POI information, the mobile device continues to monitor the location of the user device. If the device is close to a POI, the POI alert application can perform any alert function configured by the user. For example, the POI alert application may alert the user when the user device is within a configured range from the POI (e.g., within a block from the POI), or when the POI is expected to be reached or approached within a certain period of time (e.g., an alert for a scenic spot may appear 20 minutes before the point of interest is expected to be reached, so that the user has time to consider whether to stay at the point of interest; as another example, an alert for a museum may appear 10 minutes before the user is expected to arrive at a cross-street where the user must drive out to the museum). The reminder may additionally take any configured form desired by the user. In an exemplary embodiment, the POI alert application may use the alert internally or may provide an audible alert, vibrate, visual alert (e.g., showing POI details on a display of the user device), provide an email, or employ any other configurable alert program. In an alternative embodiment, the POI alert application may alert the POI location system that the device is approaching a POI. The POI location system can perform any alert function configured by the user or store the alert for later use. The POI location system can send the alert to a POI alert application or another location. For example, the POI location system may send an email, a push notification, a text message, or another communication to the user.
in an example embodiment, the POI location system provides a coupon or other offer to the POI alert application when the user device is proximate to the POI. For example, when the POI alert application determines that the user device is within a configured distance from the POI, the POI alert application may notify the POI location system, another application operating on the user device, or any suitable system. The POI alert application, POI location system, or another system may provide offers associated with the POI to the user.
For example, the POI alert application may recognize that the location of the user device is within a configured proximity to the POI and access offers associated with POIs provided by the POI location system (e.g., continuing with the above example, a discount for entering a museum and an alert regarding the museum may be provided to the user). The offer may be provided when transmitting the POI zone and POI information. Alternatively, the POI alert application may contact the POI location system, provide the identity of nearby POIs, and request any offers associated with the POIs. The POI location system may provide an offer or prompt a third party system to provide an offer to the user. Alternatively, the POI alert application may provide the identity of the nearby POI to a second application operating on the user device. The second application may provide the appropriate offer to the user on a user interface associated with the second application, on the POI alert application, or in any suitable manner. In an alternative embodiment, offers associated with POIs may be transmitted to the POI alert application at any time and stored in any location on the user device.
In an example embodiment, the POI alert application may provide a ticket or other prepaid pass to the user. For example, when a user approaches a POI (e.g., a movie theater or airport), the POI alert application may provide the user with an alert along with a ticket or other pass. The ticket may be displayed on a user interface of the user computing device, and a barcode or other ticket identifier may be displayed for viewing or scanning. In another example, the ticket may be wirelessly transmitted from the user computing device to the merchant system. In another example, the POI information may be a boarding pass at an airport, a subway ticket, or any other suitable pass.
In another example, the POI alert application may provide loyalty account information to the user. For example, the POI alert application may alert the user when approaching a POI. The POI alert application may provide updates to the loyalty status of the user account, accumulated loyalty points, offers associated with the loyalty account, or any other suitable loyalty information.
in an example embodiment, a reminder schedule may be configured. The reminder schedule may be configured by the POI reminder application, the offer application, the POI location system, the user, or any suitable party. The POI alert application provides a configured alert to the user the first time the POI is approached and modifies the alert for subsequent approaches to the POI. For example, if the user first approaches a POI associated with an offer, the POI alert application may provide an audible alert, a vibratory alert, and a visual notification that an alarm clock is displayed on a user interface of the user device. A POI may be a location near the user's home or office, and the user may pass the POI multiple times during the day. The user may not like to receive many reminders associated with the same offer. Thus, if the user approaches the POI a second time, the POI alert application may only provide a visual notification of the offer without providing an audible alert and a vibratory alert. The POI alert application may not provide any notification to the user when the user approaches the POI the third time.
any changes to subsequent notifications may be utilized. For example, a certain offer may be configured to increase the intensity of the notification with each approach of the user, such as an audible alert that increases in volume with each approach of the user to the POI. In another example, a different reminder may be provided for each approach of the user, such as toggling between a vibration, an audible alarm, and a visual notification. In another example, the notification configuration may be reset after a period of time has elapsed. That is, if a configured amount of time has elapsed since the user first approached the POI, the process will reset and the original reminder will be employed the next time the user approached the POI.
In one example, the user has an offer to use a coupon for an item in a coffee shop near the user's home. When the user leaves home in the morning, the POI alert application recognizes that the user is approaching a POI and provides an audible alert and a visual notification of an offer associated with the coffee shop. When the user goes home at night and passes through the coffee shop, the POI alert application recognizes that offers were provided to the user earlier in the day based on viewing the provided alerts stored on the user device or elsewhere. Thus, based on the configuration of the offer, the POI alert application only provides a vibratory alert and visual notification of the offer. The user leaves home to eat dinner and passes through the coffee shop on the way out and then passes through the coffee shop again when going home. The POI alert application recognizes that offers have been presented multiple times that day and no longer provides offers. In the example, when the user passes through the coffee shop the next morning when leaving home, the POI alert application determines how long has passed since the first alarm of the previous day. If more than the configured amount of time has elapsed, the POI alert application resets the alert schedule for the offer. The POI alert application can provide both an audible alert and a visual alert when the user is near the coffee shop. Subsequent reminders may follow a configured schedule.
In some examples, the reminder schedule may be reset according to any schedule. For example, the reminder schedule may be reset after 12 hours, 2 days, 1 week, or any configured period of time. In one example, the time period is based on a time period starting from the first scheduled reminder. In another example, the time period is based on a time since the last approach to the POI. That is, the reminder schedule will not reset until the user has not approached the POI for a configured period of time. In another example, the reminder schedule may be reset after a certain number of reminders (e.g., 3, 5, 10, or any suitable number of reminders). Any other configuration of the reminder schedule may be utilized.
in an example embodiment, the POI alert application may use the working time of the POI to adjust the alert schedule. For example, the POI alert application or POI location system 160 can determine the work hours of the business (e.g., by finding information on a webpage of the POI) and associate the work hours with the POI in a database. The POI alert application can be configured to provide alerts associated with the POI only when the POI is open for business. In another example, the POI location system can determine the types of businesses to which the POI can be categorized. For example, the POI location system may determine the type of business based on a view of the POI's website, a merchant category code received from the transaction, or in any suitable manner. If the POI location system is unable to determine the exact hours of operation of the business, then the POI location system can configure an estimate of the hours of operation based on the business type of the POI. For example, the POI location system may estimate that a museum will be open from 8 am to 8 pm each day. The POI location system can estimate that the nightclub will be open from 5 pm to 2 am each day. Any other method of estimating the hours of operation of a business may be employed.
In another example, the reminder schedule may be configured to provide offers to the user that are related to the time of the offer. For example, the POI location system may determine that offers discounting breakfast merchandise will only be presented to the user in the morning. In another example, the POI location system may determine that offers for discounts that are only valid after a certain time (e.g., 5 pm) will be presented only at a certain time after the time that the offer becomes valid.
In an example embodiment, the POI location system may monitor coupons, discounts, rebates, and other offers associated with the user's POI and identify any changes or other modifications to the offers. If the POI location system identifies a modification to the offer, the POI location system can determine whether the modified offer is in the user's current POI zone. If the changed offer is in the user's current POI region, the POI location system can provide the modified offer to the POI reminder application.
For example, a user receives a new POI zone from a POI location system and any offers associated with POIs located in the POI zone. The POI location system is then notified of the modification or other change to the offer. The modification may be the expiration of a coupon, a newly generated offer, a change in the terms of the offer, or any suitable modification. Notification of the modification may be provided to the POI location system by an offer creator, an offer management system, a merchant system, a payment processing system, or any suitable system or offer provider. Additionally or alternatively, the offer may be modified by the POI location system or a system related to the POI location system.
in the example, the POI location system provides offers associated with POIs in the current POI zone to a POI alert application on the user device. In an alternative embodiment, the POI location system provides the offer to the POI alert application only when the user device is within a configured proximity to the POI. The POI location system determines that the modified offer has been provided to the POI alert application on the user device by comparing the modified offer to a list of offers provided to the user device and a current location of the user device. The POI location system provides the modified offer to the POI alert application. If an offer is currently being presented to the user on the user interface, the POI alert application can alert the user to the modified offer. If the POI alert application has stored the offer but has not presented the offer to the user on the user interface, the POI alert application receives the modified offer and updates or replaces the previous unmodified offer. The POI alert application presents the modified offer to the user on the user interface when the user device is proximate to the POI.

It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computer and the apparatus may be used. Moreover, those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure will appreciate that the user device 110, offer provider system 150, and POI location system 160 shown in fig. 1 may have any of a number of other suitable computer system configurations. For example, a user device 110 implemented as a mobile phone or handheld computer may not include all of the components described above.
Example Process
the example methods illustrated in fig. 2-3 are described below with respect to components of the example operating environment 100. The example methods of fig. 2-3 may also be performed with other systems and in other environments.
Fig. 2 is a flow diagram depicting a method 200 for providing nearby points of interest to a user device, according to some example embodiments.
Referring to fig. 1 and 2, in block 205, a point of interest ("POI") location system 160 installs computer readable program instructions on a POI location system server 161 for interacting with a POI alert application 115 on a user device 110. Additionally, the POI location system 160 installs computer readable program instructions on the POI location system server 161 for interacting with the offer provider system 150. In an exemplary embodiment, these computer readable program instructions may be implemented in the POI location system server 161 as embedded scripts, such as JavaScript.
In block 210, the user 101 installs the POI alert application 115 on the user device 110. In some exemplary embodiments, the user 101 may navigate to a website of the provider of the POI alert application 115 and download and install the POI alert application 115. The website providing the POI alert application 115 may be a POI location system website 153. The POI alert application 115 may be embedded in the digital wallet 112 on the user device 110. The user 101 may configure using the user interface of the POI alert application 115. The user 101 may configure the privacy settings provided by the POI alert application 115.
additionally, the user 101 may communicate with computer readable program instructions on the POI location system 160 to establish user identification and account configuration. Communication with the POI location system 160 may occur via any available technology, including but not limited to an internet connection, text, email, or cellular connection via the network 105. On the POI location system 160 and POI alert application 115, the user 101 can configure the categories of monitored POIs. The user 101 may additionally configure privacy settings provided by the POI location system 160.
Additionally or alternatively, the POI alert application 115 can communicate with the POI location system 160 to establish the format in which POI data will be transmitted. For example, a POI alert application 115 that does not employ a map display feature may only require a list of POIs. The POI alert application 115 can request any other formats or data available from the POI location system 160.
The user 101 may additionally configure the alert mechanism of the POI alert application 115. The POI alert application 115 can provide an audible alert, a vibration, a visual alert (e.g., showing POI details on a display of the user device), or any other configurable alert program. Additionally or alternatively, the reminder may be incorporated by any other application that may benefit from POI reminders.
In block 215, the user 101 starts the POI alert application 115 by actuating a physical or virtual button, making an action such as "tap" or swipe to the user device 110, speaking a voice command, or performing any other starting process. POI alert application 115 transmits the location of user device 110 to POI location system 160. In a certain embodiment, the POI alert application 115 is configured to operate at all times when the user device 110 is operational. That is, the POI alert application 115 need not be launched to begin transmitting location information to the POI location system 160.
The POI alert application 115 may be configured to access location data directly from the user device 110. User device 110 may have the ability to determine the geographic coordinates of the location of user device 110 through computer hardware or software, or a combination thereof. For example, the POI alert application may gather the user's location from any location identification technology available to the user device. For example, a user device may identify the location of the user device using Wi-Fi transmissions in a given location. Additionally or alternatively, the POI alert application can utilize the global positioning system ("GPS") to determine its location.
Additionally or alternatively, user device 110 may include location-based application 114, and POI alert application 115 or POI location system 160 may utilize location-based application 114 to access location data of user device 110. Examples of applications that may utilize the location data and thus may make it available to the POI location system 160 may include, but will not be limited to, business location finding applications, location-based social networks, location-based game play, or friend locator applications. The POI alert application 115 can request and receive a location from the location-based application 114. The location-based application 114 may determine the location of the user device 110 using any of the positioning techniques discussed herein.
In block 220, the POI location system 160 gathers POI location data and transmits the location data to the user device 110. The details of this step will be discussed in more detail in method 220 of FIG. 3.
Fig. 3 is a flow chart depicting a method 220 for generating and transmitting POIs to a user device, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
Referring to fig. 1 and 2, in block 305 of the method 220, the POI location system 160 establishes and maintains current marketing and location data for POIs relevant to the user 101. The POI data may be maintained in a database on the POI location system server 161 or any storage location available to the POI location system 160. The POI data may be anything of interest to the user. The categories of POI data accessed may be user configured or may be selected by the POI location system server 161 based on previous activities, interests, or suggestions of the user 101. Examples of POIs that may be identified by the server 161 for transmission to the user device 110 may include, but will not be limited to, restaurants, shops, or other businesses frequented by the user 101, businesses that are currently at a high rate or promotion, businesses that are currently offering electronic coupons, tourist attractions, museums, friends identified by their device, or any other identifiable entity that may be of interest to the user 101. The list of POIs associated with the user 101 may be maintained in a database on the POI location system server 161 or any storage location available to the POI location system 160.
POI location system 160 may access POI data from any system that may poll through POI location system 160 to gather POI information. For example, POI data may be gathered from offer provider system 150. The offer provider system 150 may be a marketing system of a product manufacturer or service provider. The offer provider system 150 may be the user's social networking system, coupon aggregator or provider, map system, digital phone book, or any other service or system that may provide information that the POI location system 160 may use to define and prioritize POI regions, which may provide preference and history data for the user's activities.
In block 310, the POI location system 160 receives the location of the user device 110. POI location system 160 stores the location of user device 110 in a user account on POI location system server 161 or in another suitable storage location. POI location system 160 may translate the location data provided by user device 110. For example, if the location is provided as a street address or intersection, the POI location system 160 can convert the street address to a latitude and longitude location or other geographic location format. In another example, POI location system 160 may convert the latitude and longitude location to a street address, plot the latitude and longitude on a map, or use the data in any suitable manner.
In block 315, the POI location system 160 identifies POIs near the location of the user device 110. POI location system 160 may access a database maintained for the account of user 101 and identify potential POIs. For example, POI location system 160 may determine the distance of each possible POI from the location of user 101. The POI location system 160 may determine the distance to the location of the user device 110 to go straight or by following the shortest route on a publicly traversable road.
In block 320, POI location system 160 uses the density or quality of the POI information to establish the size of the POI zone for transmission to user device 110. The POI location system 160 may limit the size of the POI zone to prevent any adverse effects caused by transmitting too large an amount of data for the user device 110 and the system to operate efficiently. For example, if the amount of transmitted POI data is too large, the data may require the data storage unit 113 of the user device 110 to have sufficient capacity to enable normal operation of the user device 110. Alternatively, if the POI zone size is too small, the POI location system 160 may be forced to transmit the new POI zone to the user device 110 too frequently, which is not practical. For example, if POI zone data is transmitted too frequently, battery life of the user device 110 may be consumed.
The size of the POI zone surrounding the current location of the user device 110 may be determined based on the density or quality of the POI information. In an exemplary implementation, the POI zone may be sized to contain a configured number of POIs in the vicinity of the user device 110. For example, the size of the POI zone may be configured to contain a specified number of POIs, e.g., 50, closest to the user device 110 or to provide the highest priority POI around the user device 110. Thus, in areas where the available POIs are highly concentrated, the POI zone may be relatively small to acquire a specified number of POIs. Alternatively, in areas where the available POIs are less concentrated, the POI zone may be relatively large to acquire a specified number of POIs. Additionally, the size of the POI zone may take any suitable shape to contain the designated POI.
In an example embodiment, the POI location system 160 may alter the shape of the POI zone based on the conditions of the user 101 and the user device 110. For example, POI location system 160 may recognize how fast user device 110 is moving. POI location system 160 may determine the velocity of user 101 by monitoring changes in the location of user device 110 over a period of time. In one example, the POI location system 160 can categorize the speed of the user 101 into a set of categories. The user 101 may be determined to be moving at walking speed, cycling speed, low driving speed, high driving speed, or not moving.
The size and shape of the region may be altered based on the speed of the user 101. For example, if the user 101 is driving a car on an interstate, the condition of the user 101 is placed in the high driving speed category. The POI zone for the user 101 in the high driving speed category may be adjusted to better predict POIs that the user 101 may be more interested in. For example, the user 101 may be more likely to visit POIs in the direction of travel than POIs behind the direction of travel. Additionally, the user 101 may be more likely to visit POIs farther forward in the direction of travel than POIs that are closer to the user 101 but not in the direction of travel. That is, the user 101 may plan a farther next station in advance when traveling at a high speed than when walking.
Thus, an example POI zone for a user 101 traveling at high driving speeds may be larger in the direction of travel than behind the direction of travel. Additionally, the entire POI zone may be larger farther in the direction of travel and smaller closer to the user 101.
In another example, POI location system 160 may determine a road on which user 101 is traveling and limit the POI zone to POIs within a configured distance from the road. For example, the POI location system 160 may receive a series of locations of the user device and compare the locations to maps of interstate highways, and other suitable roads. If the POI location system 160 determines, based on the comparison, that the user 101 is traveling on a particular interstate, the POI location system 160 may limit the POI zone to an area within a configured distance from the particular interstate. The shape of the POI zone may be altered to follow the direction of the particular interstate. That is, the POI zone may follow the turns and changes in direction of the particular interstate on which the user 101 is traveling.
In another example, the user 101 may be categorized into walking. That is, based on the locations received by the POI location system 160 over a period of time, the POI location system 160 determines the travel speed and determines that the user speed matches the characteristics of the user 101 while walking. The POI zone can be adjusted accordingly. For example, the POI zone may be larger in the direction of travel than behind the direction of travel. In this example, the width of the POI zone in the direction of travel may be closer to the width of the POI zone behind the direction of travel than the user 101 traveling at high driving speed. That is, the zone may be more circular than the zone for the user 101 traveling at high driving speeds. Because a user 101 on foot may turn directions more easily than a user 101 traveling at a high driving speed, the POI location system 160 may determine that POIs behind the user 101 may be nearly as relevant to the user 101 as POIs in the direction of travel.
POI location system 160 may additionally prioritize POI data. Based on input from the user 101 or analysis of historical data (e.g., purchase history or website usage by the user 101), the POI location system 160 can provide the ranked list of POIs to the user device 110. For example, the POI location system 160 may be able to determine that the user 101 likes a certain store or restaurant and ranks it in front of the alternative restaurant, even if the alternative restaurant is closer to the location of the user 101. Thus, if the user 101 limits the number of POI alerts in a given area, lower ranked POIs may be ignored and nearby higher ranked POIs may be selected.
Another example of a prioritization factor may be the value or quantity of coupons or offers provided by the POI. For example, if a nearby business offers a better promotion, the POI alert application 115 may not alert the user 101 to nearby POIs.
The ranked list of POIs may be used by the POI alert application 115 to determine when or how to alert the user to the proximity of a particular POI. For example, the POI alert application 115 may display all POIs on a map of the area, but alert the user 101 only when the user approaches one of the top ten ranked POIs.
Another example of a prioritization factor may be the value or quantity of coupons or offers for POI promotions. For example, if a nearby business offers a better promotion, the POI alert application 115 may not alert the user 101 to nearby POIs.
in another example, the POI alert application 115 can provide POI data on a map and highlight higher ranked POIs. Higher ranked POIs may have larger icons or logos, appear in a different color than lower ranked POIs, or be highlighted in any other way on the map.
If the information is displayed on a map view, the POI reminder application 115 can expand or collapse the data displayed to the user depending on the density of the data. For example, if a large number of POIs are located in a localized area, the POI alert application 115 may group POIs together and display the groups in a single icon or label. An example of such a situation may be a complex mall containing too many POIs to be displayed on the user device. The display may show a marker of the mall and list the number of POIs contained at the location or any other way of representing the grouping of POIs. As the user 101 approaches a dense POI, the grouped POI may expand to show individual POIs in the area. For example, if the user 101 is between two shopping malls or between two cities, then a single POI may be provided for each shopping mall or each city, respectively. Then, as the user approaches one of the shopping malls or one of the cities, the collapsed POIs for that mall or city expand to show all POIs (or a specified number of POIs) at that location.
In an example embodiment, the POI alert application 115 may provide a ticket or other prepaid pass to the user 101. For example, when the user 101 approaches a POI (e.g., a movie theater or airport), the POI alert application 115 may provide the user 101 with alerts as well as tickets or other passes. The ticket may be displayed on a user interface of the user computing device 110 and a barcode or other ticket identifier may be displayed for viewing or scanning. In another example, the ticket may be wirelessly transmitted from the user computing device 110 to the merchant system 130. In another example, the POI information may be a boarding pass at an airport, a subway ticket, or any other suitable pass.
In another example, the POI alert application 115 may provide loyalty account information to the user 101. For example, the POI alert application 115 can alert the user 101 when approaching a POI. The POI alert application 115 may provide updates to the loyalty status of the user account, accumulated loyalty points, offers associated with the loyalty account, or any other suitable loyalty information.
In certain exemplary embodiments, POI location system 160 applies the extracted data to a machine learning algorithm or another statistical model to determine the most effective ranking system. For example, a machine learning algorithm may be performed on POIs generated for one or more users to learn the ranking system that produces the result with the highest usage. The machine learning algorithm may be updated periodically.
in block 325, the POI location system 160 transmits the POI zone size, POI identity and location, and any associated POI marketing information or offers to the POI alert application 115. The POI location system 160 can additionally transmit the prioritization ranking for each POI for use by the POI alert application 115.
continuing in block 325, the method 220 proceeds to block 225, see FIG. 2.
In block 225, the user device 110 incorporates the POI data into the user interface of the POI alert application 115. The POI alert application 115 may display information on a map or other grid via a user interface of the POI alert application. Additionally or alternatively, the POI alert application 115 can display the information to the user in any other format that can convey the information, such as a simple list of each POI and the distance of the location of each POI from the user. The POI alert application 115 may also provide a route to the POI after a request to the user. The user 101 may choose to operate the POI alert application 115 in the foreground of the operating system of the host CPU 116 and provide substantially immediate alerts as the user 101 moves through the POI zone. Alternatively, the POI alert application 115 may operate in the background of the operating system and store the POI alert for later access by the user 101.
In block 230, the POI alert application 115 monitors the location of the user device 110 as the user device 110 moves through the POI zone. The POI alert application 115 compares the location of the user device 110 to known POIs identified on the nearest POI zone. The POI alert application 115 continuously or intermittently determines whether the user device is within a configured distance from the POI.
In block 235, the POI alert application 115 determines whether a POI is approaching. For example, if the user 101 is walking through a shopping area with the user device 110 and comes within a specified distance, such as a neighborhood, from the POI, the POI alert application 115 recognizes the approaching POI. If a POI is being approached, the method 200 branches YES along block 235 to block 237. If a POI is not being approached, the method 200 branches no to 230 along block 235.
following the "no" branch from block 235 to block 230, the POI alert application 115 continues to monitor the location of the user device 110 as previously described.
The yes branch along block 235 is to block 237 where a POI alert is triggered when user device 110 moves within configured range of the POI. In an exemplary embodiment, the POI alert application 115 may use the alert internally or may provide an audible alert, a vibration, a visual alert (e.g., showing POI details on a display of the user device), an email, or any other configurable alert program.
POI location system 160 may perform any alert function configured by user 101 or store the alert for later use. The POI location system 160 can send the alert to the POI alert application 115 or to another location or application. For example, POI location system 160 may send an email, push notification, text message, or another communication to the user.
In an example embodiment, the POI location system 160 provides a coupon or other offer to the POI alert application 115 when the user device approaches the POI. For example, when the POI alert application 115 determines that the user device 110 is within a configured distance from the POI, the POI alert application 115 may notify the POI location system 160, another application operating on the user device 110, or any suitable system. The POI alert application 115, POI location system 160, or another system may provide offers associated with POIs to the user 101.
For example, the POI alert application 115 may recognize that the location of the user device 110 is within a configured proximity to a POI and access offers associated with POIs provided by the POI location system 160. The offer may be provided when transmitting the POI zone and POI information. Alternatively, the POI alert application 115 may contact the POI location system 160, provide the identity of nearby POIs, and request any offers associated with the POIs. POI location system 160 may provide an offer or prompt a third-party system to provide an offer to the user. Alternatively, the POI alert application 115 may provide the identity of the nearby POI to a second application operating on the user device 110. The second application may provide the appropriate offer to the user 101 on a user interface associated with the second application, on the POI alert application 115, or in any suitable manner. In alternative embodiments, offers associated with POIs may be transmitted to the POI alert application 115 at any time and stored in any location on the user device 110.
In an example embodiment, the reminder schedule may be. The alert schedule may be configured by the POI alert application 115, the offer application, the POI location system 160, the user 101, or any suitable party. The POI alert application 115 provides the configured alert to the user 101 the first time the POI is approached and modifies the alert for subsequent approaches to the POI. For example, if the user 101 approaches a POI associated with an offer for the first time, the POI alert application 115 may provide an audible alert, a vibratory alert, and a visual notification that an alarm clock is displayed on the user interface of the user device 110. The POI may be a location near the home or office of the user 101, and the user 101 may pass the POI multiple times during the day. The user 101 may not like to receive many reminders associated with the same offer. Thus, if the user 101 approaches the POI a second time, the POI alert application 115 may only provide a visual notification of the offer without providing an audible alert and a vibratory alert. The POI alert application 115 may not provide any notification to the user 101 when the user 101 approaches the POI the third time.
any changes to subsequent notifications may be utilized. For example, a certain offer may be configured to increase the intensity of the notification with each approach of the user 101, such as an audible alert that increases in volume with each approach of the user 101 to the POI. In another example, a different reminder may be provided for each approach of the user 101, such as toggling between a vibration, an audible alarm, and a visual notification. In another example, the notification configuration may be reset after a period of time has elapsed. That is, if a configured amount of time has elapsed since the user first approached the POI, the process will reset and the original reminder will be employed the next time the user 101 approached the POI.
In one example, the user 101 has an offer to use a coupon for an item in a coffee shop near the user's 101 home. When the user 101 leaves home in the morning, the POI alert application 115 recognizes that the user 101 is approaching a POI and provides an audible alert and a visual notification of an offer associated with the coffee shop. When the user 101 goes home at night and passes through the coffee shop, the POI alert application 115 recognizes that an offer was provided to the user 101 at an earlier time of the day based on viewing the provided alert stored on the user device 110 or elsewhere. Thus, based on the configuration of the offer, the POI alert application 115 only provides a vibratory alert and visual notification of the offer. The user 101 leaves home to eat dinner and passes through the coffee shop on the way out and then passes through the coffee shop again when going home. The POI alert application 115 recognizes that offers have been presented multiple times that day and no longer provides offers. In the example, when the user 101 passes through a coffee shop the next morning when leaving home, the POI alert application 115 determines how long has passed since the first alarm of the previous day. If more than the configured amount of time has elapsed, the POI alert application 115 resets the alert schedule for the offer. The POI alert application 115 can provide both an audible alert and a visual alert when the user approaches the coffee shop. Subsequent reminders may follow a configured schedule.
in some examples, the reminder schedule may be reset according to any schedule. For example, the reminder schedule may be reset after 12 hours, 2 days, 1 week, or any configured period of time. In one example, the time period is based on a time period starting from the first scheduled reminder. In another example, the time period is based on a time since the last approach to the POI. That is, the reminder schedule may not reset until the user has not approached the POI for a configured period of time. In another example, the reminder schedule may be reset after a certain number of reminders (e.g., 3, 5, 10, or any suitable number of reminders). Any other configuration of the reminder schedule may be utilized.
In an example embodiment, the POI alert application 115 may use the working time of the POI to adjust the alert schedule. For example, the POI alert application 115 or the POI location system 160 can determine the work hours of the business (e.g., by finding information on a webpage of the POI) and associate the work hours with the POI in a database. The POI alert application 115 can be configured to provide alerts associated with POIs only when the POI is open for business. In another example, POI location system 160 may determine the types of businesses to which the POI may be categorized. For example, POI location system 160 may determine the type of business based on a view of the POI's website, a merchant category code received from the transaction, or in any suitable manner. If the POI location system 160 is not able to determine the exact hours of operation of the business, the POI location system 160 can configure an estimate of the hours of operation based on the business type of the POI. For example, POI location system 160 may estimate that a museum will be open from 8 am to 8 pm each day. POI location system 160 may estimate that the nightclub will be open from 5 pm to 2 am each day. Any other method of estimating the hours of operation of a business may be employed.
in another example, the reminder schedule may be configured to provide offers to the user 101 that are related to the time of the offer. For example, POI location system 160 may determine that offers discounted for breakfast merchandise will only be presented to the user in the morning. In another example, POI location system 160 may determine that offers for discounts that are only valid after a certain time (e.g., 5 pm) will be presented only at a certain time after the time that the offers become valid.
In an example embodiment, the POI location system 160 may monitor coupons, discounts, rebates, and other offers associated with the user's POI and identify any changes or other modifications to the offers. If the POI location system 160 identifies a modification to the offer, the POI location system 160 may determine whether the modified offer is in the user's current POI zone. If the changed offer is in the user's current POI zone, the POI location system 160 can provide the modified offer to the POI alert application 115.
For example, the user receives a new POI zone from POI location system 160 and any offers associated with POIs located in the POI zone. The POI location system 160 is then notified of the modification or other change to the offer. The modification may be the expiration of a coupon, a newly generated offer, a change in the terms of the offer, or any suitable modification. Notification of the modification may be provided to POI location system 160 by an offer creator, an offer management system, a merchant system, a payment processing system, or any suitable system or offer provider. Additionally or alternatively, offers may be modified by POI location system 160 or systems related to POI location system 160.
in the example, the POI location system 160 provides offers associated with POIs in the current POI zone to the POI alert application 115 on the user device. In an alternative embodiment, the POI location system 160 provides offers to the POI alert application 115 only when the user device is within a configured proximity to the POI. The POI location system 160 determines that the modified offer has been provided to the POI alert application 115 on the user device by comparing the modified offer to the list of offers provided to the user device and the current location of the user device. The POI location system 160 provides the modified offer to the POI alert application 115. If the user is currently being presented with an offer on the user interface, the POI alert application 115 can alert the user of the modified offer. If the POI alert application 115 has stored the offer but does not present the offer to the user on the user interface, the POI alert application 115 receives the modified offer and updates or replaces the previous unmodified offer. The POI alert application 115 presents the modified offers to the user on the user interface when the user device is proximate to the POI.
In an alternative embodiment, the POI alert application 115 can alert the POI location system 160 that the device is approaching a POI. POI location system 160 may perform any alert function configured by the user or store the alert for later use. The POI location system 160 can send the alert to the POI alert application 115 or to another location. For example, POI location system 160 may send an email, push notification, text message, or another communication to the user.
In an alternative embodiment, the POI alert application 115 can be configured to alert the user 101 only to higher priority POIs. As discussed in detail in the method 220 of fig. 3, POI data may be prioritized by the POI location system 160. The POI alert application 115 can use the prioritization of POI data to determine which POIs will trigger alerts to the user 101. For example, the user 101 may wish to limit the reminder to the top 10 POIs in a given area. Alternatively, the user 101 may configure the POI alert application 115 to alert the user 101 to each POI in the region.
in block 240, if the user device 110 is proximate to the boundary of the POI zone by the configured distance, the method 200 branches yes to block 220 along block 240. If the user device 110 has not approached the configured boundary of the POI region, the method 200 branches along the NO branch of block 240 to block 245. In an alternative embodiment of the present application, the POI alert application 115 may require the user device 110 to leave the boundary of the POI zone entirely to follow the yes branch of block 240.
The yes branch along block 240 branches to block 220 whereupon the method requests and receives a refreshed POI zone. The POI alert application 115 will not display POI data to the user 101 or the alert monitor when the user device 110 has left the boundary of the previous POI zone. The new POI zone with the new POI list is transmitted to the user device 110.
Following the "no" branch of block 240 to block 245, the user device 110 determines whether the user device 110 received a new POI zone within a configured amount of time. For example, if user device 110 stays in one location for a configured time or does not hit any POIs for a configured time, method 200 will determine that user device 110 is idle and branch to block 220 along the yes branch of block 245. The new POI zone with the new POI list is transmitted to the user device 110. The idle time required for the yes branch of trigger block 245 may be configurable by the user 101 or the POI alert application 115. For example, the desired idle time may be an hour, a day, a week, or any other time that is reasonable based on the activity of the user 101.
If the device has not remained idle for the configured time and a new POI zone is received, the method 200 branches no to block 230 along block 245. The device will continue to monitor the location of user device 110.
The method 200 continues until the user 101 disables the POI alert application 115 or the user device is powered off.
