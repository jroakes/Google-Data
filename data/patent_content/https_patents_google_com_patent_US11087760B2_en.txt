- FIG. 2 depicts a flow diagram for multi-modal transmission of packetized data in a voice activated computer network environment
- FIG. 3 depicts method of multi-modal transmission of packetized data in a voice activated computer network environment
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a general architecture for a computer system that may be employed to implement elements of the systems and methods described and illustrated herein.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure relate generally to a data processing system that identifies an optimal transmission modality for data packet (or other protocol based) transmission in a voice activated computer network environment.
- the data processing system can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data packet transmission over one or more computer networks by, for example, selecting a transmission modality from a plurality of options for data packet routing through a computer network of content items to one or more client computing device, or to different interfaces (e.g., different apps or programs) of a single client computing device.
- Data packets or other protocol based signals corresponding to the selected operations can be routed through a computer network between multiple computing devices. For example the data processing system can route a content item to a different interface than an interface from which a request was received.
- the different interface can be on the same client computing device or a different client computing device from which a request was received.
- the data processing system can select at least one candidate interface from a plurality of candidate interfaces for content item transmission to a client computing device.
- the candidate interfaces can be determined based on technical or computing parameters such as processor capability or utilization rate, memory capability or availability, battery status, available power, network bandwidth utilization, interface parameters or other resource utilization values.
- the data processing system can reduce network bandwidth usage, latency, or processing utilization or power consumption of the client computing device that renders the content item. This saves processing power and other computing resources such as memory, reduces electrical power consumption by the data processing system and the reduced data transmissions via the computer network reduces bandwidth requirements and usage of the data processing system.
- the systems and methods described herein can include a data processing system that receives an input audio query, which can also be referred to as an input audio signal. From the input audio query the data processing system can identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request. Based on the trigger keyword or the request, the data processing system can generate a first action data structure.
- the first action data structure can include an organic response to the input audio query received from a client computing device, and the data processing system can provide the first action data structure to the same client computing device for rendering as audio output via the same interface from which the request was received.
- the data processing system can also select at least one content item based on the trigger keyword or the request.
- the data processing system can identify or determine a plurality of candidate interfaces for rendering of the content item(s).
- the interfaces can include one or more hardware or software interfaces, such as display screens, audio interfaces, speakers, applications or programs available on the client computing device that originated the input audio query, or on different client computing devices.
- the interfaces can include java script slots for online documents for the insertion of content items, as well as push notification interfaces.
- the data processing system can determine utilization values for the different candidate interfaces.
- the utilization values can indicate power, processing, memory, bandwidth, or interface parameter capabilities, for example.
- the data processing system can select a candidate interface as a selected interface for presentation or rendering of the content item. For example, the data processing system can convert or provide the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the selected interface.
- the selected interface can be an interface of the same client computing device that originated the input audio signal or a different client computing device.
- the data processing system selects a destination for the content item in a manner that can use the least amount of processing power, memory, or bandwidth from available options, or that can conserve power of one or more client computing devices.
- the data processing system can provide the content item or the first action data structure by packet or other protocol based data message transmission via a computer network to a client computing device.
- the output signal can cause an audio driver component of the client computing device to generate an acoustic wave, e.g., an audio output, which can be output from the client computing device.
- the audio (or other) output can correspond to the first action data structure or to the content item.
- the first action data structure can be routed as audio output, and the content item can be routed as a text based message.
- the data processing system can conserve resources utilized by each interface, relative to providing both the first action data structure and the content item to the same interface. This results in fewer data processing operations, less memory usage, or less network bandwidth utilization by the selected interfaces (or their corresponding devices) than would be the case without separation and independent routing of the first action data structure and the content item.

- the multiple client computing devices 150 can all be associated with the same end user.
- the data processing system 105 can determine that multiple client computing devices 150 are associated with the same end user based on information received with consent from the end user such as user access to a common social media or email account across multiple client computing devices 150 .
- the interface management component 140 can also determine that an interface is unavailable. For example the interface management component 140 can poll interfaces and determine that a battery status of a client computing device 150 associated with the interface is low, or below a threshold level such as 10%. Or the interface management component 140 can determine that the client computing device 150 associated with the interface lacks sufficient display screen size or processing power to render the content item, or that the processor utilization rate is too high, as the client computing device is currently executing another application, for example to stream content via the network 165 . In these and other examples the interface management component 140 can determine that the interface is unavailable and can eliminate the interface as a candidate for rendering the content item or the action data structure.
- the interface management component 140 can determine that a candidate interface accessible by the first client computing device 150 is linked to an account of an end user, and that a second candidate interface accessible by a second client computing device 150 is also linked to the same account.

- the data processing system 105 can determine, with end user consent, that an end user has accessed an account from different client computing devices 150 .
- These multiple interfaces can be separate instances of the same interface (e.g., the same app installed on different client computing devices 150 ) or different interfaces such as different apps for different social media accounts that are both linked to a common email address account, accessible from multiple client computing devices 150 .
- the interface management component 140 can also determine or estimate distances between client computing devices 150 associated with candidate interfaces.
- the data processing system 105 can obtain, with user consent, an indication that the input audio signal originated from a smartphone or virtual reality headset computing device 150 , and that the end user is associated with an active smartwatch client computing device 150 . From this information the interface management component can determine that the smartwatch is active, e.g., being worn by the end user when the end user enters the input audio signal into the smartphone, so that the two client computing devices 150 are within a threshold distance of one another.
- the data processing system 105 can determine, with end user consent, the location of a smartphone that is the source of an input audio signal, and can also determine that a laptop account associated with the end user is currently active.
- the laptop can be signed into a social media account indicating that the user is currently active on the laptop.
- the data processing system 105 can determine that the end user is within a threshold distance of the smartphone and of the laptop, so that the laptop can be an appropriate choice for rendering of the content item via a candidate interface.
- the interface management component 140 can select the interface for the content item based on at least one utilization value indicating that the selected interface is the most efficient for the content item. For example, from among candidate interfaces, the interface to render the content item at the smartwatch uses the least bandwidth due as the content item is smaller and can be transmitted with fewer resources. Or the interface management component 140 can determine that the candidate interface selected for rendering of the content item is currently charging (e.g., plugged in) so that rendering of the content item by the interface will not drain battery power of the corresponding client computing device 150 . In another example, the interface management component 140 can select a candidate interface that is currently performing fewer processing operations than another, unselected interface of for example a different client computing device 150 that is currently streaming video content from the network 165 and therefore less available to render the content item without delay.
- the interface management component 140 (or other data processing system 105 component) can convert the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the candidate interface. For example, if the candidate interface is a display of a smartwatch, smartphone, or tablet computing device, the interface management component 140 can size the content item for appropriate visual display given the dimensions of the display screen associated with the interface. The interface management component 140 can also convert the content item to a packet or other protocol based format, including proprietary or industry standard format for transmission to the client computing device 150 associated with the selected interface.
- the interface selected by the interface management component 140 for the content item can include an interface accessible from multiple client computing devices 150 by the end user. For example, the interface can be or include a social media account that the end user can access via the client computing device 150 that originated the input audio signal (e.g., a smartphone) as well as other client computing devices such as tabled or desktop computers or other mobile computing devices.
- the interface management component 140 can also select at least one candidate interface for the action data structure.
- This interface can be the same interface from which the input audio signal was obtained, e.g., a voice activated assistant service executed at a client computing device 150 .
- This can be the same interface or a different interface than the interface management component 140 selects for the content item.
- the interface management component 140 (or other data processing system 105 components) can provide the action data structure to the same client computing device 150 that originated the input audio signal for rendering as audio output as part of the assistant service.
- the interface management component 140 can also transmit or otherwise provide the content item to the selected interface for the content item, in any converted modality appropriate for rendering by the selected interface.
- the interface management component 140 can provide the action data structure as audio output for rendering by an interface of the client computing device 150 responsive to the input audio signal received by the same client computing device 150 .
- the interface management component 140 can also provide the content item for rendering by a different interface of the same client computing device 150 or of a different client computing device 150 associated with the same end user.
- the action data structure e.g., “it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach on Saturday” can be provided for audio rendering by the client computing device as part of an assistant program interface executing in part at the client computing device 150
- the content item e.g., a text, audio, or combination content item indicating that “sunscreen is available from the convenience store near the beach”
- an interface of the same or a different computing device 150 such as an email or text message accessible by the same or a different client computing device 150 associated with the end user.
- Separating the content item from the action data structure and sending the content item as, for example, a text message rather than an audio message can result in reduced processing power for the client computing device 150 that accesses the content item since, for example, text message data transmissions are less computationally intensive than audio message data transmissions.
- This separation can also reduce power usage, memory storage, or transmission bandwidth used to render the content item.
- the data processing system 105 can process thousands, tens of thousands or more input audio signals simultaneously so the bandwidth, power, and processing savings can be significant and not merely incremental or incidental.
- the interface management component 140 can provide or deliver the content item to the same client computing device 150 (or a different device) as the action data structure subsequent to delivery of the action data structure to the client computing device 150 .

- the action data structure can indicate “it will be sunny and 80 degrees at the beach on Saturday, would you like to hear about some services to assist with your trip?”
- the data processing system 105 can receive another audio input signal from the client computing device 150 in response to the prompt “would you like to hear about some services to assist with your trip?” such as “sure”.

- the data processing system 105 can also initiate a conversion or other activity associated with the content item, such as ordering a car service responsive to a response to the action data structure or to the content item, based on data center utilization rates or bandwidth metrics or requirements of the network 165 or of a data center that includes the data processing system 105 .
- the data processing system 105 can identify a conversion, or initiate a conversion or action.
- Processors of the data processing system 105 can invoke the direct action API 135 to execute scripts that facilitate the conversion action, such as to order a car from a car share service to take the end user to or from the beach.
