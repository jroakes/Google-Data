- Layout transition analyzer 140 further analyzes layout transition features and candidate block segments output by segmenter 110. Layout transition analyzer 140 then determines whether the candidate block segments belong to a same article in the material based on the layout transition features. [0042]
- Combiner 150 identifies whether the candidate block segments analyzed by language statistics analyzer 130 and layout transition analyzer 140 belong to the same article.

- media material analyzer 100 and its components, including segmenter 110 and article composer 120, will be described in further detail below with respect to a method for analyzing media material data shown in FIG. 2.
- a method for analyzing data from media material 200 is provided (FIG. 2).
- method 200 will be described with reference to media material analyzer 100 but is not necessarily intended to be limited to the structure of media material analyzer 100.
- step 210 block segments associated with columnar body text in the media material are identified.
- FIG. 3 shows in further detail an example routine for carrying out the block segmentation of step 210 (steps 305-320).
- this block segmentation routine is described with respect to an example image 410 of a newspaper page as shown in FIG. 4.
- data 105 includes pixel data representing image 410.
- the pixel data is made up of pixel values representing the intensity of an image at a particular picture element (pixel) location. Pixel values can be any type of pixel value including, but not limited to, grayscale, color, binary, or other type of pixel data.
- segmenter 110 analyzes pixels in the image data to identify regions having similar pixel value change complexity. All of the pixels or a sample of pixels can be analyzed. Segmenter 110 analyzes pixel value changes along horizontal and vertical directions from each pixel being analyzed. These regions of similar pixel value change complexity can include block segments. In particular, for regions that cover columnar body text arranged in a layout having gutters or other borders, block segments of body text are obtained.
- segmenter 110 can start with the smallest values and do a flood-fill with tolerance.
- Data 105 can also include text data associated with image data of a media material layout.
- OCR optical character recognition
- media material analyzer 100 can include an OCR module (not shown) that generates OCR data associated with scanned image data or electronic image data.
- segmenter 110 associates the text data with the corresponding image regions identified as having similar pixel value change complexity in step 310. Segmenter 110 can also identify the text sizes in the text data, and in particular, can identify a body text size associated with columnar body text. In this way, block segments of text data that are candidates for belonging to an article having the body text size can be identified.
- a loop 315' (steps 510-550) is used in place of loop 315.
- segmenter 110 analyzes OCR text data extracted from the image data to find words. Segmenter 110 maps words found in the text data to an initial set of the regions identified in step 310 as having similar pixel value change complexity (step 520). Segmenter 110 determines the text sizes in the text data of the regions, and in particular, can identify a body text size associated with columnar body text (step 530). Segmenter 110 determines which regions are associated with columnar body text (step 540).
- Segmenter 110 then adjusts an initial set of the regions with columnar body text
- segmenter 110 further associates the columnar body text data with the corresponding final set of image regions. For example, to determine which text is body text, a comparison can be done that compares the text size against a dominant text size with a given tolerance.
- a comparison can be done that compares the text size against a dominant text size with a given tolerance.
- step 220 article composer 120 determines which candidate block segments belong to the same article(s) based on language statistics information and layout transition information. This combination of language statistics and layout transition can improve accuracy beyond what either would achieve alone.
- step 220 includes a routine 600 (steps 610-630).
- Language statistics analyzer 130 carries out routine 600.
- Routine 600 calculates a match score for pairs of candidate block segments output by segmenter 110. The match score is calculated according to a score function. For a particular block of text (preferably with more than 30 words) compute how frequent each word is in the block relative to the entire corpus. If the word forms X percent of the words in the article and Y percent of the words in the corpus, then the exact formula used is log((X/Y)+l). For each block, a vector of values is obtained. Using these vectors to take the cosine distance between pairs of blocks, gives a score ranging from 1 (exact match) to 0 (no overlap in words).
- step 620 language statistics analyzer 130 computes a set of language statistics probabilities that pairs of candidate block segments belong to the same article based on the calculated match score and training data 135.
- This training data 135 includes probability data obtained from a training set and/or user input. Such training can be carried out with same media material if available (such as, for the example of FIG. 4, image data for 1000 pages of other issues of the newspaper). Otherwise, training for language statistics purposes can be done with different media material.
- step 620 given a score function between pairs of blocks
- language statistics analyzer 130 computes the probability of two arbitrary blocks being from the same article. If there is access to a large collection of articles for the language, split the articles into blocks of various sizes. Use the pairs from the same article as positive examples, and pairs from separate articles as negative examples. If there is no such data, one can instead use the OCRed document itself to pick out blocks that are definitely the same article (same segmented region), and blocks that are almost definitely different (different page/issue, or far away). Given a pair of blocks with a specific word length and cosine distance, look at the similar examples and find what proportion are positive examples. Depending on the number of data points, this is improved with a kernel smoother or local regression.
- language statistics analyzer 130 identifies blocks belonging to the same article based on the probabilities determined. For example, if probability is over 50% then block segments may be identified as belonging to the same article. In one example where accuracy is relatively important, if probability is over 90% then block segments are identified as belonging to the same article. These are illustrative. Other probability thresholds can be used.
- match score function and use of cosine distance and word frequencies is illustrative and not intended to limit the present invention.
- Other relevance techniques known now or developed in the future may be used to determine or score relevance of two blocks of text.
- layout transition analysis can be carried out in training mode or in a run mode.
- step 220 includes a training mode routine 700 and a run mode routine 900.
- Layout transition analyzer 140 can operate in a training mode or a run mode. In a training mode, layout transition analyzer 140 operates over aggregated data from multiple samples of a media material to build a layout transition classifier 145. In a run mode, layout transition analyzer 140 applies a layout transition classifier 145 to data in a media material layout being analyzed. Training Mode
- Layout transition analyzer 140 carries out training mode routine 700.
- Layout transition analyzer 140 analyzes a layout of media material for vertical transitions (FIG. 7A, steps 710-760) and horizontal transitions (FIG. 7B, steps 770-796).
- step 710 layout transition analyzer 140 finds pairs of block segments of body text aligned vertically, such that one block is above the other with no blocks of body text in between the vertically aligned blocks (Fig. 7A). These pairs of vertically aligned block segments can be found in the block segments output from segmenter 110. For example, in the newspaper page shown in FIG. 8, a pair of block segments 810, 830 may be identified as vertically aligned.
- Intervening items located in a layout in between pairs of vertically aligned block segments are identified (step 720).
- the pairs of block segments are then classified based on any one or more of the intervening item(s) (step 730).
- intervening items 820 are a horizontal rule, line of text, underline, horizontal rule, line of text, horizontal rule.
- One class may then be blocks separated by specific transition features of these items, such as, a horizontal rule, line of text of 16pt, underline, horizontal rule, line of text of 24 pt, and horizontal rule.
- layout transition analyzer 140 calculates a set of transition features for the classified block segments (step 740).
- the set of transition features calculated may be the total vertical separation of blocks, how well the blocks align, width of rule relative to width of blocks, text font size, text line width relative to width of blocks, etc.
- a list of the vertical transition features that can be used for pairs of block segments includes: (1) average width of the top and bottom blocks, (2) vertical distance between the top and bottom blocks, (3) difference between the widths of the top and bottom blocks as a fraction of the average width when there are blocks of non-body text in between, (4) left extent of the top and bottom blocks, (5) right extent of the top and bottom blocks, (6) top of the top and bottom blocks, (7) bottom of the top and bottom blocks, 8) distance between the top and bottom of the top and bottom blocks, (9) distance between left and right of the top and bottom blocks, (10) average font size in these top and bottom blocks, and (11) maximum font size in these top and bottom blocks.
- transition features are illustrative and not intended to limit the present invention.
- the exact set of transition features to be calculated depends upon the desired accuracy needed for the classifier 145 being trained and the complexity of media material. Simpler layouts may require less transition features to be calculated. More complex layouts or applications where accuracy is relatively important may warrant larger sets of transition features to be calculated.
- the exact set of features to be calculated can be subject to manual or automatic change. Manual changes can be carried out based on input from a user through user-interface 160.
- step 750 layout transition analyzer 140 determines probabilities of block segments being in the same articles. For each class in step 730 and set of vertical transition features, there is a number of vertical transition features which are summarized by a sequence of numbers. Also, from the output of language statistics analyzer 130 there is known a probability of the transition being part of an article.
- a layout transition classifier 145 such as, a decision tree, can now be automatically formed (step 760) in order to maximize the likelihood of the partition of block segments when the segments are not in the same article.
- This classifier 145 can be used to decide for each vertical transition whether to merge the two vertically-aligned blocks. In this way, the vertically aligned block segments are now a collection of maximal columns and ready for analysis of horizontal transitions.
- This training to form layout transition classifier 145 based on vertical transition features can be carried out over an aggregation of available data, such as, multiple block segments from one or more images. In an example, not intended to limit the invention, training can be carried out over a large collection of images, such as, a 100 or more pages from different issues of a newspaper to form layout transition classifier 145.
- step 770 layout transition analyzer 140 finds pairs of block segments of body text aligned horizontally, such that one block is beside the other with no blocks of body text in between the horizontally aligned blocks (FIG. 7B). These pairs of horizontally aligned block segments can be found in the block segments output from segmenter 110. For example, in the newspaper page shown in FIG. 8, a pair of block segments 840, 850 may be identified as horizontally aligned.
- Intervening items located in a layout in between pairs of horizontally aligned block segments are identified (step 780).
- the pairs of block segments are then classified based on any one or more of the intervening item(s) (step 790).
- the intervening item is a gutter.
- One class may then be blocks separated by a specific transition features of these item(s), such as, a gutter and its width.
- layout transition analyzer 140 calculates a set of transition features for the classified block segments (step 792).
- the set of transition features calculated may be a gutter and its width, the total horizontal separation of blocks, how well the blocks align, etc.
- a list of the horizontal transition features that can be used for pairs of block segments or regions of body text of about the same average text size and located beside each other includes: (1) distance between right edge of right block and left edge of left block, (2) vertical alignment of tops of left and right blocks, (3) horizontal distance between left and right blocks, (4) difference between width of the two left and right blocks, and (5) relationship to nearby non-body text.
- Such a relationship to nearby non-body text transition feature can involve, for instance, finding the block of non-body text closest to the top of the left block and the block closest to the top of the right block, and computing for each nearby non-body text block: a vertical distance of the non-body text block from the furthest of the two left and right blocks, a vertical distance of the non-body text block from the closest of the two left and right blocks, a left extent of the non-body text block past the left block, a right extent of the non-body text block past the right block, a distance of the non-body text block from the average of the tops of the two left and right blocks, a distance of the non-body text block from the average of the bottoms of the two left and right blocks, a width of non- body text block, a height of non-body text block, a font size in non-body text block, and a number of words in the non-body text block.
- transition features are illustrative and not intended to limit the present invention.
- the exact set of transition features to be calculated depends upon the desired accuracy needed for the classifier 145 being trained and the complexity of media material. Simpler layouts may require less transition features to be calculated. More complex layouts or applications where accuracy is relatively important may warrant larger sets of transition features to be calculated.
- the exact set of features to be calculated can be subject to manual or automatic change. Manual changes can be carried out based on input from a user through user-interface 160.
- layout transition analyzer 140 determines probabilities of block segments being in the same articles. For each class in step 790 and set of horizontal transition features, there is a number of transition features which are summarized by a sequence of numbers. Also, from the output of language statistics analyzer 130 there is known a probability of the transition being part of an article.
- a layout transition classifier 145 such as, a decision tree, can now be automatically formed (step 796) in order to maximize the likelihood of the partition of block segments when the segments are not in the same article. This classifier 145 can be used to decide for each horizontal transition whether to group the two horizontally-aligned blocks in the same article. In this way, the maximal columns of block segments are further grouped horizontally when they belong to the same article.
- This training to form layout transition classifier 145 based on horizontal transition features can be carried out over an aggregation of available data, such as, multiple block segments from one or more images.
- training can be carried out over a large collection of images, such as, a 100 or more pages from different issues of a newspaper to form layout transition classifier 145.
- this layout transition analysis can supplement language statistics analysis to improve the accuracy of articles being composed.
- the use of a classifier 145 that classifies block segments based on vertical and horizontal transition features in a layout means that even if a pair of block segments seem unrelated based on language statistics alone, but fit a pattern of several strongly related pairs, a combiner 150 can still put the pair as part of the same article. In this way, this combination of language statistics and layout transition can improve accuracy beyond what either would achieve alone.
- the media material analysis routine 200 resulted in about a 90% accuracy in telling whether two blocks were from the same article.
- Media material analysis routine 200 combined these predictions over a large collection of pages, in order to find rules that are generally true. For example, if two blocks usually have unrelated text when they are separated by 16-20pt Helvetica text, then this is likely to be an article separator.
- this method forms an estimate of the language statistics probabilities and generates an approved set of probabilities based on layout transition features, this process can be iterated as new data is analyzed, with each run potentially adding a bit more information to improve classifier accuracy.
- training classifier 145 can be used by layout transition analyzer 140 operating in a run mode to compose articles.
- the run mode is similar to the training mode described above with respect to FIG.
- Layout transition analyzer 140 carries out run mode routine 900. Layout transition analyzer 140 analyzes a layout of media material for vertical transitions (FIG. 9A, steps 710-740 and 910) and horizontal transitions (FIG. 9B, steps 770-792 and 920).
- layout transition analyzer 140 In run mode, layout transition analyzer 140 carries out steps 710-740 for pairs of vertically-aligned block segments as described above. Instead of building a classifier 145, layout transition analyzer 140 applies classifier 145, such as, a decision tree, to determine whether vertically-aligned block segments belong in the same article (step 910).
- classifier 145 such as, a decision tree
- layout transition analyzer 140 carries out steps 770-792 for pairs of horizontally-aligned block segments as described above.
- Layout transition analyzer 140 applies classifier 145, such as, a decision tree, to determine whether horizontally-aligned block segments belong in the same article (step 920).
- results output during running of the media material analyzer 100 in run mode may be used to also modify a classifier 145 so that the classifier is updated periodically as new data 105 is analyzed.
- layout transition analysis can be done based on layout transition features without splitting up process flow into the two parts. Also, instead of looking at blocks of body text, one could form a tree structure for all elements on the page, and attempt to form rules for transitions between any two types of elements.
- FIGs. 1OA to 1OD show example media material including pages of a newspaper analyzed according to embodiments of the present invention.

- Other navigational controls (not shown) can be provided to enable a user to scroll, zoom in, zoom out, or otherwise change the display of media information presented to a user.
- the layout segmentation makes it possible to understand what is an article or a cohesive entity and index it as one unit (thereby improving indexing and retrieval). It will also make it possible to conveniently zoom in on articles, extract articles in context, reflow the textual information without actually presenting text, etc. In other words, it enables a powerful and convenient user experience for navigating scanned newspapers and magazines - and in fact, it also applied to electronic sources (e.g., PDF).
- PDF electronic sources
- an embodiment of media material analyzer 100 can use language statistics to learn the role of various geometric elements, and to compute rules specific to a media material such as a newspaper.
- Such an analyzer and method does not need any example segmentations in training data, and works purely from the language statistics determined from the image and OCR output.
- a media material analyzer can keep a list of best guesses for the articles, allowing a user at a user-interface to see an alternative for a part if something is wrong. The user will generally want do this until finding the option that is most easily readable.
- the article composer can update the choices in real-time by modifying the probabilities, thus learning tricky areas from the user's choices.
- a technique of using the language statistics in aggregate over many pages in order to discover common rules can be used to solve several other problems.
- further analysis may be carried out to determine block segments in an article that continues between pages of a newspaper. Analysis of whether article portions on different pages belong in the same continuing article is done using language statistics and continuation layout transition information.
- a media material analyzer 1300 includes components of media material analyzer 100, described above, and further includes an article composer 1320 having continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 and continuation layout analyzer 1340.
- Continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 and continuation layout analyzer 1340 can be included in article composer 1320 as shown in FIG.13.
- continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 and continuation layout analyzer 1340 can be provided separately or combined, or can be added respectively as part of language statistics analyzer 130 and layout transition analyzer 140.
- Continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 and continuation layout analyzer 1340 can be implemented in software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof.
- Media material analyzer 1300 analyzes data representative of media material having a layout including one or more continuing articles that extend across multiple pages.
- Media material analyzer 1300 includes a controller 105, segmenter 110, and article composer 1320.
- Segmenter 110 identifies block segments associated with columnar body text in the media material pages as described above.
- Article composer 1320 determines which of the identified block segments belong to a continuing article extending across multiple pages in the media material based on language statistics information and continuation transition information.
- Controller 102 controls and manages segmenter 110 and article composer 1320.
- a user can initiate operation or initiate input of data 105, training data 1335 or layout transition classifier 1345.
- a user may interact with media material analyzer 1300 to help create or review training data 1335.
- a user can select positive and negative examples of block segments belonging to continuing articles extending across multiple pages in a given media material layout to improve the quality of training data 1335.
- a user may also interact with media analyzer 1300 to build or modify layout transition classifier 1345.
- Training data 1335 can include positive and negative examples of block segments belonging to continuing articles in a media material.
- Layout transition classifier 1345 can include, but is not limited to, a data structure that contains continuation transition feature information which allows candidate block segments to be classified as belonging to an article in a media material.
- Such a data structure can include, but is not limited to, a decision tree.
- Training data 135 and classifier 145 described above in FIG. 1 can also be used with media material analyzer 1300, and in particular, can be used separately or as part of training data 1335 and classifier 1345 respectively.
- article composer 1320 includes a language statistics analyzer
- Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 applies a decision tree 1345 to pick out one or more continuation transition features indicative of the probabilities of last and first block segments of candidate article portions on different pages being in the same continuing article.
- Continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 calculates language statistics information for different article portions on different pages and determines probabilities that first and last block segments in candidate article portions have continuing article portions based on the calculated language statistics information. In this way, article composer 1320 can compose a continuing article across multiple pages based on the probabilities that the first and last block segments belong to the same continuing article in accordance with the analyzed continuation layout transition features and the calculated language statistics.
- the probabilities calculated herein can include, but are not limited, yes/no or Boolean value indications, numeric values representing probability or confidence data, or numeric ranges of values representing probability or confidence data.
- Routine 1400 begins after segmenter 110 has identified block segments in data 105, and language statistics analyzer 130, layout transition analyzer 140, and combiner 150 have combined the block segments in articles on pages of the media material as described above with respect to FIGs. 1-10.
- continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 identifies last block segments associated with candidate continuing article portions. For example, continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 may look at all columnar blocks and identify block segments which are the last block segments in articles. Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 then identifies one or more items below the last block segment (step 1404). Such items may be words (such as, “continued,” “cont,” “see”, or “go to") or layout items (such as an arrow or line, drawing box) appearing at the end of a last block.
- Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 classifies the last block segment based on at least one feature of the identified one or more items (step 1406).
- Features of the items may include the items themselves or characteristics about the items and layout. For example, features for a word “continued” may be the font size, font style, spacing or placement of the term “continued”, and/or simply the presence of the term “continued” itself. Classifying these features may help place blocks with common features in respective groups. For example, blocks with a drawing box below them may be classified in one group while blocks with a term “continued” below them are put in another group.
- Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 then applies decision tree 1345 to pick out one or more continuation transition features indicative of the probability of the last block segment being in a continuing article (step 1408).
- Continuation transition features may be those features associated with a higher probability that the last block has a continuing article portion on another page.
- continuation transition features in an example layout may be the features associated with the term "continued on" at 12 point in italics and an arrow in 12 point.
- continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 searches article portions on later pages from the pages the last blocks are on (FIG. 14B, step 1410).
- Continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 calculates language statistics information for article portions on successive pages from the first page of the continuing article (step 1412), and determines a probability that the last block segment in the candidate continuing article portion has a continuing article portion based on the calculated successive language statistics information (step 1414).
- the language statistics information may be word frequency information
- continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 may calculate match scores based on word frequencies in text in the last block segment and text in the article portions on successive pages. Probabilities of the last block segment having a continuing article portion can then be determined based on the match scores.
- Training data 1335 can also be used to determine probabilities from match scores.
- continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 identifies a first block segment associated with a candidate continuing article in a successive page (step 1416). For example, continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 may look at all columnar blocks and identify block segments which are the first block segments in articles. Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 identifies one or more items above the first block segment (step 1418). Such items may be words (such as, “continued from,” or “cont. from”) or layout items (such as an arrow, line, or other symbol) appearing above a first block.
- Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 then classifies the first block segment based on at least one feature of the one or more identified items (step 1420).
- Features of the items may include the items themselves or characteristics about the items and layout. For example, features for a word “continued” may be the font size, font style, spacing or placement of the term “continued”, and/or simply the presence of the term “continued” itself. Classifying these features may help place blocks with common features in respective groups. For example, blocks with a drawing box above them may be classified in one group while blocks with a term “continued” above them are put in another group.
- Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 applies a decision tree 1345 to pick out one or more continuation transition features indicative of the probability of the first block segment being in a continuing article (step 1422). Continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 then may determine a probability of the first block segment being in a continuing article based on the applied decision tree 1345 (step 1424).
- Such continuation transition features depending upon a particular layout, may be those features associated with a higher probability that the first block has a continuing article portion on an earlier page.
- continuation transition features in an example layout may be the features associated with the term "continued from" at 12 point in italics.
- continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 searches article portions on earlier pages from the pages the first bocks are on (FIG. 14D, step 1426).
- Continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 calculates language statistics information for article portions on earlier pages from the page of the first block (step 1428), and determines a probability that the first block segment in the candidate continuing article portion is a continuing article portion based on the calculated earlier page language statistics information (step 1430).
- the language statistics information may be word frequency information
- continuation language statistics analyzer 1330 may calculate match scores based on word frequencies in text in the first block segment and text in the article portions on earlier pages. Probabilities of the first block segment being a continuing article portion can then be determined based on the match scores. Training data can also be used to determine probabilities from match scores.
- continuation layout transition analyzer 1340 identifies a candidate pair of the last and first block segments (step 1432), determines a set of continuation transition features for the pair of the last and first block segments (step 1434), and applies decision tree 1345 to determine a probability that the candidate pair of last and block segments belong to a same continuing article across pages in the media material based on the set of determined continuation transition features (step 1436).
- the set of continuation transition features may be expanded by properties having to do with the progression from one article portion to another.
- media material analyzer 1300 can be operated with or without the use of training data 1335 as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art given this description. Without the use of training data 1335, continuation decisions may be based solely on the specific blocks being looking at. For example, media material analyzer 1300 may take a final block in some article, and find the initial block in some article on a different page, such that a language score is maximal. This may work at times, but it has a relatively high chance of making a mistake, just because there may be many possible answers, and the right one likely may not have the best text match within these paragraphs.
- media material analyzer 1300 may be operated with the benefit of predetermined training data 1335 or may be operated in a training mode to obtain or supplement training data 1335.
- the training in essence uses the above approach described with respect to the run mode in Fig. 14, and combines the results over many pages in order to create a more accurate decision tree or classifier 1345. So as in the above there are examples of region pairs on different pages, a description of the transition from one to the other (the features mentioned), and a language score of the pair. Combining these scores (even very weak scores), trends can be extracted and used to build a decision tree or classifier 1345. For example, it may found that if there is a small triangle under the first block or there is the word "cont'd" in the first block, with a certain amount of word overlap between the blocks, then these must be the valid continuation.
- classifier 1345 would need to understand not just (3), but would have to incorporate (1) and (2) into the two halves.
- a single classifier approach is possible, but the above is safer to implement and easier to test.
- FIG. 15 illustrates an example computer system 1500 in which the present invention, or portions thereof, can be implemented as computer-readable code.
- media material analyzer 100 carrying out method 200 of FIG. 2 and media material analyzer 1300 carrying out method 1400 of FIG. 14, can be implemented in system 1300.
