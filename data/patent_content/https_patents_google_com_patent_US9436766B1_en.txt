Definitions
- Some resources permit users to post or otherwise provide content for an associated portion of the resource, such as a web page. These users may generate a large amount of unstructured content that implicitly or explicitly indicate each user's interests.
- the resource may further allow third-party content providers to provide third-party content items resources.
- Third party content providers may include advertisers or other providers of goods and/or services.
- a first-party content provider of a resource devoted to golf may allow an online retailer that sells golf clubs to place third-party content items on the resource.
- the third-party content provider may compensate the first-party content provider based on one or more measurements of traffic to the resource.
- the third-party content provider may pay the first-party content provider based on the number of impressions, i.e., the number of times the third-party content items were displayed on the resource to users. In another example, the third-party content provider may pay the first-party content provider based on the number of users that clicked on the third-party content items and were redirected to the third-party content provider's resource and/or made a purchase from the third-party content provider's resource.
- One implementation is a computerized method for associating an interest with a first device identifier.
- the method can include receiving, at one or more processing systems, a post from a social network associated with a device identifier.
- the one or more processing systems may determine one or more keywords of the post and may associate the post with an entry of a labeled document set based upon the keyword(s) of the post.
- the one or more processing systems may determine an interest of the posted based upon the association of the post with the entries that are associated with a known interest.
- the interest may be associated with the device identifier such that a request from a user device associated with the device identifier to effect the display of content on a user device associated with the device identifier, such as an advertisement, may be provided based, at least in part, on the interest.
- a system for selecting user content may include one or more processing modules operable to receive data indicative of a post to a social network that is associated with a device identifier.
- the one or more processing modules may be further operable to receive data indicative of one or more labeled documents each associated with a known interest.
- the one or more processing modules may determine keywords for the post and the labeled documents. Using these keywords, the one or more processing modules may associate the post with one or more of the labeled documents. This association may permit an interest of the post to be determined and for data to effect the display of content on a user device associated with the device identifier based, in part, on the interest.
- a computerized method for associating interests with a device identifier may include one or more processing systems receiving posts associated with the device identifier from a social network and labeled document sets associated with known interests. Each labeled document may have one or more entries associated with an interest. The one or more processing systems may determine keywords for the posts and entries to generate one or more clusters of posts and/or entries. The one or more processing systems may determine an interest of one or more posts based upon the relevant cluster. The interest may be associated with the device identifier to effect the display of content on a user device associated with the device identifier related to the interest in response to a request from a user device.

- FIG. 9 is an example illustration of an electronic display showing an example resource having recommended interest groups, a recommended associated identifiers, and third-party content.
- a user may consent to the use of data to be used for receiving content that may be of interest to the user.
- Content may include advertisements for goods and/or services or other content.
- a user may allow certain information about the user's online behavior to be stored and analyzed, to determine topics that may be of interest to the user. For example, history data regarding resources visited by the user, comments, or other content uploaded by a user, and other online actions may be analyzed to determine topics of interest to the user.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- an interest of a user may be determined by analyzing the online postings, comments, or other user-generated content expressed by the user. For example, golf may be determined as an interest of a user that discusses various golf courses, golf clubs, or other associated topics.
- text written by a user may be analyzed to determine a user's interests. For example, an email, online article, blog entry, comment, or similar text from the user may be analyzed to discern the user's interests.
- a user's interactions via a social networking system may be analyzed to determine potential interests of the user.
- a social networking system refers to any computerized platform that allows a user to create a profile and associate the profile with that of other users whom the user deems as social connections or with groups of interest to the user. For example, a user may associate her profile with that of her friends, family, co-workers, classmates, or the like. Actions performed by the user within the social networking system may also be analyzed to determine the user's interests. For example, groups joined by the user, content recommended by the user to other users, links provided by the user, comments by the user on other users' posts, comments by other users' on the user's posts, ratings provided by the user, and similar actions may be analyzed to determine the interests of the user. Such interests may be utilized to provide suggestions of interest groups associated with the user's interests, suggestions of others users to connect with, or to provide other content relevant to the user's interests.
- a first-party content provider may participate in an advertising or other content network. Participating in such a network may allow any number of different forms of third-party content to be presented with a resource of the first-party provider.
- the resource may be modified to cause a user's device to retrieve content, such as an advertisement, from a server of the content network (e.g., from a different source than that of the resource, such as an advertisement network or agency).
- the retrieved third-party content may then be displayed as being part of the resource or in conjunction with the display of the resource (e.g., in another browser tab, in a pop-up window, etc.).
- an advertisement may be retrieved and displayed when a web page is loaded.
- Different third-party content may be selected by the server of the content network.
- the resource may display a first advertisement to a first user and a second advertisement to a second user.
- different third-party content providers can provide different third-party content items for a particular resource, without the first-party content provider having to modify the code of the resource each time a new content item is to be displayed.
- Third-party content provided by a content network may be selected based on whether the third-party content is deemed to be relevant to a particular user associated with a device identifier. Rather than selecting a content item to be provided on a resource based on the content of the resource itself, the selection of third-party content may take into account the interest associated with a user associated with a device identifier. For example, a device identifier may be associated with visiting a resource of an online retailer, which may in turn be associated with an interest in knowing when the retailer is running a sale.
- the association of the device identifier with the interest may then be used to select an advertisement for such a sale, regardless of the content of the resource being displayed to a user of the user device associated with the device identifier. For example, assume that a user using a user device associated with a device identifier visits a resource of an online retailer of golf clubs and then visits a resource devoted to finance. The device identifier may be associated with an interest in golf, based on the visit to the retailer's resource. When the user device associated with the device identifier is used to visit the financial resource, a content item for a sale on golf clubs may be provided for display on the user device, even though the financial resource is unrelated to golf.

- user device 102 may display third-party content item 312 with the retrieved resource on electronic display 116 .
- content selection server 104 may instead select third-party content items already stored on user device 102 and provide an indication of the selection to user device 102 .
- user device 102 may retrieve the pre-stored third-party content item from memory 114 and display the third-party content item with the displayed resource.
- process 400 enables third-party content items to be selected based, at least in part, on one or more interests associated with a device identifier.
- Process 400 may be implemented by any number of computing devices.
- process 400 may be implemented by a content selection server, such as content selection server 104 shown in FIG. 1 .
- process 400 may be implemented by a content selection server working in conjunction with one or more content sources (e.g., a social networking server, another web server, etc.).
- process 400 may be implemented by a user device, such as user device 102 shown in FIG. 1 .
- Process 400 may include receiving one or more posts (block 402 ). Examples of such posts may include posts 220 , 250 shown in FIG. 2 . Such posts may be received by a content selection server, such as content selection server 104 shown in FIG. 1 , or by a user device, such as user device 102 also shown in FIG. 1 .

- the one or more posts may include posts originating from the identifier, such as post 220 , and/or may include posts originating from other identifiers to which the relevant identifier, such as identifier 222 , replied.
- the one or more posts may be limited to only the portions of posts with which the identifier is associated, such as main post field 224 and/or a specific reply, without including the content of posts or replies associated with other identifiers.
- the one or more posts may include the post or replies associated with other identifiers.
- the one or more posts may include a hyperlink to other content, such as a third-party resource. Such content may be retrieved and included with the corresponding post in the set of posts.
- receiving the one or more posts may include receiving one or more posts associated with several identifiers. For example, posts may be collected from identifiers associated with specific group, having a specific trait, having a specific account type, etc.
- the one or more posts may be received from all identifiers, a subset of identifiers, or a single identifier for a temporal period. For example, all posts from all identifiers for the past 24 hours may be received as a set of posts.
- Process 400 may include adding one or more labeled document sets to the set of posts received (block 404 ).
- An example of a labeled document set 500 is shown in FIG. 5 .
- labeled document set 500 includes an interest identifier 510 and one or more entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 associated with interest identifier 510 .

- entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 may be manually added to the labeled document set 500 .
- entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 may be retrieved from a known source associated with interest identifier 510 , such as posts from a baseball forum or an existing baseball interest group found on the social network, either manually or through an automated process.
- additional entries may be added to labeled document set 500 from previously unlabeled posts, such as posts 220 , 250 shown in FIG. 2 , once the unlabeled posts are determined as pertaining to interest identifier 510 , as will be described in greater detail herein.
- Interest identifier 510 may similarly be manually included or may be automatically set as the title of the group from which entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 originated.

- FIG. 6 illustrates an example of such an extraction of keywords from a set 600 containing the one or more posts and the one or more entries.
- Posts 220 , 250 and entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 may be textually analyzed to determine one or more keywords present within the content of each.
- the text of post 220 may be parsed by a server to determine various keywords in the text, such as keywords 602 , 604 , 606 , 608 , 610 of “baseball,” “game,” “Ramblers,” “won,” and “games,” respectively.
- the text of post 620 may undergo tokenization to divide the content into smaller portions for analysis.
- a statistical measure of the frequency of a term within a body of text may then be used to determine the top keywords of the text and/or to remove common words (such as “a,” “the,” etc.).
- TF-IDF term frequency-inverse document frequency
- Normalization may also be applied to the content of post 220 to normalize numbers, hyperlinks, etc.
- image recognition may be used to determine one or more keywords associated with a digital image (e.g., an image on a resource viewed by a user using a user device associated with a device identifier, an image shared with a social connection, an uploaded image, etc.).
- a digital image e.g., an image on a resource viewed by a user using a user device associated with a device identifier, an image shared with a social connection, an uploaded image, etc.
- an uploaded image of an automobile may be analyzed using image recognition to determine the keywords of automobiles, cars, driving, etc.
- the image recognition may employ facial recognition.
- an image of a famous baseball player may be analyzed to determine that keywords such as the name of the specific athlete, sports, baseball, pitcher, etc.
- keywords 612 , 614 of “Ramblers” and “game” may be extracted from post 250 .
- Keyword 616 of “first baseman” may likewise be extracted from entry 520 .
- Keywords 618 , 620 of “baseball” and “game” may be extracted from entry 530 .
- Keywords 622 , 624 of “struck out” and “eighth inning” may be extracted from entry 540 .
- Keywords 626 , 628 of “Ramblers” and “Marksmen” may be extracted from entry 550 .
- keywords 616 , 618 , 620 , 622 , 624 , 626 , 628 for entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 may be predetermined and need not be extracted.
- process 400 may only extract keywords from unlabeled posts 220 , 250 .
- process 400 may include applying a clustering algorithm to the set of one or more posts and the one or more entries (block 408 ).
- the clustering algorithm may include a distributed exchange algorithm.
- the distributed exchange algorithm clusters together posts and entries that have similar keywords to maximize the likelihood that clustered posts and entries are related to a common topic.
- the distributed exchange algorithm attempts to maximize a mutual information metric, MI(t i ,d j ), which is determined by the following equation:
- MI ⁇ ( t i , d j ) ⁇ P ⁇ ( t i , d j ) ⁇ log ⁇ ( P ⁇ ( t i , d j ) P ⁇ ( t i ) ⁇ P ⁇ ( d j ) )
- t is the set of keywords in a given document
- d is the set of documents in the set
- P(t i ,d j ) is the probability distribution of term t i in a given document d j
- i, j are indexes for the keywords in the set of keywords t and the documents in the set d, respectively.
- Each post and entry is considered as an individual document in the set d.
- the higher the mutual information metric score e.g., the larger the value of MI(t i ,d j )
- the more keywords are in common for the documents in a given cluster and the more distinct each cluster is from the other clusters.
- the mutual information metric will likely have a high score.
- the mutual information metric will likely have a low score.
- the clustering algorithm may stop after a predetermined number of iterations (for example, 50 iterations) or the clustering algorithm may stop if the difference between the value of the mutual information metric for the previous iteration and value of the mutual information metric for the next iteration is less than a predetermined value (for example, ⁇ MI(t i ,d j ) ⁇ 0.0001).
- the clustering algorithm may result in each cluster having one or more labeled entries and/or one or more unlabeled posts.
- FIG. 7 an example of a cluster 700 is shown after applying a clustering algorithm to a set of unlabeled posts 220 , 250 and entries 520 , 530 , 540 , 550 .
- post 220 includes both the text from main post field 224 and replies 238 , 242 as a single document, though this is merely optional.
- the applied clustering algorithm clusters the posts and entries with the highest number of keywords in common.
- keywords 606 , 612 , 626 refer to the “Ramblers”
- keywords 604 , 610 , 614 , 620 refer to “game”
- keywords 602 , 618 refer to “baseball.”
- posts 220 , 250 and entries 530 , 550 are likely to be clustered together to form cluster 700 due to the high number of common keywords.
- cluster 700 is merely an example and other clusters may be formed as a result of applying the clustering algorithm.
- clustering algorithm to the set of one or more posts and one or more entries
- other clustering algorithms may be applied as well.
- K-means clustering hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms, and/or other clustering algorithms.
- the application of other clustering algorithms may utilize metrics other than the mutual information metric to maximize the likelihood that clustered posts and entries are related to a common topic.
- process 400 may include determining an interest associated with each of the one or more clusters (block 410 ).
- one or more labeled entries and/or one or more unlabeled posts may be included in each cluster.
- the interest having the highest number of labeled entries in the cluster may be used to determine the interest associated with that cluster.
- a topic purity metric may be applied to each cluster to determine the strength of the prevalent interest.
- the topic purity metric compares the number of labeled entries for a given interest in a cluster against the total number of labeled entries in that cluster. For example, if a cluster has 10 labeled entries, of which 8 relate to baseball, then the topic purity for that cluster would be 0.8 or 80%. More specifically, the topic purity metric can be represented by the following equation:
- LE t is the number of labeled entries for a given interest in the cluster
- n is the number of different labeled interests
- t is the index for the number of different labeled interests.
- Max (LE t ) returns the interest with the highest number of labeled entries in the cluster.
- the cluster may be associated with the prevalent interest regardless of the topic purity.
- the cluster may need to exceed a predetermined topic purity value, such as 80% topic purity, before the cluster is associated with the prevalent interest. If the cluster falls below the predetermined topic purity value, the cluster may be considered a “mixed interest” or “undetermined” cluster.
- Process 400 may include associating the one or more unlabeled posts with the determined interest of the cluster (block 412 ).
- the unlabeled posts in the cluster can be associated with that prevalent interest. For example, if the prevalent interest of a cluster is determined as “baseball,” the unlabeled posts in that cluster may be associated with the interest of “baseball.”
- An interest may be a single category or may be part of a hierarchy or a hierarchical taxonomy of interests.
- “baseball” may be a stand-alone interest category or may be part of a hierarchy, such as Entertainment ⁇ Sports ⁇ Baseball, where baseball is a sub-category of sports, which is, in turn, a sub-category of entertainment.
- the unlabeled posts may be associated with only baseball, with baseball and sports, with baseball, sports, and entertainment, or any combination thereof.
- the unlabeled posts may be associated with “mixed interest” or may remain unlabeled.
- Process 400 may also include associating a device identifier with the interest (block 414 ).
- an identifier such as identifier 222 shown in FIG. 2
- the device identifier may also be associated with the prevalent interest. For example, once posts 220 , 250 are associated with the interest of baseball, the device identifier associated with posts 220 , 250 may also be associated with the interest of baseball.
- multiple identifiers may be associated with the prevalent interest if multiple identifiers are associated with posts in the given cluster. For example, referring back to FIG.
- post 220 may be associated with identifiers 222 , 236 , 240 for “Jen P.,” “Bob Z.,” and “Joe B.,” respectively. Accordingly, if post 220 is associated with the interest of baseball, identifiers 222 , 236 , 240 may be associated with the interest of baseball as well. Consequently, the relevant device identifiers associated with identifiers 222 , 236 , 240 may also be associated with the interest of baseball.
- Process 400 may include selecting content for display on the user device associated with the device identifier based on the associated interest (block 416 ). Such selection may be based upon a model 800 , such as that shown in FIG. 8 .
- Model 800 illustrates that an identifier 810 may be associated with a post 820 , which may be associated with a cluster 830 , which may be associated with an interest 840 , which may be associated with a content taxonomy 850 , which may be associated with a content 860 .
- content 860 may be an existing interest group on a social network pertaining to interest 840 that may be selected and recommended for identifier 810 .
- identifier 810 associated with interest 840 of baseball may have content 860 of an interest group pertaining to fans of baseball and/or for a specific team determined to be of relevance to identifier 810 . Such a determination may be dependent upon content taxonomy 850 and/or interests 840 associated with identifier 810 . For example, if identifier 810 is associated with interests 840 of baseball, soccer, tennis, etc., all of which may be under the broader category of sports in content taxonomy 850 , then a content 860 of a more general nature, such as content relating to sports equipment, may be selected.
- Such recommendations may be provided as part of a resource, such as via inputs 910 , 920 of resource 900 shown in FIG. 9 .
- the application displaying resource 900 may cause the user device, such as user device 102 shown in FIG. 1 , to transmit data to a remote device via the network, such as network 106 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the user device may transmit data to the content source that provides resource 900 (e.g., content source 108 or 110 shown in FIG. 1 ) and/or to another server located on the network.
- input received via resource 900 may be stored locally (e.g., in the memory of the user device). In the implementation shown in FIG.
- selection of input 910 may associate the identifier with the recommended group. For example, selection of input 910 may associate the identifier for “Jen Poe” with the existing interest group “Fans of the Ramblers.” Similarly, selection of input 920 may associate the identifier for “Jen Poe” with the existing interest group “Baseball Fans.”
- the recommendations may be text indicating the identifier may be interested in the recommended existing interest group.
- the recommendation may take the form of a hyperlink to the existing interest group's social networking resource. Still other actions associated with the recommendation may be presented to the identifier associated with the interest.
- content 860 may be a second identifier, such as that of another user, having one or more similar interests 840 that may be recommended to identifier 810 so that the two users of the social network may choose to connect with one another.
- identifier 810 having an interest in a specific team, such as the Ramblers may have a second identifier also having an interest in the Ramblers recommended as a new social connection for identifier 810 .
- Such a recommendation may also be provided as part of a resource, such as input 930 shown in FIG. 9 .
- the application displaying resource 900 may cause the user device, such as user device 102 shown in FIG.
- selection of input 930 may associate the first identifier with the recommended second identifier.
- selection of input 930 may associate the identifier for “Jen Poe” with the identifier for “Bob Z.” It should be understood that any number of other identifiers may be suggested to the first identifier.
- the recommendation may be text indicating the first identifier may be interested in connecting with the second identifier.
- the recommendation may take the form of a hyperlink to a social networking resource associated with the second identifier. Still other actions associated with the recommendation may be presented to identifier 810 associated with interest 840 .
- content 860 may be a third-party content item, such as an advertisement or other third-party content item, that may be selected based on identifier 810 being associated with interest 840 .
- a content request from a user device operated by a user and associated with a device identifier may be sent to a content selection server.
- Such a request may include a device identifier or other form of data used by the server to determine that the request is associated with identifier 810 .
- the content selection server may select content 860 from a content taxonomy 850 based, at least in part, on whether content 860 is related to the interest 840 .
- an interest 840 in the baseball team the Ramblers may be determined and a third-party content item to buy tickets to a Rambler's game may be selected to be displayed on the user device associated with identifier 810 when the user device is displaying a resource (e.g., in response to receiving a third-party content request or the like).
- a third-party content item may be provided as part of a resource devoted to the topic (e.g., a resource associated with baseball) or may be provided as part of an unrelated resource.
- a third-party content item 950 may be included on a social network resource 900 for identifier 810 , as shown in FIG. 9 . The selection and presentation of the third-party content item may occur in accordance with the process shown and described in reference to FIG. 3 and/or otherwise.
- the content selection server may conduct an auction in which different third-party content providers compete to provide relevant content items to identifier 810 .
- advertisers may specify which interests 840 on which they wish to bid.
- an online retailer of golf equipment may choose to bid in advertisement auctions involving identifiers 810 associated with an interest 840 of golf.
- the content selection server may select content 860 based on interest 840 and without first receiving a content request (i.e., the content selection server may “push” content 860 to a user device associated with identifier 810 ).
- an interest 840 may be used to select or recommend other forms of content 860 for identifier 810 .
- content 860 may include the latest scores for baseball games that may be provided automatically (e.g., without further user action) to identifier 810 associated with an interest 840 in baseball.
- an interest 840 may be self-reported by a post, user profile, and/or resource.
- an interest 840 of a user profile may be explicitly identified by the user.
- Interest 840 may then be directly associated with identifier 810 for that user and utilized to recommend existing interest groups, similar users, advertisements and/or other third-party content.
- the unlabeled posts may be added to a corresponding labeled document set. For example, once posts 220 , 250 have been associated with the interest of baseball, which corresponds to the interest identifier 510 of labeled document set 500 , posts 220 , 250 may be appended or otherwise added to labeled document set 500 to enlarge the set and improve the available labeled entries. Thus, the number of labeled entries may expand as a result.
- multiple interests 840 may be associated with identifier 810 via process 400 .
- interests 840 may be ranked according to the number of posts concerning each interest. For example, a user may have 40 posts about baseball, 5 about art, and 5 about running. Interest 840 may be assigned a higher rank than the interests about art or running due to the high number of posts. Accordingly, content 860 associated with baseball may be more frequently selected.
- the temporal relationship of the posts may be utilized to also rank interests 840 . For example, if the posts by a user about baseball mostly occurred over a year ago and the posts about art and running were more recent, then the interests of art and running may be ranked higher such that content 860 relevant to those more recent interests is presented to the user.

Abstract
Description
where t is the set of keywords in a given document, d is the set of documents in the set, P(ti,dj) is the probability distribution of term ti in a given document dj, and i, j are indexes for the keywords in the set of keywords t and the documents in the set d, respectively. Each post and entry is considered as an individual document in the set d. In short, the higher the mutual information metric score (e.g., the larger the value of MI(ti,dj)), the more keywords are in common for the documents in a given cluster and the more distinct each cluster is from the other clusters.
where LEt is the number of labeled entries for a given interest in the cluster, n is the number of different labeled interests, and t is the index for the number of different labeled interests. Max (LEt) returns the interest with the highest number of labeled entries in the cluster. Thus, both the prevalent interest and the purity of that interest for the cluster can be determined. In some implementations, the cluster may be associated with the prevalent interest regardless of the topic purity. In other implementations, the cluster may need to exceed a predetermined topic purity value, such as 80% topic purity, before the cluster is associated with the prevalent interest. If the cluster falls below the predetermined topic purity value, the cluster may be considered a “mixed interest” or “undetermined” cluster.
