Definitions
- This specification relates to Internet search engines.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources, e.g., web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia content, that are relevant to a user's information needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Internet search engines generally return a set of search results, each identifying a respective resource, in response to a user-submitted query.
- This specification describes technologies that relate to evaluating aspects of the rendering of a resource on devices, e.g., a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile phone, and so on, and, in some embodiments, generating mobile-friendliness scores for the resources based on the evaluation.
- a score that represents the degree to which a resource is optimized for viewing and control or other interaction on mobile devices can effectively be computed.
- a tool may be provided to a resource developer to evaluate their resource for various characteristics relating to the quality and ease of use of the resource when rendered on a mobile device.
- Feedback may be provided to the developer by the tool to permit the developer to modify general or specific aspects of the resource to improve the quality and ease of use of the resource when rendered on a mobile device.
- the score to adjust the ranking of search results or to modify search results to indicate that certain search results identify mobile-friendly resources, the quality of search results provided to users of a search engine that submit queries from mobile devices can be improved.
- the user experience of users of a search engine that interact with the search engine using mobile devices can be improved by allowing users to easily access resources that are optimized for viewing on mobile devices. If resource load speed is used as a mobile-friendliness signal, users can more easily access resources that load quickly on their mobile device, even if the device is on a slow network.

- the mobile-friendliness score for a resource represents the degree to which the resource has been optimized for viewing and control on mobile devices.
- the system can use the score for any of a variety of purposes. For example, the system can use the score in ranking search results. As another example, the system can use the score to modify search results to indicate that certain search results identify mobile-friendly resources. As another example, the system can use the score in providing results of a mobile-friendliness analysis to users.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system 114 .
- the search system 114 is an example of an information retrieval system implemented as computer programs on one or more computers in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below are implemented.
- a user 102 can interact with the search system 114 through a user device 104 .
- the user device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 104 can be a computer, e.g., a smartphone or other mobile device, coupled to the search system 114 through a data communication network 112 , e.g., local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks, any of which may include wireless links.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the search system 114 provides a user interface to the user device 104 through which the user 102 can interact with the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 can provide a user interface in the form of web pages that are rendered by a web browser running on the user device 104 , in an app installed on the user device 104 , e.g., on a mobile device, or otherwise.
- a user 102 can use the user device 104 to submit a query 110 to the search system 114 .
- a search engine 130 within the search system 114 performs a search to identify resources matching the query.
- the query 110 may be transmitted through the network 112 to the search system 124 .
- the search system 114 includes an index 122 and the search engine 130 .
- the search system 114 responds to the search query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network 112 to the user device 104 for presentation to the user 102 , e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 104 .
- the search engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources, an index 122 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- the search system 114 includes or can communicate with a mobile-friendliness system 150 .
- the mobile-friendliness system 150 can analyze the resource to determine a mobile-friendliness score for the resource.
- the mobile-friendliness score represents a degree to which the resource has been optimized for viewing on mobile devices.
- a mobile device is a user computer with a reduced viewing area, e.g., that has a small display size, that is capable of receiving and interacting with resources over a network.
- the viewing area necessary to qualify a device as a mobile device may be different in different implementations. For example, some implementations may focus on optimizing for smart phones, e.g., devices with a display size of 5 inches or smaller. Some other implementations may also focus on optimizing for certain sizes of tablets, e.g., devices with a display size of 7 inches or smaller. Yet other implementations may focus on optimizing for smartwatches or other wearables, e.g., devices with a display size of 50 mm or smaller.
- the requirements for qualification as a mobile device by the system may be provided as adjustable parameters by a system administrator or other entity.
- the mobile-friendliness system 150 can associate the mobile-friendliness score for the resource with the resource in a search engine index, e.g., in the index 122 or in another index accessible to the search system 114 . Generating a mobile-friendliness score for a resource is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the mobile-friendliness system 150 can use the score for any of a variety of purposes.
- the search system 114 can determine whether the search query was received from a mobile device, e.g., from data received with the search query characterizing the device that submitted the search query, and provide data to the mobile-friendliness system 150 classifying the search query as having been submitted by a mobile device.
- the mobile-friendliness system 150 can use the mobile-friendliness scores to modify scores generated by the search engine 130 for resources identified by search results for the search query. Modifying scores using mobile-friendliness scores is described below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the mobile-friendliness system 150 can use the mobile-friendliness scores to modify certain ones of the search results for the search query to include an indication that the resource identified by the search result is mobile-friendly. Modifying search results using mobile-friendliness scores is described below with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B .
- the mobile-friendliness system 150 can allow users to submit data identifying resources, e.g., uniform resource locators (URLs) of the resources, and, in response, can use the mobile friendliness scores to provide information identifying whether or not the identified resource is mobile-friendly, to provide information identifying how the resources' mobile-friendliness scores may be improved, or both. Analyzing the mobile-friendliness of a resource in response to a user request using mobile-friendliness scores is described below with reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B .
- URLs uniform resource locators
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for computing a mobile-friendliness score for a resource.
- the process 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform the process 200 .
- the system receives data identifying a resource (step 202 ).
- the system can obtain data identifying resources that have been crawled by a search engine and calculate a mobile-friendliness score for each of the identified resources.
- the system requests the resource from the site that hosts the resource (step 204 ).
- the system requests the resource from the site as a mobile agent. That is, the system indicates to the site that the resource is being requested for presentation on a mobile device.
- the system receives a resource document from the site in response to the request (step 206 ).
- the system renders the resource document (step 208 ).
- the system renders the resource document using a headless browser.
- a headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. That is, the headless browser renders the resource document to generate a rendered resource document but then stores the rendered resource document rather than providing the rendered document for presentation in a graphical user interface.
- Rendering the resource document may include considering external resources of the resource document, executing any JavaScript required by the resource document, and applying any Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) included in the resource document.
- CSS Cascading Style Sheets
- the system evaluates the result of the rendering to determine a respective signal score for each of one or more mobile-friendliness signals (step 210 ). That is, the system analyzes the rendered resource document and, optionally, data in the resource document before it was rendered in order to determine the signal scores.
- the mobile-friendliness score can be based on an evaluation of any of a variety of mobile-friendliness signals.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a plugin signal.
- the score for the plugin signal is dependent on the amount of content of the rendered resource document that requires a plugin to display.
- the system may determine the proportion of the content in the rendered document that requires a plugin and compute the score from the proportion, e.g., the score may be equal to or proportional to the determined proportion.
- the proportion of content in the rendered document may be measured in terms of area in the rendered document, i.e., so that the proportion of content that requires a plugin is the proportion of the total area of the rendered document that includes content requiring a plugin.
- the system maintains data identifying particular plugins, i.e., non-standard plugins, plugins associated with rendering problems or having other undesirable characteristics, or plugins known to not be commonly supported by mobile devices.
- the system can consider only the amount of content that requires one of these particular plugins to display.
- the signal score for the plugin signal can be dependent on how many of the particular plugins are required to properly render the resource document, with resources requiring more of the particular plugins receiving higher signal scores.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a viewport configuration signal.
- the score for the viewport configuration signal is dependent on how, if at all, the resource document configures the viewport for the document.
- the viewport controls how the document is displayed on different devices and is generally configured using a tag, e.g., a meta viewport tag, in the head of the document or another portion of the document.
- a tag e.g., a meta viewport tag
- no viewport is specified for the document, and mobile devices generally will render the page at a fallback width that is suboptimal for viewing on the mobile device, e.g., because it will require users to zoom to interact with or properly view the document.
- the tag may set the viewport to a specific width or may instruct the mobile device rendering the document to set the viewport to adapt to the device on which the document is being rendered, e.g., by matching the width of the document to the width of the display of the mobile device in device independent pixels.
- the system in order to determine the signal score for the viewport configuration signal, the system maintains a mapping between multiple possible viewport configurations and signal scores, e.g., no viewport specified may be mapped to a first score, one or more possible fixed width viewports may each be mapped to a respective second score, and viewports that adapt to different devices may be mapped to a third score.
- viewports that adapt to different devices may be mapped to the lowest score and no viewport being specified may be mapped to the highest score.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a viewable area signal.
- the score for the viewable area signal is dependent on how much of the total content area of the document is visible.
- the system computes the proportion of the total content area that is visible after the document has been rendered and determines the score for the viewable area signal from the proportion, with higher proportions being assigned lower signal scores and lower proportions being assigned higher signal scores.
- the signal score may be proportional to the inverse of the viewable proportion or may be proportional to (1 ⁇ viewable proportion).
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a tap target signal.
- a tap target is a button, link, form field, or other user interface element that is configured to be selectable by or interact-able with by a user viewing the document.
- the score for the tap target signal is dependent on whether tap targets in the rendered document are too close together, are too small to be interacted with effectively, or both.
- the system determines a count of tap targets that are within a threshold distance of another tap target in the rendered document.
- the score for the tap target signal is dependent on how many tap targets are too small, the system determines a count of tap targets that are less than a threshold size in the rendered document.
- the system then computes the score for the tap target signal from the count or counts, with documents having larger counts being assigned larger signal scores. For example, the score for the tap target signal may be proportional to the sum of the counts.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a text size signal.
- the score for the text size signal is dependent on how much of the text of the document is too small to be effectively viewed on a mobile device.
- the system computes the proportion of the total text in the rendered resource document that is less than a threshold size and determines the score for the viewable area signal from the proportion, with higher proportions being assigned higher signal scores and lower proportions being assigned lower signal scores.
- the signal score may be proportional to the too small proportion.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a resource load speed signal that measures how quickly the resource loads.
- the resource load speed can be computed based on the time it took from the time that the resource document was requested to the time that the resource document was fully rendered by the system.
- the resource load speed can be computed from a sample of load times for the resource. Generally, the longer the load time for the resource, the higher the signal score for the resource load speed signal. For example, the signal score can be proportional to the load time.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a data usage signal that measures how much data is required to be received by the system over a network to properly render the resource.
- the received data may include the resource document received from the host site and, optionally, any external data required to be requested and received from external resources in order to properly render the resource.
- the signal score may be proportional to the amount of data that is required.
- the mobile-friendliness signals can include a processor load signal that measures how much processing power is required to properly render the resource, to scroll or interact with the resource, or both.
- a processor load signal that measures how much processing power is required to properly render the resource, to scroll or interact with the resource, or both.
- the more processing power that is required the higher the signal score for the processor load signal.
- the signal score may be proportional to the amount of processing power required.
- the system computes a mobile-friendliness score for the resource from the one or more signal scores (step 212 ).
- the system combines the signal scores, e.g., by computing a sum, weighted sum, product, weighted product, a measure of central tendency of the signal scores, and so on, to generate an overall signal score for the resource.
- the system then computes the mobile-friendliness score from the signal scores, with higher mobile-friendliness scores indicating a higher degree of optimization for viewing on mobile devices.
- the system applies a squashing function to the overall signal score to map the signal score to a predetermined range, e.g., 0 to 25, 0 to 50, 0 to 100, or 0 to 1000, and then subtracts the output of the squashing function from the largest number in the range to determine the mobile-friendliness score.
- a squashing function to map the signal score to a predetermined range, e.g., 0 to 25, 0 to 50, 0 to 100, or 0 to 1000, and then subtracts the output of the squashing function from the largest number in the range to determine the mobile-friendliness score.
- the system associates the mobile-friendliness score for the resource with the resource in an index (step 214 ), e.g., an index of a search engine or a different index maintained by the system.
- the system also stores the signal scores for the various mobile-friendliness signals for the resource in the index.
- the system can use the score in ranking search results for search queries that have been classified as being submitted from a mobile device. Using the score to adjust search result rankings is described below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system can use the score to modify certain search results to indicate that the search results identify resources that are mobile-friendly. Modifying search results using the score is described in more detail below with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B .
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for adjusting initial search result ranking scores for resources using mobile-friendliness scores.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform the process 300 .
- the system receives a search query (step 302 ).
- the system obtains search results for the search query from a search engine (step 304 ). Each of the search results identifies a respective search result resource.
- the system obtains a respective initial ranking score for each of the search result resources (step 306 ).
- the initial ranking score for a given search result resource is generated for the search result resource by the search engine and may represent the quality of the search result resource, the relevance of the search result resource to the search query, or both.
- the system obtains data classifying the search query as having been submitted to the search engine by a mobile device (step 308 ). For example, when the query is received by the search engine, the search engine may classify the search query as having been received by a mobile device from information that is received with the search query, i.e., information characterizing the device that submitted the search query.
- the system identifies, for each of the search result resources, the mobile-friendliness score that is associated with the search result resource in a search engine index (step 310 ).
- the mobile-friendliness score for a given search result resource represents the degree to which the resource has been optimized for viewing on a mobile device, determined, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system adjusts the initial ranking score for each of the search result resources using the mobile-friendliness scores for the search result resource to generate a modified score for each of the search result resources (step 312 ). For example, the system can multiply the initial ranking score for the search result resource by the mobile-friendliness score for the search result resource or add the mobile-friendliness score to the initial ranking score to generate the modified score for the search result resource.
- the system scales the mobile-friendliness score, e.g., by applying a squashing function to the mobile-friendliness score to map the score to a predetermined range or by scaling the mobile-friendliness score by a predetermined constant factor.
- the system ranks the search results according to the modified scores for the resources identified by the search results and then provides the search results for presentation to a user ordered according to the ranking. In some other implementations, the system makes further adjustments to the modified scores before ranking the search results and providing them for presentation or provides the modified scores to a different system that further adjusts the modified scores prior to ranking the search results.
- FIG. 4A is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for modifying search results to indicate mobile-friendliness.
- the process 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.

- the system identifies, for each of the search result resources, the mobile-friendliness score that is associated with the search result resource in a search engine index (step 408 ).
- the mobile-friendliness score may be determined, for example, as described above with respect to FIG. 2 .
- the system determines, for each of the search result resources, whether the mobile-friendliness score for the search result resource exceeds a threshold value (step 410 ).
- the predetermined threshold value may be specified, e.g., by a system administrator or other entity, and may represent a score that a resource's mobile-friendliness score must exceed in order for the resource to be classified as being mobile-friendly.
- the system modifies each search result that identifies a search result resource having a mobile-friendliness score that exceeds the threshold value to indicate that the resource identified by the search result is mobile device friendly, i.e., has been optimized for viewing on a mobile device (step 412 ).
- the system can modify the search result to include the text “Mobile-Friendly” or to include a badge or other icon that is associated with mobile device friendly resources.
- the system provides the search results for presentation to a user, e.g., on the mobile device from which the search query was received.
- the modified search results include the indication that the resource identified by the search result is mobile-friendly.
- a modifier indicating that a resource identified by the search result is mobile-friendly may be presented on any display device, mobile or otherwise.
- the system both adjusts the scores for search result resources using mobile-friendliness scores and modifies search results to indicate mobile-friendliness.
- FIG. 4B shows an example search results presentation 450 .
- the example search results presentation 450 is presented on a display device, e.g., a mobile device, and shows search results for a query “John Example” 452 .
- the search results presentation 450 shows two search results 454 and 456 provided by a search system in response to the query 452 .
- the search result 454 identifies a resource johnexample.com and includes a snippet of text describing the resource and a link to the resource.
- the search result 456 identifies a resource example.com/encyclopedia/johnexample.html and also includes a snippet of text describing the resource and a link to the resource.
- the search result 456 includes an indication 458 of mobile-friendliness.
- the search system determined that the resource example.com/encyclopedia/johnexample.html had a mobile-friendliness score that exceeded a threshold value while the mobile friendliness score for the resource johnexample.com did not exceed the threshold value.
- the search system modified the search result 456 to include the indication 458 while not modifying the search result 454 .
- the indication 458 is the text “Mobile-Friendly,” the indication 458 may instead be, e.g., a badge or other icon that is associated with mobile device friendly resources, other text indicating that the resource is mobile-friendly, and so on.
- FIG. 5A is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for analyzing a resource for mobile-friendliness.
- the process 500 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform the process 500 .

- the system analyzes the identified resource for mobile-friendliness (step 506 ).
- the system accesses an index that associates resources with mobile-friendliness scores for the resources and, optionally, signal scores for mobile-friendliness signals for the resources.
- the system determines, from the index, whether the resource has already been analyzed for mobile-friendliness and, if so, generates the results of the mobile-friendliness analysis from the data in the index. If the resource has not already been analyzed for mobile friendliness and in implementations where the system does not check the index, the system analyzes the resource for mobile-friendliness as described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system provides the results of the analysis for presentation to the user in the user interface (step 508 ).
- the system provides data identifying the mobile-friendliness score for the identified resource.
- the system can provide an indication of whether the resource is mobile-friendly. The system can determine that the resource is mobile-friendly when the mobile-friendliness score for the resource exceeds a threshold value.
- the system also provides an analysis of the signal scores for the mobile-friendliness signals for the resource. For example, the system can provide data identifying the signal score for each mobile-friendliness signal. As another example, the system can provide data that identifies which signals indicate that the resource is mobile-friendly, which signals indicate that the resource is not mobile-friendly, or both. As yet another example, the system can provide data derived from the signal scores that identifies modifications that can be made to the resource to increase the mobile-friendliness score for the resource, i.e., information identifying suggested modifications that would result in an increase in the mobile-friendliness score. For example, if the signal score for the text size signal exceeds a threshold score, the system can include in the analysis an indication that the size of the text in the resource should be increased in order to make the resource more mobile-friendly.

Abstract
Description
- This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/150,782, filed on Apr. 21, 2015. The disclosure of the prior application is considered part of and is incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.
- This specification relates to Internet search engines.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources, e.g., web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia content, that are relevant to a user's information needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user. Internet search engines generally return a set of search results, each identifying a respective resource, in response to a user-submitted query.
- This specification describes technologies that relate to evaluating aspects of the rendering of a resource on devices, e.g., a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile phone, and so on, and, in some embodiments, generating mobile-friendliness scores for the resources based on the evaluation.
- The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular embodiments so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. A score that represents the degree to which a resource is optimized for viewing and control or other interaction on mobile devices can effectively be computed. A tool may be provided to a resource developer to evaluate their resource for various characteristics relating to the quality and ease of use of the resource when rendered on a mobile device. Feedback may be provided to the developer by the tool to permit the developer to modify general or specific aspects of the resource to improve the quality and ease of use of the resource when rendered on a mobile device. Furthermore, by using the score to adjust the ranking of search results or to modify search results to indicate that certain search results identify mobile-friendly resources, the quality of search results provided to users of a search engine that submit queries from mobile devices can be improved. The user experience of users of a search engine that interact with the search engine using mobile devices can be improved by allowing users to easily access resources that are optimized for viewing on mobile devices. If resource load speed is used as a mobile-friendliness signal, users can more easily access resources that load quickly on their mobile device, even if the device is on a slow network.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- This specification generally describes a system that generates mobile-friendliness scores for resources. The mobile-friendliness score for a resource represents the degree to which the resource has been optimized for viewing and control on mobile devices. Once the mobile-friendliness score for a resource has been generated, the system can use the score for any of a variety of purposes. For example, the system can use the score in ranking search results. As another example, the system can use the score to modify search results to indicate that certain search results identify mobile-friendly resources. As another example, the system can use the score in providing results of a mobile-friendliness analysis to users.
-
FIG. 1 shows anexample search system 114. Thesearch system 114 is an example of an information retrieval system implemented as computer programs on one or more computers in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below are implemented. - A
user 102 can interact with thesearch system 114 through auser device 104. Theuser device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106, for storing instructions and data and aprocessor 108 for executing stored instructions. The memory can include both read only and writable memory. For example, theuser device 104 can be a computer, e.g., a smartphone or other mobile device, coupled to thesearch system 114 through adata communication network 112, e.g., local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks, any of which may include wireless links. - In some implementations, the
search system 114 provides a user interface to theuser device 104 through which theuser 102 can interact with thesearch system 114. For example, thesearch system 114 can provide a user interface in the form of web pages that are rendered by a web browser running on theuser device 104, in an app installed on theuser device 104, e.g., on a mobile device, or otherwise. - A
user 102 can use theuser device 104 to submit aquery 110 to thesearch system 114. Asearch engine 130 within thesearch system 114 performs a search to identify resources matching the query. When theuser 102 submits aquery 110, thequery 110 may be transmitted through thenetwork 112 to the search system 124. Thesearch system 114 includes anindex 122 and thesearch engine 130. Thesearch system 114 responds to thesearch query 110 by generatingsearch results 128, which are transmitted through thenetwork 112 to theuser device 104 for presentation to theuser 102, e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on theuser device 104. - When the
query 110 is received by thesearch engine 130, thesearch engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy thequery 110. Thesearch engine 130 will generally include anindexing engine 120 that indexes resources, anindex 122 that stores the index information, and aranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy thequery 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores. - The
search system 114 includes or can communicate with a mobile-friendliness system 150. After a given resource has been crawled by thesearch engine 130, the mobile-friendliness system 150 can analyze the resource to determine a mobile-friendliness score for the resource. The mobile-friendliness score represents a degree to which the resource has been optimized for viewing on mobile devices. - Generally, a mobile device is a user computer with a reduced viewing area, e.g., that has a small display size, that is capable of receiving and interacting with resources over a network. The viewing area necessary to qualify a device as a mobile device may be different in different implementations. For example, some implementations may focus on optimizing for smart phones, e.g., devices with a display size of 5 inches or smaller. Some other implementations may also focus on optimizing for certain sizes of tablets, e.g., devices with a display size of 7 inches or smaller. Yet other implementations may focus on optimizing for smartwatches or other wearables, e.g., devices with a display size of 50 mm or smaller. In some implementations, the requirements for qualification as a mobile device by the system may be provided as adjustable parameters by a system administrator or other entity.
- The mobile-
friendliness system 150 can associate the mobile-friendliness score for the resource with the resource in a search engine index, e.g., in theindex 122 or in another index accessible to thesearch system 114. Generating a mobile-friendliness score for a resource is described in more detail below with reference toFIG. 2 . - Once a resource has been associated with a mobile-friendliness score, the mobile-
friendliness system 150 can use the score for any of a variety of purposes. - For example, when a search query is received by the
search system 114, thesearch system 114 can determine whether the search query was received from a mobile device, e.g., from data received with the search query characterizing the device that submitted the search query, and provide data to the mobile-friendliness system 150 classifying the search query as having been submitted by a mobile device. In response to receiving the data, the mobile-friendliness system 150 can use the mobile-friendliness scores to modify scores generated by thesearch engine 130 for resources identified by search results for the search query. Modifying scores using mobile-friendliness scores is described below with reference toFIG. 3 . - As another example, in response to receiving the data classifying the search query as having been submitted by a mobile device, the mobile-
friendliness system 150 can use the mobile-friendliness scores to modify certain ones of the search results for the search query to include an indication that the resource identified by the search result is mobile-friendly. Modifying search results using mobile-friendliness scores is described below with reference toFIGS. 4A and 4B . - As another example, the mobile-
friendliness system 150 can allow users to submit data identifying resources, e.g., uniform resource locators (URLs) of the resources, and, in response, can use the mobile friendliness scores to provide information identifying whether or not the identified resource is mobile-friendly, to provide information identifying how the resources' mobile-friendliness scores may be improved, or both. Analyzing the mobile-friendliness of a resource in response to a user request using mobile-friendliness scores is described below with reference toFIGS. 5A and 5B . -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of anexample process 200 for computing a mobile-friendliness score for a resource. For convenience, theprocess 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations. For example, a search system, e.g., thesearch system 114 ofFIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform theprocess 200. - The system receives data identifying a resource (step 202). For example, the system can obtain data identifying resources that have been crawled by a search engine and calculate a mobile-friendliness score for each of the identified resources.
- The system requests the resource from the site that hosts the resource (step 204). In particular, the system requests the resource from the site as a mobile agent. That is, the system indicates to the site that the resource is being requested for presentation on a mobile device.
- The system receives a resource document from the site in response to the request (step 206).
- The system renders the resource document (step 208). In some implementations, the system renders the resource document using a headless browser. Generally, a headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. That is, the headless browser renders the resource document to generate a rendered resource document but then stores the rendered resource document rather than providing the rendered document for presentation in a graphical user interface. Rendering the resource document may include considering external resources of the resource document, executing any JavaScript required by the resource document, and applying any Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) included in the resource document.
- The system evaluates the result of the rendering to determine a respective signal score for each of one or more mobile-friendliness signals (step 210). That is, the system analyzes the rendered resource document and, optionally, data in the resource document before it was rendered in order to determine the signal scores. The mobile-friendliness score can be based on an evaluation of any of a variety of mobile-friendliness signals.
- For example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a plugin signal. Because many plugins are not supported by mobile devices, the score for the plugin signal is dependent on the amount of content of the rendered resource document that requires a plugin to display. In particular, the system may determine the proportion of the content in the rendered document that requires a plugin and compute the score from the proportion, e.g., the score may be equal to or proportional to the determined proportion. In some implementations, the proportion of content in the rendered document may be measured in terms of area in the rendered document, i.e., so that the proportion of content that requires a plugin is the proportion of the total area of the rendered document that includes content requiring a plugin. In some implementations, the system maintains data identifying particular plugins, i.e., non-standard plugins, plugins associated with rendering problems or having other undesirable characteristics, or plugins known to not be commonly supported by mobile devices. In some of these implementations, the system can consider only the amount of content that requires one of these particular plugins to display. In some of these implementations, instead of or in addition to being dependent on the amount of content of the rendered resource document that requires a plugin to display, the signal score for the plugin signal can be dependent on how many of the particular plugins are required to properly render the resource document, with resources requiring more of the particular plugins receiving higher signal scores.
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a viewport configuration signal. The score for the viewport configuration signal is dependent on how, if at all, the resource document configures the viewport for the document. In particular, the viewport controls how the document is displayed on different devices and is generally configured using a tag, e.g., a meta viewport tag, in the head of the document or another portion of the document. In particular, if no tag is included, no viewport is specified for the document, and mobile devices generally will render the page at a fallback width that is suboptimal for viewing on the mobile device, e.g., because it will require users to zoom to interact with or properly view the document. If a tag is included in the document, the tag may set the viewport to a specific width or may instruct the mobile device rendering the document to set the viewport to adapt to the device on which the document is being rendered, e.g., by matching the width of the document to the width of the display of the mobile device in device independent pixels. In some implementations, in order to determine the signal score for the viewport configuration signal, the system maintains a mapping between multiple possible viewport configurations and signal scores, e.g., no viewport specified may be mapped to a first score, one or more possible fixed width viewports may each be mapped to a respective second score, and viewports that adapt to different devices may be mapped to a third score. In some implementations, viewports that adapt to different devices may be mapped to the lowest score and no viewport being specified may be mapped to the highest score.
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a viewable area signal. The score for the viewable area signal is dependent on how much of the total content area of the document is visible. In some implementations, the system computes the proportion of the total content area that is visible after the document has been rendered and determines the score for the viewable area signal from the proportion, with higher proportions being assigned lower signal scores and lower proportions being assigned higher signal scores. For example, the signal score may be proportional to the inverse of the viewable proportion or may be proportional to (1−viewable proportion).
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a tap target signal. A tap target is a button, link, form field, or other user interface element that is configured to be selectable by or interact-able with by a user viewing the document. The score for the tap target signal is dependent on whether tap targets in the rendered document are too close together, are too small to be interacted with effectively, or both. When the score for the tap target signal is dependent on how many tap targets are too close together, the system determines a count of tap targets that are within a threshold distance of another tap target in the rendered document. When the score for the tap target signal is dependent on how many tap targets are too small, the system determines a count of tap targets that are less than a threshold size in the rendered document. The system then computes the score for the tap target signal from the count or counts, with documents having larger counts being assigned larger signal scores. For example, the score for the tap target signal may be proportional to the sum of the counts.
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a text size signal. The score for the text size signal is dependent on how much of the text of the document is too small to be effectively viewed on a mobile device. In some implementations, the system computes the proportion of the total text in the rendered resource document that is less than a threshold size and determines the score for the viewable area signal from the proportion, with higher proportions being assigned higher signal scores and lower proportions being assigned lower signal scores. For example, the signal score may be proportional to the too small proportion.
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a resource load speed signal that measures how quickly the resource loads. For example, the resource load speed can be computed based on the time it took from the time that the resource document was requested to the time that the resource document was fully rendered by the system. As another example, the resource load speed can be computed from a sample of load times for the resource. Generally, the longer the load time for the resource, the higher the signal score for the resource load speed signal. For example, the signal score can be proportional to the load time.
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a data usage signal that measures how much data is required to be received by the system over a network to properly render the resource. The received data may include the resource document received from the host site and, optionally, any external data required to be requested and received from external resources in order to properly render the resource. Generally, the more data that is required, the higher the signal score for the data usage signal. For example, the signal score may be proportional to the amount of data that is required.
- As another example, the mobile-friendliness signals can include a processor load signal that measures how much processing power is required to properly render the resource, to scroll or interact with the resource, or both. Generally, the more processing power that is required, the higher the signal score for the processor load signal. For example, the signal score may be proportional to the amount of processing power required.
- It will be appreciated that the above is merely a partial list of possible signals, and many additional possible signals exist. In various implementations, additional signals or alternative signals may be included with or in place of those identified above, and inclusion of those additional signals or absence of those listed above is contemplated herein. Additionally, not all of the signals listed above need be included in computing mobile-friendliness scores.
- The system computes a mobile-friendliness score for the resource from the one or more signal scores (step 212). In particular, to compute the mobile-friendliness score for the resource, the system combines the signal scores, e.g., by computing a sum, weighted sum, product, weighted product, a measure of central tendency of the signal scores, and so on, to generate an overall signal score for the resource. The system then computes the mobile-friendliness score from the signal scores, with higher mobile-friendliness scores indicating a higher degree of optimization for viewing on mobile devices. In some implementations, the system applies a squashing function to the overall signal score to map the signal score to a predetermined range, e.g., 0 to 25, 0 to 50, 0 to 100, or 0 to 1000, and then subtracts the output of the squashing function from the largest number in the range to determine the mobile-friendliness score.
- The system associates the mobile-friendliness score for the resource with the resource in an index (step 214), e.g., an index of a search engine or a different index maintained by the system. In some implementations, the system also stores the signal scores for the various mobile-friendliness signals for the resource in the index.
- Once the resource has been associated with a score, the system can use the score in ranking search results for search queries that have been classified as being submitted from a mobile device. Using the score to adjust search result rankings is described below with reference to
FIG. 3 . - As another example, the system can use the score to modify certain search results to indicate that the search results identify resources that are mobile-friendly. Modifying search results using the score is described in more detail below with reference to
FIGS. 4A and 4B . -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of anexample process 300 for adjusting initial search result ranking scores for resources using mobile-friendliness scores. For convenience, theprocess 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations. For example, a search system, e.g., thesearch system 114 ofFIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform theprocess 300. - The system receives a search query (step 302).
- The system obtains search results for the search query from a search engine (step 304). Each of the search results identifies a respective search result resource.
- The system obtains a respective initial ranking score for each of the search result resources (step 306). The initial ranking score for a given search result resource is generated for the search result resource by the search engine and may represent the quality of the search result resource, the relevance of the search result resource to the search query, or both.
- The system obtains data classifying the search query as having been submitted to the search engine by a mobile device (step 308). For example, when the query is received by the search engine, the search engine may classify the search query as having been received by a mobile device from information that is received with the search query, i.e., information characterizing the device that submitted the search query.
- The system identifies, for each of the search result resources, the mobile-friendliness score that is associated with the search result resource in a search engine index (step 310). The mobile-friendliness score for a given search result resource represents the degree to which the resource has been optimized for viewing on a mobile device, determined, for example, as described above with reference to
FIG. 2 . - The system adjusts the initial ranking score for each of the search result resources using the mobile-friendliness scores for the search result resource to generate a modified score for each of the search result resources (step 312). For example, the system can multiply the initial ranking score for the search result resource by the mobile-friendliness score for the search result resource or add the mobile-friendliness score to the initial ranking score to generate the modified score for the search result resource. In some implementations, prior to using the mobile-friendliness score to adjust the initial ranking score, the system scales the mobile-friendliness score, e.g., by applying a squashing function to the mobile-friendliness score to map the score to a predetermined range or by scaling the mobile-friendliness score by a predetermined constant factor.
- In some implementations, the system ranks the search results according to the modified scores for the resources identified by the search results and then provides the search results for presentation to a user ordered according to the ranking. In some other implementations, the system makes further adjustments to the modified scores before ranking the search results and providing them for presentation or provides the modified scores to a different system that further adjusts the modified scores prior to ranking the search results.

FIG. 4A is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for modifying search results to indicate mobile-friendliness. For convenience, the process 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations. For example, a search system, e.g., thesearch system 114 ofFIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform the process 400. - The system receives a search query (step 402) and obtains search results for the search query from a search engine (step 404).
- The system obtains data classifying the search query as having been submitted to the search engine by a mobile device (step 406).
- The system identifies, for each of the search result resources, the mobile-friendliness score that is associated with the search result resource in a search engine index (step 408). The mobile-friendliness score may be determined, for example, as described above with respect to
FIG. 2 . - The system determines, for each of the search result resources, whether the mobile-friendliness score for the search result resource exceeds a threshold value (step 410). The predetermined threshold value may be specified, e.g., by a system administrator or other entity, and may represent a score that a resource's mobile-friendliness score must exceed in order for the resource to be classified as being mobile-friendly.
- The system modifies each search result that identifies a search result resource having a mobile-friendliness score that exceeds the threshold value to indicate that the resource identified by the search result is mobile device friendly, i.e., has been optimized for viewing on a mobile device (step 412). For example, the system can modify the search result to include the text “Mobile-Friendly” or to include a badge or other icon that is associated with mobile device friendly resources.
- Once the search results have been modified, the system provides the search results for presentation to a user, e.g., on the mobile device from which the search query was received. In particular, when presented on the mobile device, the modified search results include the indication that the resource identified by the search result is mobile-friendly. Although it will be appreciated that, in some implementations, a modifier indicating that a resource identified by the search result is mobile-friendly may be presented on any display device, mobile or otherwise.
- In some implementations, the system both adjusts the scores for search result resources using mobile-friendliness scores and modifies search results to indicate mobile-friendliness.

FIG. 4B shows an examplesearch results presentation 450. The examplesearch results presentation 450 is presented on a display device, e.g., a mobile device, and shows search results for a query “John Example” 452. In particular, thesearch results presentation 450 shows twosearch results query 452. Thesearch result 454 identifies a resource johnexample.com and includes a snippet of text describing the resource and a link to the resource. Thesearch result 456 identifies a resource example.com/encyclopedia/johnexample.html and also includes a snippet of text describing the resource and a link to the resource. However, unlike thesearch result 454, thesearch result 456 includes anindication 458 of mobile-friendliness. In particular, when generating the search results for thequery 452, the search system determined that the resource example.com/encyclopedia/johnexample.html had a mobile-friendliness score that exceeded a threshold value while the mobile friendliness score for the resource johnexample.com did not exceed the threshold value. In response, the search system modified thesearch result 456 to include theindication 458 while not modifying thesearch result 454. While in the example ofFIG. 4B , theindication 458 is the text “Mobile-Friendly,” theindication 458 may instead be, e.g., a badge or other icon that is associated with mobile device friendly resources, other text indicating that the resource is mobile-friendly, and so on. -
FIG. 5A is a flow diagram of anexample process 500 for analyzing a resource for mobile-friendliness. For convenience, theprocess 500 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations. For example, a search system, e.g., thesearch system 114 ofFIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform theprocess 500. - The system provides a user interface for presentation on a user device that allows a user to input a resource identifier for a resource that the user would like analyzed for mobile-friendliness (step 502).
- The system receives a resource identifier, e.g., a URL, of a resource through the user interface (step 504).
- The system analyzes the identified resource for mobile-friendliness (step 506). In some implementations, the system accesses an index that associates resources with mobile-friendliness scores for the resources and, optionally, signal scores for mobile-friendliness signals for the resources. The system determines, from the index, whether the resource has already been analyzed for mobile-friendliness and, if so, generates the results of the mobile-friendliness analysis from the data in the index. If the resource has not already been analyzed for mobile friendliness and in implementations where the system does not check the index, the system analyzes the resource for mobile-friendliness as described above with reference to
FIG. 2 . - The system provides the results of the analysis for presentation to the user in the user interface (step 508). In some implementations, the system provides data identifying the mobile-friendliness score for the identified resource. Instead of or in addition to providing data identifying the mobile-friendliness score, the system can provide an indication of whether the resource is mobile-friendly. The system can determine that the resource is mobile-friendly when the mobile-friendliness score for the resource exceeds a threshold value.
- In some implementations, the system also provides an analysis of the signal scores for the mobile-friendliness signals for the resource. For example, the system can provide data identifying the signal score for each mobile-friendliness signal. As another example, the system can provide data that identifies which signals indicate that the resource is mobile-friendly, which signals indicate that the resource is not mobile-friendly, or both. As yet another example, the system can provide data derived from the signal scores that identifies modifications that can be made to the resource to increase the mobile-friendliness score for the resource, i.e., information identifying suggested modifications that would result in an increase in the mobile-friendliness score. For example, if the signal score for the text size signal exceeds a threshold score, the system can include in the analysis an indication that the size of the text in the resource should be increased in order to make the resource more mobile-friendly.

FIG. 5B shows an example mobile-friendliness analysis presentation 550. The mobile-friendliness analysis presentation 550 was generated by a search system in response to a user request. In particular, thepresentation 550 is an analysis of a resource www.example.com, as requested by a user by inputting the URL for the resource into afield 552 in thepresentation 550. Thepresentation 550 includesinformation 554 characterizing the mobile-friendliness score for the resource as computed by the search system. In the example ofFIG. 5B , theinformation 554 includes the mobile-friendliness score for the resource (“65”) and text characterizing the mobile-friendliness score (“Sorry, your page isn't quite as mobile-friendly as it could be.”). Thepresentation 550 also includesinformation 556 characterizing one of the signal scores for the resource. In particular, in the example ofFIG. 5B , theinformation 556 characterizes the score for the viewport configuration signal that indicates that the viewport is not properly configured (“The viewport for your page is not properly configured.”). Thepresentation 550 also includesinformation 558 derived from the signal scores that identifies a modification that can be made to the resource to increase the mobile-friendliness score for the resource. In the example ofFIG. 5B , theinformation 558 is derived from the signal score for the text size signal and specifies that increasing the size of the text of the resource would increase the mobile-friendliness score (“Increasing the size of the text on your page may make your page more mobile-friendly.”). - Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in tangibly-embodied computer software or firmware, in computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible non-transitory program carrier for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory device, or a combination of one or more of them.
- The term “data processing apparatus” encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.

A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data, e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document, in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files, e.g., files that store one or more modules, subprograms, or portions of code. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable computers executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- Computers suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, can be based on general or special purpose microprocessors or both, or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally, a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processing unit for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device, e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive, to name just a few.
- Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of nonvolatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magnetooptical disks; and CDROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's user device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a backend component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a frontend component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such backend, middleware, or frontend components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), e.g., the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
