Definitions
- This disclosure relates to the retrieval/recommendation of items, and more particularly, to the retrieval/recommendation of items using latent collaborative retrieval.
- a growing number of applications and web pages seamlessly blend the traditional tasks of data retrieval and data recommendation. For example, when a user shops for a product online, the applications and web pages used by the user often recommend items that are similar to the item the user has requested/purchased. However, many retrieval processes do not take into account the user's personal preferences (e.g., other items queried/bought/reviewed) when making such recommendation and instead focus mainly on the item that was queried by the user.
- Another example of retrieval and recommendation may include the automatic creation of playlists for music players. Specifically, a user may request the creation of a playlist of songs based upon a query (e.g., a seed track, an artist, and/or genre). However, the tracks that populate the playlist may not include tracks that are based upon the profile and/or past personal preferences of the user.

- collaborative retrieval may refer to various methodologies for combining data retrieval and data recommendation into a single predictor. For example, if a user enters a query string into e.g., a search engine, a collaborative retrieval process may combine other factors (such as e.g., the user's query history, preferences, and characteristics) with the query string for the purpose of retrieving relevant items and providing a more robust result set.
- factors such as e.g., the user's query history, preferences, and characteristics
- a collaborative retrieval process may consider e.g., the tracks that you previously listened to, the tracks that you previously purchased, and any likes/dislikes identified in your user profile to provide a more targeted result set.
- user 36 is a user of music distribution system 200 that is configured to allow user 36 to review and purchase music tracks.
- Music distribution system 200 may be coupled to and accessed through network 14 .
- user 36 is a member of music distribution system 200 and, accordingly, has a defined user profile (e.g., user profile 202 ).
- User profile 202 may define various pieces of information concerning user 36 , examples of which may include but are not limited to: the purchasing habits of user 36 (via purchase history 204 ), the likes/dislikes of user 36 (via user preferences 206 ), and previous queries executed by user 36 (via previous queries 208 ).
- user 36 is an R&B fan and is looking for new R&B music. Accordingly, user 36 may define query 210 within music distribution system 200 .
- LCR process 10 may be a portion of, included within, or called from within music distribution system 200 .
- LCR process 10 may generate 100 first mathematical representation 212 of query 210 received from user 36 and second mathematical representation 214 of user profile 202 associated with user 36 .
- LCR process 10 may receive query 210 from user 36 who may be using e.g., client device 28 .
- user 36 may enter query 210 via e.g., a web page or custom application associated with music distribution system 200 .
- query 210 may be transmitted to LCR process 10 over network 14 and/or network 18 .
- LCR process 10 may convert query 210 into a numerical representation (e.g., a feature vector or other vector-based representation). For example, assume that LCR process 10 defines a dictionary (e.g., dictionary 216 ) of e.g., one million unique words that are frequently used within queries. Further, assume that each feature vector (e.g., first mathematical representation 212 ) includes one million entities that are mapped to the words included within dictionary 216 (wherein each entity is mapped to one of the one million unique words within dictionary 216 ).
- a dictionary e.g., dictionary 216
- each feature vector e.g., first mathematical representation 212
- each feature vector includes one million entities that are mapped to the words included within dictionary 216 (wherein each entity is mapped to one of the one million unique words within dictionary 216 ).
- the feature vector generated may include one million entities, wherein each binary one within the feature vector is mapped to a word within dictionary 216 that is included within query 210 , while each binary zero within the feature vector is mapped to a word within dictionary 216 that is not included within query 210 .
- the feature vector (e.g., first mathematical representation 212 ) generated 100 for query 210 may include 3 binary ones (identifying the three words within dictionary 216 that are included within query 210 ) and 999,997 binary zeros (identifying the 999,997 words within dictionary 216 that are not included within query 210 ).
- the feature vector (e.g., first mathematical representation 212 ) generated by LCR process 10 may be configured to only define the binary ones (as opposed to also defining all of the binary zeros).
- user profile 202 may identify the purchasing habits of user 36 (via purchase history 204 ), the likes/dislikes of user 36 (via user preferences 206 ), and previous queries executed by user 36 (via previous queries 208 ).
- Purchasing history 204 may include e.g., a list of music files purchased by user 36 , and a list of music files previewed by user 36 .
- User preferences 206 may define e.g., the music genres liked/disliked by user 36 , the favorite artists of user 36 , and wish list items for user 36 .
- User profile 202 may further define user specific characteristics, such as the location of residence, age, gender, or other similar information for user 36 .
- LCR process 10 may convert some or all of user profile 202 into a numerical representation (e.g., a feature vector or other vector-based representation). For example, assume that the portion of user profile 202 that is used by LCR process 10 includes a set of tracks that a user is known to own (e.g., purchase history 204 ). Further and for this example, assume that music distribution system 200 includes a database (e.g., database 218 ) that identifies four million tracks that are available for purchase/preview by user 36 via music distribution system 200 .
- a database e.g., database 218
- LCR process 10 may generate a feature vector (e.g., second numerical representation 214 ) that includes four million entities (one corresponding to each music track defined within database 218 and available via music distribution system 200 ).
- the value of each entity within this feature vector may be a binary zero if user 36 does not own the corresponding music track within database 218 and may be a binary one if user 36 does own the corresponding music track within database 218 .
- the feature vectors for query 210 and user profile 202 are different lengths (one million entities versus four million entities), this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure. Specifically, these two feature vectors may be the same length.
- music distribution system 200 includes a database (e.g., database 218 ) that identifies four million tracks (which also may be stored within database 218 ) that are available for purchase/preview by user 36 via music distribution system 200 .
- a mathematical representation e.g., an item feature vector
- each item feature vector is generated by LCR process 10 based upon the content/characteristics of the related item (i.e., the music track) and is stored within database 218 .
- a plurality of mathematical representations 220 e.g., four million item feature vectors
- LCR process 10 may vary depending upon the type of items being represented. For example, if the items being represented are web pages, LCR process may generate the plurality of mathematical representations 220 in a fashion similar to the manner in which first mathematical representation 212 is generated (e.g., mapping words within the webpages to words within dictionary 216 ). If the items being represented are music tracks, LCR process 10 may establish a track directory (not shown) that defines e.g., every possible music track available and each of the plurality of mathematical representations 220 would map to a single track defined within this track directory.
- a track directory not shown
- each of the plurality of mathematical representations 220 may include 10,000,000 entities, wherein all but one of the entities is a binary zero and the sole binary one identifies the appropriate track within the track directory (not shown).
- LCR process 10 may access 102 this plurality of mathematical representations 220 associated with, in this example, the plurality of music track included within database 218 .
- the plurality of mathematical representations 220 in the example correspond to a plurality of music tracks, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configurations are possible.
- plurality of mathematical representations 220 may correspond to a plurality of products within a product catalog, a plurality of vacation destinations, a plurality of available hotel rooms, a plurality of webpages, or a plurality of books.
- LCR process 10 may retrieve the plurality of mathematical representations 220 (i.e., the plurality of item feature vectors) associated with e.g., the plurality of music tracks within database 218 .
- the plurality of mathematical representations 220 are defined based upon the content/characteristics of each of the tracks included within database 218 , each of the plurality of mathematical representations 220 stored within database 218 may be same length.
- first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 may be different lengths.
- first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 are different lengths, the comparison of these representations becomes difficult.
- first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 are the same length (e.g., common length vectors)
- comparison of first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 is simplified, as LCR process 10 may simply count the number of similar entities within these common length vectors.
- LCR process 10 may perform a dot product operation to determine the level of similarity e.g., between a pair of vectors. However, prior to any similarity measurements being performed, LCR process 10 may transform 104 first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 associated with e.g., the plurality of tracks included within database 218 so that they have a uniform length.
- LCR process 10 When LCR process 10 transforms 104 first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 into the same length, this process may be accomplished in a variety of ways.
- LCR process 10 may normalize first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 to have the same length. Concerning the manner in which this is performed, LCR process 10 may set the uniform length equal to a shortest length of any of first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 .
- LCR process 10 may set the uniform length to be equal to a length that is smaller than the shortest of any of first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 .
- LCR process 104 may perform a transformation matrix operation (using one or more transformation matrices) to transform first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 into a common length.
- LCR process 10 may use machine learning to construct a transformation matrix for each of first mathematical representation 212 , second mathematical representation 214 , and the plurality of mathematical representations 220 .
- first mathematical representation 212 has a length of 10,000.000 entities.
- second mathematical representation 214 has a length of 100,000,000 entities.
- LCR process 10 may use a transformation matrix that may e.g., include 100 sets of 10,000,000 entities (i.e. for a total of 1,000,000,000 entities).
- LCR process 10 may use a transformation matrix that may e.g., include 100 sets of 100,000,000 (i.e. for a total of 10,000,000,000 entities).

Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates to the retrieval/recommendation of items, and more particularly, to the retrieval/recommendation of items using latent collaborative retrieval.
- A growing number of applications and web pages seamlessly blend the traditional tasks of data retrieval and data recommendation. For example, when a user shops for a product online, the applications and web pages used by the user often recommend items that are similar to the item the user has requested/purchased. However, many retrieval processes do not take into account the user's personal preferences (e.g., other items queried/bought/reviewed) when making such recommendation and instead focus mainly on the item that was queried by the user. Another example of retrieval and recommendation may include the automatic creation of playlists for music players. Specifically, a user may request the creation of a playlist of songs based upon a query (e.g., a seed track, an artist, and/or genre). However, the tracks that populate the playlist may not include tracks that are based upon the profile and/or past personal preferences of the user.
- In one implementation, a computer-implemented method for latent collaborative retrieval includes generating a first mathematical representation of a query received from a user and a second mathematical representation of a user profile associated with the user. A plurality of mathematical representations associated with a plurality of items are accessed. The first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items are transformed to have a uniform length. A first result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items is generated based upon, at least in part, a first similarity measurement of the first mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items. A second result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items is generated based upon, at least in part, a second similarity measurement of the second mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items. A result set of items chosen from the plurality of items is generated based upon, at least in part, the first result subset and the second result subset.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items may be vector-based representations. The user profile associated with the user may include one or more of: a query history of the user; one or more items associated with the user; one or more user-specified preferences; and one or more user characteristics. Accessing the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items may include retrieving the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items from a database. The plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items all may have a common length. The computing device may set the common length equal to a shortest length of one or more of the first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items. Transforming the first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items to have the uniform length may include using a transformation matrix operation.
- In another implementation, a computer program product residing on a computer readable medium has a plurality of instructions stored on it. When executed by a processor, the plurality of instructions cause the processor to perform operations including generating a first mathematical representation of a query received from a user and a second mathematical representation of a user profile associated with the user. A plurality of mathematical representations associated with a plurality of items are accessed. The first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items are transformed to have a uniform length. A first result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items is generated based upon, at least in part, a first similarity measurement of the first mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items. A second result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items is generated based upon, at least in part, a second similarity measurement of the second mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items. A result set of items chosen from the plurality of items is generated based upon, at least in part, the first result subset and the second result subset.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items may be vector-based representations. The user profile associated with the user may include one or more of: a query history of the user; one or more items associated with the user; one or more user-specified preferences; and one or more user characteristics. Accessing the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items may include retrieving the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items from a database. The plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items all may have a common length. The computing device may set the common length equal to a shortest length of one or more of the first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items. Transforming the first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items to have the uniform length may include using a transformation matrix operation.
- In another implementation, a computer system including a processor and memory is configured to perform operations including generating a first mathematical representation of a query received from a user and a second mathematical representation of a user profile associated with the user. A plurality of mathematical representations associated with a plurality of items are accessed. The first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items are transformed to have a uniform length.

For example,LCR process 10 may be implemented as a server-side process, a client-side process, or a server-side/client-side process. - Accordingly,
LCR process 10 may be implemented as a purely server-side process viaLCR process 10 s.

Examples ofcomputer 12 may include but are not limited to a single server computer, a series of server computers, a single personal computer, a series of personal computers, a mini computer, a mainframe computer, or a computing cloud. The various components ofcomputer 12 may execute one or more operating systems, examples of which may include but are not limited to: Microsoft Windows Server™; Novell Netware™; Redhat Linux™, Unix, or a custom operating system, for example. - Referring also to
FIG. 2 and as will be discussed below in greater detail,LCR process 10 may generate 100 a first mathematical representation of a query received from a user and a second mathematical representation of a user profile associated with the user.LCR process 10 may access 102 a plurality of mathematical representations associated with a plurality of items and may transform 104 the first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items to have a uniform length.LCR process 10 may generate 106 a first result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items based upon, at least in part, a first similarity measurement of the first mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items.LCR process 10 may also generate 108 a second result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items based upon, at least in part, a second similarity measurement of the second mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items.LCR process 10 may further generate 110 a result set of items chosen from the plurality of items based upon, at least in part, the first result subset and the second result subset. - The instruction sets and subroutines of
LCR process 10 s, which may be stored onstorage device 16 coupled tocomputer 12, may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory architectures (not shown) included withincomputer 12. Examples ofstorage device 16 may include but are not limited to: a hard disk drive; a tape drive; an optical drive; a RAID device; an NAS device, a Storage Area Network, a random access memory (RAM); a read-only memory (ROM); and all forms of flash memory storage devices. -
Network 14 may be connected to one or more secondary networks (e.g., network 18), examples of which may include but are not limited to: a local area network; a wide area network; or an intranet, for example. -
LCR process 10 may be accessed via client-side application 10c 1, client-side application 10 c 2, client-side application 10 c 3, and client-side application 10 c 4. Examples of client-side application 10c 1, client-side application 10 c 2, client-side application 10 c 3, and client-side application 10 c 4 may include but are not limited to a standard web browser, a customized web browser, a game console user interface, a television user interface, or a specialized application (e.g., an application running on a mobile platform).

Storage devices electronic devices personal computer 28,laptop computer 30, data-enabled,cellular telephone 32,notebook computer 34, a server computer (not shown), a data-enabled television (not shown), and a dedicated network device (not shown). -
Users computer 12 andLCR process 10 directly throughnetwork 14 or throughsecondary network 18. Further,computer 12 may be connected to network 14 throughsecondary network 18, as illustrated withphantom link line 44. - The various client electronic devices may be directly or indirectly coupled to network 14 (or network 18). For example,
personal computer 28 is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14 via a hardwired network connection. Further,notebook computer 34 is shown directly coupled tonetwork 18 via a hardwired network connection.Laptop computer 30 is shown wirelessly coupled tonetwork 14 viawireless communication channel 46 established betweenlaptop computer 30 and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) 48, which is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14.WAP 48 may be, for example, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth device that is capable of establishingwireless communication channel 46 betweenlaptop computer 30 andWAP 48. Data-enabled,cellular telephone 32 is shown wirelessly coupled tonetwork 14 viawireless communication channel 50 established between data-enabled,cellular telephone 32 and cellular network/bridge 52, which is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14. - As stated above and as will be discussed below in greater detail,
LCR process 10 may generate 100 a first mathematical representation of a query received from a user and a second mathematical representation of a user profile associated with the user.LCR process 10 may access 102 a plurality of mathematical representations associated with a plurality of items and may transform 104 the first mathematical representation, the second mathematical representation, and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items to have a uniform length.LCR process 10 may generate 106 a first result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items based upon, at least in part, a first similarity measurement of the first mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items.LCR process 10 may also generate 108 a second result subset of items chosen from the plurality of items based upon, at least in part, a second similarity measurement of the second mathematical representation and the plurality of mathematical representations associated with the plurality of items.LCR process 10 may further generate 110 a result set of items chosen from the plurality of items based upon, at least in part, the first result subset and the second result subset. - As used in this document, collaborative retrieval may refer to various methodologies for combining data retrieval and data recommendation into a single predictor. For example, if a user enters a query string into e.g., a search engine, a collaborative retrieval process may combine other factors (such as e.g., the user's query history, preferences, and characteristics) with the query string for the purpose of retrieving relevant items and providing a more robust result set. Accordingly, if the search engine described above is included within a music distribution website/platform, when a user of this search engine enters a query, a collaborative retrieval process may consider e.g., the tracks that you previously listened to, the tracks that you previously purchased, and any likes/dislikes identified in your user profile to provide a more targeted result set.
- Continuing with the above-stated example and referring also to
FIG. 3 , assume thatuser 36 is a user ofmusic distribution system 200 that is configured to allowuser 36 to review and purchase music tracks.Music distribution system 200 may be coupled to and accessed throughnetwork 14. Further, assume thatuser 36 is a member ofmusic distribution system 200 and, accordingly, has a defined user profile (e.g., user profile 202).User profile 202 may define various pieces ofinformation concerning user 36, examples of which may include but are not limited to: the purchasing habits of user 36 (via purchase history 204), the likes/dislikes of user 36 (via user preferences 206), and previous queries executed by user 36 (via previous queries 208). Further, assume thatuser 36 is an R&B fan and is looking for new R&B music. Accordingly,user 36 may definequery 210 withinmusic distribution system 200. - In this particular example,
LCR process 10 may be a portion of, included within, or called from withinmusic distribution system 200. Uponuser 36 definingquery 210,LCR process 10 may generate 100 firstmathematical representation 212 ofquery 210 received fromuser 36 and secondmathematical representation 214 ofuser profile 202 associated withuser 36. In some embodiments,LCR process 10 may receive query 210 fromuser 36 who may be using e.g.,client device 28. Additionally,user 36 may enterquery 210 via e.g., a web page or custom application associated withmusic distribution system 200. Further,query 210 may be transmitted toLCR process 10 overnetwork 14 and/ornetwork 18. - When generating 100 first
mathematical representation 212 ofquery 210,LCR process 10 may convertquery 210 into a numerical representation (e.g., a feature vector or other vector-based representation). For example, assume thatLCR process 10 defines a dictionary (e.g., dictionary 216) of e.g., one million unique words that are frequently used within queries. Further, assume that each feature vector (e.g., first mathematical representation 212) includes one million entities that are mapped to the words included within dictionary 216 (wherein each entity is mapped to one of the one million unique words within dictionary 216). - Accordingly, assume that when
query 210 is processed byLCR process 10 to generate 100 the above-described feature vector (i.e., first mathematical representation 212) representative ofquery 210, the feature vector generated may include one million entities, wherein each binary one within the feature vector is mapped to a word withindictionary 216 that is included withinquery 210, while each binary zero within the feature vector is mapped to a word withindictionary 216 that is not included withinquery 210. - Accordingly, if
query 210 includes three words, the feature vector (e.g., first mathematical representation 212) generated 100 forquery 210 may include 3 binary ones (identifying the three words withindictionary 216 that are included within query 210) and 999,997 binary zeros (identifying the 999,997 words withindictionary 216 that are not included within query 210). In the interest of conserving space, the feature vector (e.g., first mathematical representation 212) generated byLCR process 10 may be configured to only define the binary ones (as opposed to also defining all of the binary zeros). - As discussed above,
user profile 202 may identify the purchasing habits of user 36 (via purchase history 204), the likes/dislikes of user 36 (via user preferences 206), and previous queries executed by user 36 (via previous queries 208).Purchasing history 204 may include e.g., a list of music files purchased byuser 36, and a list of music files previewed byuser 36. User preferences 206 may define e.g., the music genres liked/disliked byuser 36, the favorite artists ofuser 36, and wish list items foruser 36.User profile 202 may further define user specific characteristics, such as the location of residence, age, gender, or other similar information foruser 36. - When generating 100 second
mathematical representation 214 ofuser profile 202,LCR process 10 may convert some or all ofuser profile 202 into a numerical representation (e.g., a feature vector or other vector-based representation). For example, assume that the portion ofuser profile 202 that is used byLCR process 10 includes a set of tracks that a user is known to own (e.g., purchase history 204). Further and for this example, assume thatmusic distribution system 200 includes a database (e.g., database 218) that identifies four million tracks that are available for purchase/preview byuser 36 viamusic distribution system 200. - Accordingly, when generating 100 second
mathematical representation 214 that is representative ofuser profile 202,LCR process 10 may generate a feature vector (e.g., second numerical representation 214) that includes four million entities (one corresponding to each music track defined withindatabase 218 and available via music distribution system 200). The value of each entity within this feature vector may be a binary zero ifuser 36 does not own the corresponding music track withindatabase 218 and may be a binary one ifuser 36 does own the corresponding music track withindatabase 218. - While in this particular example, the feature vectors for
query 210 and user profile 202 (i.e., firstnumerical representation 212 and secondnumerical representation 214, respectively) are different lengths (one million entities versus four million entities), this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure. Specifically, these two feature vectors may be the same length. - As discussed above, assume that
music distribution system 200 includes a database (e.g., database 218) that identifies four million tracks (which also may be stored within database 218) that are available for purchase/preview byuser 36 viamusic distribution system 200. Further, assume that a mathematical representation (e.g., an item feature vector) was generated and is available for each of these four million tracks, wherein each item feature vector is generated byLCR process 10 based upon the content/characteristics of the related item (i.e., the music track) and is stored withindatabase 218. Accordingly, a plurality of mathematical representations 220 (e.g., four million item feature vectors) may be generated that are based upon the plurality of tracks included withindatabase 218. - The manner in which the plurality of
mathematical representations 220 are generated byLCR process 10 may vary depending upon the type of items being represented. For example, if the items being represented are web pages, LCR process may generate the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 in a fashion similar to the manner in which firstmathematical representation 212 is generated (e.g., mapping words within the webpages to words within dictionary 216). If the items being represented are music tracks,LCR process 10 may establish a track directory (not shown) that defines e.g., every possible music track available and each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 would map to a single track defined within this track directory. For example, if the track directory (not shown) identifies 10,000,000 music tracks, each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 may include 10,000,000 entities, wherein all but one of the entities is a binary zero and the sole binary one identifies the appropriate track within the track directory (not shown). -
LCR process 10 may access 102 this plurality ofmathematical representations 220 associated with, in this example, the plurality of music track included withindatabase 218. While the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 in the example correspond to a plurality of music tracks, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configurations are possible. For example, plurality ofmathematical representations 220 may correspond to a plurality of products within a product catalog, a plurality of vacation destinations, a plurality of available hotel rooms, a plurality of webpages, or a plurality of books. - When accessing 202 the plurality of
mathematical representations 220,LCR process 10 may retrieve the plurality of mathematical representations 220 (i.e., the plurality of item feature vectors) associated with e.g., the plurality of music tracks withindatabase 218. As each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 are defined based upon the content/characteristics of each of the tracks included withindatabase 218, each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 stored withindatabase 218 may be same length. - As discussed above, first
mathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 may be different lengths. Unfortunately, when firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 are different lengths, the comparison of these representations becomes difficult. Specifically, when firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 are the same length (e.g., common length vectors), comparison of firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 is simplified, asLCR process 10 may simply count the number of similar entities within these common length vectors. Alternatively,LCR process 10 may perform a dot product operation to determine the level of similarity e.g., between a pair of vectors. However, prior to any similarity measurements being performed,LCR process 10 may transform 104 firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 associated with e.g., the plurality of tracks included withindatabase 218 so that they have a uniform length. - When
LCR process 10transforms 104 firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 into the same length, this process may be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example,LCR process 10 may normalize firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 to have the same length. Concerning the manner in which this is performed,LCR process 10 may set the uniform length equal to a shortest length of any of firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220. Alternatively,LCR process 10 may set the uniform length to be equal to a length that is smaller than the shortest of any of firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220. - When transforming 104 first
mathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220,LCR process 104 may perform a transformation matrix operation (using one or more transformation matrices) to transform firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 into a common length. For example,LCR process 10 may use machine learning to construct a transformation matrix for each of firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220. - For example, assume that first
mathematical representation 212 has a length of 10,000.000 entities. Further, assume that secondmathematical representation 214 has a length of 100,000,000 entities. To make firstmathematical representation 212 have a common length of e.g., 100 entities,LCR process 10 may use a transformation matrix that may e.g., include 100 sets of 10,000,000 entities (i.e. for a total of 1,000,000,000 entities). To make secondmathematical representation 214 have a common length of e.g., 100 entities,LCR process 10 may use a transformation matrix that may e.g., include 100 sets of 100,000,000 (i.e. for a total of 10,000,000,000 entities). - To transform 104 first
mathematical representation 212 into a 100 entity length vector, LCR process 10: may calculate the first entity (within the 100 entity length vector) by determining the vector similarity between the first set (of the 100 sets of 10,000,000 entities within the transformation matrix) and the firstmathematical representation 212; may calculate the second entity (within the 100 entity length vector) by determining the vector similarity between the second set (of the 100 sets of 10,000,000 entities within the transformation matrix) and the firstmathematical representation 212; and may repeat this process until the one hundredth entity is calculated, thus resulting in firstmathematical representation 212 being transformed 104 into a one hundred entity length representation byLCR process 10. This may be referred to as the “embedding vector” for firstmathematical representation 212. - To transform 104 second
mathematical representation 214 into a 100 entity length vector, LCR process 10: may calculate the first entity (within the 100 entity length vector) by determining the vector similarity between the first set (of the 100 sets of 100,000,000 entities within the transformation matrix) and the secondmathematical representation 214; may calculate the second entity (within the 100 entity length vector) by determining the vector similarity between the second set (of the 100 sets of 100,000,000 entities within the transformation matrix) and the secondmathematical representation 214; and may repeat this process until the one hundredth entity is calculated, thus resulting in secondmathematical representation 214 being transformed 104 into a one hundred entity length representation byLCR process 10. This may be referred to as the “embedding vector” forsecond representation 214. -
LCR process 10 may perform a similar procedure to transform 104 each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 into a plurality of one hundred entity length representation, thus resulting in firstmathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 all having a one hundred entity length. - Once first
mathematical representation 212, secondmathematical representation 214, and the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 have been transformed 104 into a common length,LCR process 10 may generate 106 first result subset of items 222 (chosen from the plurality of items defined within database 218) based upon, at least in part, a first similarity measurement of firstmathematical representation 212 and each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 associated with the plurality of items defined withindatabase 218. An example of such a first similarity measurement may be determined by e.g., counting how many entities are common within the one hundred entity length representations or performing a dot product operation. -
LCR process 10 may also generate 108 second result subset of items 224 (chosen from the plurality of items defined within database 218) based upon, at least in part, a second similarity measurement of secondmathematical representation 214 and each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 associated with the plurality of items defined withindatabase 218. An example of such a second similarity measurement may be determined by e.g., counting how many entities are common within the one hundred entity length representations or performing a dot product operation. -
LCR process 10 may generate 110 a single result set of items (e.g., result set 226) (chosen from the plurality of items defined within database 218) based upon an overall similarity measurement of first mathematical representation 212 (e.g., the query string feature vector), second mathematical representation 214 (e.g., the user profile feature vector), and each of the plurality ofmathematical representations 220 associated with the plurality of items included withindatabase 218. As discussed above, result set 226 may define groups of various items such as e.g., a plurality of products within a product catalog, a plurality of vacation destinations, a plurality of available hotel rooms, a plurality of webpages, a plurality of music tracks, a plurality of videos, a plurality of restaurants, or a plurality of books. -
LCR process 10 may use these overall similarity measurements to rank/order the individual items defined within result set 226, wherein the ranking/order indicates the relevance of each item with respect to the user profile, query, and item content. For example,LCR process 10 may be configured to only present the top “n” items included within result set 226 to e.g.,user 36. Alternatively,LCR process 10 may be configured to present all of the items included within result set 226 to e.g.,user 36.LCR process 10 may or may not be configured to provideuser 36 with these overall similarity measurements.LCR process 10 may be configured to calculate the above-described overall similarity measurement by summing the above described first similarity measurement and second similarity measurement. - Further technical explanation of
LCR process 10 may be found in the paper entitled “Latent Collaborative Retrieval” by Jason Weston, Chong Wang, Ron Weiss, and Adam Berenzweig, which is attached hereto as Appendix A. - Referring also to

Whilecomputing system 12 is shown in this figure, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configuration are possible. For example, any computing device capable of executing, in whole or in part,LCR process 10 may be substituted for computingdevice 12 withinFIG. 4 , examples of which may include but are not limited to clientelectronic devices -
