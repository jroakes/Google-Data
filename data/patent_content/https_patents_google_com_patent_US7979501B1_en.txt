- FIG. 3 shows an exemplary process 300 according to some embodiments of the invention for identifying and formatting informational items.
- a user is identified ( 302 ).
- a user is identified using a cookie supplied by the client 202 .
- the user is identified while logging into a service, such as an email server or website.
- Informational items are then identified for a user ( 304 ).
- informational items are provided by the informational item display manager 226 from a default list of informational items (e.g., news sources, advertisements).
- a user identifies (e.g., using one or more configuration web pages) types of informational items to be presented via a configuration screen, or provides preference information identifying certain types of informational items and/or certain sources of informational items.
- a user provides input identifying informational items the user desires to have presented (e.g., entering the source location for an RSS feed).
- the user informational items identified at 304 are based on a combination of the above.
- the display view of the messaging application impacts the selection of informational items to display. Accordingly, a current view is identified ( 306 ).
- a request for informational items to the client assistant 232 includes an indicator of the view for the informational items to be displayed. As will be explained below in more detail, the request can be generated from a current view or the request can be for a view which will be the next view displayed to the user.
- an associated probability is identified for each informational item or type of informational item identified in 304 ( 308 ).
- the identification of informational items ( 304 ) is performed after the identification of the display view ( 306 ). For instance, first and second display views may have different sets of associated informational item types.
- each display view has associated with it a different set of display probabilities for the various types of informational items. For example, the display probability of a particular informational item type (e.g., advertisements, or news items) may be higher for a first type of display view (e.g., InBox) than a second type of display view (e.g., a conversation or message view).
- a first type of display view e.g., InBox
- a second type of display view e.g., a conversation or message view
- the probabilities are associated with information types (e.g., news items, advertisements), and in some embodiments, the probabilities are associated with specific information sources (e.g., news items from Google news might have different display probabilities than news items from another news source).
- the probabilities are determined according to a default set of probabilities.
- the default set of probabilities may include default probability values for N information types (where N is an integer greater than 1, such as a value between 2 and 10).
- the default set of probabilities may include default probability values for specific information sources when an information type is associated with more than one information source.
- the user sets the probabilities of one or more of the information types or one or more of the information sources. And, in some embodiments, the probabilities are set using a combination of system supplied probabilities and user assigned or adjusted probabilities.
- one of the informational items is chosen for display to the user in the scrollable display area ( 310 ). In one embodiment, this is accomplished by generating a number within a defined range (e.g., 0 to 1) using a random or pseudo-random number generator, and then mapping that number to an informational item in accordance with the set of probabilities values associated to the information sources.
- a defined range e.g., 0 to 1
- each of the information sources or information types is assigned a portion of the defined range in accordance with its probability value. In this way, all values in the defined range are associated with a single information source or information type. When a randomly or pseudo-randomly selected value is generated, it identifies a single information source or type.
- a plurality of informational items are identified. For instance, a plurality of randomly or pseudo-randomly selected values may be generated and then mapped to a corresponding number of informational items.
- the associated information of the informational item is obtained ( 312 ). In some embodiments, this means requesting information from the informational item source (e.g., querying the news source for the item).
- the information is received during background processing and the information may be obtained by querying the location holding the received information (e.g., from informational item display manager 226 ). In some embodiments, information may be retrieved from either location.
- the informational item is related to the content of one or more areas of the display.
- an advertisement is obtained based on a relation to the content being displayed to the user (e.g., the text of an e-mail message or conversation). Certain advertisements may be associated with the presence of words or phrases in the content displayed to the user. In some embodiments, advertisers may bid on certain key words or phrases and the advertisement associated with the winning bid is selected.
- the information is formatted for display in the scrollable area and sent to the client ( 314 ).
- the formatting consists of extracting and formatting information to display in accordance with a scrollable area template.
- the extracted information may include a title and a link to the information source (e.g., a network location).
- the extracted information may also include one or more of the following: a snippet of information about the informational item, and/or a date/time value associated with the informational item.
- the formatted information may be sent in a number of ways depending on the various embodiments.
- the formatted information can be sent to a JavaScript program (e.g., client assistant 232 ) which is downloaded and used to process message information.
- the JavaScript program does not stay resident at the client 202 after the client assistant 232 is terminated.
- This embodiment provides an advantage in that the JavaScript program may be modified at the conversation/message server 206 without requiring any modification to the client or software residing at the client.
- the formatted information can be sent in a separate data stream to the client assistant 232 .
- the process waits until a next trigger event ( 316 ) before identifying another informational item to format and send.
- the trigger event is receiving a request for more informational items from the client assistant 232 .
- the client assistant may request more informational items based on various events.
- new informational items may be periodically determined by the process. For example, the client assistant 232 may automatically generate a request for a new informational item after the expiration of a determined period of time (e.g., one minute).
- the conversation engine 210 may indicate a change in display view and the process will generate an informational item to be sent along with the new display view information.
- table 402 illustrates one embodiment of a probability relationship between one or more display views 404 and one or more sources 406 .
- Table 402 includes exemplary types of informational items including RSS Feeds 408 , advertisements 410 , stock prices 412 , news items 414 and other 416 .

- Table 402 includes display views 402 which include one or more of the display views presented to a user during execution of a messaging application including an InBox view 418 , a conversation view 420 , a message compose view 422 , a contact entry view 424 (i.e., a view displayed while entering or viewing contact information for a person or organization), and a view 426 representing other views.
- the display views 404 listed in FIG. 4 are only exemplary and in some embodiments the display views 404 used include a subset of the display views illustrated in table 402 , and may include additional display views as well.
- Table 402 is used to determine the probability of display for an informational item for a particular identified display view type, such as that identified in 308 of FIG. 3 .
- a corresponding probability of display for an informational item of an advertisement type is 50% (as shown at 428 ) and the display probability of a news item is 30% (as shown at 430 ).
- Table 402 illustrates exemplary probability values; the actual probability values may will vary from one embodiment to another and may also vary from one user or client to another.
- the probability values for each display view are normalized, so that they sum to a predefined value, such as 1.0.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary user preference table 502 in a user information database 500 which is used in some embodiments to personalize the informational items displayed to the user.
- the user preference table 502 stores preference information associated with particular user indicting a user's preference to have displayed certain informational items.
- the information in table 502 if any, is used to override any default settings for the types of informational items to be displayed (e.g., a user may choose not to see a particular type of informational item).
- the information in table 502 can be used to preferentially treat any items associated with a user in the table 502 (e.g., the probabilities of table 402 may be weighted toward informational items that the user has expressed a preference for in table 502 ).
- table 502 includes a plurality of records, each having a userID portion 504 and a preferences portion 506 .
- the table 502 includes one or more records such as record 508 associated with a UserID # 1 , record 510 associated with a UserID # 2 , and a record 512 associated with a UserID #U, where U represents the number of users with a record in the table 502 .
- the record 508 includes one or more preference identifiers such as advertisements 514 , tips 516 , news 518 , source # 1 520 and source # 2 522 (where source# 1 and source# 2 represent the addresses or other identifiers of particular information types or information sources).
- the entries in any particular record 508 , 510 and 512 of table 502 are merely exemplary. In some embodiments, users may have differing sets of entries in their respective record. As illustrated in FIG. 5 , a record 510 includes a different set of entries as compared to the records 508 and 512 .
- Table 502 may also used to store any user entered sources of informational items such as selected RSS feeds. Such feeds would be stored in entries such as entry 520 , 522 .
- An entry 520 might include the URL address of the RSS feed.
- the user preference entries in the records 508 , 510 , 512 may furthermore include weights or preference factors for one or more identified information types of information sources. For instance, a weight or preference factor of 2.0 might indicate that the relative probability of an associated information type or source is to be doubled from a default or nominal value, while a weight or preference factor of 0.5 might indicate that the relative probability of an associated information type or source is to be decreased by a factor of 50 percent from a default or nominal value.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary process 600 which executes in the client assistant 232 according to some embodiments.
- a display view type is identified ( 602 ).
- the client assistant 232 identifies which display is being presented to the user, such as an InBox view, a compose view or any other type of view.
- the client assistant 232 may also maintain an address book or contact list and may have various displays associated with that feature.
- the client assistant 232 may identify the next display view to be presented to the user. For example, when the user selects a different view (e.g., selecting a compose message view from the InBox view), the client assistant 232 may identify the display view of the compose message display as the next view to be displayed to the user.
- the client assistant 232 then generates a request for informational items ( 604 ). In some embodiments this is done prior to rendering the display view, and in some embodiments, this is done during or after rendering the display view. In some embodiments, the client sends identifiers of the content being displayed such that informational items to be content related can be identified.
- the client assistant 232 receives the informational item from the conversation/message server 206 ( 606 ) and displays it in the message area in the scrollable display portion of the display area using the formatted information received (e.g., identifying the title and textual description of the informational item). The user's activities are monitored ( 610 ).
- a forward request ( 616 ) (e.g., by selecting an appropriate button or icon) a determination is then a determination is made as to whether the next informational item is currently the memory.
- the informational items received at 606 include a number of future informational items associated with the current display.
- the future informational items include informational items associated with other display views (e.g., in anticipation of a change of display view). If the informational item is in the memory ( 614 —yes), then it is displayed ( 608 ). On the other hand, if is not ( 614 —no) then another informational item is requested beginning at 602 .
- the user may choose an option that changes the display view ( 618 ) (e.g., by selecting a conversation view from an InBox view).
- a new request for informational items including the new display view type is begun starting at 602 .
