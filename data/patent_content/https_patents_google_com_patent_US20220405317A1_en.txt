Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to remote control devices for controlling multiple devices.
- Universal remotes can rely on a large number of buttons or keys to provide the ability to control multiple devices, and switching from controlling one device to controlling another device can be cumbersome. Moreover, universal remotes are often limited to controlling particular types of devices such as televisions and sound systems.
- Furthermore, smart outlets, smart lights, and other smart appliances are becoming more prevalent in homes and businesses, but control may be limited to specific control devices associated with a particular appliance, smart phone, tablet, or inputs of the device. Using each individual remote can be burdensome, smart phone or tablet use may not be practical for guests or visitors, and reaching for the inputs on the device essentially defeats the purpose. Moreover, there may be limited inputs.

- Generally, the present disclosure relates to remote control devices such as handheld and/or wearable remote control devices configured with sensors that enable the device to generate, store, and access a spatial map for controlling a variety of network-controllable devices such as speakers, displays (e.g., televisions, etc.), electrical outlets, light bulbs, and other so-called smart devices capable of control over a network and/or direct connection. For example, a handheld or wearable remote control device can include various types of sensors such as image capture devices, inertial measurement units, ultra-wideband sensors, microphones, etc. that enable the remote control device to generate a spatial map that describes an environment and the location of network-controllable devices within the environment, as well as to identify device(s) that a user intends to control. For example, the spatial map may include three-dimensional coordinates describing an environment and the location of network-controllable objects within the environment. The remote control device can identify a device selected by the user based on an orientation of the remote control device and the spatial map. For instance, the remote control device can access inertial data from an inertial measurement unit to determine the orientation of the remote control device, access the spatial map to determine a location of the remote control device within the environment based on image data or ultra-wide band (UWB) data, and identify a controllable device pointed to by the remote control based on the orientation and location.
- A remote control device in accordance with example embodiments provides universal and communal control device for multiple controllable devices in one or more environments. A user can freely interact with a variety of devices encountered in daily life using a single device with intuitive functions that can be leveraged simply by pointing the remote control at a device the user intends to control. The remote control device can utilize one or more locally stored spatial maps and location information to accurately determine which controllable device the user intends to manipulate and how the user intends to manipulate that controllable device.
- A remote control device in accordance with example aspects of the present disclosure generates and locally stores a spatial map of an environment based on sensor data generated by the remote control device. The remote control device can map an environment using sensor data generated by one or more image sensors, ultra-wide band sensors, and/or radar sensors and the like. The remote control device can use the sensor data and one or more inputs provided by a user to determine a location of a plurality of controllable devices in the environment. The location information and the spatial map can enable the use of the handheld remote control device to manipulate controllable devices in the environment. Manipulating or controlling the devices can include, but is not limited to, grouping the controllable devices, dragging and dropping content from one device to another device, and general remote control manipulation of the devices (e.g., turning on a device, changing the volume of a device with audio output, etc.).
- According to an example aspect, a remote control device can include a plurality of sensors including one or more image sensors, ultra-wideband sensors, and/or one or more inertial sensors. The sensors can be used for generating a spatial map of an environment. The sensors can generate sensor data that is descriptive of the environment and the plurality of controllable computing devices in the environment. The sensor data can be used to generate a spatial map including a spatially-aware representation of the environment. After generating the spatial map, the remote control device can receive one or more inputs from a user. The one or more inputs can be associated with one of the plurality of controllable computing devices in the environment. Inertial data can be generated using the one or more inertial sensors. The location of each of the plurality of controllable computing devices can be identified using the spatial map and the position/orientation of the remote control device as may be determined using image data, UWB data, and/or inertial data, in response to the one or more inputs. The locations can then be used to generate location information for the spatial map, in which the location information indicates the location of each controllable computing device in the environment. The spatial map including the location information can then be stored locally in the handheld remote control device.
- Traditional remote control devices provide a variety of hurdles that can hinder the user experience. Traditional control devices often require several inputs before the remote can be used for a selected device. For example, a traditional remote may require a user to provide an input to select a particular device then provide another input to select a particular function for the device. Moreover, controllable device pairing and unpairing may be complicated and tedious. Traditional remotes often include a large number of buttons or keys in which only a small portion of the buttons or keys are usable at one time. Traditional remotes can also fail to provide a user with feedback or input displays. Moreover, traditional remotes often only receive input via the buttons and keys on the remote.
- A remote control device in accordance with example aspects of the present disclosure provides an improved user experience by leveraging environment mapping to accurately determine an intended controllable computing device. A handheld or wearable remote control device can utilize a spatial map, one or more inertial sensors, and one or more additional sensors such as image sensors or UWB sensors to quickly and seamlessly determine which controllable device a user intends to control. Moreover, in some implementations, the remote control device can utilize a display screen to provide user options, user notifications, and other information to allow for more intuitive and informed use. The remote control device can also provide haptic feedback or an audio notification to inform the user of successful or unsuccessful actions. The remote control device disclosed herein can also provide the ability to control controllable devices using voice commands, gestures, or via dragging and dropping content. The quick and seamless transition from controlling one device to controlling a different device, the added notifications and display, and the different input options can improve the user experience.
- Generating a spatial map for use by the remote control device can include obtaining sensor data from a plurality of sensors. The sensor data can be processed to determine depth information for the environment, and the depth information can be processed to generate a dimensionally-aware spatial map of the environment. Device locations for each controllable device in the environment can be added to the spatial map based on one or more user inputs, inertial data, and environmental sensor data such as image data or UWB data. The remote control device can receive one or more inputs from a user indicating that the remote control device is currently pointing to or is proximate to one of the controllable computing devices. The inertial sensors can generate inertial data, which can be processed to determine a remote control device orientation Additionally and/or alternatively, the remote control device can determine the device orientation using UWB data and/or image data. Using the remote control device orientation and environmental data such as can be determined from image data or UWB data, the remote control device can identify its location within the environment. Based on the remote control device orientation and location, the remote control device uses the spatial map to determine a location of the controllable computing device. The remote control device can generate location information for the controllable device based on the remote control device orientation and location to map an associated location in the spatial map of the controllable device the remote control is pointing to. The location information can be stored in the spatial map, and the process can be repeated for each controllable computing device in the environment. The spatial map with location information can then be stored locally on the handheld remote control device.
- The generated spatial map can be used to determine what device a user intends to control. For example, in some implementations, the handheld remote control device can receive one or more inputs. The inputs can be inputs intended to control a controllable device in the environment. In response to the one or more inputs, the inertial sensors of the handheld remote control device can generate inertial data descriptive of a handheld remote control device orientation. The generated inertial data and the stored spatial map can then be used to determine the intended controllable device by determining which device the handheld remote control device is pointed at or near.
- In some implementations, one or more image sensors can be used to generate the spatial map. More specifically, the image sensors can be used to generate one or more images of the environment. The images can be of different portions of the environment and may be captured from different perspectives. The images can be processed to determine depth information for the environment. The depth information can be determined by analyzing proportional changes in portions of the environment including proportion changes of objects in the environment. In some implementations, the determination process may utilize image segmentation, image recognition, or other image processing techniques to determine the depth information. The depth information can then be used to generate a spatial map, which can include a three-dimensional, spatially-aware representation of the environment.
- Additionally and/or alternatively, ultra-wideband technology can be used to determine controllable device locations. A plurality of ultra-wideband transceivers can be used to determine a location for each controllable device in the environment. The ultra-wideband transceivers can be included in the handheld remote control device and throughout the environment. Therefore, in some implementations, the handheld remote control device can generate UWB data based on communication information transmitted and received via the ultra-wideband transceiver. The UWB data can be descriptive of a distance between a handheld remote control device and each of the plurality of controllable devices. In some implementations, the handheld remote control device can include one or more UWB antenna systems disposed on the remote side of a handheld remote control device that is integrated to serve as the transmitter, and in the environment, a three antenna receiver can receive the signal from the transmitter to calculate the spatial location of the handheld remote control device. Other UWB configurations may be used.
- In some implementations, the UWB data and generated inertial data can be processed to generate a spatially-aware controllable device map. For example, the handheld remote control device can register the location of each controllable device in the environment by receiving one or more inputs respective to a certain controllable device. In response to the one or more inputs, the handheld remote control device can generate inertial data with the one or more inertial sensors. The handheld remote control device can process the inertial data to determine a handheld remote control device orientation. The handheld remote control device can then obtain UWB data descriptive of a distance. The UWB data descriptive of distance can be obtained in a variety of ways. One example can include determining a location of the handheld remote control device when proximate a target controllable device (e.g., a prompt can be provided instructing a user to position the remote control device proximate a controllable device).The three-dimensional location data generated by the UWB sensor can be used to determine the device location which can be stored in or otherwise in association with the map. Another example can include capturing the remote control device location from two or more different perspectives relative to a controllable device. The system can determine UWB data when the remote control device is positioned at two or more locations relative to the target controllable device. The device orientation can be determined at each location. For example, the device can draw or otherwise determine a line at each perspective using the remote control device's location and orientation. An intersection of the lines passing from the control device to the target controllable device at each location can be determined as the targeted controllable device location. Another example can include assuming there is a bounding box for the room and using the three-dimensional location of the UWB together with the IMU data to determine a line to the bounding box. A point that intersects with the bounding box can be determined to be the device location. The UWB data and the orientation can be processed to determine a location data set for the controllable device. The process can be repeated for each controllable device. The location data sets can then be used to generate a spatially-aware controllable device map that can be descriptive of relative locations of each controllable device in the environment.
- Moreover, in some implementations, the inertial data for generating the controllable device map can be replaced with additional UWB data by using one or more additional ultra-wideband devices with the handheld remote control device. The additional ultra-wideband devices can be used to triangulate the controllable device based on the data from the remote control device and each additional ultra-wideband device (e.g., an additional ultra-wideband device may be put in one or more corners of the environment). The one or more additional ultra-wideband devices can be devices with manually entered locations or pre-determined locations. In some implementations, the additional ultra-wideband devices may be other controllable devices in the environment.
- In some implementations, the remote control device can generate a locally stored spatial map based at least in part on obtaining UWB data in response to an input. The UWB data and the inertial data can then be used to determine the intended controllable device.
- In some implementations, the remote control device can include an ultra-wideband transceiver on each end of the handheld remote control device. The two ultra-wideband transceivers can be used to obtain UWB data for each end of the handheld remote control device, which can then be used to determine the orientation of the remote. The two ultra-wideband receiver handheld remote control device can use the UWB data from each transceiver to determine a distance between a controllable device and each end of the remote control device. The distances can then be compared to determine if the remote control device is pointing at that particular controllable device. In some implementations, the controllable device with the greatest change in distance between the two remote control device transceivers can be determined to be the intended device. The determination process may further include determining that a front remote control device transceiver is the closer of the two remote control device transceivers.
- In some implementations, LiDAR can be used to determine the depth information of the environment. The resulting depth information can be processed to generate a spatial map, which may include three-dimensional point cloud data.
- Mapping an environment with a remote control device can enable the device to better understand the environment, which device a user wants to control, and how the user wants to control that device. Additionally and/or alternatively, mapping can enable the environment system to understand the user's presence in a certain room/space and/or the proximity of devices in the space to provide a tailored experience. In some examples, one or more image sensors can be used to map the environment by capturing images of the environment with the handheld remote control device. The images can cover overlapping portions of the environment such that parts of the environment including certain objects in the environment may be captured in multiple images. The images can be processed to determine depth information for the environment. Processing the images can involve detecting changes in size or distortions in the environment or changes in object size or proportions between images. Alternatively and/or additionally, processing the images can involve synthesizing the plurality of images to generate a media file containing the data of all of the images. The depth information for the environment can then be used to generate a spatial map. In some implementations, the spatial map can be generated by using the depth information to generate a schematic view of the environment using a plurality of layers to create a three-dimensional understanding of the environment. The depth information and/or the spatial map may include point cloud data to represent the relative depths of each portion or object in the environment.
- The remote control device environment mapping may also include controllable device mapping. Collecting location information can involve retrieving input data and motion data from the handheld remote control device. The motion data can be generated by inertial sensors and the input data can be generated from processing button selections, audio data from a microphone, image data, and/or a touch selection on a touchscreen component of the remote control device. In some implementations, the input data may trigger the generation of the motion data, and the motion data can be used to generate location information for a respective controllable device. The process can be repeated until location information is generated for each controllable device in the environment. The spatial map and the location information may be stored locally in the remote control device. In some implementations, the spatial map and the location information may be used to generate a network map in which each controllable device is mapped in the spatial map.
- For example, the determination of controllable device locations can include receiving one or more inputs. The inputs can be received and processed by the remote control device, and in response to the inputs, the inertial sensors can generate inertial data and the additional sensors such as image sensors and/or UWB sensors generate UWB data. The inertial data and additional sensor data can then be processed to determine the remote control device orientation and may be processed with the spatial map to determine a controllable device location. The location, the input data, and the spatial map can be processed to generate location information to be included with the spatial map which can include a device name and location. The process can be completed for each controllable device in the environment.
- Once the environment is mapped and the device location is determined, the handheld controllable device can leverage the information to control the controllable devices. The mapping can allow the system to understand the location and orientation of the handheld remote control device, which can be used to determine what controllable device to manipulate. Controlling the devices can include basic remote tasks, such as turning a device on, or can include more processing intensive tasks, such as grouping devices or controlling one device based on the content of another device.
- In some implementations, mapping of an environment can include generating image data descriptive of an environment. The image data can be generated with one or more image sensors included in the remote control device. The image sensors can be cameras, and the image data can include or be based on one or a plurality of images taken of the environment. Moreover, the generation of the images may be triggered by a user input, which can include a button selection, a voice command, a selection on a touchscreen, or another input. Alternatively and/or additionally, the generation of image data may be prompted by the remote control device being in an environment, detecting movement, etc. In some implementations, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data may be collected to complement or replace the image data. The LiDAR data may be generated by emitting a laser in the remote control device and obtaining the time the laser takes to return to the device.
- The generated image data can be processed to determine depth information for the environment. The processing can be completed by processors included in the handheld remote control device or may be completed by a separate computing device. The determined depth information can be descriptive of different depths for different portions of the environment or different depths of objects in the environment. In some implementations, processing the image data to determine depth information can include image recognition processing. Image recognition processing can be completed locally or on a separate computing device. Processing the image data to determine depth information can include image segmentation. In some implementations, LiDAR data may be obtained and processed to determine the depth information. Alternatively and/or additionally, inertial data may be obtained and processed to aid in determining the depth information.
- The depth information can be used to generate a spatial map of the environment. The spatial map can include three-dimensional point cloud data. The spatial map can be a dimensionally aware representation of the environment. In some implementations, the spatial map can be descriptive of a three-dimensional representation of the environment. The spatial map may include a three-dimensional model of the environment generated based on the depth information. Depth, height, and angles of the environment may be determined by processing the depth information, a plurality of images from an environment walkthrough, and inertial data to provide a realistic spatial modeling map of the environment.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods for environment mapping can include receiving one or more inputs from a user of the remote control device in association with each of the plurality of controllable computing devices. The inputs can be button selections, voice commands, and/or touch selections on a touchscreen. In some implementations, the input can include the image sensor receiving image data that includes one or more features that are processed by the one or more processors and are determined to include recognizable data. The recognizable data can be character data that can be recognized using recognition techniques (e.g., optical character recognition (OCR)). For example, the characters can be a yin number of a controllable device. In some implementations, the recognizable data can be a QR code for scanning. Alternatively and/or additionally, the remote control device may obtain network data descriptive of controllable devices on the network. The network data can aid in identifying the one or more controllable devices.
- Moreover, the systems and methods can obtain or generate inertial data indicative of an orientation of the handheld remote control device using one or more inertial sensors. The one or more inertial sensors can be housed in the handheld remote control device, and the sensors may record data indicative of six degrees of freedom. The inertial data may be used to determine an orientation of the remote control device and may also be used to determine a planar location of the remote control device. In some implementations, image data and inertial data may be obtained or generated simultaneously. Moreover, in some implementations, the orientation can be determined by one or more of image data, inertial data, and/or UWB data.
- The remote control device may use the inertial data and the depth information to identify a location of a controllable device in response to the user input. Identifying the location may involve using the elapsed time period for collecting the inertial data to provide context for the motion recorded. The identification process may occur for each controllable device in the environment. In some implementations, the location may be identified using ultra-wideband communication or another form of wireless communication between the handheld remote control device and controllable devices in the environment.
- Location information can then be generated for each controllable device. The location information can indicate the location within the environment of each controllable computing device. In some implementations, the location information can be added to the spatial map. In some implementations, the location information of each controllable device may be used to generate zones for each controllable device in the environment, such that if a user points the handheld remote control device towards the zone, the remote control device may interpret a manipulation input as being intended for that specific device. In some examples, the remote control device may provide haptic feedback in response to detecting that the remote control device is pointed toward a zone or a network-controllable device within a zone.
- In some implementations, the remote control may have an audio sensor. The audio sensor can obtain audio data. The audio data can include speech data descriptive of a device label. In some implementations, the audio data can be processed along with the inertial data to generate a label for each of the controllable computing devices. The process can be repeated for each controllable computing device. The one or more labels, the location information, and the spatial map can then be used to generate a labeled spatial map, in which each controllable computing device is denoted with a respective label. In some implementations, the audio data descriptive of a device label can be coupled with a location as part of generating a spatial map with labels.
- The spatial map and the location information can be stored locally on the handheld remote control device. Alternatively and/or additionally, the spatial map and the location information may be stored on a server computing device or in the cloud. In some implementations, the labeled spatial map may be stored locally on the handheld remote control device.
- In some implementations, the environment mapping process may be pre-empted, followed by, or occur simultaneously with obtaining network data. The network data can include data descriptive of the one or more controllable devices connected to a network. The one or more controllable computing devices may be within the environment and may be configured or registered with the network such that each controllable device can be manipulated by a handheld remote control device. The configuration or registration of the controllable devices can be completed on the handheld remote control device, a mobile phone, a computer, the device itself, or any other computing device.
- The remote control device can include a variety of features and components. For example, the handheld remote control device may include a wireless adaptor for wireless communication over a network, such that the handheld remote control device can leverage WiFi to communicate with the controllable devices. Alternatively and/or additionally, the handheld remote control device may include a Bluetooth receiver to enable a Bluetooth connection between the remote control devices and one or more controllable devices. In some implementations, the remote control device may include an ultra-wideband wireless transceiver. The ultra-wideband wireless transceiver may be used to generate location information for each controllable device in an environment. In some implementations, the UWB system may also be used to communicate with the controllable devices.
- Further components of the remote control device can be utilized to provide a user with feedback to enhance the user experience. For example, in some implementations, the remote control device can include an electronic display, one or more buttons on a first side of the remote control device, and/or one or more buttons on a second side of the remote control device. The electronic display can be a touchscreen and can display optional controls for the one or more controllable devices or can relay information obtained from the controllable devices in the environment. The buttons can be used to receive user input, and the buttons can be configured in a variety of configurations and may include a variety of button types (e.g., push buttons, triggers, d-pads, touchpads, etc.). Furthermore, in some implementations, the remote control device can include one or more haptic devices (e.g., including vibrational components) configured to provide haptic feedback. Haptic feedback may be used to notify a user of a failed input, connection of a new controllable device, the completion of an action, and/or general input feedback.
- For example, haptic feedback can be provided in response the remote control device changing direction from the pointing zone of a first controllable device to the pointing zone of a second controllable device or vice versa. The pointing zones can be zones generated and mapped in the spatial map. In some implementations, silent haptic feedback can be provided in response to the remote control device entering the pointing zone of a mapped controllable device. The haptic feedback response can aid in the use of the remote control device by allowing the user to feel a demarcation between the controllable devices. Moreover, the haptic feedback can make it easy to pick one over the other with low effort.
- A configured remote control device can be programmed for a variety of uses, including, but not limited to, device grouping, drag and drop, voice-triggered search, point and speak voice control, and general controllable device manipulation.
- The remote control device can perform device grouping by intaking and processing a gesture input to group two or more controllable devices. The remote control device can obtain motion data from an inertial sensor.
- The motion data can be processed to determine a gesture. The gesture can include a gesture to group a plurality of devices. In some implementations, the gesture may be a lasso gesture, in which the gesture encompasses a first device and a second device. Alternatively and/or additionally, the gesture may include a click and drag gesture, in which the remote control device receives a continuous input to select two or more controllable devices. The drag motion can create a shape around multiple devices intended to be grouped or can include pointing at each device intended to be grouped.
- The gesture can be processed to determine that the gesture selects a first device and a second device for grouping. In some implementations, the gesture can select three or more controllable devices for grouping. Moreover, the gesture can be determined to select a pre-existing device group and a new controllable device to add the pre-existing grouping and the new device to a new group. In some implementations, the gesture can be used to group two or more pre-existing groups for a new grouping.
- The remote control device can generate a device grouping for the first device and the second device, based on the received gesture and determined selections. In some implementations, the device grouping can include three or more controllable devices. The remote control device can receive a user input to label the device grouping. For example, audio data descriptive of speech data can be obtained and processed to determine a command related to the labeling of the device grouping. In response to determining the command, the remote control device can generate a label for the device grouping. The device grouping can be stored locally on a handheld remote control device and/or a server computing system. The device grouping labels can also be stored locally on the remote control device.
- The device grouping can be used to control each device in the grouping as a collective whole. For example, the system can obtain a user input to control the device grouping. An intended action can be determined based on the user input. The remote control device can send instructions to the devices in the device grouping to complete the intended action. In some implementations, the intended action can include turning on all devices in the device grouping. Alternatively and/or additionally, the instructions can include a command to turn on the first device and the second device.
- In some implementations, the user input for device grouping can involve the compression of one or more buttons of the handheld remote control device, a motion to make a lasso gesture around a plurality of controllable devices and a release of the one or more buttons after the lasso gesture is completed. Alternatively, the user input can involve individually pointing at each device intended to be grouped. Additionally and/or alternatively audio input can be used for device grouping.
- Systems and methods for drag and drop can allow a user the ability to control the content of a controllable device based on other devices or objects in the environment. For example, a color changing light bulb can change its color to orange in response to a user capturing an image of an orange object and dragging to the location of the light bulb. Drag and drop can involve holding a button while a handheld remote control device is moved by a user, similar to a drag and drop input with a computer mouse. For example, a user can compress a button while pointed at a first controllable device and not release the button until pointed at a second controllable device, which can cause the second controllable device to be controlled based at least in part on data related to the first controllable device.
- According to example aspects, the remote control device receive a first input from which a first device selection can be determined based on the first input and one or more sensors housed in the handheld remote control device (e.g., one or more inertial sensors, one or more image sensors, etc.). In response to the determination of a first device selection, the remote control device can obtain a first device data set from a first device. The first device can be a controllable device in the environment or an object. The first device dataset can be image data generated by an image sensor, media data collected via a wireless connection, and/or audio data generated by an audio sensor. The control device can then obtain a second input. A second device selection can be determined based on the second input and one or more sensors. The second device can be a controllable device in the environment (e.g., a television, a speaker system, a light fixture, etc.). Based on the first device data set and the second device selection, a second device action can be generated. The control device can then send, by a wireless communication component, instructions to a second device based on the second device action. In some examples, the instructions may be sent to another device such as a network control device that in turns sends to the second device the instructions or instructions derived therefrom.
- The remote control device can determine and generate a second device action by processing the first device data set to generate a semantic understanding of the first device data set. For example, the first device data set can include one or more images of an object. The second device selection can be a color changing light bulb fixture. Based on the second device selection, the system can determine that an intended action is a color changing action, and in response to the determination, the system can extract a color from the one or more images in the first device data set. The color extraction can include determining a color average, a median color, a modal color, and/or a color theme. In some implementations, the color extraction process can include removing outliers from the data set and/or image segmentation to isolate an intended object or device. Based on the intended action and the extracted color, the systems can generate a second device action that includes a command to change the light bulb to the one or more extracted colors.
- In some implementations, the remote control device can drag and drop content between devices by processing the first device data set of a first media data type and generating a second device action including playing a second media data type. For example, the first device data set can include image data or video data, and the determined second action can be to play audio data based on the second device selection being a speaker system. More particularly, the handheld remote control device may obtain images of an album or CD cover to generate a first device data set. The second device selection can include a sound system or speaker system. The handheld remote control device can either process the first device data set locally or utilize a server computing system to determine the contents of the one or more images, to recognize the album or CD cover, and in turn, determine a second device action that includes playing music or audio media associated with that album or performer. Another example can involve obtaining audio data to generate a first device data set and generating a second device action that can include playing a video content item. For example, the first device data set can include audio data obtained with one or more audio sensors. The audio data can be processed to determine that the audio data is descriptive of a portion of a motion picture soundtrack. The system can determine that the second device selection is a video media player (e.g., a smart television, a video dongle, a laptop, etc.). The system can then generate a second device action that includes playing the motion picture the motion picture soundtrack comes from.
- The remote control device can process and understand the media data type and content of the first device data set, determine an intended action based on the second device selection, and generate a second device action that can be completed by the second device that is associated to or related to the first device data set.
- In some implementations, the first input can be the beginning of a button or touchscreen compression, and the second input can be the end of the compression. Alternatively and/or additionally, the first input and the second input can be separate compressions. The first input and second input can include voice commands, visual triggers, and/or any other form of input. In some implementations, the first input can be a touch input, and the second input may be an audio input or vice versa. In some implementations, the first input may be a copy input and the second input may be a paste input.
- A handheld interactive object, or handheld remote control device, can be utilized to generate search queries and receive search results. For example, a handheld interactive object can be programmed to enable voice-triggered search functionality.
- For example, voice-triggered searching can include obtaining audio data with an audio sensor. The audio data can include speech data descriptive of a command. The audio data can be processed to determine the command. The command can include a context-based voice-triggered search function. Processing the audio data to determine the command can include processing the audio data with an analog-to-digital converter for analog-to-digital conversion. In some implementations, processing the audio data to determine a command may include using a natural language processing model for natural language processing.
- The determination for the command can trigger the generation of image data by obtaining the image data with one or more image sensors (e.g., a camera). The image data and the audio data can be processed to determine a search query. In some implementations, the search query can include one or more search terms and one or more images.
- The search query can then be input into a search engine. In response, the systems and methods can receive one or more search results based on the search query. One or more of the search results can be provided. In some implementations, the one or more search results may be provided on a visual display of a handheld interactive object. Alternatively and/or additionally, one or more of the search results can be provided via an audio notification. The audio notification can be output by one or more speakers of a handheld interactive object.
- The voice-triggered search function can be used to retrieve information on a consumer product. The command can be a command to search information on an object (e.g., a consumer product). One or more images on the consumer product can be obtained to generate a consumer product search query, and in response, the one or more search results can be information on the consumer product. More particularly, the voice command can include “how many calories is in this?” The object in front of the handheld interactive object can be a container of soda. The search query can include images of the container and the search terms can include “how” AND “many” AND “calories.” The resulting search results can include the calories of that soda according to the size of the container and/or according to the serving size. The calorie count can then be output as an audio notification or can be output on the visual display.
- In some implementations, the search query can include natural language syntax and/or Boolean syntax and terms.
- Controllable devices in the environment can be manipulated using voice commands. For example, a handheld remote control device can obtain audio data descriptive of a command with an audio sensor (e.g., a microphone). One or more processors can process the audio data to determine a command descriptive of one or more manipulation actions for a controllable device. The handheld remote control device can determine the manipulation action and instruct the controllable device to complete the desired action. In some implementations, the handheld remote control device may determine the intended controllable device based on the device being pointed at. The point and speak voice control may be initiated by a button selection or touchscreen selection.
- Manipulation actions can include a variety of different actions. Manipulation actions can include turning a device on or off, changing the volume of a controllable device, changing the settings of a controllable device, changing the light intensity of a device, and/or content item selection (e.g., channel selection, application selection, CD selection, movie title selection in a streaming application, etc.).
- In some implementations, the handheld remote control device can be utilized to control each controllable device in an environment with button selections, touchscreen selections or swipes, and/or motion gestures.
- In some implementations, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be implemented into an augmented-reality experience or a virtual-reality experience. For example, the handheld remote control device may be used to interact with the augmented-reality or virtual-reality generated environment.
- For example, in some implementations, the handheld remote control device can be used to control a plurality of controllable devices. The handheld remote control device, a phone, glasses, or some other display device may provide an augmented-reality experience, in which the user can see options for the controllable devices, labels for the controllable devices, device groupings, and may see a variety of other content related to the environment, the controllable devices, and the functionality of the handheld remote control device. The handheld remote control device may be used to interact with these different content items displayed using the augmented-reality experience. For example, the handheld remote control device may be used to control or manipulate a controllable device by interacting with a rendered controllable device options menu. The augmented-reality environment may be updated through use of the handheld remote control device, such that the user may configure devices, generate groupings, and complete other actions while using the augmented-reality experience.
- In some implementations, the handheld remote control device can be used as a controller inside a virtual-reality world provided by a virtual-reality experience. The handheld remote control device may be used to interact with a virtual environment to turn on a virtual fireplace, open a virtual cabinet, shoot a virtual bow, paint a virtual painting, move throughout a virtual world, change the settings of the virtual environment, etc. In some implementations, the virtual-reality experience may provide the ability to create a virtual-reality environment, and the handheld remote control device may be utilized to aid in generating the environment through gesture inputs, voice commands, button selections, touch screen selections, etc.
- Moreover, in some implementations, the handheld remote control device can be used for playing various games such as interactive games using one or more of the controllable devices. For example, in some implementations, the various controllable devices can be used as part of the game interface. In one example, the handheld remote control device can communicate with one or more controllable devices to light up and/or make a sound. The controllable devices that light-up and/or make a sound can prompt the user to take a specific action, which can include pointing the handheld remote control device at the specific controllable device. In some implementations, the action can be a button selection. The handheld remote control device can then generate inertial data, UWB data, and/or image data in order to determine a user action. Determining the user action can involve processing the generated data to determine an orientation which can be used to determine a controllable device being targeted. If the correct controllable device is targeted, the system may provide a positive feedback, and if an incorrect controllable device is target, the system may provide a negative feedback. The system can also determine an elapsed time or an order of a user's actions to determine if the user action occurred in a satisfactory amount of time and/or determine if a desired order is followed. The system may keep track of a user's score based on timely and correct actions.
- In one example, the environment can have a set of light bulbs, televisions, and/or monitors that can be illuminated. The desired action in the game can include instructing the user to select a controllable device being illuminated during a certain period of time. The period of time may include concurrently selecting the controllable device while the controllable device is illuminated or may include selecting the controllable device during a specific period of time during and/or after the illumination. Feedback may be provided after each successful action and/or after every unsuccessful action. Selecting the controllable device can involve the use of one or more of an inertial sensor, an image sensor, or a UWB transceiver to determine a handheld remote control device orientation, which can be used to determine the controllable device being targeted by the user. Moreover, in some implementations, selecting a controllable device can involve one or more button selections, one or more audio inputs, and/or one or more gesture inputs. A user's score may be tracked and provided via a visual display and/or via a speaker system.
- In another example, the environment can have a set of light bulbs, televisions, and/or monitors that can be illuminated. The game can involve illuminating a plurality of lights, monitors, and/or televisions in a specific order and can then instruct the user to select the plurality of illuminated objects in the same order as had been illuminated. In some implementations, the illuminating controllable devices can be illuminated in different colors and may be paired with respective audio responses. The system can set an order for illumination, send instructions to the controllable devices to illuminate at a given time, and then generate sensor data to determine if the user completed the correct actions indicative of the correct selections and order. Correct selections in the correct order may lead to the system providing positive feedback, and incorrect selections may lead to the system providing negative feedback.
- The systems and methods disclosed herein can involve localized processing on the handheld remote control device such that environment mapping and controllable device manipulation can be determined and processed locally on the handheld remote controllable device using various computing components housed in the handheld remote control device. Alternatively, in some implementations, environment mapping and device control can involve communication with one or more assistant computing devices. Alternatively and/or additionally, one or more of the controllable devices may have one or more processing components to enable individualized device processing.
- The systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, the system and methods can generate an environmental map for enabling a handheld remote control device to control various controllable devices throughout an environment. The environment mapping can be completed using the handheld remote control device, and in some implementations, the environment spatial map may be stored locally on the handheld remote control device to limit the need for communication with a server computing system. The systems and methods can further be used to enable device grouping, which can allow a user to control multiple devices simultaneously which can save a user time. Furthermore, the systems and methods can enable drag-and-drop functions, which may allow a user to determine an action for a controllable device based on another object or device in the environment, which can save time for the user and provide a better user media experience.
- Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is voice-triggered search functionality. The handheld remote control device, or handheld interactive object, can be utilized for controlling devices in the environment, while also providing the functionality of generating searches based on user commands. The handheld remote control device can receive a voice command, process the command, capture an image, and receive search results for a user related to an object or device in the environment. The search functionality can save a user time and provide a device that can help with understanding products consumed by a user.
- With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.

FIG. 2 depicts an illustration of anexample environment 200 including a handheld remote control device and a plurality of controllable devices in accordance with example aspects of the present disclosure. Theexample environment 200 includes a room with a plurality of controllable devices, includingsmart outlets lamps speakers television 210, andlight fixtures - The handheld
remote control device 250 may be used to map theenvironment 200 and control each device in theenvironment 200. In some implementations, the handheldremote control device 200 may use a generated spatial map and location information from the environment mapping to determine which controllable device is intended to be controlled by the user. - Environment mapping can begin with capturing a plurality of images of the environment with a camera included in the handheld
remote control device 250. The images may be captured during anenvironment 200 walk through or by a user pivoting about one or more points in theenvironment 200. The images can be processed to determine position information such as distance and/or depth information, which can be used to generate a spatial map. The images can be processed to determine distances between features and/or objects. In some examples, multiple images may be processed to determine distances between features so that a spatial map representative of actual dimensions, positions, and/or locations associated with the environment can be determined. The handheldremote control device 250 may receive an input associated with a respective controllable device and motion data from one or more inertial sensors included in the handheldremote control device 250. The input and motion data can be processed to determine a location for the respective controllable device. The location can be used to generate location information for the controllable device to be stored with or as part of the spatial map. The process may be repeated for each controllable device in theenvironment 200. - Once the
environment 200 is mapped, the controllable devices may be controlled by the handheldremote control device 250. For example, the handheldremote control device 250 may be used to group devices. Thelight fixtures remote control device 250 obtains a first input, motion data, and a second input. The first input may be a button compression, while the second input may be a button decompression. Alternatively and/or additionally, one or both of the inputs may be audio data descriptive of voice commands. The motion data can include data generated by one or more inertial sensors included in the handheldremote control device 250. The motion data can be processed to determine a user intent. In this example, the motion data includes data descriptive of a lasso gesture that encompasses thelight fixtures light fixtures light fixture grouping 240 may then be generated and stored locally on the handheldremote control device 250. - Alternatively and/or additionally, a device grouping may be generated via voice command or through configuration on a touch screen. In some implementations, the handheld
remote control device 250 may obtain audio data descriptive of a device label or device grouping label to generate names or labels for devices and device groupings in theenvironment 200. For example, the handheldremote control device 250 may obtain a voice command to label thespeaker grouping 230 as “my sound system,” such that when a user gives the voice command to “turn up my sound system” both thefirst speaker system 232 and thesecond speaker system 234 will have their volume raised. - Moreover, the handheld
remote control device 250 can utilize the spatial map, the location information, and the inertial sensors to accurately determine the controllable device the user intends to control. For example, the location information and the spatial map may be used to determine device zones, such that if the handheldremote control device 250 is pointed anywhere inside that respective device's zone, the handheld remote control device will determine the respective device as the intended device. More particularly, the whole back left region of theenvironment 200 may be a control zone for thesecond outlet 204, while the front right corner may be a much smaller control zone for thesecond lamp 208. Moreover, the spatial map and location information may include three dimensional data, such that thespeaker grouping 230 and thetelevision 210 may share the same point on two axes but may be controlled individually due to a third axis point direction determination. - In some implementations, the intended device may be determined based on a voice command. For example, the
first lamp 206 and thefirst outlet 202 can be labeled “first lamp” and “first outlet” respectively, and in response to a “turn off the first lamp” voice command, the handheldremote control device 250 may send instructions to the lamp to turn off even if the handheldremote control device 250 is pointed at the first outlet control zone. -

More specifically, the example set ofsoftware components 400 inFIG. 3 depicts parallel processing of motion data and audio data to control a target device. Both the motion data and the audio data can be obtained, processed, and used to determine an intent, which can include a target device control for fulfillment. - The handheld
remote control device 402 can obtain motion data from one or more inertial sensors included in the handheld remote control device. The motion data can be used to determine a six degrees offreedom position information 404. The handheld remote control device can utilize a local and/orremote tracking service 406, which can determine the six degrees of freedom position information using six degrees of freedom tracking. The handheld remote control device position can then be processed to determine a pointed target at 408. Determination of the pointed target at 408 can include the use of a local and/or remotetarget determination service 410, which can utilize the spatial map and location information for target finding. The handheld remote control device can determine a selected controllable device as the determined target at 408 based on the output of the target determination service. In combination with one or more additional inputs, an intent associated with the remote control device can then be determined. - The handheld remote control device or a connected device may obtain audio data including a
voice command 452. Thevoice command 452 can include a speech utterance and may be processed to generatetext data 454 descriptive of the speech utterance. Generating text data by processing the audio data can involve using a local and/or remote speech totext service 456. The generated text utterance can then be processed to determine anintent 458 of the voice command. The text utterance can be sent to an understanding service for natural language understanding in order to match the text utterance to a determined intent. - The selected controllable device determined at 408 and the matched intent response determined at 458 can be used to determine a handheld remote
control device intent 430. - Determining the handheld remote
control device intent 430 can include understanding a type of the target controllable device and determining how the matched intent response applies to that specific device type. For example, a sound system and a television may have different capabilities. Once an intent is determined, the desired action can be fulfilled via cloud fulfillment using an assistant service or via local fulfillment using a software development kit (SDK) or other technique. Atarget device control 436 can be determined. For example, thevoice command 452 can include “turn on this device” while pointing at a television, and in response to the processing steps, thetarget device control 436 may include turning the television on. - The plurality of services that can be utilized for determining a target device control may be provided locally on the handheld remote control device or may be provided via a wireless connection to a computing system.

Control of the controllable devices can rely on inputs collected by the handheld remote control device. The inputs can be singular inputs or clustered inputs which can be processed and determined to have particular intents. For example, a drag and drop 510 input can be determined to have the intent of determining the content (e.g., audio or video) provided by a first device and provided associated content on a second device.
- A handheld remote control device can
intake point 502 inputs to determine a device the user intends to control. Thepoint 502 input can be processed with the spatial map and location information to determine the intended controllable device. In some implementations, thepoint 502 input may be paired with one or more following inputs or precursor inputs. For example, thepoint 502 input may be paired with a trigger click or button compression to select 504 a controllable device. In some implementations, a user may hold the trigger or the selection button while pointing at multiple controllable devices to complete a multi-select 506 function. - In some implementations, the input may include audio input including human speech. The dialog input can include a copy/paste dialog. For example, the user may point at a first controllable device and provide a voice command to copy from that device then point at a second controllable device and provide a paste command. The inputs can be processed to determine a copy &
paste 512 intent. The resulting output may include providing the same or related content on the second controllable device from the first controllable device. In some implementations, copy &paste 512 can involve a drag and drop input. -
FIG. 4 depicts apoint 502 initial state, a select 504 state, a multi-select 506 state, a drag & drop 510 state, and a copy &paste 512 state. However, one or more other 508 states may be included. The inputs for each respective state can stem from the point input or may be independent from the point input. The inputs can be from trigger compressions, other button compressions, audio inputs, motion inputs, and/or image inputs. - While example embodiments are described with respect to handheld remote control devices, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented with other form factors such as a wearable remote control device.

In some implementations, thetraining computing system 2350 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. - The
training computing system 2350 can include amodel trainer 2360 that trains the machine-learnedmodels 2320 and/or 2340 stored at theuser computing device 2302 and/or theserver computing system 2330 using various training or learning techniques, such as, for example, backwards propagation of errors. For example, a loss function can be backpropagated through the model(s) to update one or more parameters of the model(s) (e.g., based on a gradient of the loss function). Various loss functions can be used such as mean squared error, likelihood loss, cross entropy loss, hinge loss, and/or various other loss functions. Gradient descent techniques can be used to iteratively update the parameters over a number of training iterations. - In some implementations, performing backwards propagation of errors can include performing truncated backpropagation through time. The
model trainer 2360 can perform a number of generalization techniques (e.g., weight decays, dropouts, etc.) to improve the generalization capability of the models being trained. - In particular, the
model trainer 2360 can train theenvironment mapping models 2320 and/or 2340 based on a set oftraining data 2362. Thetraining data 2362 can include, for example, a plurality of images with a ground truth set of depth information and a ground truth spatial map. In some implementations, thetraining data 2362 can further include inertial data and ground truth location information. - In some implementations, if the user has provided consent, the training examples can be provided by the
user computing device 2302. Thus, in such implementations, themodel 2320 provided to theuser computing device 2302 can be trained by thetraining computing system 2350 on user-specific data received from theuser computing device 2302. In some instances, this process can be referred to as personalizing the model. - The
model trainer 2360 includes computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. Themodel trainer 2360 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. For example, in some implementations, themodel trainer 2360 includes program files stored on a storage device, loaded into a memory and executed by one or more processors. In other implementations, themodel trainer 2360 includes one or more sets of computer-executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media. - The
network 2380 can be any type of communications network, such as a local area network (e.g., intranet), wide area network (e.g., Internet), or some combination thereof and can include any number of wired or wireless links. In general, communication over thenetwork 2380 can be carried via any type of wired and/or wireless connection, using a wide variety of communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP), encodings or formats (e.g., HTML, XML), and/or protection schemes (e.g., VPN, secure HTTP, SSL). -
FIG. 23A illustrates one example computing system that can be used to implement the present disclosure. Other computing systems can be used as well. For example, in some implementations, theuser computing device 2302 can include themodel trainer 2360 and thetraining dataset 2362. In such implementations, themodels 2320 can be both trained and used locally at theuser computing device 2302. In some of such implementations, theuser computing device 2302 can implement themodel trainer 2360 to personalize themodels 2320 based on user-specific data. -

For example, each application can include a machine-learned model. Example applications include a text messaging application, an email application, a dictation application, a virtual keyboard application, a browser application, etc. - As illustrated in

In some implementations, each application can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a public API). In some implementations, the API used by each application is specific to that application. -
FIG. 23C depicts a block diagram of anexample computing device 50 that performs according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thecomputing device 50 can be a user computing device or a server computing device. - The
computing device 50 includes a number of applications (e.g.,applications 1 through N). Each application is in communication with a central intelligence layer. Example applications include a text messaging application, an email application, a dictation application, a virtual keyboard application, a browser application, etc. In some implementations, each application can communicate with the central intelligence layer (and model(s) stored therein) using an API (e.g., a common API across all applications). - The central intelligence layer includes a number of machine-learned models. For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 23C , a respective machine-learned model (e.g., a model) can be provided for each application and managed by the central intelligence layer. In other implementations, two or more applications can share a single machine-learned model. For example, in some implementations, the central intelligence layer can provide a single model (e.g., a single model) for all of the applications. In some implementations, the central intelligence layer is included within or otherwise implemented by an operating system of thecomputing device 50. - The central intelligence layer can communicate with a central device data layer. The central device data layer can be a centralized repository of data for the
computing device 50. As illustrated inFIG. 23C , the central device data layer can communicate with a number of other components of the computing device, such as, for example, one or more sensors, a context manager, a device state component, and/or additional components. In some implementations, the central device data layer can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a private API). - Alternatively and/or additionally, the systems and methods may utilize a computing system with a different architecture that may include or may not include one or more machine-learned models. For example, in some implementations, the handheld remote control device, or handheld interactive object, may not include a locally stored machine-learned model but may instead be updated in intervals via communication with a server computing system, when an update is available.

FIG. 24A depicts a block diagram of an exampleartificial intelligence system 2400 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In some implementations, the computing system may be configured to control a plurality of sensors of theartificial intelligence system 2400 in an environment. - More specifically, the
artificial intelligence system 2400 may be configured to select, categorize, analyze, or otherwise perform a processing operation with respect to animage 2404 of a scene.

FIG. 24B depicts a block diagram of another exampleartificial intelligence system 2420 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Theartificial intelligence system 2420 is similar to theartificial intelligence system 2400 ofFIG. 24A except that theartificial intelligence system 2420 further includes anobject recognition model 2428. Theobject recognition model 2428 may be configured to receive animage 2424 of a scene and, in response, provide arecognition output 2430 that describes a region of theimage 2424. For example, therecognition output 2430 may describe a category, a label, a characteristic, and/or a location within theimage 2424 associated with theimage 2424. The selection model may be configured to receive therecognition output 2430 and, in response, provide anattention output 2426 that describes at least one region of the scene that includes a subject of the processing operation performed by theartificial intelligence system 2400. For example, theattention output 2426 can describe the object or device of a region of theimage 2424 in response to a question or command from the user. Alternatively, theattention output 2426 can describe a region of theimage 2424 that theselection model 2422 has determined as important, relevant, or responsive to a question/command posed by the user or an anticipated desire of the user. -
FIG. 24C depicts a block diagram of another exampleartificial intelligence system 2450 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Theartificial intelligence system 2450 may include a machine-learnedmodel 2452 that is configured to receive aninput 2454, and in response to receiving theinput 2454 generate anoutput 2456 and aconfidence value 2458 associated with theoutput 2456. The machine-learnedmodel 2452 may be any suitable type of model.

FIG. 25 depicts a block diagram of an examplevisual search system 2500 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In some implementations, thevisual search system 2500 is configured to receive a set of input data that includesvisual queries 2504 and, as a result of receipt of theinput data 2504, provideoutput data 2506 that provides the user with more personalized and/or intelligent results. As an example, in some implementations, thevisual search system 2500 can include aquery processing system 2502 that is operable to facilitate the output of more personalized and/or intelligent visual query results. - In some implementations, the
query processing system 2502 includes or leverages a user-centric visual interest graph to provide more personalized search results. In one example use, thevisual search system 2500 can use the graph of user interests to rank or filter search results, including visual discovery alerts, notifications, or other opportunities. Personalization of search results based on user interests may be particularly advantageous in example embodiments in which the search results are presented as visual result notifications (e.g., which may in some instances be referred to as “gleams”) in an augmented overlay upon the query image(s). - In some implementations, the user-specific interest data (e.g., which may be represented using a graph) can be aggregated over time at least in part by analyzing images that the user has engaged with in the past. Stated differently, the
visual search system 2500 can attempt to understand a user's visual interests by analyzing images with which the user engages over time. When a user engages with an image, it can be inferred that some aspect of the image is interesting to the user. Therefore, items (e.g., objects, entities, concepts, products, etc.). that are included within or otherwise related to such images can be added or otherwise noted within the user-specific interest data (e.g., graph). - As one example, images that a user engages with can include user-captured photographs, user-captured screenshots, or images included in web-based or application-based content viewed by the user. In another, potentially overlapping example, images that a user engages with can include actively engaged images with which the user has actively engaged by requesting an action to be performed on the image. For example, the requested action can include performing a visual search relative to the image or explicitly marking by the user that the image includes a visual interest of the user. As another example, images that a user engages with can include passively observed images that were presented to the user but not specifically engaged with by the user. Visual interests can also be inferred from textual content entered by the user (e.g., text- or term-based queries).
- Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions, or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), and if the user is sent content or communications from a server. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
- The
visual search system 2500 can use thequery processing system 2502 to select search results for the user. Theuser interest system 2502 can be used at various stages of the search process including query modification, result identification, and/or other stages of a visual search process. - As one example,
FIG. 26 depicts a block diagram of an examplevisual search system 2600 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thevisual search system 2600 operates in a two-stage process. In a first stage, aquery processing system 2502 can receive the input data 2504 (e.g., a visual query that includes one or more images) and generate a set ofcandidate search results 2506 that are responsive to the visual query. For example, thecandidate search results 2506 can be obtained without regard for user-specific interests. In a second stage, theranking system 2602 can be used by thevisual search system 2600 to assist in ranking the one or more of thecandidate search results 2506 to return to the user as final search results (e.g., as the output data 2604). - As one example, the
visual search system 2600 can use theranking system 2602 to generate a ranking of the plurality ofcandidate search results 2506 based at least in part on a comparison of the plurality ofcandidate search results 2506 to the user-specific user interest data associated with the user obtained in thequery processing system 2502. For example, the weights for certain items captured within the user interest data can be applied to modify or re-weight initial search scores associated with thecandidate search results 2506 which could further lead to a re-ranking of thesearch results 2506 prior to output to theuser 2604. - The
visual search system 2600 can select at least one of the plurality ofcandidate search results 2506 as at least one selected search result based at least in part on the ranking and then provide at least one selected visual result notification respectively associated with the at least one selected search result for display to the user (e.g., as output data 2604). In one example, each of the selected search result(s) can be provided for overlay upon a particular sub-portion of the image associated with the selected search result. In such fashion, user interests can be used to provide personalized search results and reduce clutter in a user interface. - As another example variant,
FIG. 27 depicts a block diagram of an examplevisual search system 2700 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Thevisual search system 2700 is similar tovisual search system 2600 ofFIG. 26 except that thevisual search system 2700 further includes acontext component 2702 which receivescontext information 2704 and processes thecontext information 2704 to account for implicit characteristics of the visual query and/or user's search intent. - The
contextual information 2704 can include any other available signals or information that assist in understanding implicit characteristics of the query. For example, location, time of day, input modality, and/or various other information can be used as context. - As another example, the
contextual information 2704 can include various attributes of the image, information about where the image was sourced by the user, information about other uses or instances of the image, and/or various other contextual information. In one example, the image used in the visual search query is present in a web document (e.g., a web page). References to other entities (e.g., textual and/or visual references) included in the web document can be used to identify potential additional entities which may be used to form the composition of multiple entities. - In another example, the
contextual information 2704 can include information obtained from additional web documents that include additional instances of the image associated with the visual search query. As another example, thecontextual information 2704 can include textual metadata associated with the image (e.g., EXIF data). In particular, textual metadata may be accessed and may be identified as the additional entities associated with the visual search. Specifically, textual metadata may include captions to the image used in the visual query submitted by the user. - As another example, the
contextual information 2704 can include information obtained via a preliminary search based on the visual query. More specifically, a first search may be made using information from the visual query and, upon obtaining a first set of preliminary search results, further entities may be identified which are referenced by the preliminary search results. In particular, entities that are identified in some number of preliminary results exceeding a threshold may be determined to be pertinent enough to be included in a following query. - Referring to any of the
visual search systems FIGS. 25, 26, and 27 , a computing system can implement an edge detection algorithm to process the objects depicted in the images provided as the visualquery input data 2504. Specifically, the image acquired may be filtered with an edge detection algorithm (e.g., gradient filter), thereby obtaining a resulting image, which represent a binary matrix which may be measured in a horizontal and vertical direction determining position of objects contained in the image within the matrix. Additionally, the resulting image may further be advantageously filtered using a Laplacian and/or Gaussian Filter for improved detection of edges. Objects may then be compared against a plurality of training images and/or historical images of any kind and/orcontext information 2704 with Boolean operators, such as “AND” and “OR” Boolean operators. Utilizing Boolean comparisons provides for very fast and efficient comparisons which is preferable however in certain circumstances non-Boolean operators may be desired. - Furthermore, a similarity algorithm may be accessed by the
visual search system FIGS. 25, 26 , and/or 27 where the algorithm may access the edge detection algorithm described above and store the output data. Additionally, and/or alternatively the similarity algorithm can estimate a pairwise similarity function between each image and/or queryinput data 2504 and a plurality of other images and/or queries and/orcontext information 2704 that may be training data and/or historical data of any kind. The pairwise similarity function can describe whether two data points are similar or not. - Additionally, or alternatively, the
visual search system FIGS. 25, 26 , and/or 27 can implement a clustering algorithm to process the images provided as a visualquery input data 2504. The search system may execute the clustering algorithm and assign images and/or queries to the clusters based upon the estimated pairwise similarity functions. The number of clusters can be an unknown prior to executing the clustering algorithm and can vary from one execution of the clustering algorithm to the next based on the images/visualquery input data 2504, the estimated pairwise similarity function for each pair of image/queries, and random or pseudo-random selection of an initial image/query assigned to each cluster. - The
visual search system query input data 2504. In certain exemplary embodiments, thevisual search system visual search system - The technology discussed herein makes reference to servers, databases, software applications, and other computer-based systems, as well as actions taken and information sent to and from such systems. The inherent flexibility of computer-based systems allows for a great variety of possible configurations, combinations, and divisions of tasks and functionality between and among components. For instance, processes discussed herein can be implemented using a single device or component or multiple devices or components working in combination.
