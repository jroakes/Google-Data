Detailed Description
The following is a detailed description of various concepts and embodiments related to techniques, approaches, methods, apparatuses, and systems for adjusting an aspect ratio of a content slot. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in detail below can be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular implementation. Examples of specific embodiments and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.
The content selection server can provide the content item to the client device in response to a request from the client device. The request can identify a content slot size that the content selection server can use to select appropriate content to provide in response to the request occupying the entire area of the content slot. To optimize utilization of client device display screens and avoid unnecessary unoccupied area on the display screens, existing content selection servers can filter out content items that do not match a content slot size or corresponding aspect ratio, thereby reducing the available inventory of content items for selection in responding to content requests. Alternatively, existing content selection servers can select to provide content items that do not match the content slot size or the corresponding aspect ratio of the content slot, in which case the content items do not occupy the entire area of the content slot, resulting in a less immersive experience for the user, and provide a blank (or unoccupied area), resulting in wasted space on the display screen. In some cases, the content selection server may implement video processing techniques to resize the content item to occupy the entire content slot. However, these video processing techniques can be computationally expensive and may result in the loss of some data of the content item.
The present solution solves the above-described challenges by having the client device adjust the aspect ratio of the content slots instead of having the content selection server limit the selection of content items based on the size of the content items and the size of the content slots or modifications to content items selected for display in the content slots. If the display orientation of the selected content item does not match the display orientation of the content slot, the present solution allows for selection of any content item regardless of size in response to a request by adjusting the aspect ratio of the content slot.
With the present disclosure, the systems and methods of the present disclosure are able to receive parameters corresponding to a content slot in a content request sent from a client device. Systems and methods herein can identify a display orientation of a content item selected from candidate content, identify a display orientation of a content slot based on a parameter received from a client device, and determine that the display orientation of the content item does not match the display orientation of the content slot. Then, the systems and methods herein can include: instructions to adjust an aspect ratio of the content slot based on a display orientation of the content item as the content item is transmitted to the client device such that the display orientation of the content slot matches the display orientation of the content item. Thus, the systems and methods described herein enable a content item to occupy more of the screen of a client device by adjusting the content slot without having to modify the content item or initially requiring a match between the display orientation of the content item and the display orientation of the content slot. Thus, the client device display area may be used more efficiently since the aspect ratio of the content slots is customized for the content items. With the present disclosure, the systems and methods described herein can reduce memory resource utilization by having to store fewer content items, as it is no longer necessary to store multiple sizes of the same content item to fit different content slots on a client device. This reduction in memory resource utilization is achieved because the content slots are tailored to the content item, not vice versa. Such a storage reduction saves system resources such as server storage requirements for storing multiple sizes of the same content item and for maintaining a larger and more complex database of content items. Furthermore, the content provider no longer needs to expend computational and other resources to generate multiple content items of the same size to accommodate different size content slots. This can reduce network traffic as the number of content items sent from the content publisher and the content selection server or other server storing the content items is reduced. Furthermore, the client device does not have to waste time and resources rendering content items that are not appropriate for the available content, which in turn requires additional network traffic such as processing, memory, and telephony overhead, as well as client resources, to request and receive content items that are more appropriate for the slot.

The content item selector 160 can select a content item 175 based on a parameter related to the performance of the content item 175, such as a click-through rate. Similarly, the content item selector 160 can select the content item 175 based on parameters included in or identified from the request for content, such as parameters of the client device 120 (e.g., network strength, hardware capabilities, etc.). The content item selector 160 is capable of selecting a content item 175 from the database 145. In some embodiments, the content item selector 160 retrieves or selects additional content from the content provider 135 in response to a request for content. The content item selector 160 can select content items 175 of any form of content, including text, images, video, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, content items 175 include representations of information resources, such as web pages.
The content item selector 160 can determine, extract, or identify a display orientation of the content item 175. The display orientation of the content item 175 can indicate how the content item 175 is oriented for viewing on the client device 120. For example, the display direction can be a portrait mode or a landscape mode. A portrait mode can indicate that the width of the content item 175 is less than the height of the content item 175 and a landscape mode can indicate that the width of the content item 175 is greater than the height of the content item 175. The content item selector 160 can determine, extract, retrieve, or identify the display orientation of the content item 175 based on the aspect ratio of the content item 175. The content item selector 160 can determine, extract, retrieve, or identify the aspect ratio of the content item 175. The aspect ratio indicates a ratio of the width of the content item 175 to the height of the content item. The content item selector 160 can determine or identify the display resolution of the content item 175 to determine the aspect ratio of the content item 175. The content item selector 160 can determine, extract, or identify the display resolution of the content item 175. The display resolution can indicate a height of the content item 175 relative to a width of the content item 175. In some embodiments, the content item selector 160 maintains or stores the display orientation, aspect ratio, or display resolution of the content item 175 in the database 145.
The content item selector 160 can select the content item 175 independently of the display direction of the content slot. In other words, the content item selector 160 is able to select the content item 175 without using the display orientation of the content slot. The content item selector 160 can select the content item 175 such that the display orientation of the content item 175 need not match the display orientation of the content slot. In some embodiments, the content item selector 160 selects a content item 175 having any display orientation, aspect ratio, or display resolution, as the content display manager 165 is able to directly modify or cause the client device to modify the content slot at the appropriate display orientation, aspect ratio, or display resolution such that the content item 175 occupies more of the content slot.
Because the content display manager 165 allows the content item selector 160 to select content items 175 regardless of their display orientation, aspect ratio, and display resolution, the content item selector 160 is able to select from a larger set of content items 175. For example, even if the content slot is in landscape mode, the content item selector 160 can select the content item 175 that is in portrait mode because the content display manager 165 can modify the display orientation of the content slot or cause the client device to modify the display orientation of the content slot to match the display orientation of the content item 175. Thus, the content item selector 160 is able to select from a larger set of content items 175 that occupy the entire screen of the client device 120, which brings a more immersive experience for the user of the client device 120 and optimizes the use of the available space for the screen of content items.
The content display manager 165 can manage or configure the display of the content items 175 in the content slots of the client device 120. For example, the content display manager 165 can manage the display of the content items 175 in response to a request for content from the client device 120 and selection of the content items 175 by the content item selector 160.
The content display manager 165 can compare the display parameters of the content item 175 to the display parameters of the content slot. The content display manager 165 can receive parameters for the content item 175 from the content item manager 150. The parameters of the content item 175 can include a display orientation, an aspect ratio, or a display resolution of the content item 175. Similarly, the content display manager 165 can receive parameters of the content slot from the content request receiver 155. The parameter of the content slot can include a display direction or an aspect ratio of the content slot.
The content display manager 165 can compare the display orientation of the content item 175 to the display orientation of the content slot. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 determines that the display orientation of the content item 175 matches the display orientation of the content slot. For example, the content display manager 165 can determine that both the content item 175 and the content slot are in landscape mode. Similarly, the content display manager 165 can determine that both the content item 175 and the content slot are in portrait mode. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 determines that the display orientation of the content item 175 and the display orientation of the content slot do not match. For example, the content display manager 165 can determine that the content item 175 is in landscape mode and the content slot is in portrait mode.
The content display manager 165 can determine the difference between the aspect ratio of the content item 175 and the aspect ratio of the content slot. For example, the content display manager 165 can determine that the content item 175 has an aspect ratio of 16. The content display manager 165 can compare the difference to a predetermined threshold indicative of the difference between the aspect ratio of the content item 175 and the content slot. The predetermined threshold can be 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%.
The content display manager 165 can determine that the difference does not exceed a predetermined threshold. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 determines that the aspect ratio of the content item 175 matches the aspect ratio of the content slot. For example, the content display manager 165 can determine that both the content item 175 and the content slot have an aspect ratio of 16. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 determines that the aspect ratio of the content item 175 does not match the aspect ratio of the content slot. For example, if the aspect ratio of the content item 175 is 16. If the difference does not exceed the predetermined threshold, the content display manager 165 can determine that the content item 175 and the content slot are in the same display orientation. For example, if the aspect ratio of the content item 175 is 16.
The content display manager 165 can determine that the difference exceeds a predetermined threshold. For example, if the aspect ratio of the content item 175 is 16. In some embodiments, when the client device 120 displays the content item 175 in the content slot, a difference that exceeds a predetermined threshold results in a blank space 226. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 determines that the display orientation of the content item 175 does not match the display orientation of the content slot in response to the difference exceeding a predetermined threshold. For example, the content display manager 165 can determine that the content item 175 is in landscape mode based on its 16.
The content display manager 165 can compare various formats of the content item 175. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 can determine that the content item 175 is in a video format. The content display manager 165 can also determine that the content item 175 is an image, a banner, or any format described herein. The content display manager 165 can compare the display orientation of the content items 175 in a format. For example, when the content item 175 is a video, the content display manager 165 can compare the display orientation of the content item 175 to the display orientation of the content slot. In some embodiments, in response to determining that the content item 175 is a video, the content display manager 165 can determine that the display orientation of the content item 175 does not match the display orientation of the content slot.
The content display manager 165 can generate instructions for the content slots. The instructions can be computer-executable scripts. In some embodiments, the instructions can be a computer program (also known as a program, software application, or code) written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages. The content display manager 165 can deploy the instructions in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. The display instructions can direct the client device 120 to display the content item 175 in the content slot.
The content display manager 165 can adjust the display direction of the content slot. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 generates instructions specifying the orientation in which the client device 120 adjusts or sets the content slots in portrait mode. Similarly, the content display manager 165 can generate instructions specifying the orientation of the content slot that the client device 120 adjusts or sets in landscape mode. The generated instructions as described herein allow the content item 175 to fit into multiple content slots such that the content item 175 occupies the entire screen without regard to whether the content slot or the client device 120 is in portrait or landscape mode, without requiring and receiving content items in different orientations of different display orientations.
The content display manager 165 configures instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slots. The content display manager 165 can configure instructions to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot from any aspect ratio discussed herein to any aspect ratio discussed herein. For example, the content display manager 165 can configure instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot from 9 to 16. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 configures the instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slots based on the display orientation of the content items 175. For example, if the aspect ratio of the content slot is 9 associated with portrait mode, but the content item 175 is in landscape mode, the content display manager 165 can configure instructions to adjust the aspect ratio to 16 associated with landscape mode. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 configures the instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot in response to determining that the display orientation of the content item 175 does not match the display orientation of the content slot. For example, if the content display manager 165 determines that the content item 175 is in landscape mode but the content slot is in portrait mode, the content display manager 165 can configure instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot from 9. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 configures the instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot based on the display orientation of the content item 175 in response to determining that the display orientation of the content item 175 does not match the display orientation of the content slot. For example, first the content display manager 165 determines that the content item 175 has an aspect ratio of 16. Next, the content display manager 165 determines whether the content slot is in portrait mode, and the content display manager 165 configures instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot from 16 to 16 associated with landscape mode.
The content display manager 165 can configure instructions to cause the client device 120 to exchange the width and height of the content slots. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 may be capable of configuring instructions to cause the client device 120 to exchange the width and height of the content slot to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot. For example, the content display manager 165 can configure instructions to cause the client device 120 to adjust the aspect ratio of the content slot from 9 to 16.
The content display manager 165 can generate instructions such that they include the display orientation of the content item 175. For example, the content display manager 165 can generate an instruction that includes the content item 175 in a landscape mode. Similarly, the content display manager 165 can generate an instruction that includes the content item 175 in portrait mode. The client device 120 or the content provider 135 can use the orientation of the content slot to verify the display of the content item 175 in the specified orientation.
The content display manager 165 can generate instructions to cause the client device 120 to lock the display orientation of the content slot. In some embodiments, the instructions cause the client device 120 to lock the aspect ratio of the content slot. For example, the content display manager 165 can generate instructions to cause the client device 120 to lock the display orientation of the screen in portrait mode. Similarly, the content display manager 165 can generate instructions to cause the client device 120 to lock the display orientation of the screen in landscape mode. The content display manager 165 can also generate instructions to cause the client device 120 to lock the display orientation of the application displaying the content slot during display of the content item 175. For example, the content display manager 165 can generate instructions to cause the client device 120 to lock the display orientation of the application in portrait mode. Similarly, the content display manager 165 can generate instructions to cause the application to lock the display orientation of the application in landscape mode. Locking the display orientation of the content slot or application can prevent movement of the client device 120 from inadvertently modifying the display orientation of the content slot after an instruction causes the client device 120 to modify the display orientation of the content slot. For example, an auto-rotation function of the client device 120 can automatically modify the aspect ratio of the content slots in response to movement of the client device 120. Thus, by locking the display orientation of the content slot or application, the display orientation of the content slot will not change in response to movement of the client device 120 during presentation of the content item 175.
The content display manager 165 can send instructions to the client device 120. The content display manager 165 sends instructions via the network 110. In some embodiments, the content display manager 165 can send an instruction to the client device 120 in response to determining that the display orientation of the content item 175 does not match the display orientation of the content slot. For example, the content display manager 165 can send an instruction to the client device 120 in response to determining that the content item 175 is in landscape mode but the content slot is in portrait mode.
The content display manager 165 can send the content item 175 to the client device 120. The content display manager 165 is capable of sending content items 175 via the network 110.

Referring now to fig. 2A and 2B, fig. 2A and 2B illustrate a diagram 200 of adjusting a content slot to display a content item 175 on a client device 120 in a portrait mode. Fig. 2A and 2B illustrate a width of the client device 120 along a first axis 202 and a height of the client device 120 along a second axis 204 perpendicular to the first axis 202. Client device 120 can include a screen 210 and content slots 220A and 220B (collectively referred to as content slots 220). As shown in FIG. 2A, in response to accessing an information resource of the content publisher 130, the client device 120 can send a request for content to the data processing system 140. The request for content can include parameters for the data processing system 140 to determine information about the client. In response to the content request and based on the parameters, the data processing system 140 can send the content item 175 to the client device 120. For example, the data processing system 140 can send the content item 175A to the client device 120.
If the user is orienting the client device 120, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, wherein the width of the screen 210 along the axis 202 is less than the height of the screen 210 along the axis 204, the screen 210 is in portrait mode. The screen 210 can have an aspect ratio of a: B. Since a is smaller in length than B, the content request receiver 155 can determine that the screen 210 is in the portrait mode. The content request receiver 155 is also capable of determining or identifying the aspect ratio of the screen 210 based on the display resolution of the screen 210. Content request receiver 155 is capable of determining or identifying that screen 210 has a display resolution of FxD. Accordingly, the content request receiver 155 can determine that the screen 210 has an aspect ratio of a: B.
Since the display orientation or aspect ratio of the content item 175A does not match the display orientation or aspect ratio of the content slot 220A, the content slot 220A includes empty spaces 226A and 226B. The white space 226 leaves a portion of the screen 210 and the content slot 220A unoccupied during presentation of the content item 175A, which results in a reduced immersive experience for the user of the client device 120.
Referring now to FIG. 2B, a content slot 220A is shown configured by an instruction to be in landscape mode. Because the width of content item 175A and content slot 220A along axis 204 is greater than the height along axis 202, client device 120 displays content item 175A in content slot 220A in landscape mode. Content item 175A and content slot 220A have the same aspect ratio of B: A. Content item 175A also has the same display resolution as screen 210. As shown in fig. 2A, content item 175A occupies content slot 220A and screen 210 without any empty space 226 by adjusting the display orientation of content slot 220A to match the display orientation of content item 175A. The adjustment allows content item 175A to fit into multiple content slots such that content item 175A occupies the entire screen 210 regardless of whether content slot 220A or client device 120 is in portrait or landscape mode without requiring and receiving content items in different orientations for different display orientations.
Referring now to fig. 3A and 3B, fig. 3A and 3B illustrate a diagram 300 of adjusting a content slot 220 to display a content item 175 on a client device 120 in a landscape mode. Fig. 3A and 3B include a first axis 202 along a width of the client device 120 and a second axis 204 along a length of the client device 120. As shown in FIG. 3A, in response to accessing the information resources of the content publisher 130, the client device 120 can send a request for content to the data processing system 140. The request for content can include parameters for the data processing system 140 to determine information about the client. In response to the content request and based on the parameters, the data processing system 140 can send the content item 175 to the client device 120. For example, the data processing system 140 can send the content item 175B to the client device 120.
If the user is orienting the client device 120 to view content as shown in fig. 3A and 3B, where the width of the screen 210 along the axis 204 is greater than the height of the screen 210 along the axis 202, the screen 210 is in landscape mode. The screen 210 can have an aspect ratio of B: a. Since B is longer than a, the content request receiver 155 can determine that the screen 210 is in the landscape mode. The content request receiver 155 is also capable of determining or identifying the aspect ratio of the screen 210 based on the display resolution of the screen 210. The content request receiver 155 is able to determine or identify that the screen 210 has a display resolution of DxF. Accordingly, the content request receiver 155 can determine that the screen 210 has an aspect ratio of B: a.
Because the display orientation or aspect ratio of content item 175B does not match the display orientation or aspect ratio of content slot 220B, content slot 220B includes empty spaces 226C and 226D. The white space 226 leaves a portion of the screen 210 and the content slot 220B unoccupied during presentation of the content item 175B, which results in a reduced immersive experience for the user of the client device 120.
Referring now to FIG. 3B, a content slot 220B configured by instructions to be in portrait mode is shown. Because the width of content item 175B and content slot 220B along axis 202 is greater than the height along axis 204, client device 120 displays content item 175B in content slot 220B in portrait mode. Content item 175B and content slot 220B have the same aspect ratio of A: B. Content item 175B also has the same display resolution as screen 210. In contrast to that shown in FIG. 3A, content item 175B occupies content slot 220B and screen 210 without any empty space 226 by adjusting the display orientation of content slot 220B to match the display orientation of content item 175B. The adjustment allows content item 175B to fit into multiple content slots such that content item 175B occupies the entire screen 210 regardless of whether content slot 220B or client device 120 is in portrait or landscape mode without requiring and receiving content items in different orientations for different display orientations.

A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a data communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. Elements of a computer include a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, the computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game player, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive), to name a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and storage devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can also be used to provide interaction with the user, for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, the computer can interact with the user by delivering documents to and receiving documents from the devices used by the user, for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on the user's device in response to requests received from the web browser.
Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described is this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN") and a wide area network ("WAN"), an internetwork (e.g., the internet), and a peer-to-peer network (e.g., an ad hoc peer-to-peer network).
A computing system, such as data processing system 140, can include clients and servers. For example, the data processing system 140 can include one or more servers in one or more data centers or server farms. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, the server sends data (e.g., an HTML page) to the client device (e.g., for displaying data to and receiving input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., the results of an interaction, computation, or any other event or computation) can be received at the server from the client device, and vice versa.
