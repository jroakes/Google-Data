- FIG. 1 is a screenshot of the user interface to a marketplace of digital goods.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a system for filtering digital goods in a marketplace.
- FIG. 3 is another screenshot of a user interface to a marketplace of digital goods.
- FIG. 4 is another screenshot of a user interface to a marketplace of digital goods.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary user interface that can be used to implement the techniques described here.
- FIG. 6 illustrates another exemplary user interface that can be used to implement the techniques described here.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a process for providing mode indicators for web browser extensions and applications.
- FIG. 8 shows an example of a computer device and a mobile computer device that can be used to implement the techniques described here.
- a web browser executed by a client device can receive code (e.g., HTML code) from a remote server (e.g., a remote server that hosts a website) and can execute the received code on the client device for the benefit of a user of the client device.
- code e.g., HTML code
- remote server e.g., a remote server that hosts a website
- the web browser may include or be associated with one or more web applications.
- a “web application” may be configured to perform a single task or multiple tasks for a user.
- the web application may be configured to be executed or interpreted by the web browser. This is compared with the native applications that include machine executable code and are configured to be executed directly by a processor or via the operating system of the client device, whereas, a web application may be incapable of execution or display without the aid of the web browser.
- web applications can be run inside a browser with a dedicated user interface, and typically provide functionality and an experience that is more rich and interactive than a standalone website but are less cumbersome and monolithic than a desktop application. Examples of web applications include games, photo editors, and video players that are run inside the browser.
- Web applications can be “hosted applications” or “packaged applications.” Hosted applications may include at least a portion of a web site that itself includes web pages, plus some metadata that may be especially pertinent to the web application or to the user of the web application to allow the web application to perform some particular functionality for the user.
- Packaged applications can be thought of as web applications whose code is bundled, so that the user can download all of the content of the web application for execution by the browser. A packaged web application may not need to have network access to perform its functionality for the user, and rather may be executed successfully by the browser locally on the computing device without access to a network.
- Packaged web applications have the option of using Extension APIs, allowing packaged applications to change the way the browser behaves or looks.
- the web browser may include or be configured to interact with one or more browser extensions.
- a “browser extension” may include one or more web pages packaged or grouped together as a definable whole, and configured to extend the functionality to the web browser.
- extensions also provide extra functionality to a browser, but generally, unlike applications, there is little or no user interface component to the functionality provided by an extension.
- web extensions extend the functionality of the browser and the websites being viewed in it. For example, web extensions can extend the functionality of the browser by adding a new button to the address bar, such as an ever-present currency converter.
- Buttons like this can also apply to the current website being viewed—for example, clicking the currency converter button can convert all prices on the website presented to a user into a currency chosen by the user.
- an extension can be installed so that when a user hovers a cursor over a thumbnail image on a webpage executed by a browser a larger-size version of the image is displayed until the user moves the cursor away from the image.
- and extension may be installed to embed a “mail this” button next to every link in every page.
- extensions cut across websites and web applications. Extensions are usually in effect across all websites (though some are site-specific). Web applications do not combine with other applications in this way. Rather, web applications run standalone, like any regular website. Web browser extensions and applications can be downloaded for installation in and execution by a browser running on a client computing device.
- FIG. 1 is a screenshot of a user interface 100 to a marketplace of digital goods (such as web applications and browser extensions).
- the user interface 100 can be displayed by a browser application that is executed by a computing device that may be connected to a network (e.g., the Internet).
- the browser application can open one or more tabs 102 , one of which may display the user interface to the marketplace when a user navigates to a webpage identified by a uniform resource locator (URL) 104 that provides content to the browser so that the browser can display the user interface to the marketplace in the tab.
- URL uniform resource locator
- the content provided by the webpage to the user can include a plurality of icons 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E, 110 A, 110 B, 110 C that represent digital goods that can be downloaded from the webpage by the user for execution by a computing device controlled by the user.
- the digital goods can include applications that can be downloaded from the marketplace to a client computing device where they can be installed on the computing device for execution by a browser running on the computing device.
- Such applications can be known as “installable web applications,” because they are downloadable from the World Wide Web and may be able to access the World Wide Web when executing in the browser.
- the installable web applications may not run natively on the computing device after they have been downloaded, but rather they may be executed through a browser that runs on the computing device.
- the digital goods can include applications that can be downloaded from the marketplace to a client computing device where they can be installed on the computing device for native execution running on the computing device.
- the digital goods may include native applications such as an address book, calendar, calculator, social-media application, game, or travel application.
- Native applications may be executable on the client computing device without access to a network (e.g., without Internet, Wi-Fi, 3G access).
- the installable web applications can be displayed in a manner that is organized to help a user decide which applications may be useful or relevant to the user.
- the user interface 100 can include a category 112 of applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, and 106 E that have been recently released in the marketplace and which a curator of the marketplace may deem to be especially noteworthy to users.
- the applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E shown in the category 112 can be limited to applications that have been released in the marketplace within a recent period of time (e.g. one week, one month, three months, six months).
- a subset of the applications that have been released into the marketplace within the recent period of time can be selected based on a variety of signals that indicate the noteworthiness of the selected applications to the user, and the selected subset of applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, can be displayed within the category 112 . That is, the applications 106 A, 106 B, 106 C, 106 D, 106 E, shown in the New and Noteworthy category 112 of the user interface 100 can be a subset of a larger number of applications that also could qualify as being new and noteworthy but which have not been selected for display in the user interface 100 .
- the digital goods can include browser extensions.
- Certain applications may include a graphical indicator representing a feature of the application, for example adjacent (i.e., near) the icon representing the application.
- the icon for application 106 E includes graphical indicator 106 F to represent that application 106 E is capable of working online or offline (e.g., with or without Internet access, or Wi-Fi access, or 3G access, etc.).
- the design and depiction of icon 106 F is merely for illustration.
- icons for applications that only work online may be dimmed, or displayed in a different manner from icons for applications that work online and offline, for example.
- indicator 106 F may be a link to another version (e.g., a counterpart web application, browser extension, or other application with offline capability) of the application represented by icon 106 E.
- the user interface 100 can include a category 114 of applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E that have been filtered for display in the user interface 100 .
- the applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E that are filtered in the category 114 can be selected based on criteria evaluated by a curator of the market place or evaluated automatically by a server. For example, the curator or the server may select the applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E for display in the category “Offline Capable” 114 from a much larger set of applications based on features of the selected applications, such as whether the selected applications work offline.
- the curator or the server may select the applications 108 A, 108 B, 108 C, 108 D, 108 E based upon features specified by developers of the applications, such whether the applications require a touch screen of a computing device or whether the applications utilize a location sensor or graphic accelerator of a computing device.
- the user interface 100 can include a category 116 of applications 110 A, 110 B, 110 C that have been selected for display in the category 116 of the user interface 100 based on a whether the applications require a touch screen.
- the subset of applications in category 116 can be determined automatically by a server, or by a curator of the digital marketplace, for example based on information provided by developers of the applications, or based on reviews by users who have installed the applications.
- the user interface 100 of the marketplace also can include categories of applications in other subportions of the user interface 100 in which smaller icons are used to represent the applications that are used in categories 112 , 114 , 116 .
- category 118 can display “Favorite Offline Apps,” which can be applications that work without internet access. Applications listed in the Favorite Offline Apps category 118 can be the most frequently downloaded and/or most frequently installed applications which work both online and offline.
- category 120 can display “Recommended—Touch,” which can be applications that are selected by a curator at the marketplace, or by a server, based on the selected applications being deemed especially interesting to a particular user, for example based on capabilities of a computer device the user utilizes to access the digital marketplace.
- a server may detect that a user is utilizing a particular type of web-enabled phone with a touch screen, and include applications in category 118 that are recommended for the type of web-enabled phone.
- a server may detect that a user is utilizing a desktop to access the digital marketplace, and include applications in category 118 that are recommended for desktops.
- categories 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 120 can display a subset of applications that are categorized to fall within the category. Because screen space within the user interface is limited, only a subset of the applications that fall within a category may be displayed within the user interface 100 . However, by selecting a hyperlink associated with the category, more applications that fall within the category can be displayed to a user. For example, each category 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 120 is associated with a hyperlink labeled “All,” the selection of which may cause more applications that fall within the category to be displayed.
- an “Apps” section 122 can provide a list of hyperlinks, which each can be selected to display applications that belong to a category identified by the hyperlink.
- selection of the “Education” hyperlink 123 can cause a group of icons that represent applications related to educational topics to be displayed.
- an “Extensions” section 124 can provide a list of hyperlinks, which each can be selected to display extensions that belong to a category identified by the hyperlink, where an extension is executable code that extends the functionality of a browser.
- selection of the “Sports” hyperlink 125 can cause a group of icons that represent extensions related to sports topics to be displayed.
- digital goods In addition to locating digital goods (e.g., web applications and extensions) that are already displayed within a category 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 120 of the user interface 100 as a result of selecting a hyperlink, digital goods also can be located as a result of a query for goods that may be of interest to the user. For example, a user may enter query terms into an query box 126 that may receive the query terms and pass the terms onto a search engine that then locates digital goods that match the query terms and that are available in the marketplace.
- digital goods such as web applications can have a variety of metadata associated with them that are used to index the digital goods, and the query terms can be compared to the metadata associated with the digital goods. Based on the comparison, applications that best match the query terms can be selected from the digital goods available in the marketplace, and the selected goods can be presented to the user in the user interface 100 .
- the user interface 100 also includes a hyperlink 127 that can be selected so that the user can log into the marketplace.
- selection of the hyperlink 127 can trigger the display of a prompt to the user to enter a username and password, and successful entry of the username and password may allow the user to log into a personal account associated the marketplace.
- digital goods can be selected and presented to the user within the user interface 100 , where the selection of the goods can be personalized to the user based on data associated with the user's account.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of an example embodiment of a system 200 for providing mode indicators for digital goods in a marketplace.
- the system 200 may include client computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, notebook computers, netbook computers, tablet computers, smart-phone, etc.) 202 A, 202 B, 202 C.
- client computing device 202 A can include one or more processors 204 and one or more memories 206 .

- the client computing device 202 A can include a location detector 216 , which may automatically detect a location of the computing device, for example, based on global positioning system (GPS) signals, or by triangulation of signals from transmitters at known locations, or by using other hardware and/or techniques.
- a location detector 216 may automatically detect a location of the computing device, for example, based on global positioning system (GPS) signals, or by triangulation of signals from transmitters at known locations, or by using other hardware and/or techniques.
- GPS global positioning system
- the client computing device 202 A may be running or causing the operating system 208 to execute an application 210 or window 212 .
- the window 212 is referred to as a web browser. However, it is understood that the above is merely one illustrative example to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
- this window 212 may include a plurality of panes or tabs 214 A, 214 B, 214 C.
- the window 212 can be a visual area, usually rectangular, containing some kind of user interface.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the window 212 can be a two-dimensional object arranged on a plane of the GUI known as the desktop.
- the window 212 can include other graphical objects, e.g., a menu-bar, toolbars, controls, icons and usually a working area in which the document, image, folder contents or other main object can be displayed.
- the working area may be capable of holding only one main object (i.e., in a single document interface) or more than one main object in a multiple document interface.
- multiple documents can be displayed in individual tabs 214 A, 214 B, 214 C.
- These tabs 214 A, 214 B, 214 C are typically displayed one at a time, and are selectable via a tab-bar which often resides above the contents of an individual window. That is, one selected tab 214 A is “forward-facing” and displays information or content to a user in the window 212 , with the content of other tabs 214 B, 214 C is “hidden.”
- the client computing devices 202 A, 202 B, 202 C may receive online content from one or more server computing devices 230 , 250 , 270 , that may be connected to the client device 202 through a network 290 .
- Each of the client computing devices 202 A, 202 B, 202 C can be connected to the network 290 through a local Internet Service Provider 292 .
- the received online content can be processed and displayed in the window 212 (e.g., in a on a tab 214 of the window 212 ).
- the window 212 can display a user interface of a marketplace for digital goods, similar to the user interface of the marketplace described herein, to a user.
- a user can interact with the displayed content, and an activity metadata generator (MD GEN) 218 can monitor the user's interactions with the content and the performance of the application 210 and can generate activity metadata based on the user's interactions with the content and based on the performance of the application 210 .
- MD GEN activity metadata generator
- a location of the client computing device 202 A can be determined based on a location associated with the ISP 292 .
- a known location of the ISP can be used as an approximation or as a proxy for the location of the client computing device 202 A.

The processor provides to a client device instructions to display a graphical indicator representing at least one of the specified set of modes, wherein the graphical indicator is associated with a graphical icon representing the first web application in the digital marketplace.
- In various implementations, the specified set of modes includes the mode of executing the first web application on a computing device with a touch screen. The specified set of modes may include the mode of providing a location of a computing device running the first web application. The specified set of modes may also include the mode of determining a three-dimensional acceleration of a computing device running the first web application. Further, it may be determined that a computing device accessing the digital marketplace includes at least one specified feature. The web applications and browser extensions may be filtered based on the at least one specified feature, and the instructions may specify to display graphical icons for only the filtered web applications and browser extensions in a user interface. The at least one specified feature may include at least one of: a predetermined minimum processor size, a predetermined minimum memory size, a geographic position system, a touch screen, or a predetermined minimum battery life. The graphical icons for only the filtered web applications and browser extensions may be displayed in the digital marketplace.
- In some implementations, the processor determines that a subset of the filtered set of web applications and browser extensions are executable without access to a network. The instructions may specify to display a graphical indicator representing the determination. The graphical indicator may be associated with a graphical icon representing each of the web applications and browser extensions of the subset of web applications and browser extensions.
- According to another general aspect, a tangible computer-readable storage medium has recorded and stored thereon instructions that, when executed by a processor of a computer system cause the computer system to: establish a digital marketplace for web applications and browser extensions; determine that a first web application of the web applications and browser extensions includes a specified set of modes, wherein the specified set of modes includes executing the first web application without access to a network; and provide instructions to a client device to display a graphical indicator representing at least one of the specified set of modes, wherein the graphical indicator is displayed associated with a graphical icon representing the first web application in the digital marketplace.
- According to yet another general aspect, a system includes a memory configured to store executable code and a processor operably coupled to the memory. The processor is configured to execute the code to establish a digital marketplace for web applications and browser extensions determine that a first web application of the web applications and browser extensions includes a specified set of modes, the specified set of modes including executing the first web application without access to a network. The processor is configured to execute the code to provide instructions to a client device to display a graphical indicator representing at least one of the specified set of modes, wherein the graphical indicator is associated with a graphical icon representing the first web application in the digital marketplace.
- According to yet another general aspect, a computer-implemented method for providing capability indicators includes establishing, by a processor of a computing system, a digital marketplace for digital goods. The processor determines that a first digital good includes a counterpart digital good that is executable without access to a network. The processor provides to a client device instructions to display a graphical indicator representing the counterpart digital good. The graphical indicator representing the counterpart digital good is displayed in the digital marketplace.
- Various implementations may include additional features. For example, the graphical indicator representing the counterpart digital good may include a link to the counterpart digital good. It may be determined that a computing device accessing the digital marketplace includes at least one specified feature. The digital goods may be filtered based on the at least one specified feature. The instructions may specify to display graphical icons for only the filtered digital goods in a user interface.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- A web browser executed by a client device can receive code (e.g., HTML code) from a remote server (e.g., a remote server that hosts a website) and can execute the received code on the client device for the benefit of a user of the client device.
- In various implementations, the web browser may include or be associated with one or more web applications. In this context, a “web application” may be configured to perform a single task or multiple tasks for a user. In such an implementation, the web application may be configured to be executed or interpreted by the web browser. This is compared with the native applications that include machine executable code and are configured to be executed directly by a processor or via the operating system of the client device, whereas, a web application may be incapable of execution or display without the aid of the web browser. Thus, web applications can be run inside a browser with a dedicated user interface, and typically provide functionality and an experience that is more rich and interactive than a standalone website but are less cumbersome and monolithic than a desktop application. Examples of web applications include games, photo editors, and video players that are run inside the browser.
- Web applications can be “hosted applications” or “packaged applications.” Hosted applications may include at least a portion of a web site that itself includes web pages, plus some metadata that may be especially pertinent to the web application or to the user of the web application to allow the web application to perform some particular functionality for the user. Packaged applications can be thought of as web applications whose code is bundled, so that the user can download all of the content of the web application for execution by the browser. A packaged web application may not need to have network access to perform its functionality for the user, and rather may be executed successfully by the browser locally on the computing device without access to a network. Packaged web applications have the option of using Extension APIs, allowing packaged applications to change the way the browser behaves or looks.
- In various implementations, the web browser may include or be configured to interact with one or more browser extensions. In this context, a “browser extension” may include one or more web pages packaged or grouped together as a definable whole, and configured to extend the functionality to the web browser. Thus, extensions also provide extra functionality to a browser, but generally, unlike applications, there is little or no user interface component to the functionality provided by an extension. Instead, web extensions extend the functionality of the browser and the websites being viewed in it. For example, web extensions can extend the functionality of the browser by adding a new button to the address bar, such as an ever-present currency converter. Buttons like this can also apply to the current website being viewed—for example, clicking the currency converter button can convert all prices on the website presented to a user into a currency chosen by the user. In another example, an extension can be installed so that when a user hovers a cursor over a thumbnail image on a webpage executed by a browser a larger-size version of the image is displayed until the user moves the cursor away from the image. In another example, and extension may be installed to embed a “mail this” button next to every link in every page. Compared to web applications, extensions cut across websites and web applications. Extensions are usually in effect across all websites (though some are site-specific). Web applications do not combine with other applications in this way. Rather, web applications run standalone, like any regular website. Web browser extensions and applications can be downloaded for installation in and execution by a browser running on a client computing device.

FIG. 1 is a screenshot of auser interface 100 to a marketplace of digital goods (such as web applications and browser extensions). Theuser interface 100 can be displayed by a browser application that is executed by a computing device that may be connected to a network (e.g., the Internet). The browser application can open one ormore tabs 102, one of which may display the user interface to the marketplace when a user navigates to a webpage identified by a uniform resource locator (URL) 104 that provides content to the browser so that the browser can display the user interface to the marketplace in the tab. - The content provided by the webpage to the user can include a plurality of
icons user interface 100, the installable web applications can be displayed in a manner that is organized to help a user decide which applications may be useful or relevant to the user. For example, theuser interface 100 can include a category 112 ofapplications applications applications applications user interface 100 can be a subset of a larger number of applications that also could qualify as being new and noteworthy but which have not been selected for display in theuser interface 100. In certain implementations, the digital goods can include browser extensions. - Certain applications may include a graphical indicator representing a feature of the application, for example adjacent (i.e., near) the icon representing the application. For example, the icon for
application 106E includesgraphical indicator 106F to represent thatapplication 106E is capable of working online or offline (e.g., with or without Internet access, or Wi-Fi access, or 3G access, etc.). The design and depiction oficon 106F is merely for illustration. Alternatively or additionally, icons for applications that only work online may be dimmed, or displayed in a different manner from icons for applications that work online and offline, for example. In some embodiments,indicator 106F may be a link to another version (e.g., a counterpart web application, browser extension, or other application with offline capability) of the application represented byicon 106E. - In another example, the
user interface 100 can include acategory 114 ofapplications user interface 100. Theapplications category 114 can be selected based on criteria evaluated by a curator of the market place or evaluated automatically by a server. For example, the curator or the server may select theapplications applications - In another example, the
user interface 100 can include acategory 116 ofapplications category 116 of theuser interface 100 based on a whether the applications require a touch screen. The subset of applications incategory 116 can be determined automatically by a server, or by a curator of the digital marketplace, for example based on information provided by developers of the applications, or based on reviews by users who have installed the applications. - The
user interface 100 of the marketplace also can include categories of applications in other subportions of theuser interface 100 in which smaller icons are used to represent the applications that are used incategories category 118 can display “Favorite Offline Apps,” which can be applications that work without internet access. Applications listed in the FavoriteOffline Apps category 118 can be the most frequently downloaded and/or most frequently installed applications which work both online and offline. In another example,category 120 can display “Recommended—Touch,” which can be applications that are selected by a curator at the marketplace, or by a server, based on the selected applications being deemed especially interesting to a particular user, for example based on capabilities of a computer device the user utilizes to access the digital marketplace. For example, a server may detect that a user is utilizing a particular type of web-enabled phone with a touch screen, and include applications incategory 118 that are recommended for the type of web-enabled phone. As another example, a server may detect that a user is utilizing a desktop to access the digital marketplace, and include applications incategory 118 that are recommended for desktops. - Within the
user interface 100,categories user interface 100. However, by selecting a hyperlink associated with the category, more applications that fall within the category can be displayed to a user. For example, eachcategory - Other parts of the
user interface 100 also can be used to organize the digital goods that are available in the marketplace. For example, an “Apps”section 122 can provide a list of hyperlinks, which each can be selected to display applications that belong to a category identified by the hyperlink. For example, selection of the “Education”hyperlink 123 can cause a group of icons that represent applications related to educational topics to be displayed. In another example, an “Extensions”section 124 can provide a list of hyperlinks, which each can be selected to display extensions that belong to a category identified by the hyperlink, where an extension is executable code that extends the functionality of a browser. For example, selection of the “Sports”hyperlink 125 can cause a group of icons that represent extensions related to sports topics to be displayed. - In addition to locating digital goods (e.g., web applications and extensions) that are already displayed within a
category user interface 100 as a result of selecting a hyperlink, digital goods also can be located as a result of a query for goods that may be of interest to the user. For example, a user may enter query terms into anquery box 126 that may receive the query terms and pass the terms onto a search engine that then locates digital goods that match the query terms and that are available in the marketplace. For example, digital goods such as web applications can have a variety of metadata associated with them that are used to index the digital goods, and the query terms can be compared to the metadata associated with the digital goods. Based on the comparison, applications that best match the query terms can be selected from the digital goods available in the marketplace, and the selected goods can be presented to the user in theuser interface 100. - The
user interface 100 also includes ahyperlink 127 that can be selected so that the user can log into the marketplace. For example, selection of thehyperlink 127 can trigger the display of a prompt to the user to enter a username and password, and successful entry of the username and password may allow the user to log into a personal account associated the marketplace. As explained in more detail below, once the user is logged into the marketplace, digital goods can be selected and presented to the user within theuser interface 100, where the selection of the goods can be personalized to the user based on data associated with the user's account. -
FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of an example embodiment of a system 200 for providing mode indicators for digital goods in a marketplace. In various implementations, the system 200 may include client computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, notebook computers, netbook computers, tablet computers, smart-phone, etc.) 202A, 202B, 202C. Aclient computing device 202A can include one ormore processors 204 and one ormore memories 206. Theclient computing device 202A can execute anoperating system 208 and anapplication 210 that which may display auser interface window 212. Theclient computing device 202A can include alocation detector 216, which may automatically detect a location of the computing device, for example, based on global positioning system (GPS) signals, or by triangulation of signals from transmitters at known locations, or by using other hardware and/or techniques. - In one implementation, the
client computing device 202A may be running or causing theoperating system 208 to execute anapplication 210 orwindow 212. For purposes of illustration thewindow 212 is referred to as a web browser. However, it is understood that the above is merely one illustrative example to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited. In various implementations, thiswindow 212 may include a plurality of panes ortabs window 212 can be a visual area, usually rectangular, containing some kind of user interface. In a graphical user interface (GUI) used in theclient device 202A, thewindow 212 can be a two-dimensional object arranged on a plane of the GUI known as the desktop. Thewindow 212 can include other graphical objects, e.g., a menu-bar, toolbars, controls, icons and usually a working area in which the document, image, folder contents or other main object can be displayed. The working area may be capable of holding only one main object (i.e., in a single document interface) or more than one main object in a multiple document interface. In some applications, specifically web browsers, multiple documents can be displayed inindividual tabs tabs tab 214A is “forward-facing” and displays information or content to a user in thewindow 212, with the content ofother tabs - The
client computing devices server computing devices network 290. Each of theclient computing devices network 290 through a localInternet Service Provider 292. The received online content can be processed and displayed in the window 212 (e.g., in a on a tab 214 of the window 212). For example, thewindow 212 can display a user interface of a marketplace for digital goods, similar to the user interface of the marketplace described herein, to a user. A user can interact with the displayed content, and an activity metadata generator (MD GEN) 218 can monitor the user's interactions with the content and the performance of theapplication 210 and can generate activity metadata based on the user's interactions with the content and based on the performance of theapplication 210. - A location of the
client computing device 202A can be determined based on a location associated with theISP 292. For example, a known location of the ISP can be used as an approximation or as a proxy for the location of theclient computing device 202A. - The
client computing device 202A can communicate with a digitalgoods marketplace server 250 that provides a marketplace for digital goods toclient computing devices marketplace server 250 can include one ormore processors 252 and one ormore memories 254. Themarketplace server 250 can execute an operating system and various applications and services to provide functionality to the client computing devices. For example, in one implementation, themarketplace server 250 can include a repository for database ofdigital goods 258, and the digital goods can be served from, or downloaded from, the repository to the client computing devices. In another implementation, the digital goods can be stored in, and serve to client computing devices from, a repository that is remotely located from the marketplace server. For example, digital goods could be stored and served to client computing devices from individual repositories that are operated and controlled by developers of the digital goods, anddigital goods repository 258 of themarketplace server 250 can provide just a reference to the individual repositories that are operated by the developers. - The
marketplace server 250 can include ametadata database 260 that stores metadata associated with the digital goods that are available from or referenced by thedigital goods repository 258. The metadata associated with a digital good can include a variety of information about the digital goods including, for example, information about the digital goods that are available from therepository 258. Such information can include, for example, representative keywords associated with the digital goods, whether the digital goods work both online and offline, and the price associated with the digital goods. The metadata may also include demographic data about targeted users of the digital good, features required by the digital goods, etc. For example, metadata associated with a running tracker application may indicate that the good is intended for individual users with portable phones that include GPS sensors. - The
marketplace server 250 can includequery handler 262 that can be configured to receive and process queries for digital goods available in the marketplace. For example, the query handler can receive queries for digital goods that are entered intoquery box 126 of theuser interface 100 shown inFIG. 1 . Terms or phrases of the queries then can be compared to terms and phrases (e.g., terms and phrases stored in the metadata database 260) that are used to index the digital goods available in the marketplace. Based on the comparison, a subset of digital goods can be selected from thedatabase 258 with which to respond to the query. - The
marketplace server 250 can include afiltering engine 264 that is configured to filter digital goods based on a specified set of capabilities or modes. For example, the specified set of capabilities or modes may include that the web application is capable of executing offline, or that the web application is capable of executing with touch screen, a graphic accelerator, a camera, or a location sensor. - The
marketplace 250 can include apresentation engine 266 that prepares information for transmission to theclient computing devices user interface 100 that shows representations of selected digital goods available in the marketplace. For example, based on the output of theranking engine 264, thepresentation engine 266 can prepare HTML code, XML code, etc. that determines the information that is displayed to a user in theuser interface 100 and where the code determines which digital goods will be displayed in theuser interface 100 to the user. - The
filtering engine 264 can use a variety of information to filter the digital goods, for example, based on the relative desirability to the user of different digital applications available in the marketplace. In one implementation, the signals used by thefiltering engine 264 can be based the capabilities of a client computing device and the requirements of certain web applications. - The information that is provided by an
application 210 running on a client device to the marketplace server 250 (e.g., regarding the type or capabilities ofcomputing device 202A, etc.) can be provided on an opt-in basis. In other words, such information may be provided from theclient computing device 202A to theserver 250 only if the user of the client device specifically authorizes the transmission of such information from the client to the server. In addition, information may be anonymized before it is sent tomarketplace server 250. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , the system 200 can include asearch engine server 230 that includes one ormore processors 232, one ormore memories 234, anoperating system 236, aquery handler 238, and aresult server 240. Thequery handler 238 can receive queries that include one or more query terms or query phrases fromclient computing devices result server 240 can provide search results in response to the queries. Thesearch engine server 230 can monitor the query terms and phrases received from client devices, and based on the query term traffic thesearch engine server 230 can generate statistics about trends in users' interests. For example, when a previously-unknown singer becomes a star entertainer, trends in query term traffic may reveal that users are becoming more interested in discovering information about the singer. Similarly, when a movie or a game becomes popular, trends in the search engine traffic received to thesearch engine server 230 can automatically reveal the increase in the popularity. In another example, search engine trends can be driven by seasonal factors, such as search queries for “costumes” rising in the weeks before Halloween, or queries for the purchase of products rising during the winter holiday season. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , the system 200 can include asocial network server 270 that includes one or more processors to 272, one ormore memories 274, anoperating system 276, and asocial network application 278. Thesocial network application 272 can provide a network, environment, virtual world through which a particular user can interact with selected colleagues, friends, acquaintances (collectively, “friends”) of the particular user. For example, the particular user can exchange information with his or her friends about interests that they may share. Thus, a user that downloads a digital good from themarketplace server 250 and installs and executes the digital goods within a client computing device controlled by the user may recommend the web application to the user's friends. Such recommendations pass through thesocial application 278, and anonymous information about such recommendations can be gathered by thesocial network server 270 and then passed on to thefiltering engine 264. The filtering engine then can base its filtering of digital goods in the marketplace on statistical information about such recommendations. For example, thefiltering engine 264 can filter applications such that a user sees web applications that have received a predetermined number of recommendations within the context of asocial network application 278. In another example, thefiltering engine 264 can boost a user-specific ranking of a web application when the web application has been recommended frequently within the context of a social network application by friends of the specific user to their friends. - The
filtering engine 264 also can use other signals that are generated outside of the marketplace to generate rankings of digital goods available in the marketplace. In one implementation, thefiltering engine 264 can filter digital goods specific to a user for digital goods that are available within the marketplace, where the filtering is based in some way on information that is associated with the user and that is generated outside the marketplace. In one implementation, the information associated with the user may include information that the user actively provides or enters (e.g., one or more capabilities of one or more of the user's computing devices, the user's age, one or more user entered preferences, likes or dislikes, etc.). In one implementation, the information associated with a user may include information inferred from user actions (e.g., the user's browsing history, the user's computing device's features, the user clicking on advertisements, etc.) or passively gathered about the user (e.g., the user's location, the type of user computing device, hardware associated with the user's computing device, etc.). - For example, hardware associated with one of the user's computing devices that is being used to access the digital marketplace can be compared to metadata associated with digital goods, and the
filtering engine 264 can provide rankings of digital goods based on such comparisons. The hardware can be determined in a number of ways, including being provided actively by the user or passively with authorization from the user. For example,digital marketplace server 250 may determine thatcomputing device 202B includes a three-dimensional (3D) graphical accelerator, and is therefore capable of running web applications with 3D graphical features. Conversely,digital marketplace server 250 may determine thatcomputing device 202C does not include a 3D graphical accelerator, and is filteringengine 264 may filter out applications with 3D graphical features so they are not displayed, or dimmed when presented to a user ofcomputing device 202C. As another example,digital marketplace server 250 may determine thatcomputing device 202B includes a front-facing camera, and is therefore capable of running web applications that utilize front-facing cameras. - The information that is provided by an
application 210 running on a client device to the marketplace server 250 (e.g., regarding a user's browsing history, etc.) can be provided on an opt-in basis. In other words, such information may be provided from theclient computing device 202A to theserver 250 only if the user of the client device specifically authorizes the transmission of such information from the client to the server. - In some implementations, a user account allows a user to authenticate to system services (e.g., web applications) and receive authorization to access them. To log in to a user account, a user may authenticate herself with a password or other credentials for the purposes of accounting, security, and resource management, for example. Once the user has logged on (e.g., to a web browser, to a computing device, etc.) an operating system may use an identifier such as an integer to refer to the user, rather than a username. For example, the username may be correlated with a user identifier. A system (e.g., server 250) may reconcile and validate the proper ownership of user accounts, and can permanently link ownership of those user accounts to particular individuals by assigning a unique identifier to validated account login identifiers (e.g., user names and passwords, secure identifiers, etc.). The system may validate that individuals only have account login identifiers for the appropriate systems and applications, for example according to an organization's business policies, access control policies, and various application requirements.
- A unique identifier in the context of identity correlation may be any identifier that is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for a group of individuals and for a specific purpose. Unique identifiers may be serial numbers assigned incrementally, random numbers selected from a number space much larger than the maximum (or expected) number of objects to be identified, names, or codes allocated by choice but verified as unique. Unique identifiers may be used to sync web applications, browser extensions, and mode indicators among various computing devices accessible to a user.
- When a packaged web application has been installed,
computing device 202A may locally store some data related to the packaged web application. A server (e.g., digital marketplace server 250) may ensure that local data fromcomputing device 202A is synced across all of a user's devices or all devices that are used to log the user into a user account. Additionally, passwords traditionally are stored locally, but can be synced across devices using the server. Further, the server may sync across different devices all installed web applications, browser extensions, browser bookmarks, settings, profiles, browser history, themes, plugins, local permissions, mode indicators, and data associated with the web applications and browser extensions for a user. For example, if a user ofcomputing device 202A accesses a user account (for example, via a web browser) fromcomputing device 202C,server 250 may copy settings and data associated with web applications and browser extensions (for example, that the user has selected to sync) from the user account tocomputing device 202C. Further, the server may be capable of device-sensitive sync. For example, certain versions of web applications with powerful graphics may be suitable for a desktop computer with a hardware accelerator and large display monitor, but not as suitable for a web-enabled phone, tablet, or laptop. The server may determine that a version of the web application is not as suitable for a user's web-enabled phone, tablet, or laptop, and may notify the user (e.g., during a sync or login process), or exclude a version or a web application from syncing on the user's web-enabled phone, tablet, or laptop. - Changes to settings on one computing device may be automatically copied (e.g., via server 250) from other computers (for example, if the user has enabled that sync feature). Synced data may be encrypted when it travels between
computing devices server 250 to keep information secure. Further, passwords may be encrypted oncomputing devices server 250 using a cryptographic key. Mode indicators, for example indicators related to installed web applications, may also be synced across different computing devices, and local data specifying how indicators related to the installed web applications are presented may also be synced across different computing devices. -
FIG. 3 is a screenshot of theuser interface 300 to a marketplace of digital goods. Ausername 327 is present in place of thehyperlink 127, andusername 327 is selectable, so that the user can enter login credentials indicate that a user has logged in to an account associated with the marketplace that is presented by themarketplace server 250 shown inFIG. 2 . The account associated with the marketplace also can be associated with other online or local services or applications the user may use. For example, the account associated with the marketplace also can be associated with the user's online e-mail account (e.g., Microsoft Hotmail, Yahoo mail, Google Gmail, etc.) the user's online social network account (e.g. Facebook, twitter, etc.), the user's online photo account (e.g., Snapfish, Shutterfly, Picasa, etc.), accounts at content websites (e.g., news websites game websites, entertainment websites, etc.), etc. By associating the user's marketplace account with other accounts of the user, information from the other accounts can be utilized, with the permission of the user, by thefiltering engine 264, to provide user-specific filtering of digital goods available in the marketplace to the user. The browse experience may therefor be customized, and a set of web applications may also be customized based on a user's current device, other device(s), preferences, etc. For example, selection of the “news and weather”hyperlink 302 can trigger the display of offline capable web applications tailored to web-enabled phones and related to news and weather within the user interface 300 (e.g., if the user is accessinguser interface 300 with a web-enabled phone). -
FIG. 4 is a screenshot of theuser interface 400 to a marketplace of digital goods. The screenshot is representative of a user interface that can be displayed when a user enters a query term “news” inquery box 426 to search for web applications available in the marketplace that are related to news. The query term can be compared to metadata associated with digital goods, for example, metadata stored inmetadata database 260. Based on the comparison, thequery handler 262 can identify one or more digital goods that are related to the query term. Theuser interface 400 includes adisplay item 404 that indicates that a total of 451 web applications have been identified in the marketplace as relevant to the query term “news” and that 24 of the identified applications have been selected for display in theinterface 400. The applications that are selected for display in the user interface can be selected based on a ranking of the relative desirability of the identified applications. Furthermore, among the selected subset of applications, the position of the applications within theuser interface 400 can be determined by their ranking. For example, applications with higher rankings can be displayed in rows at the top of theuser interface 400, and, within a row, applications with a higher ranking can be displayed on the left side of the row. - A pop-up
HTML window 406 can be displayed when a user moves a mouse icon over an icon for anapplication 408 that is displayed in theuser interface 400. Within the pop-upHTML window 406, additional information about theweb application 408 can be displayed. For example afield 410 can indicate whether the application is free or the price that must be paid to be able to download and install the app. Anotherfield 412 can indicate whether the application is capable of running offline. Information about the installation and/or use of the application on a client device can be transmitted from a browser executing the application of the client device to themarketplace server 250. Anotherfield 414 can display descriptive information about the web application that supplements information in thetitle field 416. Anotherfield 418 can display an average subjective rating that users have provided of the web application and a number of users that have rated the application. Anotherfield 420 can display the name of the author or developer of the application. -
FIG. 5 illustrates anexemplary user interface 500 consistent with implementations described in this disclosure.User interface 500 may be displayed by a browser application that is executed by a computing device that may be connected to a network (e.g., the Internet).
