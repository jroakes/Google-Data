- Advertising campaigns can be created to advertise products and/or services online. An advertising campaign can be directed to a broad product class, such as shoes. A shoe advertising campaign can include multiple advertisements related to shoes. Advertisements can be inserted into search results, web pages, mobile web pages, mobile content, games, online content, etc. Keywords entered into a search engine can be used to generate search results and to determine what advertisements should be inserted into the search results. An advertiser can manually enter one or more keywords used to insert an advertisement into content.
- A campaign can include a number of advertisements. Advertisements directed to a similar product or service can be grouped into ad groups. For example, a campaign regarding shoes can include ad groups containing ads directed to ladies shoes, basketball shoes, sports shoes, etc. Advertisements within an ad group can share keywords and other advertising parameters such as, but not limited to, content types that can include the advertisements, specific websites to exclude from placements, reporting data, etc.
- Creating advertising campaigns can include selecting a number of a keywords associated with one or more advertisements of the campaign. To expedite the creation of the list of keywords, keywords can be suggested to an advertiser. Suggested keywords can be based upon providing a keyword. The provided keyword is used to search for related keywords. One or more related keywords can be selected to associate the selected keywords to advertisements in a campaign and/or ad group.
- Another way to suggest keywords to an advertiser is based on an image of a product that is to be advertised. In this implementation, the advertiser does not have to provide any initial keywords. Rather, the advertiser supplies an image of the product and the image is used to suggest keywords.
FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an advertising keyword-generating system that uses an image search in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Aclient device 102 can submit animage 104 to a keyword-suggestingdevice 106. The keyword-suggesting device can submit theimage 104 to animage search engine 108. In one implementation, the image search is based only on theimage 104. In another implementation, the image search includes theimage 104 and text provided by the advertiser. For example, the advertiser can provide a textual description of the product shown in theimage 104 and submit the textual description along with theimage 104 to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106. - Using the
image 104, theimage search engine 108 searches for content that includes images that are similar to the providedimage 104. The search results can include information regarding the returned content. For example, the search results can include uniform resource locators (URLs) of content that includes an image similar to the providedimage 104. The keyword-suggestingdevice 106 can determine if any of the content is associated with an advertising account. In one implementation, URLs in the search results are provided to anadvertising device 110. Theadvertising device 110 can determine if any advertising accounts include advertisements that include any of the URLs in the search results. For example, if an account has an advertisement that directs users to a URL in the search results, the keywords associated with the advertisement can be retrieved. In another implementation, the keywords associated with the ad group that includes the advertisement is returned. In yet another implementation, the keywords associated with the campaign that includes the advertisement can be returned. These keywords can be provided to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106. - In addition to the keywords, data related to each of the keywords can also be received from the
advertising device 110. For example, the number of impressions generated from each keyword, a click through rate for each keyword, etc. In addition to data related to keywords, data related to ad groups and/or campaigns that include matched advertisements can be returned. For example, web sites that displayed advertisements, types of advertisements, etc. from an ad group and/or campaign can be returned. The data can be aggregated based upon keywords across the matching advertising campaigns. In another implementation, once a suggested list of keywords is identified, data regarding the keywords across all advertising campaigns can be determined. For example, the number of impressions of a particular keyword across all advertising campaigns can be determined. The keywords and associated data sent to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106 is anonymous. That is, the returned data does not include data that identifies the owner of any of the matching accounts, campaigns, ad groups, etc. - Using some or all of the keyword and related data, the keyword-suggesting
device 106 can determine a list of suggested keywords. For example, the keyword-suggestingdevice 106 can determine the keywords with the largest number of impressions across all of the matching advertising campaigns. The suggested keywords can include a set of ten, twenty, fifty, etc., keywords that had the largest number of impressions. The suggested keywords can also include a set of keywords based upon the keywords with the highest click-through rate. The keywords can be ordered or ranked based upon this data. Once determined, the set of suggested keywords can be provided to theclient device 102. In addition to the suggested keywords, data related to the matching ad groups/campaigns can be provided. For example, an aggregated number of impressions per keyword can be provided along with each of the suggested keywords. After receiving the suggested keywords, theclient device 102 can request that an advertisement be displayed based on one or more of the suggested keywords. The advertisement can then be inserted into search results based upon search keywords that match one or more of the selected suggested keywords. - The keyword-suggesting
device 106 can also filter out certain keywords. For example, any adult-themed keywords can be removed from the suggested keywords prior to being provided to theclient device 102. In another example, keywords that are currently active in an advertiser's campaign, ad group, etc., can be removed from the suggested keyword list. The keyword-suggestingdevice 106 can also calculate a quality score or request a quality score from theadvertising device 110. A quality score generally depends on the relevancy of a keyword. Keywords that are below a particular quality score can be removed from the suggested keyword list. For example, a quality score can take into account the number of impressions, cost for displaying an advertisement based upon the keyword, a click-through rate of the keyword, etc. - Advertisements can also be grouped into an ad group. The ad group can use a single of set of keywords to place advertisements within the ad group. Ad groups are identified by a name. The keyword-suggesting
device 106 can also provide examples of names of ad groups. In one implementation, the ad group names are based upon ad groups that the suggested keywords were located. In another implementation, the ad groups can be based upon the suggested keywords themselves. For example, a keyword of “used black muscle car” can be used to generate suggested ad group names of “muscle cars,” “black cars,” “used cars,” etc. - The suggested items returned by the keyword-suggesting
device 106 can be turned on/off by the user. For example, a user can turn off ad type suggestions, ad group name suggestions, etc., before submitting an image. In this example, after submitting an image, the user would receive suggested keywords but not suggested ad types or ad group name suggestions. - In the illustrated
system 100, the keyword-suggestingdevice 106, theimage search engine 108, and theadvertising device 110 are separate computing devices. In other implementations one or more of the computing devices can be combined. For example, the keyword-suggestingdevice 106 and theadvertising device 110 can be a single computing device. In other implementations, multiple computing devices can provide the features of an illustrated device. For example, there can be a number ofimage search engines 108 that provide search results based upon an image. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary user interface for providing an initial image in accordance with an illustrative implementation. For example, theuser interface 200 can be displayed on a web browser running on theclient device 102. An uploadimage button 204 allows an image to be selected for uploading to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106. In one implementation, a file selector can be used to locate an image to upload. Atext area 202 can allow entry or display of textual data related to the image. In one implementation, thetext area 202 can include text that describes the image. In one implementation, thetext area 202 allows the entry of text. For example, the text can identify the product in theimage 104 and provide a brief description of the product, the product's market, target customers, etc. In another implementation, thetext area 202 can include data from a web page that is associated with the product in theimage 104 and describes the product. Once an image is selected, the image can be uploaded to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106. - Using the received image, the keyword-suggesting
device 106 can determine a suggested list of keywords. As described above, theimage 104 can be used to initiate a search of content, such as, but not limited to, content available on the internet, to find content that includes images related to the receivedimage 104. In one implementation, the suggested keywords are based upon keywords from advertising campaigns that include a URL that is returned in the search results. In another implementation, one or more of the suggested keywords are used as search keywords to a search engine. The search results can include organic search results and advertisements that were selected based upon the keywords. The URLs from the organic search results can be used to find matching advertising campaigns similar to advertising campaigns based upon the image search results. The advertisements, however, are identified as a matching campaign by being returned based upon the keyword search. The selection and return of an advertisement in this case, however, is not considered an impression and does not incur any cost or data related to the campaign from which the advertisement was selected. Once the matching advertisement campaigns/ad groups are identified, a second set of suggested keywords and data can be obtained in a similar manner as the suggested keywords and data from the image search. In one implementation, each keyword is used in a separate search. The suggested list of keywords based upon the image search can be supplemented with keywords from the matched advertising campaigns/ad groups from the search results. In addition, the data related to the keywords and/or advertising campaigns/ad groups from both the image search and the one or more web searches can be combined. - In one implementation, matching advertising campaigns are determined. All keywords associated with the matching campaign are returned to the keyword-suggesting
device 106. A campaign can include one or more ad groups. Each ad group can have its own set of keywords that can differ from the keywords of other ad groups. In one implementation, matching ad groups are determined, instead of matching campaigns. The keywords from the matching ad groups are returned to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106. - Once the set of suggested keywords are determined, they can be sent to the
client device 102 and provided to a user.FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary user interface suggesting advertising keywords based upon a provided image in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Theuser interface 300 can include a copy of theimage 104 that was previously uploaded and used to search for related content. The suggestedkeywords searches 312 and/or searches from ageographic area 314. Other data, such as click-through rate, a number of times a keyword was clicked, an average cost per click, cost per view, etc. can be provided to theclient device 102. Any of thekeywords - In one implementation, an advertising campaign or ad group can be selected and provided along with the
image 104 to the keyword-suggestingdevice 106. For example, an advertiser can create or select an advertising campaign or ad group and request suggested keywords based uponimage 104. After one or more suggested keywords are selected, the selected advertising campaign or ad group can be updated to be associated with the selected keywords. For example, suggestedkeywords user interface 300. An advertising campaign or ad group associated with the product inimage 104 can be updated with the selected suggestedkeywords keywords - In addition to providing suggested keywords, other suggestions for an advertising campaign or ad group can be provided.
FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary user interface suggesting sites and types of advertisements based upon a provided image in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Theuser interface 400 includes achart 402 that illustrates the number of campaigns that place ads on three different sites 404, 406, and 408. In addition to sites, theinterface 400 can include achart 410 that illustrates the number of advertising campaigns that include particular types of advertisements. An advertiser can create different types of advertisements, such as text 412,image 414, video 416, mobile (not shown), etc.User interface 400 can also include the number of matching advertising campaigns that are used to generate any data.User interface 400 can also include the data in forms other than tables, for example, in tabular format. -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a process for generating a list of suggested advertising keywords in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Theprocess 500 can be implemented on a computing device. In one implementation, theprocess 500 is encoded on a computer-readable medium that contains instructions that, when executed by a computing device, cause the computing device to perform operations of theprocess 500. - The
process 500 includes receiving an image of a product (502). The image of the product is used to search web content (504). In one implementation, a search query based on the image of the product is used to search web content. In another implementation, the search query is based on the image of the product and a textual description of the product. Search results from the web content search is received (506). The search results include a number of URLs. Advertising campaigns or ad groups that include advertisements that include a URL present in the search results are considered matching advertising campaigns. The keywords from the matching advertising campaigns are obtained (510). A suggested list of keywords is determined from the keywords from the matching advertising campaigns (512). In one implementation, data associated with the keywords is received. Data associated with keywords can include, but is not limited to, the click-through rate of the keywords in the matching advertising campaigns, the click through rate of the keywords from all advertising campaigns, etc. The keywords are ranked based upon the data associated with the advertising campaigns. For example, the keywords can be sorted in descending order based upon the click-through rate of the keywords from all advertising campaigns. The suggested list of keywords can include the first ten, twenty-five, fifty, etc., keywords. Once determined, the suggested keywords can be provided (514). For example, the suggested keywords can be provided to an advertiser through theclient device 102. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with an illustrative implementation.
