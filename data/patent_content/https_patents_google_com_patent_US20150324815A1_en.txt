- the time period selection process may include receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device, identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period, and determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic.
- the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic may be time-based qualities of the first and second time periods (e.g., a time of day, a day of the week, a date, a month, a year, etc.). For example, if the first time period defines a seven day period beginning on a Monday, time period module 236 may determine the second time period such that the second time period also defines a seven day period beginning on a Monday. As another example, if the first time period defines a thirty day period beginning on the Jun. 1, 2012, time period module 236 may determine the second time period such that the second time period defines a thirty day period beginning on May 1, 2012. Both time periods share a seasonality characteristic in that they both begin on the first day of a month. Alternatively, time period selection module 236 may determine the second time period such that the second time period defines a thirty day period beginning on Jun. 1, 2011. Both time periods share a seasonality characteristic in that they both begin on June 1.

- the content performance metric may relate to a raw number of impressions, selections, and/or conversions for the distributed content items.
- the content performance metric may be a calculated value such as a keyword value, a total content distribution cost, a cost-per-click, an estimated profitability, or other measurement of content value.
- the performance metric may relate to a number of unique visitors (e.g., user devices 108 ) to a monitored resource (e.g., a website traffic analysis).
- Comparative report module 238 may use the first data set, the second data set, and the performance metric to generate a comparative performance report.
- the performance report may compare the selected content performance metric during the first time period with the same content performance metric during the second time period.
- the performance report may be a historical report based on past performance data or a performance estimate using estimated performance data (e.g., a predicted click-through-rate, estimated conversion, etc.).
- Process 300 may be performed by content management system 110 or by a user device.
- the user device may perform process 300 by executing operating instructions included presented to the user device by content management system 110 .
- process 300 is shown to include receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device (step 302 ), identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period (step 304 ), determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic (step 306 ), receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period (step 308 ), and generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set (step 310 ).
- process 300 is shown to include receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device (step 302 ).
- the first time period may be a range of dates (e.g., May 27-June 26), hours (e.g., 3:00 P.M.-6:00 P.M.), months (e.g., January 2013-March 2013), years, or any other measurement of time.
- the first time period may be specified as a relative range (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, last 6 hours, etc.) looking backward from the time at which the first time period is selected. For example, a present date of “Jul. 15, 2013” with a “last year” qualifier would define the first time period as a range of dates from Jul. 15, 2012 through Jul. 15, 2013.
- the first time period may be a single day, month, or other unitary time period. Such a selection may implicitly select the all times occurring during the selected day, month, or other unitary time period.
- the selection of a unitary time period may be specified in absolute terms (e.g., May 29, 2012, May 2012, etc.) or relative terms (e.g., today, yesterday, last week, last month, etc.).
- the selection of the first time period may be a user-specified time period (e.g., manually typed or otherwise entered into the user device) or a selection of a time period from a list of selectable options.
- time period module 236 may cause a list of selectable time period options to be presented to a user device and/or displayed visually by the user device. A user may select the first time period by clicking or otherwise choosing a time period from the presented list.
- process 300 is shown to further include identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period (step 304 ).
- the first seasonality characteristic may be a time-based quality of the first time period.
- the first seasonality characteristic may relate at least one of: a time of day, a day of the week, a date, a month, and a year.
- the first seasonality characteristic describes a beginning of the first time period (e.g., beginning on a Monday, beginning on the first day of a month, etc.).
- step 304 includes identifying multiple seasonality characteristics of the first time period. For example, a selection of a first time period of Sunday, May 27-Saturday, June 26 may have a seasonality characteristic of “beginning on a Sunday” and another seasonality characteristic of “includes 31 days.” The first time period may have yet another seasonality characteristic of “includes 9 weekend days” or “includes 22 weekdays.” Any number and/or type of seasonality characteristics may be identified for the first time period.
- step 304 may include assigning a weight or ranking to a plurality of identified seasonality characteristics.
- the weights may be specified by a user, automatically determined, or received from another data source.
- the weights may be based on a history of performance data for a given performance metric. For example, seasonality characteristics having a higher correlation with the selected performance metric may be assigned a heaver weight.
- process 300 is shown to further include determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic (step 306 ).
- step 306 may ensure that the second time period and the first time period have matching seasonality characteristics to avoid seasonality-based misreads in the comparative content performance report.
- a content provider may routinely experience a higher number of conversion events (e.g., online product sales or other events satisfying conversion criteria) during the weekend than during the week. Accordingly, a report comparing the number of conversion events during a Friday-Sunday period with the number of conversion events during a Monday-Wednesday period may be misleading regarding the effectiveness of a newly-implemented content distribution strategy.
- the content provider may be misled to believe that the newly-implemented content distribution strategy is not as effective as the previous strategy due to the lower number of conversion events that routinely occur during a Monday-Wednesday period.
- the second time period determined during step 306 may be a Monday-Wednesday period from a previous week such that the first and second time periods share the “begins on a Monday” seasonality characteristic.
- step 306 may include receiving a user-defined third time period and adjusting the third time period such that a seasonality characteristic of the adjusted third time period matches the seasonality characteristic of the first time period.
- the adjusted third time period may be used as the second time period.
- a selection of the third time period may be made (e.g., by a user) by manually typing or otherwise entering the third time period into the user device.
- the selection of the third time period may be made by a user choosing the third time period from a list of selectable options.
- time period module 236 may cause a list of selectable time period options to be presented to a user device and/or displayed visually by the user device. A user may select the third time period by clicking or otherwise choosing a time period from the presented list.
- Adjusting the third time period may include shifting the third time period by a fixed number of days, weeks, months, hours, or any other unit of time.
- the fixed number may be determined by comparing a seasonality characteristic of the third time period with a seasonality characteristic of the first time period. For example, if the first time period begins on a Monday and the third time period begins on a Wednesday, the third time period may be shifted by ⁇ 2 days or +5 days such that both time periods begin on a Monday.
- the shifting may be positive (e.g., +5 days) or negative (e.g., ⁇ 2 days).
- the direction of the shift (e.g., positive or negative) may be the direction which results in a lower absolute value for the duration of the shift.
- the shift may be performed in the negative direction because the absolute value of ⁇ 2 days is less than the absolute value of +5 days (e.g.,
- the direction of the shift may be reversed if the selected shift direction would result in an overlap between the first time period and the second time period.
- the absolute value of the duration of the shift may be minimized. For example, a shift of ⁇ 2 days may be preferable over a shift of ⁇ 9 days because the absolute value of ⁇ 2 days is less than the absolute value of ⁇ 9 days (e.g.,
- external data e.g., weather data, stock price, calendar data, etc.
- other metrics e.g., a moving average of external data and/or other metrics may be used to provide additional context in determining a duration of the shift.
- step 306 may include determining a second time period based on a plurality of identified seasonality characteristics.
- the second time period may be determined by selecting the second time period from a set of potential second time periods.
- Each of the potential second time periods may be assigned a seasonality score based on the number and weight of seasonality characteristics shared by each of the potential second time periods and the first time period.
- the potential second time period having the highest seasonality score may be selected as the second time period.
- the seasonality score may be used to determine a shift direction for the user-specified third time period.
- the seasonality characteristics may be ranked from most important to least important.
- the most important seasonality characteristic may be used to determine a set of potential second time periods having equivalent “most important seasonality characteristics.”
- the other seasonality characteristics may be used to select one of the potential second time periods from the set of potential second time periods. For example, if the first time period ranges from Monday Apr. 1, 2013-Friday Apr. 5, 2013, the first time period may have the following seasonality characteristics ordered from most important to least important: (1) five day duration, (2) begins on a Monday, (3) begins on the first of a month, and (4) occurs within calendar year 2013. This ordering and identification of seasonality characteristics is merely exemplary and may be different in various embodiments in which the seasonality characteristics have different weights and/or importance rankings.
- the most important seasonality characteristic may define many potential second time periods having a duration of five days. Each of these potential second time periods has an equivalent first seasonality characteristic with the first time period. However, by considering the second most important seasonality characteristic (e.g., begins on a Monday), the set of potential second time periods may be reduced to only those which begin on a Monday. By considering the third most important seasonality characteristic (e.g., begins on the first of a month), the set of potential second time periods may be reduced further to only those which begin on the first of a month. By considering the fourth most important seasonality characteristic (e.g. occurs within calendar year 2013), the set of potential second time periods may be reduced further to only those which occur within calendar year 2013.
- the second most important seasonality characteristic e.g., begins on a Monday
- the set of potential second time periods may be reduced to only those which begin on a Monday.
- the third most important seasonality characteristic e.g., begins on the first of a month
- the set of potential second time periods may be reduced further to only those which
- step 306 may include presenting a plurality of potential second time periods to the user device. Each potential second time period may be presented as a selectable option.
- the selectable option may include a description of the seasonality characteristic(s) used to determine the potential second time period and/or the range defined by the potential second time period.
- process 300 is shown to further include receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period (step 308 ).
- Step 308 may include retrieving performance data relevant a given performance metric from a data storage device such as data storage devices 112 . For example, if the performance metric is “number of conversion events,” step 308 may include retrieving data representing the number of conversion events occurring during each discrete time interval during the first and second time periods.
- the relevant data sets may include performance data recorded at times outside the first and second time periods.
- step 308 may include retrieving data representing an amount spent by the content provider on various keyword bids during the first and second time periods as well as the number and value of conversion events attributable to such keyword bids.
- the attributable conversion events may occur outside of the first or second time periods, the fact that such conversion events are attributable to a keyword bid occurring during the first or second time periods may cause the conversion events to be relevant to the “keyword profitability” metric.
- the first data set may be defined by the first time period and the second data set may be defined by the second time period.
- the second data set may be defined by a user-specified third time period.
- process 300 may include providing an option to use either the second time period or the third time period for defining the second data set.
- the option may be provided as a global option (e.g., a configuration setting, an overriding preference, etc.) or as a selectable option each time a choice between the second time period and third time period is relevant.
- a selection of the third time period may be made (e.g., by a user) by manually typing or otherwise entering the third time period into the user device.
- the selection of the third time period may be made by a user choosing the third time period from a list of selectable options.
- time period module 236 may cause a list of selectable time period options to be presented to a user device and/or displayed visually by the user device. A user may select the third time period by clicking or otherwise choosing a time period from the presented list.

- the third seasonality characteristic may be identified in response to receiving a selection of the third time period.
- Process 300 may further include providing a notification for display via the user device in response to the third seasonality characteristic not matching the first seasonality characteristic.
- the notification may alert or inform the user that the selection of the third time period may result in a seasonality-based mislead in the comparative performance report.
- the notification may include a display (e.g., a suggestion, a preview, etc.) of the second time period along with an option to use the second time period instead of the third time period for defining the second data set.
- process 300 is shown to further include generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set (step 310 ).
- Step 310 may include determining one or more calculated values based on the performance data in the first and second data sets.
- the first and second data sets may be used to determine a value of one or more content performance metrics during the first time period and the second time period.
- the content performance metric may relate to a raw number of impressions, selections, and/or conversions for the distributed content items.
- the content performance metric may be a calculated value such as a keyword value, a total content distribution cost, a cost-per-click, an estimated profitability, or other measurement of content value.

The method includes receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device, identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period, determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic, receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period, and generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set.
Description
- The present application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/787,149 filed Mar. 15, 2013, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of content. Content providers such as advertisers and website operators often use a content management system to provide relevant content to a user device. The content management system may allow content providers to monitor the performance of various content items, analyze website traffic, or review the effectiveness of various content distribution strategies.
- For these and other purposes, the content management system may generate a detailed report relating to a selected performance metric (e.g., a click through rate, a keyword value, a number of unique visitors, etc.). The report may compare the performance metric during a first time period with the same performance metric during a second time period. However, such comparative reports are often misleading due to qualitative differences between the first and second time periods. Selecting appropriate time periods such that the comparative reports express meaningful data is often challenging.
- One implementation of the present disclosure is an automated computer-implemented method for generating a time-based comparative report. The method includes receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device, identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period, determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic, receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period, and generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set.
- In some implementations, the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic are time-based qualities of the first and second time periods. For example, the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic may relate to at least one of: a time of day, a day of the week, a date, a month, and a year. In some implementations the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic describe a beginning of the first and second time periods. In some implementations, the first time period defines a particular day and the second time period defines a matching day from a previous week, a matching day from a previous month, or a matching day from a previous year. In some implementations, the first time period defines a range of days and the second time period defines a matching range of days from a previous week, a matching range of days from a pervious month, or a matching range of days from a previous year.
- In some implementations, the method further includes providing an option to use either the second time period or the third time period for defining the second data set, receiving a selection of the third time period from a user device, identifying a third seasonality characteristic of the third time period, and providing a notification for display via the user device in response to the third seasonality characteristic not matching the first seasonality characteristic.
- In some implementations, the method further includes receiving a selection of the third time period from a user device, determining the second time period based on the third time period and the seasonality characteristic of the first time period, providing a selectable preview of the second time period for display via the user device, and using the second time period for defining the second data set in response to a selection of the selectable preview of the second time period. In some implementations, the selectable preview of the second time period includes a description of the seasonality characteristic of the second time period.
- In some implementations, the method further includes generating a list of selectable time periods and providing the list of selectable time periods for display via the user device. At least one of the first time period, the second time period, and the third time period may be selected from the list of selectable time periods.
- Another implementation of the present disclosure is one or more non-transitory computer-readable media having instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by one or more processors to cause the one or more processors to perform operations including receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device, identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period, determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic, receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period, and generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set.
- In some implementations, the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic are time-based qualities of the first and second time periods. For example, the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic may relate to at least one of: a time of day, a day of the week, a date, a month, and a year. In some implementations the first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic describe a beginning of the first and second time periods. In some implementations, the first time period defines a particular day and the second time period defines a matching day from a previous week, a matching day from a previous month, or a matching day from a previous year. In some implementations, the first time period defines a range of days and the second time period defines a matching range of days from a previous week, a matching range of days from a pervious month, or a matching range of days from a previous year.
- In some implementations, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to perform operations including providing an option to use either the second time period or the third time period for defining the second data set, receiving a selection of the third time period from a user device, identifying a third seasonality characteristic of the third time period, and providing a notification for display via the user device in response to the third seasonality characteristic not matching the first seasonality characteristic.
- In some implementations, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to perform operations including receiving a selection of the third time period from a user device, determining the second time period based on the third time period and the seasonality characteristic of the first time period, providing a selectable preview of the second time period for display via the user device, and using the second time period for defining the second data set in response to a selection of the selectable preview of the second time period. In some implementations, the selectable preview of the second time period includes a description of the seasonality characteristic of the second time period.
- In some implementations, the instructions further cause the one or more processors to perform operations including generating a list of selectable time periods and providing the list of selectable time periods for display via the user device. At least one of the first time period, the second time period, and the third time period may be selected from the list of selectable time periods.
- The foregoing is a summary and thus by necessity contains simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail. Consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the devices and/or processes described herein, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the detailed description set forth herein and taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system which may be used to automatically define one or more time periods and generate a comparative content performance report based on content performance data defined by the one or more time periods, the computer system including a network, content providers, resources, user devices, a content management system, and data storage devices, according to a described implementation. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating in greater detail the content management system ofFIG. 1 , according to a described implementation. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a process for automatically define one or more time periods and generating a comparative content performance report based on content performance data defined by the one or more time periods, according to a described implementation. -
FIGS. 4A-4D are drawings of a user interface for defining the one or more time periods, the user interface including several time period selection options and a comparison button for toggling a comparison window, according to a described implementation. -
FIGS. 5A-5C are drawings of another user interface for defining the one or more time periods, the user interface including several options for selecting a first time period and multiple groups of selectable options for defining a second time period based on the selection of the first time period, according to a described implementation. - Referring generally to the FIGURES, systems and methods for automated reporting period selection and components thereof are shown and described. The systems and methods described herein may be used to automatically determine a time period for use in a time-based comparative report. For example, a content provider (e.g., an advertiser, a website operator, etc.) may desire to compare a content performance metric (e.g., a click through rate, a number of conversion events, a keyword value, website traffic, etc.) during a first time period with the same content performance metric during a second time period (e.g., to evaluate content performance over time, to assess the effectiveness of an experimental content distribution strategy, etc.). The content provider may use a content management system to generate a report comparing the content performance metric during the first and second time periods.
- If the first and second time periods are not appropriately selected, the data in the comparative report may be misleading. For example, a content provider may routinely experience a higher number of conversion events (e.g., online product sales or other events satisfying conversion criteria) during the weekend than during the week. Accordingly, a report comparing the number of conversion events during a Friday-Sunday period with the number of conversion events during a Monday-Wednesday period may be misleading regarding the effectiveness of a newly-implemented content distribution strategy (e.g., beginning on the Monday of the second time period).
- Advantageously, the systems and methods described herein may automatically determine an appropriate reporting period (e.g., the first time period and/or the second time period) such that the first and second time periods have similar or matching “seasonality characteristics.” A seasonality characteristic may be a time-based quality of a given time period. For example, a seasonality characteristic may relate to a time of day (e.g., between 4:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M.), a day of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Saturday, etc.), a month, a year, a date, a range of dates, or any other time-based attribute of a given time period.
- In some implementations, a selection of a first time period may be received from a user device. The systems and methods of the present disclosure may identify a seasonality characteristic of the first time period and automatically determine a second time period having a matching seasonality characteristic (e.g., a same number of weekdays and weekend days, a same range of dates from a pervious year, etc.). The first and second time periods may be used to define a first data set and a second data set to be compared and/or presented to the content provider in the time-based comparative report.
- Referring now to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 is shown, according to a described implementation.Computer system 100 is shown to include anetwork 102,content providers 104,resources 106,user devices 108, acontent management system 110, anddata storage devices 112.Computer system 100 may facilitate communication betweencontent providers 104,resources 106, anduser devices 108. For example, a content item provided bycontent providers 104 may be presented touser devices 108 vianetwork 102. The content item may be displayed in a content slot ofresources 106 along with othercontent comprising resources 106. -
Computer system 100 may also facilitate communication betweencontent providers 104,content management system 110, anddata storage devices 112. For example,content management system 110 may receive a request to generate a comparative report fromcontent providers 104 vianetwork 102.Content management system 110 may receive content performance data fromdata storage devices 112 and generate the comparative report based on such data. The comparative report may then be communicated tocontent providers 104 vianetwork 102. -

For example,content providers 104 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to a computing device ofnetwork 102. -
Content providers 104 may include one or more electronic devices representing advertisers, resource operators, business owners, or other entities using the services provided bycontent management system 110. In some implementations,content providers 104 may produce content items for presentation touser devices 108. In other implementations,content providers 104 may submit a content generation request tocontent management system 110 andcontent management system 110 may automatically generate a content item in response to the request. The content items may be stored in one or more data storage devices local tocontent providers 104,content management system 110, ordata storage devices 112. - In some implementations, the content items may be advertisements. The advertisements may be display advertisements such as image advertisements, Flash® advertisements, video advertisements, text-based advertisements, or any combination thereof. In other implementations, the content items may include other types of content which serve various non-advertising purposes. The content items may be displayed in a content slot of
resources 106 and presented (e.g., alongside other resource content) touser devices 108. -
Content providers 104 may submit, tocontent management system 110, campaign parameters that are used to control the distribution of content items touser devices 108. The campaign parameters may include keywords associated with the content items, bids corresponding to the keywords, a content distribution budget, geographic limiters, or other criteria used bycontent management system 110 to determine when a content item may be presented touser devices 108. -
Content providers 104 may accesscontent management system 110 to monitor the performance of the content items that are distributed according to the established campaign parameters. For example,content providers 104 may submit a request to generate a comparative performance report tocontent management system 110.Content providers 104 may use the comparative report to evaluate the effectiveness of a content distribution strategy. - Still referring to
FIG. 1 ,computer system 100 is shown to includeresources 106.Resources 106 may include any type of information or data structure that can be provided overnetwork 102. In some implementations,resources 106 may be identified by a resource address associated with each resource (e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL)).Resources 106 may include web pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, programming elements, interactive content, streaming video/audio sources, or other types of electronic information.Resources 106 may include content (e.g., words, phrases, images, sounds, etc.) having embedded information (e.g., meta-information embedded in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions. Embedded instructions may include computer-readable media (e.g., software code, JavaScript®, ECMAScript®, etc.) that is executed by user devices 108 (e.g., by a web browser running on user devices 108). -
User devices 108 may include any number of user-operable electronic devices capable of receiving content (e.g., content items, resource content, etc.) vianetwork 102. For example,user devices 108 may include desktop computers, laptop computers, smart phones, tablets, mobile communication devices, monitors, workstations, client terminals, entertainment consoles, or any other device capable of receiving electronic content. In some implementations,user devices 108 may include a user application (e.g., a web browser, a resource renderer, etc.) for converting electronic content into a comprehensible format (e.g., visual, aural, graphical, etc.).User devices 108 may further include a user interface element (e.g., an electronic display, a speaker, etc.) for presenting the received content to a user. -
User devices 108 may submit a request for content fromresources 106.Resources 106 may respond to a request for content by providing the requested content for presentation touser devices 108. In some implementations, the resource content may include a portion ofresources 106 in which a content item or other sponsored content item can be presented. These portions ofresources 106 may be referred to as content slots. Alternatively, other sponsored content or content items may be presented in a separate window (e.g., a pop up window) separate from the resource content.Resources 106 may populate these content slots by submitting a request for a content item tocontent management system 110. - Still referring to
FIG. 1 ,computer system 100 is shown to include acontent management system 110.Content management system 110 may receive a request for content items fromresources 106 and select an eligible content item in response to the request. The selected eligible content item may be transmitted toresources 106 for presentation touser devices 108 along with the requested resource content. In some implementations, the selected content item may be delivered to theuser devices 108 directly (e.g., without first transmitting the content item to resources 106) fromcontent management system 110 or fromdata storage devices 112. -
Content management system 110 may record performance data for each content item and use the recorded performance data to generate a comparative content performance report. The performance report may compare a content performance metric during a first time period with the same content performance metric during a second time period. In some implementations, the content performance metric may relate to a raw number of impressions, selections, and/or conversions for the distributed content items. In other implementations, the content performance metric may be a calculated value such as a keyword value, a total content distribution cost, a cost-per-click, an estimated profitability, or other measurement of content value. -
Content management system 110 may generate the comparative performance report in response to a request fromcontent providers 104. In generating the comparative performance report,content management system 110 may require a first time period and a second time period. Each time period may define a set of performance data for inclusion in the comparative report. For example, the first time period may specify a first date range (e.g., “last 7 days,” “last 14 days,” “last 30 days,” etc.) defining a first set of performance data. Similarly, the second time period may specify a second date range (e.g., “previous week,” “previous month,” etc.) defining a second set of performance data. - In some implementations,
content management system 110 may receive a selection of the first time period fromcontent providers 104 and may automatically determine the second time period such that the first and second time periods have matching seasonality characteristics. In other implementations,content management system 110 may receive both time periods fromcontent providers 104. For example,content providers 104 may interact withcontent management system 110 via a web browser or other user interface capable of executing operating instructions. In some implementations, a content provider (e.g., a user) may specify the first time period and the web browser or other user interface may automatically determine the second time period. Both time periods may then be communicated tocontent management system 110. - Still referring to
FIG. 1 ,computer system 100 is shown to includedata storage devices 112.Data storage devices 112 may be any type of memory device capable of storing content items, content performance data, or other data used bycontent management system 110.Data storage devices 112 may include any type of non-volatile memory, media, or memory devices. For example,data storage devices 112 may include semiconductor memory devices (e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory devices, etc.) magnetic disks (e.g., internal hard disks, removable disks, etc.), magneto-optical disks, and/or CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. In some implementations,data storage devices 112 may be local tocontent management system 110 orcontent providers 104. In other implementations,data storage devices 112 may be connected withcontent management system 110 andcontent providers 104 vianetwork 102. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , a detailed block diagram ofcontent management system 110 is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment.Content management system 110 may receive a selection of a first time period from a user device and automatically determine a second time period such that the first and second time periods have matching seasonality characteristics. Content management system may then retrieve a first and second data set defined by the first and second time periods and generate a comparative report based on such data.Content management system 110 is shown to include acommunications interface 240 and aprocessing circuit 210. - Communications interface 240 may include wired or wireless interfaces (e.g., jacks, antennas, transmitters, receivers, transceivers, wire terminals, Ethernet ports, WiFi transceivers, etc.) for conducting data communications with local or remote devices or systems. For example,
communications interface 240 may allowcontent management system 110 to communicate withnetwork 102,content providers 104,resources 106,user devices 108, and/ordata storage devices 112. - Still referring to
FIG. 2 ,processing circuit 210 is shown to include aprocessor 220 andmemory 230.Processor 220 may be implemented as a general purpose processor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a CPU, a GPU, a group of processing components, or other suitable electronic processing components.Memory 230 may include one or more devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, Flash® memory, hard disk storage, etc.) for storing data and/or computer code for completing and/or facilitating the various processes, layers, and modules described in the present disclosure.Memory 230 may comprise volatile memory or non-volatile memory.Memory 230 may include database components, object code components, script components, or any other type of information structure for supporting the various activities and information structures described in the present disclosure. - In some implementations,
memory 230 is communicably connected toprocessor 220 viaprocessing circuit 210 and includes computer code (e.g., the modules stored in memory) for executing one or more processes described herein.Memory 230 is shown to include acontent item module 232, aperformance data module 234, atime period module 236, and acomparative report module 238. -
Content item module 232 may receive a request for a content item (e.g., via communications interface 240) fromresources 106. In some implementations, the request for content items may include characteristics of the content slots in which the content items will be displayed. For example, such characteristics may include the URL of theresource 106 on which the content slot is located, a display size of the content slot, a position of the content slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the content slot. If the content slot is located on a search results page, keywords associated with the search query may also be provided tocontent management system 110. These characteristics of the content slot may facilitate identification of content items that are relevant toresources 106 or to the search query. -
Content item module 232 may select an eligible content item in response to the request received fromresources 106. In some implementations, eligible content items may include content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of the content slots in which the content items are presented. For example,content item module 232 may select a content item having a display size which fits in a destination content slot. In some implementations,content item module 232 may resize a selected content item to fit a content slot or add additional visual content to the selected content item (e.g., padding, a border, etc.) based on the display size of the content item and the display size of the content slot. - In some implementations,
content item module 232 may select a content item determined to be relevant toparticular resource 106,user device 108, or search query. For example,content item module 232 may select a content item by comparing the keywords associated with each content item (e.g., specified bycontent providers 104, additional keywords extracted from the content item, etc.) with the keywords associated with theresource 106 requesting the content item. A topic or type of content included inresources 106 may be used to establish keywords forresources 106. -
Content item module 232 may select a content item by comparing the keywords associated with each content item with information (e.g., profile data, user preferences, etc.) associated with aparticular user device 108 requesting information fromresource 106. In some implementations,content item module 232 may select a content item that does not match established user preferences if an insufficient number of preferred content items are available. In some implementations,content item module 232 may select a content item based on an established click-through-rate, a predicted click-through-rate, a bid price associated with each content item, or other relevant selection criteria. - The selected content item may be transmitted to
resources 106 for presentation touser devices 108 along with the requested resource content. In some implementations, the selected content item may be delivered to theuser devices 108 directly (e.g., without first transmitting the content item to resources 106) fromcontent management system 110 or fromdata storage devices 112. - Still referring to
FIG. 2 ,memory 230 is shown to include aperformance data module 234.Performance data module 234 may record performance data for each content item (e.g., distributed content items and/or non-distributed content items). Performance data may include, for example, a number of times the content item was presented to user devices 108 (e.g., impressions), a number of times the content item was selected or clicked after being presented, and a number of conversions that have been attributed to the content item. Performance data may also include a cost-per-click, a total cost, or other cost measures for the content item. In some implementations, performance data may include contextual information such as the keyword triggering the presentation of the content item, a winning bid price for the keyword, and/or a value (e.g., a conversion value, a click-through-rate, etc.) associated with each keyword or content item. - In some implementations,
performance data module 234 may identify a referring resource (e.g., a search results page, a web page, etc.), directinguser devices 108 toresources 106.Performance data module 234 may identify a referring resource by executing code embedded inresources 106 and/or by information contained in a URL directinguser devices 108 toresources 106. For example,user devices 108 may accessresources 106 by selecting a link presented on a referring resource. This link can be associated with a URL that includes data (i.e., text) that uniquely identifies the resource from whichuser devices 108 are navigating toresource 106. - As one illustration, the hyperlink http://www.example.com/homepage/%affiliate_identifier%promotion1 may provide
performance data module 234 with the information that a user device navigated to the “example.com” Internet resource from a resource associated with the affiliate identifier number “affiliate_identifier” specified in the URL. Furthermore, the hyperlink may provideperformance data module 234 with the information that the user device was directed to the “example.com” Internet as part of a content distribution campaign associated with the promotion code “promotion1.” The user interaction data for this interaction (i.e., the selection of the link) may be stored indata storage devices 112 and used, as described below, to facilitate performance reporting and visualizing the flow of traffic incomputer system 100. - In some implementations,
performance data module 234 may collect performance information relating touser devices 108 to which the distributed content items are presented. Such information may include other content items presented to the same user device, user content preferences, geographic information, or other profile information associated withuser devices 108. For situations in whichcontent management system 110 collects personal information about users or makes use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content fromcontent management system 110 that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used bycontent management system 110. -
Performance data module 234 may record a time associated with each recorded event. For example,performance data module 234 may record a time at which a selected content item is presented to auser device 108, a time at which the content item is clicked by a user, and/or a time at which a conversion attributed to a particular impression of the content item event occurs. The performance data may be stored in one or more data storage devices. In some implementations, the performance data may be stored locally withinmemory 230. In other implementations, the performance data may be stored in a remote data storage device (e.g., data storage devices 112) accessible vianetwork 102. - Still referring to
FIG. 2 ,memory 230 is shown to include atime period module 236.Time period module 236 may automatically select a time period defining a set of performance data for inclusion in the comparative content performance report. Althoughtime period module 236 is shown as a component ofcontent management system 110, in some implementations,time period module 232 may be a component ofcontent providers 104 oruser devices 108. For example, a content provider may request a comparative content performance report using a user device (e.g., a personal computer, laptop, tablet, smart phone, client terminal, etc.) in communication withcontent management system 110 vianetwork 102. The user device may include a web browser or other user interface capable of storing and executing operating instructions includingtime period module 236. Accordingly, the time period selection process may be performed bycontent management system 110,content providers 104, or a combination of both. - Time
period selection module 236 may perform a time period determination process to determine a time period for inclusion in the comparative performance report. The time period selection process may include receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device, identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period, and determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic. - The first seasonality characteristic and the second seasonality characteristic may be time-based qualities of the first and second time periods (e.g., a time of day, a day of the week, a date, a month, a year, etc.). For example, if the first time period defines a seven day period beginning on a Monday,
time period module 236 may determine the second time period such that the second time period also defines a seven day period beginning on a Monday. As another example, if the first time period defines a thirty day period beginning on the Jun. 1, 2012,time period module 236 may determine the second time period such that the second time period defines a thirty day period beginning on May 1, 2012. Both time periods share a seasonality characteristic in that they both begin on the first day of a month. Alternatively, timeperiod selection module 236 may determine the second time period such that the second time period defines a thirty day period beginning on Jun. 1, 2011. Both time periods share a seasonality characteristic in that they both begin on June 1. - In some implementations,
time period module 236 may provide a user (e.g., a content provider) with an option to prioritize various seasonality characteristics or to choose between several possibilities for the second time period. In some implementations,time period module 236 may generate a list of selectable options for the second time period. Each selectable option may include a description of the seasonality characteristic used to determine the second time period. The time period selection process is described in greater detail in reference toFIG. 3 .Time period module 236 may output a first and second time period for use in generating the comparative performance report. - Still referring to
FIG. 2 ,memory 230 is shown to include acomparative report module 238.Comparative report module 238 may receive the first and second time periods fromtime period module 236. The first time period may define a first data set and the second time period may define a second data set.Comparative report module 238 may use the first and second time periods to identify and retrieve the first and second data sets. -
Comparative report module 238 may receive an input from a user device (e.g., a device used by content providers 104) specifying a performance metric. In some implementations, the content performance metric may relate to a raw number of impressions, selections, and/or conversions for the distributed content items. In other implementations, the content performance metric may be a calculated value such as a keyword value, a total content distribution cost, a cost-per-click, an estimated profitability, or other measurement of content value. In further implementations, the performance metric may relate to a number of unique visitors (e.g., user devices 108) to a monitored resource (e.g., a website traffic analysis). -
Comparative report module 238 may use the first data set, the second data set, and the performance metric to generate a comparative performance report. The performance report may compare the selected content performance metric during the first time period with the same content performance metric during the second time period. The performance report may be a historical report based on past performance data or a performance estimate using estimated performance data (e.g., a predicted click-through-rate, estimated conversion, etc.). - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , a flowchart of aprocess 300 for generating a time-based comparative report is shown, according to a described implementation.Process 300 may be performed bycontent management system 110 or by a user device. The user device may performprocess 300 by executing operating instructions included presented to the user device bycontent management system 110. In brief overview,process 300 is shown to include receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device (step 302), identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period (step 304), determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic (step 306), receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period (step 308), and generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set (step 310). - Still referring to
FIG. 3 , and in greater detail,process 300 is shown to include receiving a selection of a first time period from a user device (step 302). The first time period may be a range of dates (e.g., May 27-June 26), hours (e.g., 3:00 P.M.-6:00 P.M.), months (e.g., January 2013-March 2013), years, or any other measurement of time. In some implementations, the first time period may be specified as a relative range (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, last 6 hours, etc.) looking backward from the time at which the first time period is selected. For example, a present date of “Jul. 15, 2013” with a “last year” qualifier would define the first time period as a range of dates from Jul. 15, 2012 through Jul. 15, 2013. - In some implementations, the first time period may be a single day, month, or other unitary time period. Such a selection may implicitly select the all times occurring during the selected day, month, or other unitary time period. The selection of a unitary time period may be specified in absolute terms (e.g., May 29, 2012, May 2012, etc.) or relative terms (e.g., today, yesterday, last week, last month, etc.).
- The selection of the first time period may be a user-specified time period (e.g., manually typed or otherwise entered into the user device) or a selection of a time period from a list of selectable options. For example, in some implementations,
time period module 236 may cause a list of selectable time period options to be presented to a user device and/or displayed visually by the user device. A user may select the first time period by clicking or otherwise choosing a time period from the presented list. - Still referring to
FIG. 3 ,process 300 is shown to further include identifying a first seasonality characteristic of the first time period (step 304). The first seasonality characteristic may be a time-based quality of the first time period. For example, the first seasonality characteristic may relate at least one of: a time of day, a day of the week, a date, a month, and a year. In some implementations, the first seasonality characteristic describes a beginning of the first time period (e.g., beginning on a Monday, beginning on the first day of a month, etc.). - In some implementations,
step 304 includes identifying multiple seasonality characteristics of the first time period. For example, a selection of a first time period of Sunday, May 27-Saturday, June 26 may have a seasonality characteristic of “beginning on a Sunday” and another seasonality characteristic of “includes 31 days.” The first time period may have yet another seasonality characteristic of “includes 9 weekend days” or “includes 22 weekdays.” Any number and/or type of seasonality characteristics may be identified for the first time period. - In some implementations,
step 304 may include assigning a weight or ranking to a plurality of identified seasonality characteristics. The weights may be specified by a user, automatically determined, or received from another data source. In some implementations, the weights may be based on a history of performance data for a given performance metric. For example, seasonality characteristics having a higher correlation with the selected performance metric may be assigned a heaver weight. - Still referring to
FIG. 3 ,process 300 is shown to further include determining a second time period such that the second time period has a second seasonality characteristic matching the first seasonality characteristic (step 306). Advantageously, step 306 may ensure that the second time period and the first time period have matching seasonality characteristics to avoid seasonality-based misreads in the comparative content performance report. - For example, a content provider may routinely experience a higher number of conversion events (e.g., online product sales or other events satisfying conversion criteria) during the weekend than during the week. Accordingly, a report comparing the number of conversion events during a Friday-Sunday period with the number of conversion events during a Monday-Wednesday period may be misleading regarding the effectiveness of a newly-implemented content distribution strategy. The content provider may be misled to believe that the newly-implemented content distribution strategy is not as effective as the previous strategy due to the lower number of conversion events that routinely occur during a Monday-Wednesday period. Advantageously, the second time period determined during
step 306 may be a Monday-Wednesday period from a previous week such that the first and second time periods share the “begins on a Monday” seasonality characteristic. - In some embodiments,
step 306 may include receiving a user-defined third time period and adjusting the third time period such that a seasonality characteristic of the adjusted third time period matches the seasonality characteristic of the first time period. The adjusted third time period may be used as the second time period. A selection of the third time period may be made (e.g., by a user) by manually typing or otherwise entering the third time period into the user device. Alternatively, the selection of the third time period may be made by a user choosing the third time period from a list of selectable options. For example, in some implementations,time period module 236 may cause a list of selectable time period options to be presented to a user device and/or displayed visually by the user device. A user may select the third time period by clicking or otherwise choosing a time period from the presented list. - Adjusting the third time period may include shifting the third time period by a fixed number of days, weeks, months, hours, or any other unit of time. The fixed number may be determined by comparing a seasonality characteristic of the third time period with a seasonality characteristic of the first time period. For example, if the first time period begins on a Monday and the third time period begins on a Wednesday, the third time period may be shifted by −2 days or +5 days such that both time periods begin on a Monday. The shifting may be positive (e.g., +5 days) or negative (e.g., −2 days). In some embodiments, the direction of the shift (e.g., positive or negative) may be the direction which results in a lower absolute value for the duration of the shift. For example, if given a choice to shift the third time period by −2 days or +5 days, the shift may be performed in the negative direction because the absolute value of −2 days is less than the absolute value of +5 days (e.g., |−2 days|<|+5 days|).
- In some embodiments, the direction of the shift may be reversed if the selected shift direction would result in an overlap between the first time period and the second time period. In some embodiments, the absolute value of the duration of the shift may be minimized. For example, a shift of −2 days may be preferable over a shift of −9 days because the absolute value of −2 days is less than the absolute value of −9 days (e.g., |−2 days|<|−9 days|). In some embodiments, external data (e.g., weather data, stock price, calendar data, etc.), other metrics, or a moving average of external data and/or other metrics may be used to provide additional context in determining a duration of the shift.
- In some implementations,
step 306 may include determining a second time period based on a plurality of identified seasonality characteristics. The second time period may be determined by selecting the second time period from a set of potential second time periods. Each of the potential second time periods may be assigned a seasonality score based on the number and weight of seasonality characteristics shared by each of the potential second time periods and the first time period. The potential second time period having the highest seasonality score may be selected as the second time period. In some embodiments, the seasonality score may be used to determine a shift direction for the user-specified third time period. - In some embodiments, the seasonality characteristics may be ranked from most important to least important. The most important seasonality characteristic may be used to determine a set of potential second time periods having equivalent “most important seasonality characteristics.” The other seasonality characteristics may be used to select one of the potential second time periods from the set of potential second time periods. For example, if the first time period ranges from Monday Apr. 1, 2013-Friday Apr. 5, 2013, the first time period may have the following seasonality characteristics ordered from most important to least important: (1) five day duration, (2) begins on a Monday, (3) begins on the first of a month, and (4) occurs within calendar year 2013. This ordering and identification of seasonality characteristics is merely exemplary and may be different in various embodiments in which the seasonality characteristics have different weights and/or importance rankings.
- The most important seasonality characteristic (e.g., five day duration) may define many potential second time periods having a duration of five days. Each of these potential second time periods has an equivalent first seasonality characteristic with the first time period. However, by considering the second most important seasonality characteristic (e.g., begins on a Monday), the set of potential second time periods may be reduced to only those which begin on a Monday. By considering the third most important seasonality characteristic (e.g., begins on the first of a month), the set of potential second time periods may be reduced further to only those which begin on the first of a month. By considering the fourth most important seasonality characteristic (e.g. occurs within calendar year 2013), the set of potential second time periods may be reduced further to only those which occur within calendar year 2013.
- In some implementations,
step 306 may include presenting a plurality of potential second time periods to the user device. Each potential second time period may be presented as a selectable option. The selectable option may include a description of the seasonality characteristic(s) used to determine the potential second time period and/or the range defined by the potential second time period. - Still referring to
FIG. 3 ,process 300 is shown to further include receiving from one or more data storage devices a first data set defined by the first time period and a second data set defined by at least one of the second time period and a user-selected third time period (step 308). Step 308 may include retrieving performance data relevant a given performance metric from a data storage device such asdata storage devices 112. For example, if the performance metric is “number of conversion events,”step 308 may include retrieving data representing the number of conversion events occurring during each discrete time interval during the first and second time periods. - In some implementations, the relevant data sets may include performance data recorded at times outside the first and second time periods. For example, if the performance metric is “keyword profitability,”
step 308 may include retrieving data representing an amount spent by the content provider on various keyword bids during the first and second time periods as well as the number and value of conversion events attributable to such keyword bids. Although the attributable conversion events may occur outside of the first or second time periods, the fact that such conversion events are attributable to a keyword bid occurring during the first or second time periods may cause the conversion events to be relevant to the “keyword profitability” metric. - In some implementations, the first data set may be defined by the first time period and the second data set may be defined by the second time period. In other implementations, the second data set may be defined by a user-specified third time period. In some implementations,
process 300 may include providing an option to use either the second time period or the third time period for defining the second data set. The option may be provided as a global option (e.g., a configuration setting, an overriding preference, etc.) or as a selectable option each time a choice between the second time period and third time period is relevant. - A selection of the third time period may be made (e.g., by a user) by manually typing or otherwise entering the third time period into the user device. Alternatively, the selection of the third time period may be made by a user choosing the third time period from a list of selectable options. For example, in some implementations,
time period module 236 may cause a list of selectable time period options to be presented to a user device and/or displayed visually by the user device. A user may select the third time period by clicking or otherwise choosing a time period from the presented list. - In some implementations,
process 300 may include identifying a third seasonality characteristic of the third time period. The third seasonality characteristic may be identified in response to receiving a selection of the third time period.Process 300 may further include providing a notification for display via the user device in response to the third seasonality characteristic not matching the first seasonality characteristic. The notification may alert or inform the user that the selection of the third time period may result in a seasonality-based mislead in the comparative performance report. In some implementations, the notification may include a display (e.g., a suggestion, a preview, etc.) of the second time period along with an option to use the second time period instead of the third time period for defining the second data set. - Still referring to
FIG. 3 ,process 300 is shown to further include generating a comparative report using the first data set and the second data set (step 310). Step 310 may include determining one or more calculated values based on the performance data in the first and second data sets. The first and second data sets may be used to determine a value of one or more content performance metrics during the first time period and the second time period. In some implementations, the content performance metric may relate to a raw number of impressions, selections, and/or conversions for the distributed content items. In other implementations, the content performance metric may be a calculated value such as a keyword value, a total content distribution cost, a cost-per-click, an estimated profitability, or other measurement of content value. In further implementations, the performance metric may relate to a number of unique visitors to a monitored resource. - The comparative performance report may compare the selected content performance metric during the first time period with the same content performance metric during the second time period. The performance report may be a historical report based on past performance data (e.g., if the first or second time periods define an expired time period) or a performance estimate using estimated performance data (e.g., if the first or second time periods define an upcoming time period). The comparative report may be presented to a user device as a chart, graph, or other visual comparison.

FIGS. 4A-4D , an illustration of auser interface 400 for defining one or more time periods is shown, according to a described implementation.User interface 400 may be presented to a user device for facilitating the selection or customized definition of the first time period, the second time period, and/or the third time period. - Referring specifically to
FIG. 4A ,interface 400 is shown to include a custom timeperiod input bar 410.Input bar 410 may be used to enter (e.g., via a keyboard or other user input device) a customized range for the first time period. The customized range may be a customized date range (e.g., May 27-June 26), a customized time range (e.g., 3:00 P.M.-5:00 P.M.), a customized month range (e.g., May 2012-April 2013), or another customized range using any other time measurement unit.Input bar 410 is shown having afirst field 412 and asecond field 414.Field 412 may be used to enter a customized start date for the first time period andfield 414 may be used to enter a customized end date for the first time period. -
Interface 400 is further shown to include aquick pick list 420.List 420 may be used as an alternative to timeperiod input bar 410 for defining the first time period.List 420 is shown to include singleday selection options 422 and daterange selection options day selection options 422 may be used to select a single day (e.g., today, yesterday, etc.) as the first time period. Daterange selection options Options 424 present a range of dates ending with the current date (e.g., last 7 days, last 14 days, last 30 days, etc.) whereasoptions 426 present a range of dates ending prior to the current date (e.g., previous week, previous month, etc.). -
Quick pick list 420 may include any number or type of selection options in addition to or in place of the options shown. For example, daterange selection options 424 may include additional date range options such as “last two months,” “last year,” “last quarter,” “last two years,” etc. Daterange selection options 426 may include additional date range options such as “previous quarter,” “previous year,” “previous two years,” etc.Quick pick list 420 may further include several “to date” options (e.g., week to date, month to date, quarter to date, year to date, etc.) specifying a continuously increasing time period beginning at the start of the listed time measurement unit (e.g., the current week, month, quarter, year, etc.) and ending at the current date. - In some implementations, a selection of any of
quick pick options 420 may cause a check mark to be displayed next to the selected option. The check mark may indicate to a user that the checked time period has been selected. Selecting any ofquick pick options 420 may also cause the date range displayed ininput bar 410 to change to the checked option. In some implementations,interface 400 may include aselection indicator 425.Indicator 425 may display the time period selected by eitherinput bar 410 orquick pick list 420. In some implementations,quick pick list 420 and/orselection indicator 425 may include a written description of the corresponding date range in addition to a numerically defined range. For example, the date range “May 27-June 26” inindicator 425 is shown described in relative terms as “last 30 days.” -
Interface 400 is shown to further include anicon bar 430.Icon bar 430 may include one or more selectable icons for reconfiguring or confirming a selection made viainterface 400.Icon bar 430 is shown to include a “Done”icon 432, aquick pick icon 434, and a “Compare”icon 436. Selectingicon 432 may confirm the usage of the selected time periods for defining the first and second data sets used in the comparative performance report. - Selecting
quick pick icon 434 may causeinterface 400 to hide or displayquick pick list 420. For example, wheninterface 400 is in the default state shown inFIG. 4A , clickingicon 434 may transitioninterface 400 between a default state (shown inFIG. 4A ) and a compact state (shown inFIG. 4C ). In the compact state shown inFIG. 4C ,only input bar 410,selection indicator 425, andicon bar 430 are displayed. Wheninterface 400 is in the default compare state shown inFIG. 4B , clickingicon 434 may causeinterface 400 to transition between the default compare state (shown inFIG. 4B ) and a compact compare state (shown inFIG. 4D ). Clickingicon 434 again may causequick pick list 420 to reappear. - Referring now to
FIG. 4B , selecting “Compare”icon 436 may causeinterface 400 to display acomparison window 440.Window 440 may be used to confirm a determination of the second time period (e.g., having a matching seasonality characteristic with the first time period) or to select a user-defined third time period.Window 440 is shown to include the text “vs.” indicating that the time period selected in comparison window 440 (e.g., the second time period or the third time period) will be compared against the previously selected time period (e.g., the first time period). -
Window 440 is shown to further include a seasonalitycharacteristic check box 444. Checkbox 444 may present a user with an option to use either the automatically-determined second time period (e.g., having a matching seasonality characteristic with the first time period) or a user-defined third time period. The textual description displayed alongsidecheck box 444 may describe the seasonality characteristic used to determine the second time period. For example, the text “Synchronize days of the week” may indicate that the seasonality characteristic used to determine the second time period relates to a day of the week (e.g., Monday, Saturday, etc.). In other implementations, the text may display other instructive descriptions based on the matching seasonality characteristic. In some implementations,check box 444 may include a preview of the second time period. -
Window 440 is further shown to include a drop-down selection box 442. Drop-down box 442 may include selection options such as “previous 7 day period,” “previous 30 day period,” “previous quarter,” and “previous year.” The selection options presented via drop-down box 442 may include one or more automatically determined time periods as a potential candidate for the second time period. The selection options presented via drop-down box 442 may define time periods having different durations or time periods having different seasonality characteristics in common with the first time period. In some implementations, each of the options presented via drop-down box 442 may include a description of the shared seasonality characteristic. - Referring now to
FIG. 4D , drop-down selection box 442 may include an option permitting a user to select a customized time period (e.g., the third time period). For example, drop-down selection box 442 is shown to include the option “Custom 30 day period.” Selecting the customized time period option via drop-down box 442 may causeinterface 400 to display a custom time period input bar 446. - Input bar 446 may be similar or the same as
input bar 410. For example, input bar 446 may be used to enter (e.g., via a keyboard or other user input device) a customized range for the third time period. The customized range may be a customized date range (e.g., May 27-June 26), a customized time range (e.g., 3:00 P.M.-5:00 P.M.), a customized month range (e.g., May 2012-April 2013), or another customized range using any other time measurement unit. Input bar 446 is shown having afirst field 448 and asecond field 450.Field 448 may be used to enter a customized start date for the third time period andfield 450 may be used to enter a customized end date for the first time period. - In some implementations, upon receiving a selection of the third time period,
user interface 400 may display a notification that the third time period does not share an important (e.g., highly weighted, highly ranked, etc.) seasonality characteristic with the first time period. A user may be presented with the notification and with an option to use the second time period instead of the third time period for defining the second data set. In some embodiments, the second time period presented to the user may be determined based on the seasonality characteristic of the first time period as well as the user selection of the third time period. - Referring now to
FIGS. 5A-5C , an illustration of another user interface 500 for defining one or more time periods is shown, according to a described implementation. Referring specifically toFIG. 5A , interface 500 is shown to include a list ofselection options 510.Selection options 510 may be selected (e.g., clicked or otherwise selected via a user input device) to define the first time period.Selection options 510 are shown to include single day options 512 (e.g., today, yesterday, etc.), campaign-relative options 514, fixedrange selection options selection options 520, alldates selection option 522, and a custom timeperiod selection option 524. - Campaign-
relative options 514 may define a time period relative to a start or end date of a selected content item distribution strategy (e.g., a selected ad campaign). Selectable options are shown to include “duration of this campaign” and “since end of this campaign.” The “duration of this campaign” option may be selected to define a time period corresponding to the duration of a selected campaign. The selected campaign may be a current campaign (e.g., currently in progress) or a historical campaign (e.g., currently expired). The “since end of this campaign” option may be selected to define a time period beginning at the end of the selected campaign and ending at the current time or date. - Fixed
range selection options Options 516 present a range of dates ending with the current date (e.g., last 7 days, last 14 days, last 30 days, etc.) whereasoptions 518 present a range of dates ending prior to the current date (e.g., previous week, previous month, etc.).Selection options 520 are shown to include several “to date” options (e.g., week to date, month to date, quarter to date, year to date, etc.) specifying a continuously increasing time period beginning at the start of the listed time measurement unit (e.g., the current week, month, quarter, year, etc.) and ending at the current date. “All dates”selection option 522 may be selected to define a time period including all previously recorded performance data. Custom timeperiod selection option 524 may be selected to define the first time period using customized definition criteria. - Referring now to
FIG. 5B , interface 500 is shown to include several singleday selection options 530 for defining the second time period.Selection options 530 may be displayed in response to a selection of single day options 512 (shown inFIG. 5A ) for the first time period. In some implementations,selection options 530 may include various single day time periods corresponding to various seasonality characteristics of the first time period. For example, the “previous Saturday” selection option may define a day sharing a “day of the week” seasonality characteristic with the first time period (e.g., both days are Saturdays). The “same day from March” selection option may define a day sharing a “day of the month” seasonality characteristic with the first time period (e.g., both days are the 26th day of the month). The “same day from 2011” selection option may define a day sharing a “date of the year” seasonality characteristic with the first time period (e.g., both days are April 26th). Any number of single day selection options may be present in addition to or in place of theselection options 530 shown inFIG. 5B . - Referring now to
FIG. 5C , interface 500 is shown to include several multipleday selection options 540 for defining the second time period.Selection options 540 may be displayed in response to a selection of multiple day selection options 516-522 (shown in FIG. 5A) for the first time period. In some implementations,selection options 540 may include various multiple day time periods corresponding to various seasonality characteristics of the first time period. For example, the “same 17 days from March” selection option may define a time period sharing a “days of the month” seasonality characteristic with the first time period (e.g., both time periods begin on the 18th day of a month). The “same 17 days from 2011” selection option may define a time period sharing a “dates of the year” seasonality characteristic with the first time period (e.g., both time periods begin on April 18th). Any number of single day selection options may be present in addition to or in place of theselection options 540 shown inFIG. 5C . - Referring now to
FIGS. 5B and 5C , interface 500 is shown to further include custom timeperiod selection options period selection options Selection option 535 may be selected to enter a customized single day time period whereasselection option 545 may be selected to enter a customized multiple day time period. - In some implementations, upon receiving a selection of the third time period, user interface 500 may display a notification that the third time period does not share an important (e.g., highly weighted, highly ranked, etc.) seasonality characteristic with the first time period.
