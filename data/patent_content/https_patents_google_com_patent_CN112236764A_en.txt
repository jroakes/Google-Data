Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to mapping applications that provide and/or display map data associated with a geographic area.
Background
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are systems for archiving, retrieving and manipulating data that has been stored and indexed according to the geographic coordinates of the elements of the data. The system may generally utilize various data types such as imagery (imagery), maps, and tables. GIS technology can be integrated into internet-based mapping applications.
Such a mapping application may be or may be otherwise associated with a software application displaying an interactive digital map. For example, mapping applications may run on laptop and tablet computers, mobile phones, car navigation systems, handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units, and the like. Many of these devices are equipped with touch screens, touch pads, or are otherwise configured to receive input including finger gestures. For example, a user may pan a map by sliding her fingers in a desired direction, zoom in on an area by pinching the two fingers together, and so forth.
Generally, mapping applications may display various types of geographic data, including terrain data, street data, city transportation information, and traffic data. Further, the geographic data may be schematic or photographic-based (such as satellite imagery). Still further, the mapping application may display information in a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) format.

Detailed Description
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure are intended to cover such modifications and variations.
In general, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for presenting a visual indication of supplemental data related to a subset of locations that are related to search criteria but outside of a selected area of a map currently displayed within a map viewport. For example, the communication device may include a digital mapping application that provides a graphical user interface that includes a map viewport in which a map is displayed in accordance with digital mapping data. In accordance with embodiments of the disclosed technology, a graphical user interface may display data for a location outside of a selected area currently displayed within a map viewport. More particularly, a map viewport of a graphical user interface may simultaneously display map data for a selected area and supplemental data for one or more locations outside of the selected area currently displayed within the map viewport. The supplemental data may be for less than all locations outside the selected area that are associated with the search criteria. In this way, the digital mapping application may provide map data for the selected area while alerting (alert) the user of additional information related to locations outside the currently displayed area. In this manner, embodiments of the present disclosure provide techniques for improving the display of map information, particularly where the size of the screen or map viewport provided by the graphical user interface is limited.
Presenting map data to a user of a communication device on a screen of the communication device may present challenges due to a mismatch between the size of a geographic area ("mapped area") in the real world for which map data is available and the limited size of the screen. Typically, the screen is arranged to display map data relating to only part of the mapping area. This portion of the drawing area may be referred to as a "selected region". A linear mapping may be defined between real world points of the selected area and points on the screen. Elements of the map data may be displayed on the screen at corresponding points defined by the drawing. The scale of the map displayed on the screen may be defined as the ratio of (i) the length of the screen representing the real-world distance in the selected area to (ii) the real-world distance. The scale should be high enough so that the user can understand the map data of the selected area. However, the scale may also limit the size of the select area due to the constraint that the select area will be presented on the screen.
With conventional graphical user interfaces, a user may not be able to access portions of the map data that do not correspond to the currently selected area displayed on the screen. In other words, the screen size of the communication device may impose undesirable limitations on the portions of the real world map data that may be accessed at any given time.
If the user changes the select region (e.g., if the user pans (pan) the select region within the cartographic region, or if the user reselects the scale), the results may be confusing. For example, some users may have difficulty observing the relationship between the previous selection and the current selection. Other users may find it difficult to remember the map data for the previously selected area.
Furthermore, many mapping applications may use multiple "data layers," e.g., the lowest data layer indicates major roads, while successively higher data layers indicate lesser roads, railways, airports, and geographic names, respectively. Depending on the selected scale, the communication device typically presents different subsets of these data layers. If a user zooms out on the scale of the map, it may result in a given data layer not being displayed, making the data of that data layer more difficult for the user to access. Thus, for example, if a user is interested in obtaining information that is part of a given data layer, she may need to select a large enough scale for the data layer to be displayed. This in turn limits the size of the selected area due to the limited screen size. At some ratio, the distance between two points in the drawing area (e.g., the end points of a trip that the user wishes to take) may be much longer than the width of the selected area that can be represented on the screen. Thus, a user wishing to view information in a given data layer related to a trajectory in a mapping area between these two points may take a significant amount of time to pan the map along the trajectory. During panning, the communication device may need to obtain a large amount of map data from an external source, which places a high burden on the communication network transmitting the data and consumes the battery of the communication device. Even so, the user may not receive data relating to points in the mapping region that are close to the trajectory, but that happen not to be in the selected region, at any time during the panning.
In accordance with example embodiments of the disclosed technology, a communication device may obtain and present data associated with one or more locations outside of a selected area displayed by a digital mapping application. Data for one or more locations outside of the selected area may be presented concurrently with map data for the selected area. For example, a graphical user interface of a digital mapping application may display map data for a selected area in a map viewport and simultaneously display data for one or more locations outside of the selected area. In some cases, data for an off-viewport location may be presented within a map viewport along with map data. For example, the data for the out-of-viewport location may be displayed as an overlay (overlay) of map data for the selected area. In this manner, the graphical user interface is able to provide information to the user relating to locations outside of the selected area without requiring the user to engage in user interface actions such as panning or repeated zooming.
In some examples, the communication device may obtain map data associated with a selected area of the mapping area from one or more remote databases. The communication device may display the map data for the selected area within a map viewport of the digital mapping application. The selected area may be selected based at least in part on data received by the communication device from the user (e.g., a user selected location and a user selected scale). The selected area may be automatically generated, for example, as part of a mapping area that is centered at a location specified by a digital mapping application running on the communication device and has a default size or a size specified by the application.
The communication device may additionally obtain supplemental data associated with one or more records corresponding to record locations other than the selected location. The one or more records may be stored in one or more databases and contain information related to map elements, such as roads, signs, buildings, business or other organizational locations, and the like. The communication device can present map data for the selected area within a viewport of a digital mapping application, where each point in the map viewport corresponds to a respective point of the selected area. The communication device may additionally present at least one visual indication of supplemental data associated with the recording location outside of the selected area. The at least one visual indication may be presented in a graphical user interface of the digital mapping application at a location different from the respective recording location outside of the selected area. In some examples, the visual indication is presented within the viewport along with map data for the selected area. In other examples, the visual indication may be presented in association with the map data, but outside of the viewport.
In some examples, the recorded visual indication associated with the location outside of the selected region may indicate that the respective location is outside of the selected region displayed within the viewport. For example, the visual indication may include an arrow or other indication that the respective location of the record is outside the selected area. The visual indication may indicate the direction of the respective location relative to a point within the selected area. In some examples, the visual indication may indicate a distance from a point of the select area to a corresponding recording location outside of the select area.
In some implementations, the communications device can obtain and display supplemental data that includes real-time data associated with one or more recorded locations outside of a selected area being displayed by a digital mapping application of the communications device. For example, the real-time supplemental data may include current traffic condition data associated with traffic condition locations outside of the selected area. Such a visual indication of the current traffic conditions outside the viewport may be provided in association with map data of the selected area. For example, the graphical user interface may display a visual indication on the map data for the selected area. The visual indication may indicate the direction of the corresponding traffic condition location relative to the selected area being displayed. The visual indication may indicate a delay time associated with the traffic condition and/or a distance between a point in the selected area and the traffic condition location.
In some implementations, the supplemental data can include a cluster of records that identifies a plurality of records corresponding to record locations outside of the selected area being displayed within the viewport. A visual indication of the out-of-view recording cluster may be provided in association with map data for the selected area. In some examples, the visual indication may indicate a direction of the recording cluster relative to a point within the selected area. The visual indication may additionally or alternatively indicate the number of records in a cluster of records. The number of recording clusters may be predefined or dependent on the identified records (e.g., the number of identified records and/or their associated record locations). Further, the number of records included in a recording cluster may be predefined or dependent on the identified records.
In some implementations, the supplemental data can include data selected based on a comparison of records matching the search criteria and the location criteria. For example, the supplemental data may be price, availability, or other third party information as determined from the record comparison. For example, the supplemental data may identify the location of a business outside of the selected area, but the business offers goods or services at a lower price based on comparison to other businesses that satisfy the search criteria and the location criteria. In this manner, data associated with a particular location outside of the selected area may be selectively displayed based on the comparison of the records in order to present information that may be more useful to the user.
In some examples, the supplemental data may be associated with a subset of the plurality of records that satisfy one or more search criteria associated with the request for map data for the selected area. For example, a geographic information system remote from the communication device may identify a plurality of records associated with one or more search criteria. The geographic information system may determine that the plurality of records satisfies the one or more search criteria. The geographic information system may additionally determine that the plurality of records satisfies the one or more location criteria. For example, the location criteria may be used to identify records associated with respective record locations that are outside of the selected area but within a certain distance from a point within the selected area. The geographic information system may select a subset of the plurality of records based on a comparison of the plurality of records. The system can provide supplemental data associated with a subset of the plurality of records to a remote communication device. The remote communication device may then display a visual indication of the supplemental data associated with the display of the map data for the selected area.
In some embodiments, the geographic information system may select the subset based on comparing the supplemental data associated with the plurality of records. For example, the subset may be selected based on a comparison of current traffic conditions at traffic condition locations corresponding to the plurality of records. For example, the system may select the traffic condition location associated with the longest time delay, or one or more traffic condition locations having a time delay above a threshold time delay.
In another example, the subset may be selected based on a comparison of prices of goods or services offered at record locations corresponding to the plurality of records. In some implementations, the supplemental data can be price data associated with a good or service associated with each of the plurality of records. The system may select a subset of the plurality of records based on comparing the price at each of the plurality of record locations. For example, the system may select the recording location associated with the lowest price. In another example, the system may select one or more recording locations with prices below a threshold price. In this manner, the system may select supplemental data for display associated with the selected area from a plurality of recording locations outside of the selected area based on the price or other real-time data associated with the recording.
In yet another example, the subset may be selected to create a cluster of records that includes two or more records that satisfy the search criteria and the location criteria. In some implementations, the geographic information system may compare the relative position of each record location outside of the selected area to select a subset of the plurality of records. For example, the system may compare each recording location to generate one or more recording clusters. For example, the system may place two or more records in a recording cluster based on the distance between two or more corresponding recording locations. More particularly, the system can create a recording cluster by grouping records having respective recording positions close to each other together.
In some implementations, the location criteria associated with a recording cluster can include at least one distance criteria and/or at least one direction criteria. The distance criteria for a given recording cluster may specify that the identified records of that cluster are associated with respective recording locations that are within a specified distance from the selected area, and/or within a specified distance from a particular point in the selected area, and/or within a specified distance from each other. In each case, the specified distance may be predetermined, or may be variable (e.g., as a function of at least one dimension of the selected area), or user specified, or calculated such that the number of records in a cluster of records meets a particular criterion.
The orientation criterion for a given recording cluster may specify that the identified recording of the recording cluster is within a specified angular range around a center point of the selected area. The respective angular ranges of the recording clusters may be non-overlapping and/or may collectively span all angles around a center point of the selected area. Similarly, the angular range(s) may be predetermined or variable (e.g., user selected, or dependent on the number of records and/or the record location identified). The angular ranges may be equal to each other (e.g., in the case of four clusters, each angular range may be 90 degrees around the center point of the selected area).
A given recording cluster may be associated with a direction relative to the selected area. For example, the direction may be a direction within an associated angular range around a center point of the selected area. For example, it may be the center of the angular range. Alternatively, the direction may be derived based on recording positions associated with the recording of the recording clusters, e.g. as a direction from a center point of the selected area towards an average of those recording positions.
In some examples, a given record cluster may not be defined if a single record is identified that has an index entry that matches the search criteria and satisfies the location criteria of the record cluster. Alternatively, a visual indication of the individual record may be presented on the screen.
As an example, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosed technology, a computing system may be provided to present a visual indication associated with a location outside of a selected area and map data of the selected area based on search criteria. For example, a computing system, such as a communication device, may initiate one or more requests for map data associated with a selected area to one or more remote databases. The selected area may be part of a drawing area. The one or more requests may be associated with one or more search criteria. The search criteria may include general search criteria (such as a request for map data for a selected area) without specifying additional search parameters or terms. The search criteria may specify traffic condition criteria, such as to include traffic conditions in a selected area, or to include a particular type of traffic condition within a selected area. The search criteria may specify buildings, landmarks, businesses, etc. that are included with or as part of the map data. In some examples, the search criteria may include more specific search criteria, such as a request for a particular element associated with the selected area, such as a particular type of business or a particular type of traffic condition in the selected area. In response to one or more requests, the computing device may receive map data associated with the selected area. Further, the communication device may receive supplemental data associated with the subset of records. A subset of records may be selected from the plurality of records that satisfy one or more search criteria and/or one or more location criteria. A subset of records may be selected from the plurality of records based on a comparison of the plurality of records. In some examples, the remote geographic information system may select a subset of the records and provide the supplemental data to the computing device. The computing device may present map data for the selected area within a viewport of a digital mapping application. The map data for the selected area may be displayed according to a continuous mapping (e.g., a linear mapping) between points of the map viewport or other display area of the screen and the real-world location. Elements of the map data may be displayed within the viewport at respective points defined by the drawing. Further, the computing system may present, within the viewport, at least one visual indication of supplemental data associated with the subset of records along with the map data.
In some examples, the respective record location of each of the subset of records may be a respective traffic condition location. The supplemental data may then be traffic condition data describing corresponding current traffic conditions at the respective traffic condition location for each of the subsets of records. Further, the at least one visual indication may include an indication of the corresponding current traffic condition at the respective traffic condition location for each of the subset of records. In some examples, the comparison of the plurality of records may include comparing the traffic condition data to select a subset of records for which the current traffic condition is to be presented. In this manner, the computing device may selectively present data that may be of greater interest to the user. In some examples, the visual indication of the current traffic condition may include a time delay value indicating a time delay currently experienced by traffic traveling at the respective traffic condition location.
In some examples, the subset of records selected by the geographic information system includes two or more records from the plurality of records that match the one or more search criteria. The supplementary data may identify a recording cluster including two or more records. The visual indication may comprise an identification of the recording cluster. In some examples, the visual indication may indicate a number of two or more records in a cluster of records. The recording clusters may be associated with directions relative to a point within a selected area being displayed within a map viewport. The visual indication of the recording cluster may indicate the direction.
According to an example embodiment, a computing system may be provided to respond to one or more requests associated with map data for a selected area. For example, a computing system, such as a server hosting a geographic information system, may obtain map data associated with the selected area in response to the one or more requests. Further, the computing system may identify a plurality of records that satisfy one or more search criteria associated with the one or more requests. The plurality of records may additionally be identified based at least in part on satisfying the location criteria. Each of the plurality of records is associated with a respective recording location outside of the selected area. The computing system may select a subset of the plurality of records and supplemental data associated with the subset of records based on comparing the plurality of records. In response to the one or more user requests, the computing system may provide map data and supplemental data associated with the subset of records.
One example includes presenting map data to a user of a communication device, where the communication device is operable to access one or more databases external to the communication device. For example, the database may be provided by a geographic information system hosted on one or more remote servers. Additionally or alternatively, the database may be provided by a third party service separate from the geographic information system. The one or more databases may include map data describing transportation routes in the mapping area. The communication device may obtain map data from a database relating to a selected area that is part of a mapping area. The communication device may present the obtained map data in a display area of a screen of the communication device. The display area may correspond to a map viewport of a graphical user interface provided by a digital mapping application of the communication device. In some examples, under a continuous mapping, each point of the display area may correspond to a respective point of the selected area. For one or more traffic condition locations outside of the selected area, the communication device may obtain traffic condition data describing respective current traffic conditions at the one or more traffic condition locations. Further, for each of the one or more traffic condition locations, the communication device may present a respective visual indication indicative of a respective current traffic condition at the traffic condition location. Under this drawing, the visual indication may be presented on the screen at a location other than the location of the traffic condition. In some examples, the visual indication may be presented within a display area on the screen, such as within a map viewport. In some examples, the traffic condition data may include a time delay value indicating a time delay currently experienced by traffic traveling in one direction at a corresponding traffic condition location. The respective visual indication of the respective traffic condition location may indicate a length of the time delay.
Another example of presenting map data is provided that includes obtaining map data and one or more records from one or more databases. For example, the communication device may be operable to access a first database external to the communication device to obtain map data describing a transit route in the mapping area. The communication device is further operable to access a second database storing a plurality of records. Each record may be associated with one or more respective indexing items and with a respective record location in the mapping region. The communication device may obtain map data from a first database relating to a selected area that is part of a mapping area. The communication device may present the obtained map data in a display area of a screen of the communication device. Under a continuous mapping, each point of the display area may correspond to a respective point of the selected area. The communication device may define one or more search criteria and initiate a search in the second database. The search may include identifying any records for which the respective index term matches one or more search criteria. The searching may additionally include identifying at least one recording cluster. Each recording cluster may be associated with a respective location criterion and include a respective plurality of identified records for which the associated recording location is outside the selected area and satisfies the respective location criterion. The communication device may present a corresponding visual indication of the presence of the at least one recording cluster on the screen. In some examples, a visual indication of a cluster of records may be presented within a display area displaying map data.
The systems and methods of the present disclosure may provide a number of technical effects and benefits. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein provide techniques that may be utilized by computing systems including communication devices to improve graphical user interfaces displaying map information. In addition, the systems and methods disclosed herein provide techniques that may be utilized by computing systems including servers such as those hosting geographic information systems to improve the search results and specific data provided in response to requests related to maps. The systems and methods disclosed herein may provide particular improvements over existing systems in which mobile or other computing devices have limited screen sizes and are used to provide map information and map-related information. The disclosed technology allows more relevant data to be retrieved for display on a communication device and more relevant information to be displayed in an accessible manner.
For example, the present disclosure can make it possible to alleviate a mismatch between a physical limitation related to a screen size of a communication device and a size of a drawing area where map data exists. In particular, the present disclosure can enable presentation of data within a graphical user interface relating to a location outside of a selected area of a map currently being presented by a communication device. This may be achieved by displaying map data for the selected area according to a continuous mapping (e.g. a linear mapping) between points of the displayed area of the screen and the real world locations, while displaying a visual indication relating to the real world locations outside the selected area.
According to the drawing, the visual indication may be displayed at a location of the screen that does not correspond to a real world location. For example, one or more of the visual indications relating to real world locations outside of the selected area may be displayed within the display area along with map data for the selected area. To express this more precisely, the display area may have an outer perimeter (which may be, for example, a convex hull of all points on the screen at which the map data is presented under the map and which corresponds to the selected area), and a visual indication may be provided within the outer perimeter. In other words, the display area may be used both to provide information about the selected area and to provide information relating to location(s) outside the selected area. In some examples, the display area is a map viewport of a graphical user interface provided by a digital mapping application.
In this way, the communication device is able to alert the user of data regarding locations outside of the selected area without requiring the user to perform complex, time-consuming and confusing operations (e.g., through pan/rescale operations) to change the current selected area. This has the further advantage that the amount of data that the communication device may need to obtain from an external source may be reduced. This may ease the burden on the data communication network for transmitting data to the communication device and may extend the battery life of the communication device. Similarly, in response to a single search, data corresponding to locations outside of the selected area may be obtained and presented without requiring multiple different searches of areas other than the selected area, thereby reducing the total number of searches required to obtain desired information and, therefore, reducing network traffic.
In some examples, embodiments of the present disclosure may address the inability of conventional communication devices to present traffic condition data related to traffic conditions at locations outside of a selected area ("traffic condition locations"). In another example, embodiments of the present disclosure may address the inability of conventional communication devices to indicate to a user the presence of multiple records that are identified as matching search criteria and that are associated with respective locations outside of a selected area ("record locations"). Because each visual indication may indicate a respective cluster of multiple records, the number of visual indications may be lower than the number of identified records, such that the display area is not cluttered even if the number of identified records is high.
In some implementations, to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein, a user may be required to allow collection and analysis of location information associated with the user or her device. For example, in some implementations, a user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect such information. If a user does not allow the collection and use of such signals, the user may not obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein. The user may also be provided with a tool to revoke or change consent. In addition, certain information or data may be processed in one or more ways to delete personally identifiable information before being stored or used. By way of example, a computing system may obtain real-time location data that may indicate a location without identifying any particular user(s) or particular user computing device(s).
Referring now to the drawings, example aspects of the disclosure will be discussed in more detail.
FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of an example computing environment 100 in which embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced to provide and/or present data for locations outside of a selected area associated with currently displayed map data. The environment 100 may be implemented using a client-server architecture that includes a server computing system 130, where the server computing system 130 communicates with one or more user computing devices 102, 104, 106 (e.g., client devices) over a network 180. The environment 100 may be implemented using other suitable architectures, such as a single computing device or additional computing devices.
The environment 100 includes a server computing system 130, such as a web server and/or an application server, among others. The server computing system 130 may host a geographic information system 140, such as a geographic information system associated with a mapping service. The server computing system 130 may be implemented using any suitable computing device(s). The server computing system 130 may have one or more processors 132 and one or more memory devices 134. The server computing system 130 may also include a network interface for communicating with one or more user computing devices over the network 180. The network interface may include any suitable components for interfacing with one or more networks (interfaces), including, for example, a transmitter, receiver, port, controller, antenna, or other suitable component.
The one or more processors 132 may include any suitable processing device, such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, integrated circuit, logic device, or other suitable processing device. The one or more memory devices 134 may include one or more computer-readable media, including but not limited to non-transitory computer-readable media, RAM, ROM, hard disk drives, flash drives, or other memory devices. The one or more memory devices 134 may store information accessible by the one or more processors 132, including computer-readable instructions 138 that are executable by the one or more processors 132. The instructions 138 may be any set of instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors 132, cause the one or more processors 132 to perform operations. For example, the instructions 138 may be executable by one or more processors 132 to be implemented in a map manager 142 and/or an off-viewport data manager 144. Thus, although shown separately from the instructions 138, the map manager 142 and/or the extraviewport data manager 144 may be included as instructions 138 in the memory 134.
As shown in fig. 1, the one or more memory devices 134 may also store data 136 that may be retrieved, manipulated, created, or stored by the one or more processors 132. For example, the data 136 may include mapping data, recording data, supplemental data (such as traffic data, price data), recording cluster data, and other data. The data 136 may be stored in one or more databases. The one or more databases may be connected to the server computing system 130 through a high bandwidth LAN or WAN, or may also be connected to the server computing system 130 through the network 180. The one or more databases may be split so that they are located in multiple regions.
The server computing system 130 may exchange data with one or more client devices, such as the user computing devices 102, 104, 106. The user computing devices 102, 104, 106 are one example of communication devices. Although three client devices are shown in fig. 1, any number of client devices may be connected to server computing system 130 via network 180. Each of the client devices may be any suitable type of computing device, such as a general purpose computer, a special purpose computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a mobile device, a navigation system, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a wearable computing device, a display with one or more processors, or other suitable computing device.
Similar to the server computing system 130, the user computing devices 102, 104, 106 may include one or more processors 112 and memory 114. The one or more processors 112 may include one or more Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) dedicated to efficiently rendering images or performing other specialized computations, and/or other processing devices. The memory 114 may include one or more computer-readable media and may store information accessible by the one or more processors 112, including instructions 118 and data 116 executable by the one or more processors 112. For example, the memory 114 may store instructions 118 for implementing a digital mapping application 120, the digital mapping application 120 for displaying map data and other data determined in accordance with example aspects of the present disclosure.
The user computing device of fig. 1 may include various input/output devices for providing and receiving information from a user, such as a touch screen, a touch pad, data input keys, a speaker, and/or a microphone suitable for speech recognition. For example, according to an example aspect of the present disclosure, a user computing device may have a display device for presenting a graphical user interface 122, the graphical user interface 122 displaying the data and other data within a map viewport 124.
The user computing device may also include a network interface for communicating with one or more remote computing devices (e.g., server computing system 130) over network 180. The network interface may include any suitable components for interfacing with one or more networks, including, for example, a transmitter, receiver, port, controller, antenna, or other suitable component.
The network 180 may be any type of communication network, such as a local area network (e.g., an intranet), a wide area network (e.g., the internet), a cellular network, or some combination thereof. The network 180 may also include direct connections between the user computing devices 102, 104, 106 and the server computing system 130. In general, communications between the server computing system 130 and the user computing devices 102, 104, 106 may be performed via a network interface using any type of wired and/or wireless connection, using various communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP), encoding or formatting (e.g., HTML, XML), and/or protection schemes (e.g., VPN, secure HTTP, SSL).
The server computing system 130 may host a Geographic Information System (GIS) 140. The GIS140 may implement a mapping application, a virtual globe application, or any other suitable GIS. The GIS140 may provide archiving, retrieval, and manipulation of geospatial data that has been indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates (such as latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates) associated with the geospatial data. The GIS140 may combine satellite imagery, photographs, maps, models, and other geographic data, as well as internet search capabilities, to enable a user to view imagery of the earth (e.g., map data associated with multiple geographic areas) and related geographic information (e.g., areas such as islands and cities, and points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, parks, hotels, and schools). The GIS140 also allows a user to conduct a local search to obtain directions of travel to or between locations, or otherwise retrieve map data for a selected area. The user may virtually fly from space (e.g., a vantage point above the earth) to the entered target address or location, or around the target address or location, such as a neighborhood or other area of interest. The results may be displayed in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional representation of the region of interest. In some cases, a user may pan, tilt, and rotate the view to view the three-dimensional terrain and buildings.
The GIS140 may also allow users to annotate maps and/or enable data layers to display, for example, parks, schools, hospitals, airports, stores, and other points or locations of interest. The GIS140 may also allow users to tier multiple searches, save results to folders, and share search results and maps with others. Examples of graphical user interfaces that allow a user to interact with the GIS140 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure are discussed with reference to fig. 2, 3, and 4.
The user computing device 102 may include a digital mapping application 120, such as a geospatial browser or other suitable viewer that provides an interface between the user computing device 102 and the GIS 140. For example, the digital mapping application may be configured to display digital map data within the map viewport 124 of the graphical user interface 122. A user of the user computing device 106 may interact with the digital mapping application 120 using the graphical user interface 122 to facilitate interaction between the user computing device 102 and the GIS 140. The digital mapping application may provide a user interface for viewing geographic data (e.g., digital map data). The graphical user interface may include a plurality of user interface elements with which a user may interact to facilitate communication between the user computing device 102 and the GIS 140.
According to an example aspect of the present disclosure, the digital mapping application 120 may be configured to display a map view of a geographic area including a selected area of the mapping area. As indicated, such a map view may provide a more intuitive user experience for a user viewing the digital mapping application 120. In this manner, the user computing device 102 may communicate with the GIS140 in order to provide a map view to the user.
The geographic information system 140 can include a map manager 142 and an extraviewport data manager 144. The extraviewport data manager 144 may be configured to determine supplemental data to display with a map associated with a geographic area, such as a user-selected area. For example, the geographic area may be a geographic area to be displayed within a viewport of the digital mapping application 120 on the user computing device 102. In some implementations, the user can select a geographic region through interaction with the digital mapping application 120. Such interaction may be, for example, any suitable interaction (such as panning, zooming, etc.) with respect to a digital mapping application, such that the graphical user interface 122 displays a geographic area (such as within the map viewport 124). In some implementations, the geographic region can be displayed within the viewport in response to a search query provided by a user.
The extraviewport data manager 144 may access the map data 146 and/or the map element records 148 in response to one or more user requests for map data to determine supplemental data 154 to provide. For example, the map manager 142 may access the map data 146 in response to one or more user requests to determine map data to display within the graphical user interface 122. The one or more user requests may be search queries or, more simply, requests to modify the current map view in some manner. Based on the selected area, the map manager 142 may access and provide map data in response to the one or more user requests. The extraviewport data manager 144 may receive one or more search criteria associated with the one or more user requests to determine supplemental data 154 provided in response to the one or more user requests. For example, the extraviewport data manager 144 may compare one or more search terms to one or more index terms 152 associated with the map element records 148. For example, the extraviewport data manager 144 may determine whether one or more records 148 satisfy one or more search criteria based on whether the records are associated with an index entry corresponding to the search criteria. In an example embodiment, the extraviewport data manager 144 may provide supplemental data based on one or more recorded locations 150 associated with locations outside of the selected area displayed within the map viewport 124. The extraviewport data manager 144 may also select the records 148 and/or supplemental data 154 using one or more location criteria in response to a user request.
The supplemental data 154 may include various types of data related to the map element records 148. The supplemental data may include data other than typical map data provided for recording by a mapping system. For example, supplemental data 154 may include traffic condition data, price or availability data, or other types of data associated with one or more records. In some examples, supplemental data 154 may include metadata such as one or more rankings or scores, user comments, location data, hours of operation, menus, enrollment data, and/or other suitable data associated with the respective record. The supplemental data may relate to any suitable building, structure, geographic area, energy source, landmark, or other suitable location. The supplemental data can include data associated with a graphical representation of a record to be rendered within the map viewport 124. In some examples, the supplemental data 154 may be generated in real-time based on a comparison of the logged data. For example, supplemental data 154 may indicate one or more clusters of records generated in real-time based on search criteria, location criteria, or other criteria.
The out-of-viewport data manager 144 may access the map element records 148 to determine supplemental data associated with the map data for the selected area to be displayed within the map viewport 124. The out-of-view data manager 144 may select a record to display or supplemental data to provide in association with the selected record based at least in part on the map element record 148 and/or the supplemental data 154.
In some examples, the extra-viewport data manager 144 may select supplemental data 154 to be displayed in the map viewport 124 based at least in part on one or more location criteria to select one or more map element records 148 associated with a record location 150 that is not within the geographic region to be represented within the viewport. For example, in some examples, the location criteria may include a distance criteria and/or a direction criteria. For example, a record may be selected based on a corresponding record location that is outside of the geographic area, but within a threshold distance of the geographic area.
In some examples, the out-of-viewport data manager 144 may identify data indicative of a plurality of candidate map element records 148 located within a threshold distance of a geographic area. For example, the extraviewport data manager 144 may identify a plurality of map element records 148 of the candidate records that satisfy one or more search criteria and location criteria. Each of the plurality of records may be associated with a respective record location that is displayed outside of a selected area within the map viewport 124. The out-of-view data manager 144 may select a subset of the plurality of records and/or supplemental data associated with the subset of records based on comparing the plurality of records. In some examples, the comparison may be based on supplemental data associated with the plurality of records. For example, a subset of records may be selected based on traffic condition data or metadata (such as pricing or other information associated with the record location).
The geographic information system 140 can provide map data 146 and/or log data including map element records 148 and/or supplemental data 154 to be displayed within the map viewport 124 of the user computing device 102. The digital mapping application 120 may then render the map data and/or record the data within a viewport 124 of a graphical user interface 122. In particular, the digital mapping application 120 may present the map data in the map viewport 124 concurrently with selected record data based on the search criteria, the location criteria, and a comparison of the plurality of records matching the search criteria and the location criteria.
For example, supplemental data 154 may include weather information, traffic information, transportation information, or other suitable information associated with a geographic area. The supplemental data can be graphically represented in the map viewport 124. For example, one or more weather elements (e.g., graphical representations of weather events (such as rain, snow, sunlight, moonlight, etc.)) may be determined based at least in part on current real-time environmental information associated with a geographic area in the physical world. In this manner, the geographic information system 140 may obtain environmental information currently associated with a geographic area. Such environmental information may be obtained from any suitable source.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram depicting an example of a user computing device 202, where the user computing device 202 has a screen on which map data 208 that has been rendered in a visual format is displayed. According to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, map data may be displayed in a map viewport 206 of a graphical user interface of a digital mapping application. In a particular depicted example, the screen of the user computing device 202 also includes an auxiliary user interface 204 that depicts auxiliary information such as battery usage, time, network connectivity, etc., associated with the user computing device 202.
The rendered map data 208 includes a map topology that depicts a street-level view of a geographic area that includes a plurality of roads and other map elements (including waterways and parks, in the specifically described example). The map viewport 206 additionally presents a plurality of visual indications 210-1, 210-2, and 210-3 depicting traffic conditions at three respective traffic condition locations within the selected area depicted in the map viewport 206. For example, the visual indication 210-1 depicts traffic conditions at a respective traffic condition location associated with a time delay of three minutes. Thus, visual indication 210-1 comprises a visual indication of a time delay. In this example, the visual indication 210-1 indicates the time delay currently experienced by traffic traveling in both directions at the respective traffic condition location. Similarly, the visual indication 210-2 includes a visual indication of a time delay (e.g., +1 minute (min)), where the visual indication indicates a time delay currently experienced by traffic traveling in one direction at another respective traffic condition location. The visual indication 210-3 comprises a visual indication of a time delay value (e.g., +2 minutes), where the visual indication indicates the time delay currently experienced by traffic traveling in one direction at another respective traffic condition location.
The map viewport 206 can also display traffic conditions associated with one or more traffic condition locations that are outside of the selected area corresponding to the rendered map data 208 currently displayed in the viewport. For example, the map viewport 206 can present a visual indication 220 of traffic conditions at a location outside of a selected area corresponding to the rendered map data 208. In this example, the visual indication 220 includes an indication of the corresponding traffic condition location outside of the selected area. For example, the visual indication 220 indicates that the corresponding traffic condition is being experienced at a traffic condition location denoted as "I-5". Further, the visual indication 220 includes an indication of the time delay (+20 minutes) currently experienced by traffic at the traffic condition location. Further, the visual indication 220 includes an indication of the direction of the traffic condition location relative to a point within the selected area displayed within the viewport 206. For example, the visual indication 220 includes an arrow indicating that the corresponding traffic condition location is to the right relative to the current depiction of the rendered map data 208. Although the map viewport 206 depicts a single visual indication 220 corresponding to the out-of-viewport recorded location, other examples may detect additional visual indications of additional traffic condition locations.
Fig. 3 is a block diagram depicting another example of a user computing device 202, where the user computing device 202 has a screen that again displays rendered map data 208. In this example, the map viewport 206 presents visual indications 230-1, 230-2, and 230-3 depicting supplemental data associated with three recording locations within the selected area. The supplemental data may be selected in response to one or more search criteria, such as a user request for gasoline pricing information in a selected area. In response to one or more user requests, map viewport 206 provides visual indication 230-1 depicting the price of gasoline at the first recording location, visual indication 230-2 depicting the price of gasoline at the second recording location, and visual indication 230-3 depicting the price of gasoline at the third recording location.
The map viewport 206 additionally displays supplemental data indicating a price of gasoline associated with one or more recorded locations (e.g., gas station locations) outside of the selected region corresponding to the rendered map data 208 currently displayed in the viewport. For example, the map viewport 206 may present a visual indication 240 of a price of gasoline at a location outside of the selected area corresponding to the rendered map data 208. In this example, the visual indication 240 includes an indication of the corresponding recording location outside of the selected area. For example, visual indication 240 indicates that the corresponding recording location is identified as "gasoline 4". Further, the visual indication 240 includes supplemental data, where in this case the supplemental data indicates the price of gasoline at the corresponding recording location (e.g., $ 2.89). Further, the visual indication 220 includes an indication of an expected time of travel between a point in the selected area to the recording location. Further, the visual indication 240 includes an indication of the direction of the recording location relative to a point within the selected area. For example, the visual indication 240 includes an arrow indicating that the corresponding recording location is to the right relative to the current depiction of the rendered map data 208. While the map viewport 206 depicts a single visual indication 240 corresponding to a recorded location outside of the viewport, other examples may depict additional visual indications of additional traffic condition locations.
In some examples, the geographic information system may determine a subset of records for which supplemental data is to be provided based on comparing the records. For example, in this example, the geographic information system may compare the gasoline prices of a plurality of records corresponding to record locations outside of the selected area to select one or more records having the lowest or lower price. In some examples, the comparison may be made only between recorded locations outside of the selected area. In other examples, the comparison may be between recorded locations outside of the selected area and recorded locations within the selected area. For example, the geographic information system in this example may determine to present supplemental data associated with location "gasoline 4" based on the supplemental data, where the supplemental data indicates that the location is within the selected area, and/or is outside the selected area but within the threshold criteria has a minimum gasoline price.
Fig. 4 is a block diagram depicting yet another example of a user computing device 202. In this example, the computing device 202 includes a screen that displays the rendered map data 228 within the map viewport 206. The screen of the device 202 also depicts an auxiliary user interface 204, and a direction interface 222 of a graphical user interface of a digital mapping application, which direction interface 222 may provide the direction of a trajectory between two or more locations. The map viewport 206 displays a search box 242, where in the search box 242, a user can provide one or more search criteria, such as a search term. In a particular depicted example, the user has entered one or more search criteria, and the map viewport 206 has responded with a display that includes visual indications 250-1, 250-2, and 250-3, where the visual indications 250-1, 250-2, and 250-3 indicate records that have corresponding record locations within the selected region.
The map viewport 206 can also display visual indications of record clusters, each record cluster including two or more records having corresponding record locations outside of the selected region. For example, the geographic information system may identify a plurality of records that satisfy one or more search criteria and one or more location criteria. The location criteria may include distance criteria and/or orientation criteria. The distance criterion may specify that for a recording to be selected, the corresponding recording location should be within a specified distance of the selected area or a point within the selected area. Further, the distance criterion may specify that the recordings of the recording cluster selection should be within a specified distance of each other. The direction criterion may specify that for a recording to be included in a recording cluster it should be within a specified angular range around a center point of the selected area. The respective angular ranges of the clusters of records may be non-overlapping and/or may collectively span all angles around a center point of the selected area, and similarly the angular ranges may be predetermined or variable (e.g., user selected or dependent on the number of identified records and/or recording locations). The angular ranges may be equal to each other (e.g., in the case of four clusters, each cluster may be at 90 degrees around the center point of the selected area).
The number of recording clusters may be predefined or dependent on the identified records (e.g., the number of identified records and/or their associated recording locations). Similarly, the number of records in a recording cluster may be predefined or dependent on the identified records.
A given recording cluster may be associated with multiple recordings in the cluster, orientation with respect to a selected area, or other information. For example, the direction may be a direction within an associated angular range around a center point of the selected area. For example, the direction may be the center of the angular range. Alternatively, the direction may be derived based on recording positions associated with the recording of the recording clusters, e.g. the direction is derived as the direction of the mean of the center point of the selected area towards those recording positions.
In a particular depicted example, the map viewport 206 presents visual indications 260-1, 260-2, 260-3, and 260-4 of respective record clusters. The visual indication 260-1 indicates that the corresponding cluster of records includes 11 records. Further, the visual indication 260-1 indicates the direction of the corresponding recording cluster with respect to the point within the selected area. For example, the visual indication 260-1 comprises an arrow or a dot indicating that the recording cluster corresponds to a recording position outside the selected area, wherein the recording position is located above or north of the selected area with respect to the depiction in fig. 4. The visual indication 260-2 indicates that the corresponding cluster of records includes sixteen records with corresponding record locations to the right or east of the selected point within the selected area. The visual indication 260-3 indicates that the corresponding cluster of records includes six records having corresponding record locations that are below or south of the selected point within the selected area. The visual indication 260-4 indicates that the corresponding cluster of records includes twenty-five records having corresponding record locations to the left or west of the selected point within the selected area.
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 500 for presenting a visual indication of supplemental data associated with one or more locations outside of a selected area while presenting map data of the selected area. One or more portions of the method 500 may be implemented by one or more computing devices (e.g., such as the user computing devices 102, 104, 106 shown in fig. 1 or the user computing device 202 shown in fig. 2). One or more portions of the method 500 described herein may be implemented as an algorithm on a hardware component of a device described herein (e.g., as shown in fig. 1), e.g., to generate a graphical user interface including map viewport image map data for a selected area rendered with supplemental data associated with one or more recordings. In an example embodiment, the process 500 may be performed by the digital mapping application 120 of the user computing device 102.
At (502), one or more search criteria may be defined, for example, in response to user input. For example, the one or more search criteria may include one or more search terms provided by the user or otherwise generated in response to user input. In some examples, one or more search criteria may be generated in response to a user selected location. Further, the user-selected scale may be used to generate one or more search criteria. Note, however, that one or more search criteria may be automatically generated. For example, one or more search criteria may be automatically generated to request a portion of the mapping region centered at a location specified by the digital mapping application. In this manner, it is noted that the search criteria may be a general request for map data associated with a selected area of the mapping area. Further, the search criteria may be a more specific request that includes one or more search terms or other input search query.
At (504), one or more requests for map data associated with a selected area of the mapping area are initiated to one or more databases. In some examples, the one or more requests may include one or more search criteria. More particularly, the user computing device may initiate one or more requests by sending search instructions from the user computing device. The search request may specify one or more search criteria. Referring to fig. 1, the user computing device 102, 104, or 106 may initiate one or more requests to one or more databases of the geographic information system 140, such as one or more databases containing map data 146 and/or map element records 148.
At (506), map data related to the selected area is received from one or more databases. The map data may be received as one or more responses from the geographic information system 140 that are provided in response to one or more requests.

Other location criteria may be used. For example, the subset of records may be selected based on being within a specified distance of the selected area, and/or within a specified distance from a particular point in the selected area, and/or within a specified distance from each other. In some examples, the order of (558) and (560) may be reversed.
At (562), at least a subset of the plurality of map element records is selected. In some examples, the subset is selected based on a comparison of multiple map element records. For example, the subset may be selected by applying one or more comparison criteria. In addition to search criteria and location criteria, comparison criteria may also be applied. For example, the comparison criteria may be applied to supplemental data associated with the plurality of map element records to select the subset. For example, the supplemental data may include traffic condition data. The comparison criteria may specify a minimum time delay or other parameter for selecting a traffic condition record corresponding to a location outside of the selected area. In another example, the comparison criteria may specify that a predetermined or dynamic number of map element records be selected from the plurality of map element records. For example, the comparison criteria may be applied to select a percentage of the plurality of map element records based on the supplemental data. As a particular example, the comparison criteria may specify that half or another percentage of records having the lowest price or the longest time delay, etc., are selected.
At (564), one or more responses may be provided from the geographic information system, the responses including the map data and supplemental data associated with the subset of map element records.
