Definitions
- skim reading When users sift through large amounts of content, such as many pages of text reviews about a particular place, they want to frequently switch between skim-reading and detailed reading. For example, users typically want to skim until they find something they're interested in, and read particular content, such as an individual text review, in detail. In skim reading, the user only needs an overview to gain a general feeling of the entire contents. For example, a user can skim-read a number of restaurant reviews to gain a general feeling as to how most people rated the restaurant. During the skim-read, the user can also pick out certain words, and decide based on those words whether they want to read the text is more detail.
- words such as “terrible service” or “recommended” might stand out during a skim read of a restaurant review.
- the user does not necessarily care about the rest of the words, such as “I went to this place last Saturday,” while skim-reading.
- such text may be important to provide the full context of the content.
- Existing systems provide content in an overview context for skim reading and a detailed reading context for detailed reading.
- existing systems do not enable users to quickly switch between the overview context and detailed reading context.
- one existing system is the 2-page view system.
- one page provides an overview context while another page provides the detailed reading context.
- the overview page may provide a sample of user reviews for a given place, and clicking on any of the samples allows the user to see the full original review in detail.
- the overview page is only a sampled representation of all of the available contents, it gives the user the impression that they're missing the overall picture.
- the user needs to actively switch between the two pages, often by tapping. This gives high mental fatigue, making it hard to switch between the overview context and detailed context quickly and smoothly.
- word clouds provides a cloud of “important” words that appeared in the original content, where words may be extracted via various well-known algorithms for word-importance scoring.
- the clouds give a glanceable way for users to understand the overall picture of all the contents. Clicking on individual words may lead to a second page that show individual contents that contained the given word. However, this suffers the same drawbacks as the 2-page system.
- Yet another example of an existing system includes highlighting important words directly within the individual contents. For example, if a user types words into a search tool, those words may be highlighted within the text they were found in. This has the deficiency that users cannot view the original content in its true form as the original author intended, as the styling is defaced.
- the present disclosure describes a system allowing users to switch between an overview context for skim reading and a detailed reading context quickly and with minimal active interaction.
- One aspect of the disclosure provides a method for automatically displaying content in a context selected based on passive user cues.
- the method includes identifying, with one or more processors, most important portions of the content, detecting, with the one or more processors, passive cues of the user, determining, with the one or more processors, a viewing context based on the passive cues of the user, wherein potential viewing contexts include a first overview context wherein the most important portions of the content are displayed, and a detailed reading context wherein the content is displayed in its entirety, and providing, with the one or more processors, the content for display in the determined viewing context.
- Identifying the most important portions of the content may include generating a library of words in the content, and assigning an importance value to each word.
- the importance value may be based on at least one of a frequency of appearance of the word or subject matter of the content.
- detecting the passive cues of the user may include detecting a speed at which the user is scrolling through the content.
- the method may further include assigning a detailedness score based on the detected speed, wherein determining the viewing context is based at least in part on the detailedness score.
- the method may further include computing a visibility score based on the detailedness score and the identified most important portions.
- detecting the passive cues of the user may include detecting a gaze of the user, detecting the gaze may include determining an amount of time during which the user's gaze is focused on the content.
- Determining the viewing context may include inferring an intent of the user based on the passive cues, and determining the viewing context based on the inferred intent.
- the potential viewing contexts may further include a second overview context, in which the most important portions of the content are displayed in their original form and remaining portions of the content are displayed with transparency.
- the system includes one or more memories, and one or more processors in communication with the one or more memories.
- the one or more processors are configured to identify most important portions of the content, detect passive cues of the user, determine a viewing context based on the passive cues of the user, wherein potential viewing contexts include a first overview context wherein the most important portions of the content are displayed, and a detailed reading context wherein the content is displayed in its entirety, and provide the content for display in the determined viewing context.
- the one or more processors are further configured to generate a library of words in the content, and assign an importance value to each word.
- the importance value may be based on at least one of a frequency of appearance of the word or subject matter of the content.
- Detecting the passive cues of the user may include detecting a speed at which the user is scrolling through the content.
- the one or more processors may be further configured to assign a detailedness score based on the detected speed, wherein determining the viewing context is based at least in part on the detailedness score.
- the one or more processors may be further configured to compute a visibility score based on the detailedness score and the identified most important portions. Detecting the passive cues of the user may alternatively or additionally include detecting gaze of the user.
- Determining the viewing context may include inferring an intent of the user based on the passive cues, and determining the viewing context based on the inferred intent.
- the potential viewing contexts may further include a second overview context, in which the most important portions of the content are displayed in their original form and remaining portions of the content are displayed with transparency.
- Yet another aspect of the disclosure provides a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions executable by one or more processors for performing a method of automatically displaying content in a context inferred based on passive user cues, including identifying most important portions of the content, detecting passive cues of the user, determining a viewing context based on the passive cues of the user, wherein potential viewing contexts include a first overview context wherein the most important portions of the content are displayed, and a detailed reading context wherein the content is displayed in its entirety, and providing the content for display in the determined viewing context.

- the present disclosure provides a text display system that switches seamlessly between an overview mode and a detailed view mode, depending on passive signals from the user. Accordingly, users can switch between the overview and detailed context using interactions that they use naturally. When looking for interesting things to read, they can naturally scroll fast and be able to see only the important topics of the contents. This allows them to capture the gist of all of the contents, and also quickly find contents that they may be interested in reading further. When they slow down the scrolling, the content will be presented in its original form without highlighting, so the user will be able to consume the content in the true form that the author created. Since there is no active interaction required other than the natural scrolling that users would do anyway, there is no mental hurdle in switching between the overview and detailed contexts, allowing users to find and consume content quickly.
- control over the form in which content is displayed can be achieved without interrupting other functions (such as scrolling).
- control over the form in which content is displayed can be achieved without interrupting other functions (such as scrolling).
- the approach of the present disclosure is also well suited to allowing reversible changes between operating modes in response to changes in context.
- the system may include a content scorer, a context detector, and a user interface.
- the content scorer scores the relative importance of parts of each content, such as the importance of each word in a restaurant review text, or parts of a photo that show the central object of the photo.
- the user context detector classifies the intent of the user. For example, the context detector may determine whether the user wants to see the overview or the details of an individual content. The determination may be based on, for example, how quickly the user is scrolling through the content.
- the user interface displays the individual content with only the important parts highlighted when it is determined that the user wants to see the overview, and displays the individual content in its original form when the user is classified as wanting to see details.
- the content scorer may perform text scoring, such as by using term frequency—inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to generate a library of words mapped to their relative importance. Every word that appears in a text content may have a score based on how interesting it may be to a user. According to some examples, the score may be a numeric value, such as a number ranging from [0.0-1.0]. In another implementation, importance scores may be manually assigned to particular parts of the content. For example, where the content is a business review, details such as a username or image of the content author may be assigned a lower importance score so that they will be hidden when the user is skimming through content.
- the user context detector may map the scrolling speed at any point in time to a number representing the user's willingness to read individual details. For example, a scrolling speed of 0 dp/sec, where dp is a unit of measurement of distance on a display, may be linearly mapped to detailedness of 1, where 1 represents a maximum detailedness level. A scrolling speed of 30 dp/sec, for example, may be mapped to detailedness of 0, where it would be inferred that the user only wants to see the overview of contents. Any scrolling speed between 0 dp/sec and 30 dp/sec may correlate to a level of detailedness based on a function.
- the user interface may emphasize important parts of the content, and de-emphasize non-important parts, when the detailedness score is low.
- all words may be classified as either important and not important.
- the top 5% of words in the library may be defined to be important, and all else not important.
- All not important words may be made transparent based on the detailedness score, so that when the detailedness is 1, the transparency of not important words are at the level of the original content, whereas when the detailedness is 0 , the not important words are fully transparent but important words are still fully visible.

- such information includes a portion 302 of a previous review, and a section 310 of reviews related to “Restaurant C.”
- Such section 310 includes an overall rating 312 , which may be an average or other combination of individual ratings provided in individual reviews, and one or more images 314 , such as images of the restaurant, of food served at the restaurant, etc.
- an overall rating 312 which may be an average or other combination of individual ratings provided in individual reviews
- images 314 such as images of the restaurant, of food served at the restaurant, etc.
- Each review may include, for example, a title 324 , an identification 326 , such as a user name or the like, of the contributor, a rating 322 , and a description 328 . It should be understood that this is merely an example, and that other types of reviews or other types of content may have a different format.
- the first overview context 400 only some portions of the content are displayed and the rest are transparent. In this example, the undisplayed portions are completely transparent, such that they are not visible, though in other examples they may be displayed with a different degree of transparency. Accordingly, in some examples, in the first overview context the most important portions of the context may be displayed while display of other portions of the content may be restricted partially or completely.
- the portions of the content displayed in the first overview context 400 include a number of words having a highest importance.
- each word in the content may be ranked according to its importance, as further described below in connection with FIG. 6 .
- the words may be from different reviews 320 - 340 , and a number of words selected from each review may be the same or different.
- some reviews may not have any important words, and therefore no words for such review would be displayed in the first overview context 400 .
- the important words may be from any portion of the reviews. For example, the title 324 of the review 320 is shown, but the titles for other reviews are not shown, because the words in such titles were of lower importance.
- the total number of words displayed in the first overview context 400 may depend on, for example, how quickly the user is scrolling or skim-reading the page. For example, if the user is scrolling through approximately 6 screens per second, and typical users can read approximately 60 words per second, then approximately 10 words may be displayed on each screen. While the images 31 and review 312 , 322 were not shown in the first overview context 400 , in other example some images and graphics may be displayed. The display of graphics may depend on, for example, the type of content displayed, such as whether it is reviews, search results, news, etc., a composition of the content displayed, such as whether it is primarily images and graphics or primarily text, user defined settings, or any other information.
- FIG. 4 illustrates screenshots of an example transition between a second overview context 500 and the first overview context 400 .
- the words displayed in the first overview context 400 may be displayed in their normal state, while the remaining content is displayed with a degree of transparency.
- the transparency of such remaining content is at a lesser degree than that of the first overview context 400 , where it is fully transparent. Rather, in the second overview context 500 , the remaining content can be faintly seen.
- the second overview context 500 may be displayed if, for example, the user is scrolling slower than a maximum speed, for which the first overview context 400 would be displayed, but faster than a normal reading pace, for which the detailed reading context 300 ( FIG. 3 ) would be displayed.
- the degree of transparency may be proportional to the scrolling speed or reading speed of the user. For example, the faster the user scrolls, the more transparent the remaining content may become. As the scrolling speed slows, the remaining content may become more visible.
- FIG. 5 illustrates screenshots of an example transition between the second overview context 500 and the detailed reading context 300 . Such transition may occur automatically, for example, when the user's scrolling slows down. While the same content is illustrated in each context for comparison, it should be understood that the content may actually move off the screen and be replaced by new content.
- FIGS. 3-5 illustrate altering the transparency of less important words or features
- visibility may be altered in other ways.
- other attributes of styling such as color, brightness, relative contrast to the background, bolding, font size, etc. may be used to alter the relative visibility of important words and features.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example of the library of words ranked by importance.
- every word that appears in a text content may have a score based on how interesting it may be to a user.
- the score may be based on any of a variety of parameters, such as frequency of appearance, field within the context in which it appears, subject matter of the content, etc.
- text that appears within a user identifier field e.g., identifier 326 of FIG. 3
- a description field e.g., description 328 of FIG. 3
- a title field e.g., title 324 of FIG. 3
- words of particular interest in such subject matter may be assigned a greater importance that they would in other subject matters.
- term frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to generate a library of words mapped to their relative importance.
- the score may be a numeric value, such as a number ranging from [0.0-1. 0 ], as shown in FIG. 6 . In other examples, the score may be a numeric value in a different range, a percentage, a non-numeric value, or any other type of value.
- graphics may also have an overview context and a detailed context.
- the elements shown in each context may be based on, for example, manual user input, computed scores, or other information.
- scores may be based on machine learning input detecting portions of content most relevant to viewers.
- maps may show different contents depending on the user's required level of detail.
- the display may show only user interface elements that give an overview of the place.
- such elements may include the country name, large natural features like rivers and mountains, etc.
- the display may show more detailed labels, such as the city name, tourist attractions, restaurant names, etc.
- photographs may also be altered in overview context as compared to detailed context. For example, in a gallery of photos, in the overview context, only the foreground object in the photo may be shown in color, while the background is shown in grayscale. In the detailed view, the full photograph may be shown in color.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example context detection unit 700 .
- the context detection unit 700 may include, for example, the one or more processors of the client device and/or of one or more servers. According to some examples, it may also include input features of the client device, such as touch screen input, voice input, electronic connections to other devices, GPS location, accelerometer data, camera input, etc.
- the context detection unit 700 may determine a user's desired context based on scrolling speed 710 .
- any scrolling speed between 0 dp/sec and 30 dp/sec may correlate to a level of detailedness based on a function, such as:
- the function may have a non-zero intercept. For example, a scrolling speed up to some threshold, such as 5 dp/sec, may be deemed to have a detailedness level of 1, because users may scroll slowly while reading content, and still want to be in the detailed view.
- a scrolling speed up to some threshold such as 5 dp/sec
- Such function may be, for example:
- This function may be computed across an averaged speed over some time, such as, by way of example only, 100 ms. Because some scrolling may happen accidentally, such as if a user accidentally touches the screen of a smartphone, computing the averaged speed over time would reduce accidental scrolling.
- the function, with such averaging, may be:
- the visibility of the words may be computed as a function of the detailedness. For example, a maximum detailedness score may produce maximum visibility, such as illustrated in the detailed reading view 300 of FIG. 3 . Conversely, a minimum detailedness score may produce minimum visibility of unimportant words or objects, such as shown in the first overview context 400 of FIG. 4 . A detailedness score somewhere between the maximum and minimum may result in a context similar to the second overview context 500 of FIG. 4 . For example, visibility may be computed as:
- visibility may be computed as a function of importance and detailedness to alter the text visibility:
- the context detector 700 may determine the user's desired detailedness based on other natural cues, such as the user's reading speed, the user's activities, user-defined parameters, etc. For example, while performing certain activities, such as walking, talking, eating, etc., users may be less willing or able to view detailed content. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 7 , the context detector 700 may detect when the user is performing such an activity, and the detailedness may be adjusted to show summarized content in an overview context accordingly. For example, the context detector 700 may detect a user's voice input 730 , or a wireless communication connection between the client device and another device 750 .
- Such input may be used to infer a particular activity of the user.
- Other possible inputs may include accelerometer input, GPS input, gyroscope input, temperature input, light input, etc.
- the context view may return to the more detailed reading context.
- the user's focus on the screen may be used to infer the desired context.
- a camera or other device may detect movements of the user's pupils 740 , the user's head, or other movements that would indicate the user's gaze.
- a time during which the user's eyes are focusing on the screen may be used to compute the detailedness of contents shown to the user.
- users glancing at a phone may see a summary of an email they received, and then view the details by continuing to view the screen.
- the user will have the ability to authorize such input or disable such input.
- the user may be required to enable access of a camera for capturing pupil or head movements of the user.
- the context detector 700 may also determine context based on user-defined parameters. For example, parameters for setting the visibility may be chosen so that, given a certain model of users' reading speed, users have enough time at their current scrolling speed to read all words visible on the screen. For example, if a typical user can read 3 words per second, and the scrolling speed is such that exactly one screen height's worth is scrolled in exactly one second, then visibility should be controlled such that about 3 most important words appear on the screen. The user may adjust the number of words appearing on one screen, for example, if the user is capable of reading faster or slower than the typical user. This ensures that at whatever scrolling speed, the users can keep reading at the same speed, and never have a situation where words scroll off before they're read by the user.

If it is inferred that the user wants to see details, then a detailed reading context may be selected. Other contexts, such as a second overview context wherein less information is removed than in the first overview context, may also be selected based on the inferred user intent.

- the above techniques are advantageous in that users can switch between viewing the overall picture of contents, and detailed views of individual contents quickly without actively needing to express their context intent. They are able to view the overview within the context of the original content. For example, when they see the word awesome, they can slow down the scrolling to see what the author meant. They are able to view the contents in detail in the true form that they were given by the original author.
Abstract
Description
- The present application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/775,196 filed Dec. 4, 2018, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
- When users sift through large amounts of content, such as many pages of text reviews about a particular place, they want to frequently switch between skim-reading and detailed reading. For example, users typically want to skim until they find something they're interested in, and read particular content, such as an individual text review, in detail. In skim reading, the user only needs an overview to gain a general feeling of the entire contents. For example, a user can skim-read a number of restaurant reviews to gain a general feeling as to how most people rated the restaurant. During the skim-read, the user can also pick out certain words, and decide based on those words whether they want to read the text is more detail. For example, words such as “terrible service” or “recommended” might stand out during a skim read of a restaurant review. The user does not necessarily care about the rest of the words, such as “I went to this place last Saturday,” while skim-reading. When reading in detail, however, such text may be important to provide the full context of the content.
- Existing systems provide content in an overview context for skim reading and a detailed reading context for detailed reading. However, such systems do not enable users to quickly switch between the overview context and detailed reading context. For example, one existing system is the 2-page view system. In this system, one page provides an overview context while another page provides the detailed reading context. For example, the overview page may provide a sample of user reviews for a given place, and clicking on any of the samples allows the user to see the full original review in detail. Because the overview page is only a sampled representation of all of the available contents, it gives the user the impression that they're missing the overall picture. Moreover, the user needs to actively switch between the two pages, often by tapping. This gives high mental fatigue, making it hard to switch between the overview context and detailed context quickly and smoothly.
- Another example of an existing system is word clouds, which provides a cloud of “important” words that appeared in the original content, where words may be extracted via various well-known algorithms for word-importance scoring. The clouds give a glanceable way for users to understand the overall picture of all the contents. Clicking on individual words may lead to a second page that show individual contents that contained the given word. However, this suffers the same drawbacks as the 2-page system.
- Yet another example of an existing system includes highlighting important words directly within the individual contents. For example, if a user types words into a search tool, those words may be highlighted within the text they were found in. This has the deficiency that users cannot view the original content in its true form as the original author intended, as the styling is defaced.
- The present disclosure describes a system allowing users to switch between an overview context for skim reading and a detailed reading context quickly and with minimal active interaction.
- One aspect of the disclosure provides a method for automatically displaying content in a context selected based on passive user cues. The method includes identifying, with one or more processors, most important portions of the content, detecting, with the one or more processors, passive cues of the user, determining, with the one or more processors, a viewing context based on the passive cues of the user, wherein potential viewing contexts include a first overview context wherein the most important portions of the content are displayed, and a detailed reading context wherein the content is displayed in its entirety, and providing, with the one or more processors, the content for display in the determined viewing context.
- Identifying the most important portions of the content may include generating a library of words in the content, and assigning an importance value to each word. The importance value may be based on at least one of a frequency of appearance of the word or subject matter of the content.
- According to some examples, detecting the passive cues of the user may include detecting a speed at which the user is scrolling through the content. The method may further include assigning a detailedness score based on the detected speed, wherein determining the viewing context is based at least in part on the detailedness score. The method may further include computing a visibility score based on the detailedness score and the identified most important portions. According to other examples, wherein detecting the passive cues of the user may include detecting a gaze of the user, detecting the gaze may include determining an amount of time during which the user's gaze is focused on the content.
- Determining the viewing context may include inferring an intent of the user based on the passive cues, and determining the viewing context based on the inferred intent.
- According to some examples, the potential viewing contexts may further include a second overview context, in which the most important portions of the content are displayed in their original form and remaining portions of the content are displayed with transparency.
- Another aspect of the disclosure provides a system for automatically displaying content in a context based on passive user cues. The system includes one or more memories, and one or more processors in communication with the one or more memories. The one or more processors are configured to identify most important portions of the content, detect passive cues of the user, determine a viewing context based on the passive cues of the user, wherein potential viewing contexts include a first overview context wherein the most important portions of the content are displayed, and a detailed reading context wherein the content is displayed in its entirety, and provide the content for display in the determined viewing context.
- According to some examples, in identifying the most important portions of the content, the one or more processors are further configured to generate a library of words in the content, and assign an importance value to each word. The importance value may be based on at least one of a frequency of appearance of the word or subject matter of the content.
- Detecting the passive cues of the user may include detecting a speed at which the user is scrolling through the content. For example, the one or more processors may be further configured to assign a detailedness score based on the detected speed, wherein determining the viewing context is based at least in part on the detailedness score. Further, the one or more processors may be further configured to compute a visibility score based on the detailedness score and the identified most important portions. Detecting the passive cues of the user may alternatively or additionally include detecting gaze of the user.
- Determining the viewing context may include inferring an intent of the user based on the passive cues, and determining the viewing context based on the inferred intent. The potential viewing contexts may further include a second overview context, in which the most important portions of the content are displayed in their original form and remaining portions of the content are displayed with transparency.
- Yet another aspect of the disclosure provides a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions executable by one or more processors for performing a method of automatically displaying content in a context inferred based on passive user cues, including identifying most important portions of the content, detecting passive cues of the user, determining a viewing context based on the passive cues of the user, wherein potential viewing contexts include a first overview context wherein the most important portions of the content are displayed, and a detailed reading context wherein the content is displayed in its entirety, and providing the content for display in the determined viewing context.

FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method according to aspects of the disclosure. - The present disclosure provides a text display system that switches seamlessly between an overview mode and a detailed view mode, depending on passive signals from the user. Accordingly, users can switch between the overview and detailed context using interactions that they use naturally. When looking for interesting things to read, they can naturally scroll fast and be able to see only the important topics of the contents. This allows them to capture the gist of all of the contents, and also quickly find contents that they may be interested in reading further. When they slow down the scrolling, the content will be presented in its original form without highlighting, so the user will be able to consume the content in the true form that the author created. Since there is no active interaction required other than the natural scrolling that users would do anyway, there is no mental hurdle in switching between the overview and detailed contexts, allowing users to find and consume content quickly. In this manner, an improved ability for user to control the operation of the system may be provided; for example, control over the form in which content is displayed can be achieved without interrupting other functions (such as scrolling). The approach of the present disclosure is also well suited to allowing reversible changes between operating modes in response to changes in context.
- The system may include a content scorer, a context detector, and a user interface. The content scorer scores the relative importance of parts of each content, such as the importance of each word in a restaurant review text, or parts of a photo that show the central object of the photo. The user context detector classifies the intent of the user. For example, the context detector may determine whether the user wants to see the overview or the details of an individual content. The determination may be based on, for example, how quickly the user is scrolling through the content. The user interface displays the individual content with only the important parts highlighted when it is determined that the user wants to see the overview, and displays the individual content in its original form when the user is classified as wanting to see details.
- The content scorer may perform text scoring, such as by using term frequency—inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to generate a library of words mapped to their relative importance. Every word that appears in a text content may have a score based on how interesting it may be to a user. According to some examples, the score may be a numeric value, such as a number ranging from [0.0-1.0]. In another implementation, importance scores may be manually assigned to particular parts of the content. For example, where the content is a business review, details such as a username or image of the content author may be assigned a lower importance score so that they will be hidden when the user is skimming through content.
- The user context detector may map the scrolling speed at any point in time to a number representing the user's willingness to read individual details. For example, a scrolling speed of 0 dp/sec, where dp is a unit of measurement of distance on a display, may be linearly mapped to detailedness of 1, where 1 represents a maximum detailedness level. A scrolling speed of 30dp/sec, for example, may be mapped to detailedness of 0, where it would be inferred that the user only wants to see the overview of contents. Any scrolling speed between 0 dp/sec and 30 dp/sec may correlate to a level of detailedness based on a function.
- The user interface may emphasize important parts of the content, and de-emphasize non-important parts, when the detailedness score is low. In one implementation, all words may be classified as either important and not important. For example, the top 5% of words in the library may be defined to be important, and all else not important. All not important words may be made transparent based on the detailedness score, so that when the detailedness is 1, the transparency of not important words are at the level of the original content, whereas when the detailedness is 0, the not important words are fully transparent but important words are still fully visible.
- In addition to switching back and forth between overview and detailed view for text content, the same may be performed for other types of content, such as that including maps, graphs, charts, pictures, etc.

Theclient computing device 160 may also include a location determination system, such as aGPS 268. Other examples of location determination systems may determine location based on wireless access signal strength, images of geographic objects such as landmarks, semantic indicators such as light or noise level, etc. - Although the
client computing devices client computing device 160 may be a mobile phone or a device such as a wireless-enabled PDA, a tablet PC, a netbook, a smart watch, a head-mounted computing system, or any other device that is capable of obtaining information via the Internet. As an example the user may input information using a small keyboard, a keypad, microphone, using visual signals with a camera, or a touch screen. - As with
memory 230,storage system 140 can be of any type of computerized storage capable of storing information accessible by theserver computing devices 110, such as a hard-drive, memory card, ROM, RAM, DVD, CD-ROM, write-capable, and read-only memories. In addition,storage system 140 may include a distributed storage system where data is stored on a plurality of different storage devices which may be physically located at the same or different geographic locations.Storage system 140 may be connected to the computing devices via thenetwork 150 as shown inFIG. 1 and/or may be directly connected to any of thecomputing devices 110. -
Storage system 140 may store data, such as various types of content available for viewing on one of theclient devices storage system 140 may also store a library of words ranked by importance. The importance of each word in the library may vary based on the content in which it appears. For example, a word such as “service” may be ranked higher with respect to other words in a restaurant review than in a catalog of dinnerware and flatware. - According to some examples, the library of words may be stored in the
memory 230 as data. The data may also include a correlation of user cues to intended viewing context. For example, the data may include a correlation of scrolling speed, eye movement, or other natural/passive cues to a value. The values may be used to define the user's intent. For example, an intent to view content in a first overview mode may be defined by a first range of values, an intent to view the content in a second overview mode may by defined by a second range of values, and an intent to view the content in a detailed reading mode may be defined by a third range of values. - The one or
more processors 220 may perform one or more operations for displaying the content in the user's desired mode. According to some examples, theprocessor 262 in theclient device 160 may perform some or all of such operations. Such operations may include, for example, generating the library of words, with each word mapped to an importance value, and identifying the most important words for the content. The operations may further include detecting user natural/passive cues, such as scrolling speed, and inferring the user's intent based on the natural/passive cues. In this regard, though not shown, the system may further include a context detection unit. For example, the context detection unit may reside at either or both of theclient device 160 and theserver 110. The context detection unit may include the one ormore processors camera 267, GPS 368, user input 266, etc. Such unit may provide information as to an activity the user is performing, such as scrolling, walking, talking, riding a bike, or any other activity that may affect a speed at which the user can read. The viewing context may be determined based on the inferred intent, and the content may be provided for display in the determined viewing context. -
FIG. 3 illustrates screenshots of an example transition between adetailed reading context 300 and afirst overview context 400. While in this example the content relates to restaurant reviews, it should be understood that the techniques described herein may be applied to any types of content, including any content with text, images, graphics, etc. In each of thedetailed reading context 300 and thefirst overview context 400, the content displayed relates to content of the same web page available ataddress 304. For example, the web page may include a collection of search results or any other information. Thedetailed reading context 300 may be displayed if, for example, the user is not scrolling or is scrolling very slowly, at a pace indicating that the user is attempting to read each word. According to other examples thedetailed reading context 300 may be displayed based on detected eye movement of the user, such as eye movements indicating that the user is attempting to read all or most of the words. However, if the user begins scrolling quickly, such as with a brisk swipe up on a touchscreen, the display may automatically switch to thefirst overview context 400. While the same content is shown in thefirst overview context 400 for comparison to thedetailed reading context 300, the screen may actually be scrolling quickly, and therefore the content shown would move off the screen quickly and be replaced by new content. - In the
detailed reading context 300, all information of the web page in its authentic state is displayed. For example, as shown, such information includes aportion 302 of a previous review, and asection 310 of reviews related to “Restaurant C.”Such section 310 includes anoverall rating 312, which may be an average or other combination of individual ratings provided in individual reviews, and one ormore images 314, such as images of the restaurant, of food served at the restaurant, etc. In thesection 310 is also a plurality ofindividual reviews title 324, anidentification 326, such as a user name or the like, of the contributor, arating 322, and adescription 328. It should be understood that this is merely an example, and that other types of reviews or other types of content may have a different format. - In the
first overview context 400, only some portions of the content are displayed and the rest are transparent. In this example, the undisplayed portions are completely transparent, such that they are not visible, though in other examples they may be displayed with a different degree of transparency. Accordingly, in some examples, in the first overview context the most important portions of the context may be displayed while display of other portions of the content may be restricted partially or completely. - In the example of
FIG. 3 , the portions of the content displayed in thefirst overview context 400 include a number of words having a highest importance. For example, each word in the content may be ranked according to its importance, as further described below in connection withFIG. 6 . The words may be from different reviews 320-340, and a number of words selected from each review may be the same or different. For example, some reviews may not have any important words, and therefore no words for such review would be displayed in thefirst overview context 400. Moreover, the important words may be from any portion of the reviews. For example, thetitle 324 of thereview 320 is shown, but the titles for other reviews are not shown, because the words in such titles were of lower importance. - The total number of words displayed in the
first overview context 400 may depend on, for example, how quickly the user is scrolling or skim-reading the page. For example, if the user is scrolling through approximately 6 screens per second, and typical users can read approximately 60 words per second, then approximately 10 words may be displayed on each screen. While the images 31 andreview first overview context 400, in other example some images and graphics may be displayed. The display of graphics may depend on, for example, the type of content displayed, such as whether it is reviews, search results, news, etc., a composition of the content displayed, such as whether it is primarily images and graphics or primarily text, user defined settings, or any other information. -
FIG. 4 illustrates screenshots of an example transition between asecond overview context 500 and thefirst overview context 400. In thesecond overview context 500, for example, the words displayed in thefirst overview context 400 may be displayed in their normal state, while the remaining content is displayed with a degree of transparency. The transparency of such remaining content is at a lesser degree than that of thefirst overview context 400, where it is fully transparent. Rather, in thesecond overview context 500, the remaining content can be faintly seen. - The
second overview context 500 may be displayed if, for example, the user is scrolling slower than a maximum speed, for which thefirst overview context 400 would be displayed, but faster than a normal reading pace, for which the detailed reading context 300 (FIG. 3 ) would be displayed. According to some examples, the degree of transparency may be proportional to the scrolling speed or reading speed of the user. For example, the faster the user scrolls, the more transparent the remaining content may become. As the scrolling speed slows, the remaining content may become more visible. -
FIG. 5 illustrates screenshots of an example transition between thesecond overview context 500 and thedetailed reading context 300. Such transition may occur automatically, for example, when the user's scrolling slows down. While the same content is illustrated in each context for comparison, it should be understood that the content may actually move off the screen and be replaced by new content. - While the examples of
FIGS. 3-5 illustrate altering the transparency of less important words or features, on other examples visibility may be altered in other ways. For example, other attributes of styling, such as color, brightness, relative contrast to the background, bolding, font size, etc. may be used to alter the relative visibility of important words and features. -
FIG. 6 illustrates an example of the library of words ranked by importance. For example, every word that appears in a text content may have a score based on how interesting it may be to a user. The score may be based on any of a variety of parameters, such as frequency of appearance, field within the context in which it appears, subject matter of the content, etc. For example, text that appears within a user identifier field (e.g.,identifier 326 ofFIG. 3 ) may be attributed a lower importance than text that appears within a description field (e.g.,description 328 ofFIG. 3 ). Similarly, a title field (e.g.,title 324 ofFIG. 3 ) may be attributed greater importance. Further, where the subject matter of the content relates to restaurant review, such as inFIG. 3 , words of particular interest in such subject matter may be assigned a greater importance that they would in other subject matters. - According to some examples, term frequency—inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to generate a library of words mapped to their relative importance. The score may be a numeric value, such as a number ranging from [0.0-1.0], as shown in
FIG. 6 . In other examples, the score may be a numeric value in a different range, a percentage, a non-numeric value, or any other type of value. - In addition to or in the alternative to text, other information such as objects, images, graphics may also have an overview context and a detailed context. The elements shown in each context may be based on, for example, manual user input, computed scores, or other information. For example, scores may be based on machine learning input detecting portions of content most relevant to viewers. As an example of the different types of content, maps may show different contents depending on the user's required level of detail. When the user is panning a viewport of the map, the display may show only user interface elements that give an overview of the place. As an example, such elements may include the country name, large natural features like rivers and mountains, etc. When the user stops panning, the display may show more detailed labels, such as the city name, tourist attractions, restaurant names, etc. As another example of other types of content, for graphs in an overview context, only overall data may be shown, such as a trend graph of a scatter plot. In a detailed context, all other elements of the graph, such as the axis labels, individual data points, etc. may be shown. As yest another example type of content, photographs may also be altered in overview context as compared to detailed context. For example, in a gallery of photos, in the overview context, only the foreground object in the photo may be shown in color, while the background is shown in grayscale. In the detailed view, the full photograph may be shown in color.

FIG. 7 illustrates an examplecontext detection unit 700. Thecontext detection unit 700 may include, for example, the one or more processors of the client device and/or of one or more servers. According to some examples, it may also include input features of the client device, such as touch screen input, voice input, electronic connections to other devices, GPS location, accelerometer data, camera input, etc. - According to one example, the
context detection unit 700 may determine a user's desired context based on scrollingspeed 710. For example, any scrolling speed between 0 dp/sec and 30 dp/sec may correlate to a level of detailedness based on a function, such as: -
detailedness=max(0, 1−speed/30) - According to some examples, the function may have a non-zero intercept. For example, a scrolling speed up to some threshold, such as 5 dp/sec, may be deemed to have a detailedness level of 1, because users may scroll slowly while reading content, and still want to be in the detailed view. Such function may be, for example:
-
detailedness=max(0, min(1, 1−(speed−5)/30)) - This function may be computed across an averaged speed over some time, such as, by way of example only, 100ms. Because some scrolling may happen accidentally, such as if a user accidentally touches the screen of a smartphone, computing the averaged speed over time would reduce accidental scrolling. The function, with such averaging, may be:
-
detailedness=max(0, 1−avg[0<i<100](speed[t−i])/30) - The visibility of the words may be computed as a function of the detailedness. For example, a maximum detailedness score may produce maximum visibility, such as illustrated in the
detailed reading view 300 ofFIG. 3 . Conversely, a minimum detailedness score may produce minimum visibility of unimportant words or objects, such as shown in thefirst overview context 400 ofFIG. 4 . A detailedness score somewhere between the maximum and minimum may result in a context similar to thesecond overview context 500 ofFIG. 4 . For example, visibility may be computed as: -
visibility=if importance>=[threshold] then detailedness, else 0 - Accordingly to some other examples, visibility may be computed as a function of importance and detailedness to alter the text visibility:
- visibility =detailedness * importance
- Additionally or alternatively to using screen scrolling speed to infer the user's required detailedness, the
context detector 700 may determine the user's desired detailedness based on other natural cues, such as the user's reading speed, the user's activities, user-defined parameters, etc. For example, while performing certain activities, such as walking, talking, eating, etc., users may be less willing or able to view detailed content. Accordingly, as shown inFIG. 7 , thecontext detector 700 may detect when the user is performing such an activity, and the detailedness may be adjusted to show summarized content in an overview context accordingly. For example, thecontext detector 700 may detect a user'svoice input 730, or a wireless communication connection between the client device and anotherdevice 750. Such input may be used to infer a particular activity of the user. Other possible inputs, though not shown and by way of example only, may include accelerometer input, GPS input, gyroscope input, temperature input, light input, etc. When the user has halted the particular activity, the context view may return to the more detailed reading context. - In another implementation, the user's focus on the screen may be used to infer the desired context. For example, a camera or other device may detect movements of the user's
pupils 740, the user's head, or other movements that would indicate the user's gaze. A time during which the user's eyes are focusing on the screen may be used to compute the detailedness of contents shown to the user. As such, for example, users glancing at a phone may see a summary of an email they received, and then view the details by continuing to view the screen. In such examples, and any other example where the device may potentially capture other information of the user, the user will have the ability to authorize such input or disable such input. For example, the user may be required to enable access of a camera for capturing pupil or head movements of the user. - According to some examples, the
context detector 700 may also determine context based on user-defined parameters. For example, parameters for setting the visibility may be chosen so that, given a certain model of users' reading speed, users have enough time at their current scrolling speed to read all words visible on the screen. For example, if a typical user can read 3 words per second, and the scrolling speed is such that exactly one screen height's worth is scrolled in exactly one second, then visibility should be controlled such that about 3 most important words appear on the screen. The user may adjust the number of words appearing on one screen, for example, if the user is capable of reading faster or slower than the typical user. This ensures that at whatever scrolling speed, the users can keep reading at the same speed, and never have a situation where words scroll off before they're read by the user. - While a few example activities are illustrated in
FIG. 7 for use in detecting the user's desired viewing context, it should be understood that any of a variety of other possible activities may be used to infer the user's intent through natural cues. -
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method of automatically adapting a view of content based on an inferred reading ability of a user. The method may be performed by, for example, a client computing device and/or a server computing device. While the operations are illustrated and described in a particular order, it should be understood that an order of the operations may be varied. For example, some operations may be performed simultaneously. Further, operations may be added or omitted. - In
block 810, a library of important words is generated. For example, each word in the content may be assigned a score based on frequency of appearance, subject matter, or any other parameters. The scores may be, for example, numeric values or any other type of values differentiating the words. The scored words may be added to the library and ranked based on their scores. In examples where the content does not include words, such as in a gallery of pictures, it should be understood that this step may be omitted or modified based on important elements of the contents. - In
block 820, the most important words are identified. For example, the highest ranked words may be identified. The number of words identified may be based on, for example, a number of words on a page of the content and/or a user's ability to read the words while scrolling through the content. - In
block 830, passive cues of the user are detected. Such passive cues may include, for example, input that the user would naturally enter while reading content, such as scrolling, eye movement, etc. According to some examples, such passive cues may also include activities being performed by the user, such as walking, talking, etc. - In
block 840, user intent is inferred based on the passive cues. For example, the user intent may relate to an amount of visual content the user desires to receive. By way of example, of the user is quickly scrolling or only quickly glancing at the display before averting their focus, it may be inferred that the user only desires to get a general overview of the content available for display. Conversely, if the user is not scrolling or is focusing their gaze on the display, it may be inferred that the user wants to read the content in detail. - In
block 850, a viewing context is determined based on the inferred intent. For example, when it is determined that the user only desires an overview, then a first overview context may be selected, wherein only the words identified as most important are displayed in a position in which they would normally appear, while other words are removed or grayed or otherwise made less noticeable. If it is inferred that the user wants to see details, then a detailed reading context may be selected. Other contexts, such as a second overview context wherein less information is removed than in the first overview context, may also be selected based on the inferred user intent. Inblock 860, the content is provided for display in the determined viewing context. - The above techniques are advantageous in that users can switch between viewing the overall picture of contents, and detailed views of individual contents quickly without actively needing to express their context intent. They are able to view the overview within the context of the original content. For example, when they see the word awesome, they can slow down the scrolling to see what the author meant. They are able to view the contents in detail in the true form that they were given by the original author.
- Unless otherwise stated, the foregoing alternative examples are not mutually exclusive, but may be implemented in various combinations to achieve unique advantages. As these and other variations and combinations of the features discussed above can be utilized without departing from the subject matter defined by the claims, the foregoing description of the embodiments should be taken by way of illustration rather than by way of limitation of the subject matter defined by the claims. In addition, the provision of the examples described herein, as well as clauses phrased as “such as,” “including” and the like, should not be interpreted as limiting the subject matter of the claims to the specific examples; rather, the examples are intended to illustrate only one of many possible embodiments. Further, the same reference numbers in different drawings can identify the same or similar elements.
