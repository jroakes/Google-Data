Definitions
- This invention pertains to automated speech recognition. More particularly this invention pertains to speaker independent speech recognition suitable for varied background noise environments.
- HMM Hidden Markov Models
- spoken messages to be identified using a HMM ASR system are processed in such a manner as to extract feature vectors that characterize successive periods of the spoken message.
- a most likely sequence of the states of the HMM is determined in view of the transition probability for each transition in the sequence, the extracted feature vectors, and the a posteriori probabilities associated with the states.
- Background noise which predominates during pauses in speech, is also modeled by one or more states of the HMM model so that the ASR will properly identify pauses and not try to construe background noise as speech.
- ASR systems particularly those used in portable devices
- the characteristics of the background noise in the environment of the ASR system is not fixed. If an ASR system is trained in an acoustic environment where there is no background noise, or in an acoustic environment with one particular type of background noise, the system will be prone to making errors when operated in an environment with background noise of different type. Different background noise that is unfamiliar to the ASR system may be construed as parts of speech.

- a beginning state 140 A and an ending states 140 D are non-emitting which is to say that these states 140 A, 140 D are not associated with acoustic features.
- each phoneme HMM Between the beginning and ending states of each phoneme HMM are a number of acoustic emitting states (e.g., 140 B, 140 C). Although two are shown for the purpose of illustration, in practice there may be more than two emitting states in each phoneme model.
- Each emitting state of each phoneme HMM model (e.g., 140 ) is intended to correspond to an acoustically quasi stationary frame of a phoneme. Transitions between the states in each phoneme model are also governed by a transition probability matrix.
- the acoustic layer also includes an HMM model 156 for the absence of speech sounds that occur between speech sounds (e.g., between words, and between sentences).
- the model for the absence of speech sounds 156 (background sound model) 156 is intended to correspond to background noise which predominates in the absence of speech sounds.
- the background sound model 156 includes a first state 158 that is non-emitting, and a final state 160 that is non-emitting.
- An emitting state 146 is located between the first 158 and final 160 states. The emitting state 146 represents background sounds. As mentioned above a difficulty arises in ASR due to the fact that the background noise varies.

- Viterbi search method Various methods are know to persons of ordinary skill in the ASR art for finding a likely sequence of states without having to exhaustively evaluate the above equation for each possible sequence of states.
- One known method is the Viterbi search method.
- transitions from various phoneme states to the model for the absence of speech sounds are allowed. Such transitions often occur at the end of postulated words.
- a model used in the ASR preferably the model of non-speech background sounds is updated frequently while the ASR is in regular use.
- the model of non-speech background sounds is updated so as to better model current background sounds.
- the background sound is preferably measured in the absence of speech sounds, e.g., between words or sentences.
- the updating takes place during breaks of at least 600 milliseconds, e.g. breaks that occur between sentences.
- the detection of the absence of voiced sounds is premised on the assumption that speech sounds reaching the input 102 of the ASR system 100 have greater power than background sounds.
- the interruptions in speech sounds between sentences are detected by comparing the zero order DCT coefficient of each frame which represents the log energy of each frame to a threshold, and requiring that the zero order DCT coefficient remain below the threshold for a predetermined period. By requiring that the zero order DCT coefficient remain below the threshold it is possible to distinguish longer inter sentence breaks in speech sound from shorter intra sentence breaks.
- an absence of speech sounds is detected by comparing a weighted sum of DCT coefficients to a threshold value. The threshold may be set dynamically based on a running average of the power of the audio signal.
- An inter sentence pause detector 152 is coupled to the DCT 116 for receiving one or more of the coefficients output by the DCT for each frame.
- the inter-sentence pause detector receives the zero order DCT coefficient (log energy value) for each frame. If the zero order DCT, (Alternatively, a sum of DCT coefficients, or a weighted sum of the DCT coefficients) remains below a predetermined threshold value for a predetermined time and then goes above the threshold, the inter sentence pause detector 152 outputs a trigger signal.
- the predetermined time is set to be longer than the average of intra sentence pauses.
- the trigger signal is output at the end of long (inter sentence) pauses.
- adjustment of the non speech sound model is based on background sounds that occur near the end of inter sentence breaks in speech sound. Note that inter sentence pause detector 152 may be triggered after long breaks (e.g., 15 minutes) in speech sounds
- a comparer and updater 154 is coupled to the inter-sentence pause detector for receiving the trigger signal.
- the comparer and updater 154 also coupled to the second buffer 122 for receiving feature vectors.
- the comparer and updater 154 reads one or more feature vectors that were extracted from the end of the inter sentence pause from the second buffer 122 .
- more than one feature vector is read from the second buffer 122 and averaged together element by element to obtain a characteristic feature vector (CRV) that corresponds to at least a portion of the inter sentence pause.
- CRV characteristic feature vector
- a weighted sum of feature vectors from the inter sentence pause is used. Weights used in the weighted sum may be coefficients of a FIR low pass filter.
- the weighted sum may sum feature vectors extracted from multiple inter sentence pauses (excluding speech sounds between them).
- one feature vector extracted from the vicinity of the end of the inter sentence pause is used as the characteristic feature vector.
- a mean vector, from among a plurality mean vectors of one or more emitting states of the background sound model, that is closest to the characteristic feature vector is determined.
- the closest mean belongs to an nth mixture component of a jth state.
- Closeness is preferably judged by determining which mixture component assumes the highest value when evaluated using the characteristic feature vector.
- closeness is judged by determining which mean vector ⁇ jn yields the highest dot product with the characteristic feature vector.
- closeness is judged by evaluating the Euclidean vector norm distance between the characteristic feature vector and each mean vector ⁇ jn and determining which distance is smallest.
- the invention is not limited to any particular way of determining the closeness of the characteristic feature vector to the mean vectors ⁇ jn of the Gaussian mixture components. Once the closest mean vector is identified, the mixture component with which it is associated is altered so that it yields a higher a posteriori probability when evaluated with the characteristic feature vector.
- the system 100 will continue to update one or more of the means of the Gaussian mixtures of the non speech sound emitting state, so that the at least one component of the Gaussian mixtures better match the ambient noise.
- the ASR system 100 will be better able to identify background noise, and the likelihood of the ASR system 100 construing background noise 100 as a speech phoneme will be reduced.
- the recognition performance of the ASR system is improved.
- the ASR system 100 may be implemented in hardware or software or a combination of the two.

- process block 202 an HMM ASR process is run on an audio signal that includes speech and non speech background sounds.
- Block 202 is decision block that depends on whether a long pause in the speech component of the audio signal is detected. If a long pause is not detected then the process 200 loops back to block 204 and continues to run the HMM ASR process. If a long pause is detected, the process continues with process block 206 in which a characteristic feature vector that characterizes the audio signal during the long pause (i.e., characterizes the background sound) is extracted from the audio signal.
- process block 208 a particular mean of a multi-component Gaussian mixture that is used to model non speech background sounds that is closest to the characteristic feature vector extracted in block 206 is found.
- process block 210 the particular mean found in process block 208 is updated so that it is closer to the characteristic feature vector extracted in block 206 . From block 210 the process 200 loops back to block 202 .
