- FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating an eBook module 135 within a user device. Some embodiments of the module 135 have different and/or other modules than those described herein. Similarly, the functions can be distributed among the modules in accordance with other embodiments in a different manner than is described herein. As shown, the module 135 includes an ingestion module 310 , an interface module 320 , a history module 330 , a communication module 340 , and a data store 350 .
- the ingestion module 310 retrieves an eBook from the eBook source 110 or the eBook server 120 , and a user's navigation history for the eBook from the eBook server 120 .
- the eBook and navigation history are stored in the data store 350 .
- the content of an eBook may include, for example, raw text, formatting for raw text, images, video, audio, and interactive content.
- An example of interactive content are embedded links that allow a user to quickly navigate between distantly located navigation positions within the eBook. For example, an embedded link may allow for jumping between body text and a footnote, or from one page of the book to another distantly located page within the eBook.
- the content of an eBook is usually organized in some manner. This may be as simple as a page numbering scheme where each page of eBook content includes some amount of content. Other organizational schemes for organizing portions of the eBook are also possible, for example by word location, section, by chapter, etc. Each portion of an eBook (e.g., each item of content within the eBook) occurs at a particular navigation position within the eBook.
- the interface module 320 both presents the content of eBook on the user device 130 , and also provides an interface that allows a user to navigate to different navigation positions within the eBook.
- the interface provides a number of different input options to a user, and responds responsive to receiving inputs (or actions) from the user. Examples of actions include adjusting the presentation of the eBook (e.g., zoom state, font, etc.)
- a number of input options/actions correspond to navigation within the eBook.
- Navigation actions cause the interface to navigate to a different navigation position in the eBook and present the corresponding portion of the eBook. Examples of navigation actions include scrolling, presenting the next page, presenting the previous page, and interactions with embedded links that jump to a particular navigation position within the eBook. Some navigation actions involve multiple inputs from the user.
- One example includes presenting a table of contents and then navigating to the navigation position a selected one of the entries in the table of contents.
- Another example includes receiving a search query, presenting a set of search results matching the search query, and navigating to a navigation position of a selected one of the search results.
- the history module 330 generates a navigation history that provides another mechanism for navigating within the eBook.
- the navigation history generated by the history module 330 represents a list of navigation positions within the eBook that the user has previously navigated to using the interface.
- the history module 330 provides the navigation history to the interface module 330 for inclusion in the interface.
- the interface module 320 may present the navigation history, receive a selection action from a user regarding one of the navigation positions in the navigation history, and then subsequently navigate to and present the portion of the eBook corresponding to the selected navigation position.
- the history module 330 generates the navigation history by logging navigation positions from actions received by the interface module 330 through the interface.
- the navigation history is stored as a list in data store 350 .
- Each entry in the navigation history describes the navigation position that was navigated to in response to a received action.
- the navigation history may store the navigation position, the navigation action, or both. Further, the history module 330 may also store additional information. This information includes the time and/or date the navigation action took place, and the number of times a particular navigation position has been accessed. Other statistics may also be derived and stored based on this information, such as a frequency of access of a particular navigation position. This additional information is stored in the data store 350 as part of the navigation history.
- the history module 330 filters received navigation actions to determine a filtered list of received navigation actions are stored as part of the navigation history in the data store 350 . How navigation actions are filtered may vary by implementation. In one embodiment, the history module 330 applies filtering criteria to the navigation actions so that only particular types of navigation actions contribute navigation positions to the navigation history.
- the filtering criteria may include filtering out (i.e., remove and not store) particular types of navigation actions, and filtering out navigation actions based on the magnitude of the position change within the eBook from the user's current reading position.
- the history module 330 may use different and/or additional filtering criteria in other embodiments.
- the filtering criteria may remove previous page, next page, and scroll actions so that they are not stored in the navigation history because the user often performs such actions while reading the eBook at a normal pace.
- the filtering criteria may pass (i.e., store) some types of navigation actions because the user does not often perform such actions while reading the eBook at a normal pace, and/or because such actions access content related to the current reading position that the user may wish to return to in the future. Examples of actions that may be stored include embedded link actions, table of contents actions, query actions, and navigation history actions.
- the filtering criteria cause the history module 330 to pass (i.e., store) navigation actions that navigate to navigation positions a threshold distance away within the eBook from the user's current reading position.
- this threshold distance is based on the amount of text on a page of the eBook displayed by the user device 130 .
- history module 330 determines the distance between the current reading position and the navigated-to position, compares the distance to the threshold, and stores the navigation action if the distance exceeds the threshold.
- the history module 330 may also store the current reading position prior to a navigation action as a separate entry in the navigation history. Storing the current reading position prior to navigation is useful in assisting the user in getting back to a position that may not otherwise be listed in the navigation history. For example, if the user rapidly scrolls through 10 pages to reach a particular page, then interacts with a link that navigates the user to another position, the user's reading position prior to these navigation actions may get lost. Storing the current reading position in the navigation list prior to these navigations provides a convenient way for the reader to return to the current reading position.
- the history module 330 may rank the navigation positions in the navigation history.
- the ranking affects the order in which the entries in the navigation history are presented to the user by the interface.
- the ranking is based on the relative importance and/or usefulness of the navigation positions.
- the ranking may be performed using one or more ranking criteria, examples of which include recency of access and frequency of access. When the history module 330 ranks by recency of access/navigation, more recently accessed navigation positions appear before less recently accessed navigation positions, or vice versa. When the history module 330 ranks by frequency of access, more frequently accessed navigation positions appear before less frequently accessed navigation positions, or vice versa.
- the ranking may also be combination ranking that takes into account both recency and frequency of access and/or other criteria.
- the eBook module 135 includes user configurable preferences for determining the ranking used in presenting the navigation history.
- the navigation history may be cumulative over multiple reading sessions, or reset and created separately for each reading session.
- a separate navigation history is stored for each eBook and each user in one embodiment.
- the history module 330 logs the actions and their associated navigation positions responsive to their receipt at the interface, the resulting logging occurs automatically. No separate input is required to generate the navigation history.
- the navigation history avoids the problem of bookmarks which require separate affirmative action by the user prior to navigation away from a navigation position in order to be effective.
- the communication module 340 is an externally facing module configured to communicate navigation histories with the eBook server 120 .
- the communication module 340 may provide navigation histories generated on the user device 130 to the eBook server 120 .
- the communication module 340 may also receive navigation histories generated on the user device 130 or other devices from the eBook server 120 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 400 for providing a navigation history, according to one embodiment of the invention.
- Other embodiments can perform the steps of the process 400 in different orders.
- other embodiments can include different and/or additional steps than those described herein.
- the user device 130 receives actions through the interface to navigation to positions within the eBook.
- the user device 130 filters the received actions to determine which navigation positions are stored in a navigation history.
- the actions and corresponding navigation positions that pass the filtering are stored in a navigation history.
- the navigation positions in the navigation history are ranked using ranking criteria such as recency and frequency of access.
- the user device 130 presents the navigation history to the user.
- the user device 130 receives a request to navigate to a selected one of the navigation positions in the navigation history.
- the user device 130 presents a portion of the eBook corresponding to the selected navigation position.
- any reference to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.
- the appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
- the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion.
- a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus.
- “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).
