Definitions
- This specification relates generally to providing recommendations to users and to providing search results in response to search queries.
- a search engine receives search queries, for example, from one or more users and returns search results responsive to the queries.
- the search engine can optionally receive queries from and return search results to a computing resource, such as another search engine.
- the search engine can identify resources responsive to a search query, generate search results with information about the documents, and provide the search results in response to the query.
- resources include resources, such as web pages, videos, books, and sound files.
- Other types of search results for example, direct answers to questions posed by the user, or a summary of information responsive to the user's query, can also be provided.
- a system provides a customized experience for users for which the system lacks a detailed history of on-line behavior and interests, by identifying similar user types.
- a method includes storing a table mapping users to attributes; storing a second table mapping the users to products associated with a source domain; determining, using a processor of a computer system, a set of top scoring products for each of the attributes; creating, using the top scoring products, a model that is predictive of an activity in a target domain, the target domain being separate from the source domain; detecting a behavior from a particular user accessing the target domain; and generating a personalized prediction for the particular user based on the model, in response to the detecting the behavior.
- the users have activity in both the source domain and the target domain.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination with each other.
- the method may include determining that the particular user lacks recorded behavior in the target domain; determining that the particular user has recorded behavior in the source domain; generating the personalized prediction using the recorded behavior in the source domain; and providing the personalized prediction for the particular user.
- the products may include at least one of a video, a purchased product, a search query, or a suggested activity.
- the set of top scoring products may be limited to within a predetermined time period.
- the attributes may include demographics, clusters, or entities.
- Creating the model may be performed offline. Creating the model may be in response to detecting the activity in the target domain.
- a method includes determining users having a set of matching attributes; storing a set of products associated with a source domain and accessed by each of the users; determining a subset of the products corresponding to each attribute of the set of matching attributes; creating, using the subset of the products, a model that is predictive of an activity in a target domain, the target domain being separate from the source domain; determining that a particular user lacks recorded behavior in the source domain; in response to determining that the particular user lacks recorded behavior in the source domain, determining that the particular user has sufficient recorded behavior in a proxy domain, the proxy domain being separate from the source domain and having similar properties as the source domain; and in response to determining that the particular user has sufficient recorded behavior in the proxy domain, generating a personalized prediction for the particular user based on the sufficient recorded behavior in the proxy domain, using the model, the personalized prediction for the particular user being generated in response to the particular user performing the activity while accessing the target domain.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination with each other.
- the method may include accessing a first encrypted data store that maps users to attributes, and accessing a second encrypted data store that maps the users to products.
- the products may include at least one of a video, an item, a search query or a suggested activity.
- Creating the model may be performed offline.
- the method may include creating the model in response to detecting the activity in the target domain.
- the method may also include determining the users having the set of matching attributes based on encrypted tables including data from behaviors in multiple domains.
- the personalized content reflects the interests of the user.
- the system provides a customized and helpful experience to users in a product for which the system lacks a detailed history of online behavior and interests, but where detailed information about those users exists in another product (and for instances where users have consented to the use of such information).
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system.
- FIG. 2 is an example system that may be used to generate personalized content.
- FIG. 3 is an example user interface.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating personalized predictions.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating personalized predictions.
- FIG. 6 is an example of a generic computer device that may be used with techniques described here.
- FIG. 7 is an example of a generic computer device that may be used with techniques described here.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example search system 102.
- the search system 102 can be implemented on one or more computers that communicate, for example, through a network.
- the system receives queries 104 from a client device 106 and generates results 108 with summarized content that includes extracts from the referenced content.
- Each query 104 is an electronic communication such as an e- mail, post, text message, etc.
- the query 104 can be, for example, in text form or in other forms, for example, in audio form or in image form.
- a query 104 may be implicit and based on information gathered about a user with the user's consent.
- a system may make recommendations based on a user's identifier, a user context such as geographic location as well as other user data, or an explicit query by the user.
- the search system 102 and the client device 106 can communicate through a network, for example, an intranet or the Internet. While the search system 102 and the client device 106 are shown as two separate devices, in some
- the search system 102 and the client device 106 can be the same device.
- the search system 102 includes an indexing engine 110 and a ranking engine 112.
- the indexing engine 110 maintains an index 114 for use by the search system 102.
- the indexing engine 110 processes documents and updates index entries in the index 114, for example, using conventional or other indexing techniques.
- the search system 102 may maintain a user interest data store 120.
- the user interest data store 120 may include one or more entities (an "entity" may be a person, place, thing, or concept), websites, text, search queries, item purchase records, videos viewed, music played, demographic data, or other user interest information that may be used by search system 102.
- the user interest data store 120 may classify search queries by user, by frequency, by location, and by date or time, where the user consents to the use of such data.
- the user interest data store 120 may be included as part of index 114.
- the user interest data store 120 may be stored at a remote server.
- the ranking engine 112 may use the index 114 to identify documents responsive to the query 104, for example, using conventional or other information retrieval techniques.
- the ranking engine 112 calculates scores for the documents responsive to the queries, for example, using one or more ranking signals.
- Each signal provides information about the document itself or the relationship between the document and the message.
- One example signal is a measure of the overall quality of the document.
- Another example signal is a measure of the number of times terms of the query occur in the document.
- Other signals can also be used, such as measures of personalized content based on behavior in a source domain, as discussed in more detail below with respect to FIGs. 2-4.
- the ranking engine 112 ranks the responsive documents or portions of documents using the scores.
- the search system 102 uses the documents identified and scored by the ranking engine 112 to generate results 108.
- the results 108 include results corresponding to documents responsive to the query 104.
- a result can include a title of a document, a link to the document, and a summary of content from the document that is responsive to the query.
- results 108 include a summary of information responsive to the query. The summary can be generated from documents responsive to the query or from other sources.
- results 108 include personalized content such as suggested links, videos, music, or products, as discussed in more detail below.
- a "product” as referred to here may include a video, a web application, a standalone application, a website, a game, or any online activity.
- An “attribute” referred to here may include, as examples, a cluster (i.e., a group of users), an entity, or demographic information.
- a "domain” as described here may be a set of actions, activities, or data that a user can interact with in a particular system such as a website or an online application such as a web application.
- An activity or behavior in a domain may include, for example, search queries, requests, video searches or plays, music searches or plays, online product purchases (e.g., of books, clothing, songs, videos, or other items), mailing list subscriptions, etc., in the instances where users consent to the use of data associated with the activities or behaviors.
- a source domain may be a website and activity in the source domain may include web search behavior.
- a target domain may be another website, and the system may provide suggested movies or music for a user of the target domain.
- a user may input a query 104 for "beach vacations" in a target domain.
- the search system 102 may determine that the user who input the query 104 is a new or unidentified user of the target domain (e.g., the user is not logged-in to the target domain, the user lacks previous recorded behavior in the target domain, etc.).
- the system may also determine that the user has some behavior in the source domain, for example by searching various data stores, as described in more detail below with respect to FIGs. 2-5.
- the search system 102 may make recommendations, for example in the form "users who had attribute x tend to like in-product item y.” For example, “users in cluster XYZ tend to like videos about technology gadgets,” or “users with an interest in entity ABC tend to like vegetarian cookbooks.”
- the two example attributes above may be stored in user interest data store 120 (with the consent of the user), which may contain a summary of the user's activity across multiple domains.
- the system may determine that a new user in the target domain has no recorded behavior in the source domain, but does have sufficient activity available from a proxy domain (i.e., a domain with similar properties as the source domain).
- a proxy domain i.e., a domain with similar properties as the source domain.
- the proxy domain may be website that is a version of the target domain where a user is not logged in to a user account.
- the system may make personalized predictions based on the user's previous behavior in the proxy domain. For example, where users have consented to the use of such data, for users that have web history enabled, the system may build a model of how web page visits predict video searches or plays, music searches or plays, book purchases, products purchased, etc.
- the system may treat the logged out browsing history in the proxy domain as if it were logged in web history in a target domain, making recommendations based on visited pages, using the model.
- multiple source domains or proxy domains may be used for one or more target domains.
- the system may utilize a model, which is described in more detail below with respect to FIG. 2, to provide relevant and personalized results 108 to the user based on the query 104.
- the system may thus provide the user with a customized experience by identifying similar user types based on similar information about other (e.g., logged-in, identified) users.
- Other examples of results 108 generated by the search system 102 are described in more detail below with respect to FIGs. 2-5.
- FIG. 2 is an example system that may be used to generate personalized content.
- System 200 includes source domain data store 210, target domain data store 220, and proxy domain data store 240.
- the source domain data store 210 may include one or more tables (which may be encrypted), table 212 and table 214.
- table 212 includes a mapping of users to attributes. For example, as shown in table 212, user Ul is mapped to attributes Al and A2, user U2 is mapped to attributes Al and A3, and user U3 is mapped to attributes A4 and A5.
- Table 214 includes a mapping of users to products. For example, as shown in table 214, user Ul is mapped to products PI and P2, user U2 is mapped to products PI and P4, and user U3 is mapped to attributes P3 and P4.
- the products may come from recent activity within a predetermined time period, such as videos watched in the last week or products purchased in the last month.
- a user with multiple products may have multiple rows in the table 214.
- products may include suggested activity, such as suggested restaurants or stores to visit based on a user's geographic location, or a suggested flight, hotel, or reservation to reserve.
- the table 212 and the table 214 can be read from a data store such as source domain data store 210.
- the system 200 may generate a subset of products 216 using at least the data from source domain data store 210 (e.g., tables 212 and 214). For example, the system may combine the table 212 and table 214 (e.g., using a join procedure) to produce the subset of products 216 that contains a set of top scoring products for each attribute.
- the join may be designed to prevent privacy leaks by ensuring minimum thresholds for a number of users with an attribute and for a number of times an item is associated with an attribute before it can have a score. For example, in one implementation, the system may first join the tables.
- the system may count how many users have each attribute, how many users have each product, and how many users with a given attribute have a given product.
- the system may filter (e.g., remove) attributes applicable to fewer than a minimum number of users in a cluster (i.e., a group of users). For the remaining attributes, items that appear fewer than a minimum number of times are discarded.
- the system may score the remaining items for each attribute.
- the system may rank a predetermined number (e.g., 200) of top scoring items for each attribute and record the items (e.g., one item per attribute).
- the system may use the subset of products 216 to create a set of recommendations for a particular user on the basis of which attributes the particular user has.
- a recommendation may be generated dynamically, for example when the user accesses the target domain.
- the recommendations may be generated offline.
- the system may generate a model 222 using data from the subset of products 216 and using information from the target domain data store 220.
- the system may combine the table 212 (a table mapping users to attributes) with the table 214 (mapping users to products, for example in a particular client's id space, e.g. videos) to produce a set of top scoring products for each attribute.
- a user may have multiple attributes that have the same product, there may be different ways of assigning a score.
- One way is to choose a maximum score among all the attributes, as described in more detail below.
- Another option is to take the product of scores.
- the system may select the top scoring items (across all of a user's attributes) for each user (e.g., based on a user identifier).
- the generated table can then be loaded into any serving infrastructure.
- the system may use the model 222 to generate a personalized prediction 230 for a particular user.
- the system may generate the personalized prediction 230 offline, in some implementations, to pre-compute a set of candidates for a particular user (e.g., in target domain such as a video website homepage).
- the system may generate the personalized prediction 230 dynamically, e.g., in response to a query in the target domain such as an online application store.
- the system may determine that the particular user is a new user in the target domain that has no recorded behavior in the source domain (e.g., using source domain data store 210).
- the system may determine whether the particular user has any (or sufficient) recorded behavior in a proxy domain (a domain with similar properties to the source domain), for example using a proxy domain data store 240.
- the system may make a personalized prediction 230 based on the data from the user's behavior in the proxy domain, e.g., using the proxy domain data store 240.
- the system may also utilize the model 222 to make the personalized prediction along with the data from the proxy domain data store 240.
- the system in instances where users have consented to the use of such data, stores a summary of user interests and attributes, including assignments of users to clusters.
- User interests may be determined based on a variety of factors, such as search activity, video watching activity, entities provided by a user, or other information that is obtained with the consent of the user. Users can be assigned more than one cluster-id in a single model- instance.
- the system discards contain clusters assignments from a model-instance after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., one year). The system may periodically calculate assignments of users to a predetermined total number of clusters.
- the system may determine that users that are like Ben with respect to video play history tend to buy music by some artist, so the system may recommend that artist on Ben's online web store home screen.
- an "attribute" is an automatically inferred cluster.
- the system can assign a user to one or more clusters. To do so, the system may use k-means clustering or any other unsupervised clustering algorithm in some feature space derived from user histories, the cluster may be inferred from demographics, etc.
- a function f s maps users u to cluster identifiers c drawn from a set of domain-specific cluster identifiers C s
- f s u ⁇ c G C S ).
- function g maps users to set of outcomes associated with that user. These outcomes X t might be (in instances where the user has consent to the use of such data) video watches on a website, songs purchased in an online digital goods store, or even interests explicitly provided by a user.
- g t (u) may be empty.
- the system may estimate the likelihood that a generic user in cluster c has an item x. Formally, this is represented with a Bernoulli random variable
- This estimate is the (pseudocount-smoothed) fraction of users in cluster c which were observed to have outcome x.
- the most popular items may be so popular that they may dominate across all clusters.
- the system may downweight very popular recommendations to encourage diversity among the top recommendations for each cluster.
- the system may recommend items for a given user u.
- the system determines how likely it is the user to have each given item in X t , given that the user is in the set of clusters f s (u).
- the user may have enough data in the source domain to be assigned to a cluster in the source domain.
- the system may assign clusters based on data in the proxy domain.
- the likelihood a user should have the given item may be high if the user is in any cluster where users tend to have that item. For example, if a user is in a cluster of golf players and guitar players, the system may recommend videos popular among either kind of users in that cluster (golf players or guitar players).
- a Bernoulli random variable h u x G ⁇ 0,1 ⁇ may represent whether a user has an item. Items may be ranked by likelihood:
- the system can compute an empirical distribution over the outcomes in X t for all cluster identifiers C s in source channel s by counting the occurrence of each outcome across all users U t in the target domain t.
- o c,x ( ⁇ ueUt ⁇ ceCs ⁇ xeXt I[c e f s (u) A x e gt (u)])/
- the vector o c encodes the fraction of users in cluster c of source channel s that are associated with outcome x in target channel t.
- the system may add a pseudo-count value a E R + to these counts, and raise the result to a power ⁇ .
- This defines an empirical joint distribution of outcomes, P(x, c; ⁇ , ⁇ ), from which the system can compute marginal distributions over outcomes P(x; ⁇ , ⁇ ) and over clusters P(c; a, y).
- the temperature parameter ⁇ controls how peaked the resulting distribution is, dampening the impact of extremely popular items.
- the system may score each outcome with respect to its cluster in one of at least two methods.
- the score represents how likely a user is to be associated with outcome x given that the user is in cluster c. This score tends to be head-biased - popular items tend to get the highest scores, even if they are not over-represented in a cluster. As a result, the top scoring items do not always look particularly "representative" of a cluster.
- the system uses pointwise mutual information:
- the score represents (in bits) how much more or less likely is outcome x from users in cluster c than outcome x overall. These scores tend to favor items that are disproportionately represented in a given cluster. As a result, the top scoring items may tend to be very descriptive of what is unique about a cluster, even if those items are not particularly popular in the cluster.
- FIG. 3 is an example user interface.
- a system such as search system 102 may present a user interface 300.
- the particular user may type a query 310 into a search toolbar of a target domain.
- the system may respond with results in the form of a link 320, a link 330, and a link 340.
- the link 320, the link 330, and the link 340 may each be a personalized prediction for the user, such as the personalized prediction 230 which was described above with respect to FIG. 2.
- the search system 102 in the instance where a user consents to the use of such data, the search system 102 generates the personalized predictions automatically as the sender types the query 310. In other implementations, the system may generate the personalized predictions offline and present them to a user when the user visits a web page, even without the user entering a query in that web page.
- FIG. 4 a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating personalized predictions.
- the system can be, for example, search system 102 described above with reference to FIG. l, system 200 described above with respect to FIG. 2, or other systems.
- the system stores a table mapping users to attributes (410).
- the system may store an encrypted table such as table 212 shown in FIG. 2.
- the data in the table may be continually updated, with the consent of the users.
- the users may include users that have activity in both a source domain and a target domain (412).
- the attributes include demographics, products, or entities (414).
- the system stores a second table mapping the users to products associated with a source domain (420).
- the system may store an encrypted table such as table 214 shown in FIG. 2.
- the system determines a set of top scoring products for each of the attributes (430), e.g., using the tables.
- the system creates a model that is predictive of an activity in a target domain (440). For example, the system creates the model 222 shown in FIG. 2.
- the system may create the model offline (442), for example to pre-compute a set of candidates for a particular user of a video website.
- the system may create the model in response to detecting activity in the target domain (444).
- the system detects the activity by a new user in the target domain (450). For example, the system receives a search query for a topic, or a web page visit by the new user.
- the system generates a personalized prediction for the particular user based on the model, in response to detecting the behavior (460).
- FIG. 5 a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating personalized predictions.

- the system detects users with activity in both the source domain and the target domain (530).
- the system creates a model of a relationship of the behavior in the source domain with the behavior in the target domain (540).
- the system detects an activity by a user in the target domain (550).
- the system determines if the user has behavior in the source domain (552). If the user has behavior in the source domain (552, yes), the system generates a personalized prediction for the new user based on the model (554), and provides the personalized prediction to the user in response to the user performing the activity in the target domain (570).
- the system may provide personalized links, suggested videos or clothing, or specific advertisements that may interest the user.
- the system determines if the user has behavior in the proxy domain (560). If the user does not have sufficient recorded behavior in the proxy domain (560, no), the process may end. If the user has behavior in the proxy domain (560, yes), the system generates a personalized prediction for the user based on the behavior in the proxy domain (562). In some implementations, the system may also generate the personalized prediction using the model or using other data. The system provides the personalized prediction to the user in response to the user performing the activity in the target domain (570).
