Description
Technical field
The disclosure relates generally to radio communication, and relates more specifically to interference reduction and the control of the adjacent operational frequency bands in wireless communication system.
Background technology
In some wireless communication systems, adjacent channel or operational frequency bands drop in the duplexer filter RF passband or transition band of communication equipment, have caused the signal at equipment place to disturb.In Fig. 1, for example, between EUTRA Band 33TDD uplink/downlink (UL/DL) and EUTRA Band 1FDD UL, only there is the guard band of 5MHz.Between public safety (PS) arrowband (NB) down link (DL) frequency band and EUTRA Band 13FDD up link (UL), only there is the guard band of 2MHz.Similarly, depend on specific adjustment and UMTS extending bandwidth auction result, between Band 7FDD UL and Band 38TDD UL/DL, only have potentially the guard band of 5MHz.Therefore EUTRA UE transmission may disturb the public safety equipment or another EUTRAUE that in nearby frequency bands, operate to receive, or disturbs UMTS equipment etc.
Fig. 2 illustrates subscriber equipment (UE) transmission, and it adversely affects the common location UE operating in nearby frequency bands.For example, UE can be the EUTRA UE of another EUTRA UE of interference as discussed above or the UE that operates on public safety frequency bands.UE transmission depends on that to the interference of nearby frequency bands power output, transmitted bandwidth and the tranmitting frequency of UE are with respect to the position of nearby frequency bands conventionally.For example, use the control channel of the narrow band frequency resource realization of settling towards the edge of wideband frequency resource to trend towards disturbing nearby frequency bands, special under higher transmit power level.In EUTRA, PUCCH control channel is positioned near the opposite edges of wideband frequency resource or opposite edges place, diversity to be provided and to avoid the fragmentation for the resource block assignments space of data traffic transmission.More generally, interference in nearby frequency bands also may be caused by stray radiation, this stray radiation is owing to the frequency domain figure picture being generated by radio frequency (RF) damage, such as the unbalance defect of quadrature (I/Q), local oscillator leakage and the feedthrough of DC component and drop on the RF passband of duplexer filter or the associated intermodulation product in transition band (typically 3 rank, but other intermodulation rank are also possible).
Fig. 3 illustrates the spectral model that has the 10MHz EUTRA channel of 2MHz guard band (in Fig. 3 from-5 to-7MHz) about adjacent with 6MHz public safety frequency bands.The position of the 10MHz EUTRA channel shown in Fig. 3 is from-5MHz to 5MHz, and be positioned at-7MHz of public safety frequency bands is to-13MHz, has the guard band of the 2MHz from-5MHz to-7MHz.The 10MHz that approaches most public safety frequency bands by being positioned at has been shown in Fig. 3
Frequency spectrum or power spectral density (PSD) that near the edge of EUTRA channel, the transmission of 1 Resource Block (RB) (consisting of 12 adjacent subcarriers with the sub-carrier separation of 15kHz) of the maximum transmission power with 23dBm of (for example ,-4.5MHz transmission frequency) causes.The transmission at the maximum power place of 23dBm reduces (MPR) corresponding to the maximum power of 0dB.The local oscillator of suppose-30dB (LO) carrier feed (DC component) and I/Q are unbalance causes having near the I/Q image (be positioned at+4.5MHz) lower than the power of desired transmitting power 30dB.The LO that spectrum component between the I/Q image that near desired spectrum component (be positioned at-4.5MHz) and its be designated as " image is spuious " and desired has been shown in Fig. 3 and has been designated as " I/Q is spuious " leak or carrier feed between the spuious component of 3 rank intermodulation distortion.The PSD of the spuious component of 3 rank intermodulation distortion is the function of RB power, and the every increase of MPR 1dB, and it reduces 3dB.The spuious bandwidth of image is 3 times that desired RB distributes bandwidth, and for the 1RB distribution in Fig. 3 or the situation of 180kHz bandwidth, it is about 0.5MHz that desired RB distributes bandwidth.The LO being caused by 3 rank intermodulation or the spuious bandwidth of I/Q are less.The position of the spuious component of 3 rank intermodulation distortion is the function that distributes RB position, and its position depends on the RB skew at relative channel edge and changes.Can find out, in the situation that there is no duplexer filter, image and I/Q stray radiation are obvious.-30dBm/100kHz (20dBm/1MHz) stray radiation does not meet and is typically about-50 to-60dBm/100kHz UE and the UE target that coexists.Even in the situation that having typical duplexer filter, if stray radiation drops on the stopband (for 700MHz carrier frequency, it is typically arranged in 6MHz skew place) of RF filter, decay will only provide alleviation.In Fig. 3, be shown as from-duplexer filter stopband that 12MHz starts the possible limited decay (if any) of I/Q stray radiation component is only provided for the alleviation of image stray radiation.Therefore, may there is the obvious interference to adjacent public safety frequency bands DL frequency band (between (EUTRA UE) transmitter and (PS NB) receiver closely geographical approach), need in wireless communication system for the interference reduction of adjacent operational frequency bands and the technology of control.

In Fig. 4, wireless communication system 100 comprises one or more static infrastructures unit, and its formation is distributed in the network on geographic area.Base unit can also be called as access point, accesses terminal, infrastructure device, base station, Node-B, eNode-B, eNB or other terms used in the art.In Fig. 4, one or more base units 101 and 102 are served many remote units 103 and 110 in the coverage of community for example or cell sector.Remote unit can be fixed cell or mobile terminal.Remote unit can also be called as subscriber unit, mobile device, mobile radio station, user, terminal, subscriber station, subscriber equipment (UE), terminal or other terms used in the art.
In Fig. 4, conventionally base unit 101 and 102 in time domain and/or frequency domain transmit downlink communication signals 104 and 105 to serve remote unit.Remote unit 103 is communicated by letter with one or more base units with 113 via uplink communication signal 106 with 110.One or more base units can comprise for one or more transmitters of down link and ul transmissions and one or more receiver.Remote unit also can comprise one or more transmitters and one or more receiver.Base unit is a part for radio access network normally, and this radio access network comprises the one or more controllers that are coupled to communicatedly one or more corresponding base units.Access network is coupled to one or more core networks conventionally communicatedly, and described core network can be coupled to other networks, as the Internet and PSTN (except other things).These and other elements of not shown access and core network, but they are normally known for those of ordinary skill in the art.
In one implementation, the exploitation of the Long Term Evolution scheme (LTE) of wireless communication system and 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) agreement (EUTRA) is compatible, wherein base station is used OFDM (OFDM) modulation scheme to launch on down link, and user terminal is used single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) scheme to launch in up link.Yet more generally, wireless communication system can be realized certain other opening or privately owned communication protocol.The disclosure is not intended to be limited to the realization of any specific wireless communication system architecture or agreement.System can also comprise a more than adjacent or overlapping system, and each adjacent or overlapping system is realized different wireless communication protocols (for example, RUTRA) and public safety communication agreement.
In Fig. 5, wireless communication infrastructure entity 500 comprises communicatedly the transceiver 510 with controller 520 couplings, for the one or more communications of user equipment with its overlay area.Controller is typically implemented as the software of storage in memory 530 and/or the digital processing unit that firmware is controlled.Therefore controller is configured to by software/firmware: carry out various functions.Yet alternatively, controller may be implemented as the combination of hardware equivalent apparatus or hardware and software.Base unit comprises scheduler function 521, for as below more fully discussed to UE Resources allocation.In one embodiment, wireless communication infrastructure entity is corresponding to one in the base unit of Fig. 4.
In some systems of for example EUTRA protocol system, base unit operation dispatching function, it is included as data and controls allocation of communications time and/or frequency resource.In EUTRA system, scheduler divides and is used in the uplink control channel that transmits hybrid ARQ feedback (ACK/NACK), channel-quality feedback (CQI), order designator (RI), precoding matrix indicators (PMI) (except other information) to one or more UE.In other system, other control informations can transmit on uplink control channel.In EUTRA system, the uplink control information upper transmission of line link channel (PUCCH) physically.More generally, uplink control information can transmit on certain other channel.In EUTRA, for example, control information is the upper transmission of line link shared channel (PUSCH) physically also.In EUTRA, a plurality of subscriber equipmenies that PUCCH is suitable for communicating by letter in wireless communication system with PUSCH carry out ul transmissions simultaneously.In EUTRA, in the time of such, communication is what the orthogonal coding of the uplink communication launch by UE was realized.
PUCCH is used the narrow band frequency resource in wideband frequency resource to realize, and wherein PUCCH is included in a pair of uplink control channel separating in wideband frequency resource.PUSCH can carry out similar configuration.Other uplink control channels that use in other wireless protocols can carry out similar configuration.By this uplink control channel to being placed in the opposite edges place of wideband frequency resource or diversity being provided near it and having avoided the fragmentation in resource block assignments space.The fragmentation that reduces this space allows continuous resource block assignments to single UE to support relatively high data rate.In some implementations, by frame one by one by UE alternately assignment to one in the control channel at the opposite edges place of frequency band, realized diversity.
According to an aspect of the present disclosure, in order to reduce frequency band, disturb outward, near the uplink control channel edge of wideband frequency resource can be arranged as again away from edge and towards the mid portion of frequency band, and/or Power Limitation can be applied to the UE launching on uplink control channel.Again settling of control channel can be that static, semi-static (i.e. regularly adjustment) or its can for example dynamically be carried out based on UE.The transmission power limit that for example maximum power that is applied to the UE launching on uplink control channel reduces (MPR) conventionally be take and minute is used in for example frequency of uplink control channel and the narrow band frequency resource of bandwidth is condition.The UE launching under high power may cause disturbing, and this interference occurs conventionally near cell edge place or its, while away from the channel condition of cell edge, also may draw higher transmitting power.Therefore great community may make to disturb aggravation relatively.Below further discussed for making these and other schemes of uplink control channel skew.
Fig. 6 illustrates the uplink control channel at the opposite edges place that is positioned at frequency band to (PUCCH region 1 and region 2), and it is for the position of PUCCH appointment under current EUTRA standard.For purposes of illustration, (4) Physical Resource Block (PRB) of the forth day of a lunar month of supposing PUCCH region 1 can not for example, be realized maximum power in the situation of not disturbing nearby frequency bands (, as illustrated in Figure 6 public safety frequency bands).In order to reduce this interference, PUCCH region 1 can the mid portion skew towards frequency band away from band edge.In Fig. 6, PUCCH region 1 is displaced to enough the position in alternative P UCCH region 1 far away, makes not exist the transmission power limit (0dBm MPR) being applied on UE.In PUCCH region 2, do not disturb under the hypothesis of any nearby frequency bands, PUCCH region 2 is not offset.But more generally, PUCCH region 2 also can be towards the mid portion skew of frequency band.PUCCH region 1 and 2 skew can be identical or different.
In one embodiment, according to the number of the Resource Block of the whole resource area skew of PUCCH, carry out the skew of specific uplink control channel.In EUTRA, according to the system variable that comprises the business etc. of UE number, each UE, come allocated resource region and come computational resource region by network.Therefore in Fig. 6, whole PUCCH region 1 is offset 13 Resource Block.In alternate embodiment, the numbering of the Resource Block in the resource area of the PUCHH starting according to the assignment of control channel resource or distribution is carried out the skew of specific uplink control channel.Than 4 Resource Block associated with PUCCH region 1 and 2 in Fig. 6, in Fig. 7, for example, PUCCH region 1 and 2 comprises approximately 18 Resource Block.Therefore in Fig. 7, control channel assignment can be carried out in any Resource Block in region 1 and 2.According to this alternate embodiment, assignment where the starting in region of skew indicator control channel resource.For example, in Fig. 7, the first assignment control channel resource in region 1 is PRB14.According to another alternate embodiment, skew is corresponding to the skew of PUCCH numbering.Each UE is assigned the PUCCH occurring in the PRB in being designated as shown in Figure 7 each PUCCH region that PUCCH PRB is right (PUCCH region 1 and 2 as shown in Figure 7).The specific PUCCH form of supporting according to PUCCH PRB centering, each PUCCH PRB is to supporting certain maximum numbering of PUCCH.PUCCH numbering starts from the PUCCH PRB in PUCCH region.According to supported PUCCH form, PUCCH PRB can have up to 12 or 18 PUCCH, makes a PUCCHPRB will have for example PUCCH#1 to #18.Each PUCCH PRB subsequently in PUCCH region is proceeded to PUCCH numbering.
In Fig. 7, PUCCH region can have than the more PUCCH PRB of actual number that is assigned the PUCCH PRB of PUCCH.This is called as to supply more than the planned quota answers (over provisioning).In this case, for UE PUCCH assignment, i.e. the minimum channel number of the PUCCH assignment of UE continuous dispatching may be skipped initial J11 channel in PUCCH region and be started in channel number place corresponding to further going deep into the PRB in PUCCH region and skipping thus initial K11 PRB in PUCCH region.Suppose that each PUCCH PRB is to supporting 18 PUCCH, for example, for the PUCCH numbering that is only assigned > J11, J11=K11 * 18 wherein, mean corresponding to each PUCCH of the PUCCH numbering of its assignment and will appear in numbering K11+1 in PUCCH region or larger PRB.Suppose that PUCCH region has identical scale and uses identical PUCCH numbering plan aspect PRB, the UE that is assigned PUCCH numbering can determine its PUCCH resides in which PRB in arbitrary PUCCH region.In an embodiment of the present invention, in each PUCCH region, use different PUCCH numbering skews, PUCCH can be mapped to from it and form the set of PRB arbitrarily each PRB region that PUCCH PRB is right, as shown in Figure 7.For example, in PUCCH region 1, PUCCH numbering i1 is provided by i1=j+J1*NPUCCH_PER_PRB, the skew of PUCCH numbering is J1*NPUCCH_PER_PRB, and in PUCCH region 2, PUCCH numbering i2 is provided by i2=j+J2*NPUCCH_PER_PRB, and the skew of PUCCH numbering is J2*NPUCCH_PER_PRB.The scope that it should be noted that j is from 0 to maximum _ PUCCH_ signal _ numbering-1.
In alternate embodiment, J1 has provided the PRB skew with respect to the edge PRB in PUCCH region 1 to the PRB in PUCCH region 1, wherein PUCCH numbering starts from being designated as in this example the PRB of the PRB in PUCCH region 1, and J2 has provided the PRB skew with respect to the edge PRB in PUCCH region 2 to the PRB in PUCCH region 2, and wherein PUCCH numbering starts from being designated as in this example the PRB of the PRB in PUCCH region 2.
In such embodiment of most of or all permission PUCCH resources skew (comprising the situation of answering of supplying more than the planned quota), make network to transmit in untapped frequency resource and to initiate uplink data transmission at PUCCH.And, although in the description of embodiment, skew normally defines with respect to band edge, but can use other skews such as another any reference with respect to such as center or any other predefined reference, and they are equal in function.
In another embodiment, uplink control channel also comprises the 3rd uplink control channel, its outmost uplink control channel between wideband frequency resource in.In Fig. 6, the 3rd control channel resource can the resource block regions between the PUCCH region 1 and 2 of the nearby frequency bands away from being interfered in.Control channel resource between the use of the 3rd control channel resource provide to the flexibility of UE assignment the 3rd control channel of launching with higher-wattage for scheduler, if or need, meet such as extraradial certain other criterions of excessive frequency band.
According to another embodiment of the present invention, by changing uplink control channel feedback model, can change the position of uplink control channel.In EUTRA system, for example, feedback model can become PUSCH feedback model from PUCCH feedback model.In other words, the feedback information conventionally transmitting on PUCCH can transmit on PUSCH.Pattern changes and can trigger based on various conditions.For example, except other conditions, when the CQI report indication CQI sending on PUCCH has dropped to assign thresholds when following or risen to threshold value when above when the transmit power level of the estimation of UE, can trigger from PUCCH feedback model and become PUSCH feedback model.In one implementation, when dispatching CQI/PMI/RI on not to the assigned PUSCH resource of the adverse effect of nearby frequency bands, can notify UE pattern to change to stop using for reporting the PUCCH resource of CQI, PMI and RI and using as an alternative MPR+RBA mapping with signal form.In another embodiment, when the CQI report indication CQI sending on PUCCH has dropped to assign thresholds when following or risen to threshold value when above when the transmit power level of the UE of estimation, UE continues to report CQI on PUCCH, but with the through-put power reducing, reports on the PUCCH PRB adjacent with public safety frequency bands.When this occurs, also will dispatch UE to report CQI/PMI/RI on PUSCH, wherein PUCCH and PUSCH feedback transmission can be carried out soft combination subsequently.
Through-put power can also be reduced to be applied to that UE is upper disturbs preventing or to reduce frequency band outward.In Fig. 6, for example, show and need the maximum power of 6dBm to reduce (MPR) to reduce fully the frequency band external radiation interference on public safety frequency bands.In this example, control channel is not offset.It is condition that the MPR that is applied to the UE launching on uplink control channel be take the frequency and the bandwidth that minute are used in uplink control channel conventionally.Form in Fig. 8 illustrates exemplary relation.Especially, this form illustrates about specific allocated length (PRB) and corresponding maximum power and reduces the smallest offset in the Resource Block (PRB) of (MPR).For example, for the control channel length between 11-30PRB, for 20MPR, smallest offset is 14PRB.In one implementation, use the bit field in system information block (SIB) message to enable or forbid MPR.
The position that the wireless communication infrastructure entity of using narrow band frequency resource in wideband frequency resource to realize for example EUTRA base station in the wireless communication system of uplink control channel transmits the uplink control channel in wideband frequency resources to one or more UE changes.In Fig. 5, for example, 522 pairs of controllers of shift signaling function are configured, and so that transceiver 510 is with signal form, the position to the uplink control channel in the notification of user equipment wideband frequency resource of communicating by letter with wireless communication infrastructure entity changes.As proposed, by indication according to one or two Physical Resource Block of scheduling uplink control channel centering with respect to the skew of reference position, can notify the position of control channel to change with signal form.In one embodiment, UE priori known reference position.For example, reference position can be the acquiescence PUCCH position of EUTRA protocol specification appointment.Alternatively, can in signaling, provide reference position.
Conventionally, as discussed above, mode that must be consistent according to the mode with definition skew transmits skew.For example, in the situation that adopt control channel resource between the 3rd control channel resource, can to UE notice or assignment UE, use the 3rd control channel or the 3rd control channel and of control channel resource centering only with signal form.The 3rd control channel provides to the flexibility of UE assignment the 3rd control channel of launching with higher-wattage to scheduler.For example, scheduler can be to assignment high power subscriber equipment of the 3rd uplink control channel and uplink control channel centering and near the relative lower powered subscriber equipment of paired control channel assignment band edge.In Fig. 5, scheduler 521 can be carried out this function.In Fig. 5, controller also comprises that pattern changes function 524 so that transceiver changes the position with signal form notice control channel while changing between PUCCH feedback model and PUSCH feedback model.Controller also comprises power reduction control function, for as discussed above, based on control channel, distributes to determine that for example the power of MPR is controlled.Therefore these and other functions of base station described herein are carried out by the controller based on software/firmware.
In substituting realization, user terminal is configured to: when in the situation that do not come signaling that the position of the indication uplink control channel of automatic network changes be tuned to during arrowband uplink control channel in different wideband frequency resource, make at least one skew in paired arrowband uplink control channel.Therefore for example, wireless communication user terminal comprises the controller that is coupled to communicatedly transceiver, its middle controller is configured to: by transceiver be tuned to launch on arrowband uplink control channel in wideband frequency resource, and when be tuned to make at least one skew in paired arrowband uplink control channel during arrowband uplink control channel in different wideband frequency resource.In one implementation, wireless communication user terminal is EUTRA UE, uplink control channel is PUCCH, and controller is configured to: when be tuned to during the uplink control channel frequency band 13 (Band 13) of EUTRA appointment, make at least one skew in paired arrowband uplink control channel.
Although according to setting up ownership and making those of ordinary skill in the art can manufacture and use mode of the present disclosure to describe the disclosure and optimal mode thereof, but be to be understood that and recognize, there is the equivalent of exemplary embodiment disclosed herein, and in the situation that not departing from scope and spirit of the present invention, can it be modified and be changed, scope and spirit of the present invention should not limited by exemplary embodiment but should be defined by the claims.
