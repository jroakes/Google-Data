Phase-shift keying (PSK) (QPSK) is repeated once.
Once the host-processor 102 of supervision equipment 100 has been completed data structure 105, just by the data structure
(for example, in the form of a table) is provided to radio controller 104.Then radio controller 104 is able to use the data structure
To determine the current delivering power (for example, current delivering power of radio controller 110) of reporting device 106.For example, once
The table is completed in mode described above and (is dropped to minimum power from maximum power), and radio controller 104 just will be considered to
The current delivering power of reporting device 106 is -5dBm (last line of table 1).If radio controller 104 is to wireless electric-controlled
Device 110 processed issues power control command-for example, power is increased 2 strides, then radio controller 104 is thought currently to transmit
Power is 5dBm (the second row of table 1).
Host-processor 102 also provides trigger condition to radio controller 104 (or low-power processor 111), wirelessly
Electric controller 104 (or low-power processor 111) stores it in data structure 115.The trigger condition can be with many sides

Trigger condition executes movement as shown in table 2 (for example, wake-up master processor 102) in the case where being satisfied.
In one embodiment, host-processor 102 loses for each of distance set apart from precalculated path.
Then host-processor 102 is provided to radio controller 104 for the path loss values as trigger point.For example, supervision equipment
Path loss between 100 and reporting device 106 can be expressed as
Path loss=20log10(d)+20log10(f)–27.6
Wherein, d is the distance between two equipment (as unit of rice), and f is that the frequency of wireless signal (is with megahertz
Unit).In this embodiment, equation more than 102 use of host-processor is directed to multiple distances-such as 3m, 10m and 30m-
Calculate path loss.Radio controller 104 utilizes path loss values amplification data structure 115.Table 2, which is shown, to be precalculated
