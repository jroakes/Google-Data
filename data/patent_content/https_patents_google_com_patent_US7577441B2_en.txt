Definitions
- LCS Location Services
- LCS features that display location coordinates on a device are useful, for example, to device users who need to know where they are located relative to geographic map coordinates.
- LCS features can enable a device user to initiate a location request where the device acts as a Global Positioning System (GPS) terminal.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- location requests may be initiated by third parties and transmitted to a device over a wireless network. Such third party requests are useful in various circumstances.
- a “user plane” means that assistance data and positioning data are transmitted between the device and the location platform over a conventional wireless communication channel such as a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) channel.
- GPRS General Packet Radio Service
- User plane communications are thus distinguished from control plane communications where assistance data and positioning data are transmitted between a device and a location platform over a separate signaling channel in a network.
- the device and the location platform Before a portable electronic device can utilize the location services of a location platform, the device and the location platform generally are mutually authenticated. Such mutual authentication can include obtaining authentication data, such as shared keys, from a particular domain.
- locating technologies include short-range wireless based locating technologies that measure parameters of a wireless local area network (WLAN), such as a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or a time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter. Still other locating technologies include other hybrid approaches that employ a combination of satellite based, cell based, and short-range wireless based locating technologies.
- WLAN wireless local area network
- RSSI received signal strength indicator
- TDOA time difference of arrival
- the various above described locating technologies and LCS applications can consume a significant amount of power and processing resources of a portable electronic device such as a mobile telephone. Acquiring location information such as geographic coordinates, and performing ancillary processes such as mutual authentication, consumes device battery power and employs processor resources that may cause other processor intensive applications of a device to be slowed down. Further, frequent transmission of such messages contributes to network congestion and can reduce network bandwidth for all network users.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a network in which a mobile telephone interacts with a variety of locating technology systems, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of updating a positioning method priority list (PMPL) based on positioning method priority information received from a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag in a mobile telephone, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- PMPL positioning method priority list
- RFID radio frequency identification
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for iteratively determining whether any positioning method identified in a positioning method priority list satisfies quality of position (QOP) parameters identified in a positioning request for location services (LCS), according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- QOP quality of position
- the present invention is a method for determining a position of a portable electronic device.
- the method includes detecting at a portable electronic device a first signal received from a local terminal.
- a second signal is transmitted from the device, indicating a proximity of the portable electronic device to the local terminal.
- Positioning method priority information which is based on a location of the local terminal and is received from the local terminal in response to the second signal, is then processed at the device.
- a positioning method priority list based on the positioning method priority information is then processed.
- the position of the portable electronic device is determined using a positioning method identified in the positioning method priority list.
- Some embodiments of the present invention therefore enable a portable electronic device to prioritize available positioning methods based on current circumstances or locations of the device, but without requiring the device to actually execute any of the positioning methods identified in a positioning method priority list. Then only one or more positioning methods, which are assigned a high priority level in the positioning method priority list, are executed in order to determine the position of the device. That can significantly conserve battery power and processor resources of the device, because positioning methods assigned a lower priority do not need to be executed and tested in order to determine that they should be assigned a low priority. Rather, the positioning method priority information is received directly from a local terminal, such as a radio frequency identification (RFID) card read/write terminal, that is in proximity to the portable electronic device.
- RFID radio frequency identification
- the processor 103 also includes an encoder/decoder 111 with an associated code Read Only Memory (ROM) 112 for storing data for encoding and decoding voice or other signals that may be transmitted or received by the mobile telephone 100 .
- the processor 103 further includes a microprocessor 113 coupled, by the common data and address bus 117 , to the encoder/decoder 111 , a character Read Only Memory (ROM) 114 , a Random Access Memory (RAM) 104 , programmable memory 116 and a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) interface 118 .
- ROM Read Only Memory
- RAM Random Access Memory
- SIM Subscriber Identity Module
- the radio frequency communications unit 102 is a combined receiver and transmitter having a common antenna 107 .
- the communications unit 102 has a cell transceiver 108 coupled to the antenna 107 via a radio frequency amplifier 109 .
- the cell transceiver 108 is also coupled to a combined modulator/demodulator 110 that is coupled to the encoder/decoder 111 .
- the cell transceiver 108 can be adapted for use with wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), global system for mobile (GSM), or general packet radio service (GPRS) cell based communications.
- WCDMA wideband code division multiple access
- GSM global system for mobile
- GPRS general packet radio service
- Other transceivers also can be included in the radio frequency communications unit 102 for use with other radio communication systems such as the global positioning system (GPS), BluetoothTM systems, and wireless local area network (WLAN) systems.
- GPS global positioning system
- WLAN wireless local area network
- the microprocessor 113 has ports for coupling to the keypad 106 and to the display screen 105 .
- the microprocessor 113 further has ports for coupling to an alert module 115 that typically contains an alert speaker, vibrator motor and associated drivers; to a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag 119 ; to a microphone 120 ; and to a communications speaker 122 .
- the character ROM 114 stores code for decoding or encoding data such as text messages that may be received by the communications unit 102 .
- the character ROM 114 , the programmable memory 116 , or a SIM also can store operating code (OC) for the microprocessor 113 and code for performing functions associated with the mobile telephone 100 .
- the programmable memory 116 can comprise location services computer readable program code components 125 configured to cause execution of a method for determining a position of the mobile telephone 100 , according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- a diagram illustrates a network 200 in which the mobile telephone 100 interacts with a variety of locating technology systems, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- the location services program code components 125 can define a positioning service provider (PSP) module 205 that interacts with the cell transceiver 108 , a GPS transceiver 210 , a BluetoothTM transceiver 215 , and a WLAN transceiver 220 .
- PSP positioning service provider
- the GPS transceiver 210 can wirelessly connect to a GPS satellite 225
- the BluetoothTM transceiver 215 can wirelessly connect to other BluetoothTM devices such as a GPS device 230 in a car navigation system, or a base transceiver (BT) at an access point (AP) 235 .
- the cell transceiver 108 can wirelessly connect to a network cell 240
- the WLAN transceiver 220 can wirelessly connect to a WLAN AP 245 .
- a local terminal such as an RFID reader/writer 255 provides positioning method priority information directly to the mobile telephone 100 . Therefore the mobile telephone 100 can determine immediately which positioning method is appropriate in a given circumstance or location without executing any positioning method identified in a positioning method priority list.
- the PMPL 265 can prioritise various positioning methods such as satellite based, cell based, short range wireless based, radio frequency identification based, and hybrid positioning methods.
- the positioning service provider (PSP) module 205 can then obtain a preferred positioning method from the PMS module 260 and activate an appropriate transceiver such as one of the transceivers 108 , 210 , 215 , or 220 .
- the RFID reader/writer 255 can be associated with an electronic lock to a building, such as a home or office.
- the RFID tag 119 in the mobile telephone 100 then can function as an electronic key.
- the RFID tag 119 communicates with the RFID reader/writer 255 .
- a preferred location technology may be accessed through the WLAN network 245 using the WLAN transceiver 220 . Therefore, each time the user enters the building the RFID reader/writer 225 transmits positioning method priority information to the RFID tag 119 that identifies use of the WLAN transceiver 220 as the most preferred positioning method.
- Still other examples include placing the RFID reader/writer 255 in public locations such as bus stations, train stations, concert halls, shopping centers, and various public buildings.
- the RFID reader/writer 255 then can be programmed to identify a single preferred positioning method, or a ranked list of a plurality of positioning methods, appropriate for that particular public location.
- the RFID reader/writer 255 transmits the appropriate positioning method priority information to the electronic device, such as to the RFID tag 119 .
- the positioning method priority list can be changed to a default priority list after the expiration of a predetermined time period.
- the location services program code components 125 can further define a default priority list (DPL) 270 that defines a positioning method priority list for use when no other suitable priority list is identified.
- DPL default priority list
- the positioning method selector (PMS) 260 can set a timer when the positioning method priority list (PMPL) 265 is changed. If a further update to the PMPL 265 is not processed before expiration of the timer, then the PMPL 265 is reset to the DPL 270 .
- a positioning method database (PMDB) 275 can be used to store effective time periods and other attributes associated with various positioning methods.
- a location application module 280 can be used to process requests for location services (LCS) from various sources.
- requests can include mobile terminated location requests (MTLRs), network initiated location requests (NILRs), or mobile originated location requests (MOLRs).
- MTLRs are location requests that are initiated by another network user, such as other mobile stations, websites or information services.
- NILRs are location requests that are received from a mobile network where the network is not requesting verification or notification.
- NILRs are used for locating mobile stations for emergency or law-enforcement purposes.
- MOLRs are location requests that originate from the mobile telephone 100 itself, such as when a user of the mobile telephone 100 requests his or her location.
- a flow diagram illustrates a method 300 of updating the positioning method priority list (PMPL) 265 based on positioning method priority information received from the RFID tag 119 , according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- the PSP 205 copies data from the DPL 270 to the PMPL 265 .
- a search for a priority list associated with the attribute is performed. For example, databases provided on the Internet by LCS providers, or by owners of the RFID reader/writer 255 , such as rail station companies or facility management companies, can be searched to obtain a priority list. Then at step 325 it is determined whether a priority list was found. If not, at step 330 a TMP_PRIORITY field is assigned a null value; if so, at step 335 the TMP_PRIORITY field is assigned the value of the found priority list. Next, at step 340 , it is determined whether the PMDB 275 is full. If so, at step 345 a least recently or least frequently used attribute entry is deleted from the PMDB 275 ; if not, at step 350 the found attribute associated with the TMP_PRIORITY field is saved in the PMDB 275 .
- the priority list associated with the found attribute is retrieved.
- the PMPL 265 is defined as the priority list identified by the TMP_PRIORITY field.
- An effective time for each attribute also can be specified and stored in the PMDB 275 so that a selected priority list will expire after the effective time.
- the PMPL 265 then will be overwritten with the DPL 270 . That prevents the PMPL 265 from maintaining an out of date, context-specific priority list.
- a flow diagram illustrates a method 400 for iteratively determining whether any positioning method identified in a positioning method priority list satisfies quality of position (QOP) parameters identified in a positioning request for location services (LCS), according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- QOP quality of position
- LCS positioning request for location services
- step 425 it is determined whether the first priority method succeeded in providing a positioning fix that satisfied the required QOP parameters. If not, then at step 430 it is determined whether N is less than a maximum number of positioning methods available to the mobile telephone 100 . If so, at step 435 the value of N is incremented by one and the method 400 returns to step 420 ; if not, then a “positioning failed” message is reported to the LCS requestor. At step 445 , if one of the available positioning methods succeeds, then the associated positioning result is reported to the LCS requestor.
- a message sequence chart illustrates a method 500 of updating the positioning method priority list (PMPL) 265 in response to movement of the mobile telephone 100 through a subway system, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- the PMPL 265 initially prioritizes three available positioning methods, where use of the GPS transceiver 210 is assigned a first priority, use of the cell transceiver 108 is assigned a second priority, and use of the WLAN transceiver 220 is assigned a tertiary priority.
- the mobile telephone 100 can function as a target SUPL enabled terminal (SET) that is in communication, such as through the network 250 , with a home SUPL location platform (H-SLP) 510 .
- SET target SUPL enabled terminal
- H-SLP home SUPL location platform
- the H-SLP 510 is in communication, such as through the network 250 , with a SUPL agent 515 .
- a mobile location protocol triggered location reporting request (MLP TLRR) 520 is transmitted from the SUPL agent 515 to the H-SLP 510 , and indicates that a current location of the mobile telephone 100 has been requested.
- the H-SLP 510 therefore looks up routing information for the mobile telephone 100 in a routing table 525 and transmits a SUPL initiation (INIT) message 530 to the mobile telephone 100 .
- the mobile telephone 100 responds with a SUPL TRIGGERED START message 535 that identifies SET capabilities including the positioning methods identified in the PMPL 265 .
- the mobile telephone 100 then receives a SUPL TRIGGERED RESPONSE message 540 , which indicates preferred positioning methods of the H-SLP 510 , and sets a timer T.
- the H-SLP 510 then transmits a mobile location protocol triggered location reporting answer (MLP TLRA) 545 to the SUPL agent 515 .
- MLP TLRA mobile location protocol triggered location reporting answer
- the PSP 205 copies the PMPL 265 to a posmethods-avail field in a SUPL positioning initiation (POS INIT) message 550 that is transmitted to the H-SLP 510 .
- a first SUPL positioning session 555 is then started using the GPS transceiver 210 , and another timer T is started.
- a MTP TLRA 560 including results of the first SUPL positioning session 555 is then transmitted from the H-SLP 510 to the SUPL agent 515 .
- Block 570 illustrates the updated PMPL 265 , where the three available positioning methods are reprioritized so that use of the WLAN transceiver 220 is assigned a first priority, use of the cell transceiver 108 is assigned a second priority, and use of the GPS transceiver 210 is assigned a tertiary priority.
- the mobile telephone 100 transmits a SUPL POS INIT message 575 to the H-SLP 510 .
- a second SUPL positioning session 580 is then started using the WLAN transceiver 220 , and another timer T is started.
- a MTP TLRA 585 including results of the second SUPL positioning session 580 is then transmitted from the H-SLP 510 to the SUPL agent 515 .
- Block 590 illustrates the updated PMPL 265 , where the three available positioning methods are reprioritized so that use of the GPS transceiver 210 is assigned a first priority, use of the cell transceiver 108 is assigned a second priority, and use of the WLAN transceiver 220 is assigned a tertiary priority.
- the mobile telephone 100 transmits a SUPL POS INIT message 592 to the H-SLP 510 .
- a third SUPL positioning session 595 is then started using the GPS transceiver 210 .
- a MTP TLRA 597 including results of the third SUPL positioning session 595 is then transmitted from the H-SLP 510 to the SUPL agent 515 .
- the PMPL 265 is automatically updated to identify the WLAN transceiver 220 as a source of a preferred positioning method while a user of the mobile telephone 100 is within the subway. But each of the available positioning methods that use the transceivers 108 , 210 , 215 , and 220 do not need to be tested in order to determine that the WLAN transceiver 220 is preferred, thus conserving battery power and processor resources in the mobile telephone 100 , and bandwidth resources in both the network 200 and the network 250 .
- a general flow diagram illustrates a method 600 for determining a position of a portable electronic device, according to some embodiments of the present invention.
- a first signal received from a local terminal is detected.
- the RFID tag 119 detects a signal from the RFID reader/writer 255 .
- a second signal indicating a proximity of the portable electronic device to the local terminal is transmitted from the portable electronic device in response to the first signal.
- the RFID tag 119 transmits a response signal back to the RFID reader/writer 255 .
- transmitting the second signal is performed using power from a wireless excitation signal received from the local terminal, such as an electrical induction signal from the RFID reader/writer 255 .
- positioning method priority information which is based on a location of the local terminal and is received from the local terminal in response to the second signal, is processed.
- processing can comprise reading the positioning method priority information from a radio frequency identification tag in the portable electronic device, such as where the RFID tag 119 receives positioning method priority information from the RFID reader/writer 255 that is based on the location of the RFID reader/writer 255 in a subway, train station, bus station, public building, or vehicle, and the information is then read by the PMS module 260 .
- the positioning method priority information can comprise a current position of the portable electronic device, such as specific latitude and longitude coordinates. That can further reduce the need for a portable electronic device to employ one or more of its available positioning methods.
- a positioning method priority list based on the positioning method priority information is updated. For example, according to the method 300 the PMPL 265 is updated.
- the position of the portable electronic device is determined using a positioning method identified in the positioning method priority list.
