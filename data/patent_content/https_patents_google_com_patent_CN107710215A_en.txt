U3 the secure identity of " user_u " can) be shared.As another example, the user " R1 " that there is root to access can be assigned peace
Whole audience border identity " root_u ".
Each identity of safe context can be associated with one or more safe context role.Then, each safety
Context role is associated with particular safety context domain or type.Then, device D operating system can be with context domain safe to use
Either type come determine for object which access rights (if present) can be used in particular safety context domain or type
The main body of operation.For example, it is assumed that user U1 has safe context identity " user_u ", and user R1 has as discussed above
Safe context identity " root_u "." user_u " identity can be with " user_r " for the role for representing non-management user safe field
Border role is associated." root_u " identity can be associated with two safe context roles：" user_r " and " sysadm_r " table
Show the role of system manager.Safe context role " user_r " can be assigned safe context domain or type " user_t " or
Person is associated with safe context domain or type " user_t ", and role " sysadm_r " can be assigned safe context domain or
Person's type " sysadm_t " is either associated with safe context domain or type " sysadm_t ".Then, because user U1 is in
Do not possess " user_r " role to the access rights of the file in " sysadm_t " domain or type, if so user U1 please
Ask and access the file " root_only " with " sysadm_t " domain, then the request can be refused by operating system.If user R1
Request accesses file " root_only " when in " uer_r " role, then the request can also be refused by operating system.This
In the case of, user R1 can change into role " sysadm_r ", the request of repeated accesses " root_only " file, then obtain
Must be to the access rights of " root_only " file.
Safe context can also specify one or more safe context rank.More specifically, some movement and/or it is other
Operating system can provide the object-based correspondence safe context rank for specifying safe context rank and main body and control to right
The Confidentiality protection strategy of the access rights of elephant.More, less, and/or different information can also be in safe context.
Operating system listing file order (such as, " ls-Z ") can be used to list the safe context of object, the operation
System list file command is enabled to list safe context information and on its of one or more file or other objects
Its information.Safe context information can be the form of safe context label.Safe context label can be " id:role:type:
Level " form, wherein, id is safe context identifier, and role is safe context role, type be safe context domain or
Type, and level are one or more safe context ranks.For example, order " ls-Zfile1/usr/bin/ssh " can be with
Exported with example, such as：
unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0file1
sys_u:object_r:ssh_exec_t:s0-s4/usr/bin/ssh
The safe context label " unconfined_u of object " file1 ":object_r:user_home_t:S0 " can refer to
Show that obj ect file 1 has the safe context identity of " unconfined_u ", the role of " object_r ", " user_home_t "
The safe context rank of domain or type and " s0 ".Object "/usr/bin/ssh " safe context label " sys_u:
object_r:ssh_exec_t:S0-s4 " can with denoted object/usr/bin/ssh with " sys_u " safe context identity,
The role of " object_r ", the domain of " ssh_exec_t " or type and instruction are from the safe field for being included s0 to s4
The safe context rank of " s0-s4 " of the scope of border rank.The list process commands of operating system can be used for process and/or
Thread provides similar security information；For example, " ps-Z ".
Then, can be according to device D and/or dress in order to preserve the safe context information on one or more object
D operating system is put, safe field is obtained using operating system listing file order (such as, " ls " order or equivalent command)
Environment information.It is then possible to the output of listing file order is parsed or handles, to obtain the safe field of one or more object
Border label.Then, for the special object O1 of one or more object, it can parse and/or deal with objects successively O1 peace
Whole audience border label SCL (O1), with obtain the safe context label based on O1 come change safe context identity, role, domain/type,
And/or the data of one or more order of rank.It is then possible to one or more life that safe context information will be changed
Order is added to script or other softwares, and these are ordered reduces object O1 safety based on safe context label when executed
Context.
For example, it is assumed that by above-mentioned file " file1 " and "/usr/bin/ssh " saves as a part for snapshot.Then,
The listing file output of file 1 can be (as indicated above)：
unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0file1
Output can be parsed into safe context label " unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:S0 " and
Object name " file1 ".Can be to determine the safe context identity of file 1 with the safe context label of resolution file 1
" unconfined_u ", safe context role be " object_r ", safe context domain or type be " user_home_t ", with
And safe context rank is " s0 ".Then, " chcon " example ordered can be added to script, by the safety of " file1 "
Context is arranged to use the safe context that the safe context in label indicates.Example added to the order of script can be：
chcon–u unconfined_u file1#assign“unconfined_u”id to file1fromlabel
chcon–r object_r file1#assign“object_r”role to file1from label
chcon–t user_home_t file1#assign“user_home_t”type to file1fromlabel
chcon–l s0file1#assign level“s0”to file1from label
As another example, can be performed and above-mentioned 4 orders identical function with issuing orders：
chcon unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0file1
Then ,/usr/bin/ssh listing file output can be (as indicated above)：
sys_u:object_r:ssh_exec_t:s0-s4/usr/bin/ssh
Output can be parsed into safe context label " sys_u:object_r:ssh_exec_t:S0-s4 " and object name
“/usr/bin/ssh”.Then, script can include for/usr/bin/ssh safe context being restored to the safe field such as reference
The safe context specified in the label of border to issue orders；For example,
chcon sys_u:object_r:ssh_exec_t:s0-s4/usr/bin/ssh
