Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
This application claims priority to U.S. patent application No.14/249,840, filed 4/10/2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Technical Field
Methods, systems, and media for presenting business information related to video content are provided.
Background
When viewing a program, the viewer is often interested in information related to the program, such as additional information related to items of merchandise (e.g., clothing, household items, health products, etc.) presented in the program. To use a conventional search engine to find information about items of merchandise presented in a program, a viewer may need to enter one or more keywords into the search engine. The viewer can then quickly browse the search results to find a web page containing information about the item of merchandise.
However, such conventional search engines may not provide a satisfactory search experience for the user for several reasons. For example, the viewer must generate a search query for a merchandise item, relying only on the appearance of the merchandise item as shown in the video frame. This can be a time consuming and frustrating process for the viewer, particularly when the viewer is unaware of the search terms (e.g., product names) that may point to the item of merchandise the user is looking for. As another example, a viewer may have to conduct multiple searches to examine information about multiple merchandise items displayed in a program. Thus, the viewer may need to miss a significant portion of the program when searching for information related to the merchandise item.
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide new mechanisms for presenting business information related to video content.

Detailed Description
According to various embodiments, as described in more detail below, mechanisms are provided for presenting commerce information related to video content, which may include systems, methods, and computer-readable media.
In some implementations, the mechanisms described herein can process video frames of video content (e.g., television programs, streaming video content, etc.) and detect objects in the video frames. For example, the object can be detected using any suitable object detection technique, such as template matching, video segmentation, edge detection, and the like.
In some implementations, upon detecting an object in a video frame of video content, the mechanism can search for an item of merchandise (e.g., a product) that matches the detected object. For example, the mechanisms can generate an image of the detected object (e.g., an image including a portion of a frame containing the detected object, a grayscale image, etc.) and generate an image fingerprint (e.g., normalized pixel values) from the image. The mechanism can then compare the generated image fingerprint to a plurality of reference image fingerprints associated with the merchandise items stored in the storage device. In some implementations, a reference image fingerprint can be considered a matching image fingerprint when a difference (e.g., an absolute difference) between the reference image fingerprint and the generated image fingerprint is less than a predetermined threshold.
In some implementations, upon detecting a matching image fingerprint, the mechanism can identify the merchandise item associated with the matching image fingerprint and then associate the commerce information related to the merchandise item with the detected object. In some implementations, the commerce information can include any suitable information related to the merchandise item, such as identification information (e.g., product name, index number, product number, icon, barcode, two-dimensional code, etc.) that can be used to identify the merchandise item, pricing information related to the merchandise item, a seller that can provide the merchandise item, a link to a website that includes information related to the merchandise item, and so forth.
It should be noted that prior to receiving the commercial information, these mechanisms can provide the user with an opportunity to provide consent or authorization to perform an action, such as detecting an object in a video frame, presenting commercial information related to the merchandise item, submitting payment information for purchasing the merchandise item, and/or placing the merchandise item in a queue. For example, upon loading the application onto a media playback device, such as a television device, the application can prompt the user to provide authorization to deliver commercial information, deliver payment information, and/or present the content. In a more specific example, in response to downloading the application program and loading the application on the media playback device, the user can be prompted with a message asking the user to provide consent before performing these actions. Additionally or alternatively, in response to installing the application, the user can be prompted with an entitlement message that requires the user to provide consent before performing these detections and/or communicating information related to these detections. Where the user agrees to use the data, business information relating to the one or more merchandise items can be presented and payment information can be communicated to purchase the one or more merchandise items.
In some implementations, the mechanism can retrieve commercial information related to the video content in response to receiving a request to pause presentation of the video content. For example, the mechanism can identify a video frame of video content currently being presented and retrieve business information associated with one or more objects in the video frame. In some implementations, the mechanisms described herein can present commercial information associated with a video frame using one or more suitable graphical content items (e.g., images, text segments, URLs, etc.). For example, a graphical content item can be presented that includes commercial information related to a merchandise item corresponding to an object in a video frame, along with the object in the video frame.
In some implementations, the mechanisms described herein can prompt a user to interact with one or more of the graphical content items. For example, in response to receiving a user selection of a URL pointing to a Web page that includes business information associated with an item of merchandise presented in a video frame, the mechanism can render the Web page using an appropriate application (e.g., a Web browser, a mobile application, etc.). As another example, in response to a user selection of a segment of Web content that includes commercial information for an item of merchandise presented in a video frame, the mechanism can cause commercial information (e.g., pricing information, product specifications, etc.) related to the item of merchandise to be presented.
In some embodiments, the mechanisms can be used in a variety of applications. For example, the mechanisms can provide commercial information related to merchandise items presented in video content. More specifically, for example, the mechanism can identify discrete objects in a video frame and match the discrete objects to products and other items of merchandise in a product catalog that are available for sale. The mechanism can then store business information (e.g., price, product name, seller of the product, link to order information, etc.) related to the item of merchandise in association with (e.g., timestamp of) the video frame of the video content. As another example, the mechanism may provide commercial information related to merchandise items presented in video content in a real-time manner. In a more specific example, in response to receiving an indication that a viewer of video content is interested in an item of merchandise presented in the video content (e.g., a user request to pause playback of the video content), the mechanism can retrieve and present to the viewer commercial information related to the item of merchandise. In this example, the mechanisms can provide a viewer who is consuming video content with an opportunity to purchase one or more merchandise items corresponding to the identified objects in the video frame and/or an opportunity to place the one or more merchandise items in a queue for later purchase decision making without leaving or navigating away from the presented video content.
Turning to fig. 1, a flow diagram of an example 100 of a process for providing business information related to video content is shown, according to some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.
As shown, the process 100 begins by receiving a set of video frames of video content at 110. In some implementations, the video content can include one or more programs (e.g., news programs, talk shows, sports programs, etc.) from various sources, such as over-the-air programs, programs broadcast by cable television providers, programs broadcast by telephone television providers, programs broadcast by satellite television providers, on-demand programs, OTT (over-the-top) programs, internet content, streaming media programs, recorded programs, and so forth.
In some implementations, a video frame can correspond to any suitable portion of video content, such as a portion of video content having a particular duration (e.g., a few seconds or any other suitable duration). In some implementations, the video frames can include one or more encoded frames or decoded frames generated using any suitable video codec. In some implementations, the video frames can have any suitable frame rate (e.g., 60 Frames Per Second (FPS), etc.), resolution (e.g., 720p, 1080p, etc.), and/or any other suitable characteristics.
Next, at 120, the process 100 can process the video frame to detect an object in the video frame. In some implementations, the process 100 can process the video frames sequentially, in parallel, and/or in any other suitable manner (e.g., by decoding encoded frames, by generating grayscale images based on the video frames, by performing object detection and/or recognition on the video frames, etc.).
In some implementations, the process 100 can detect one or more objects in a video frame using any suitable object detection technique, such as template matching, image segmentation, edge detection, and the like. Further, in some embodiments, process 100 can identify one or more detected objects using any suitable object identification technique (e.g., edge matching, gray scale matching, gradient matching, color matching, feature matching, etc.).
In some implementations, one or more capture modules receive and process signals from multiple sources (e.g., multiple channels, multiple on-demand sources, multiple television providers, etc.). These capture modules are capable of capturing video screenshots at specific time intervals (e.g., every 2 or 3 seconds) for each video. Generally, these capture modules can monitor media content from multiple content sources and generate video screenshots and/or any other suitable content identifiers. More specifically, the capture modules can store the generated video screenshots and other content identifiers in a storage device. For example, the capture module can monitor channels that provide broadcast television content and store generated video fingerprints in a database indexed by channel and time. In another example, the capture module can monitor an on-demand video source that provides television content and store generated video fingerprints in a database indexed by video information and time. In some implementations, these capture modules can communicate information from the database to the image detection module for detecting one or more objects located within the captured video frames. In response, the capture module can receive object detection information (e.g., object name, grayscale image of the object, fingerprint of the object, etc.). The capture module can associate one or more detected objects with corresponding video information and temporal information indexed in the database.
At 130, the process 100 can obtain business information related to the detected object. In some implementations, business information related to the particular object detected at 120 can be obtained in any suitable manner. For example, the process 100 can access a database of merchandise items (e.g., products, services, etc.) and can identify one or more merchandise items that match the object. The process 100 can then associate business information related to the item of merchandise with the object. In a more specific example, as described below in connection with FIG. 3, merchandise items that match an object can be identified by generating a fingerprint from an image of the object and matching the generated fingerprint to reference fingerprints associated with a plurality of merchandise items.
In some implementations, the business information related to the object detected at 120 can include any suitable information related to one or more merchandise items that match the object. For example, the commerce information related to a particular merchandise item may include an identifier (e.g., a product identifier) that can identify the merchandise item, a description of the merchandise item (e.g., a product name), information related to a seller that provided the merchandise item, information related to the manufacture of the merchandise item, consumer reviews and/or ratings of the merchandise item, pricing information about the merchandise item, information about a platform (e.g., an e-commerce website) on which the merchandise item can be purchased, and so forth.
As another example, the commerce information related to a specified merchandise item may include any suitable data that can be used to retrieve and/or present information related to the merchandise item. In a more specific example, the commerce information may include a link (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)), a barcode (e.g., a Quick Response (QR) code), and/or any other suitable mechanism to a Web page from which the merchandise item may be purchased, a Web page including information related to the merchandise item, and/or any other suitable Web content related to the merchandise item. In another more specific example, the commercial information can include an image, animation, and/or any other suitable representation of the item of merchandise. In yet another more specific example, the commercial information can include a segment of Web content (e.g., a Web page, text, video, etc.) that contains information related to the item of merchandise.
It should be noted that in embodiments described herein where a media playback application (or other mechanism described herein) collects information about a particular user, the user can be provided with an opportunity to control whether the application (or other mechanism) collects information about the particular user and/or how the application (or other mechanism) uses the collected user information. Examples of information about the user may include interests of the user (e.g., paused video frames, selected merchandise items, etc.), user location, name spoken by the user, payment information associated with the user, etc. Additionally, certain information about the user can be stored locally (e.g., unshared), encrypted, and/or processed in one or more ways prior to storage to remove personally identifiable information. For example, the identity of the user can be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined for the user. As another example, the geographic location of the user in which the location information is obtained can be generalized (e.g., to city, ZIP, state, etc.) such that the particular location of the user cannot be determined. Using these and other techniques described herein, a user can control what information is collected about the user and/or how the application (or other mechanism) uses the information.
It should be noted that in embodiments described herein where a media playback application (or other mechanism described herein) presents commercial information to a particular user, the user can be provided with an opportunity to control whether and/or how the commercial information is presented. For example, the user can specify which sources can provide business information for presentation to the user. In another example, the user can specify which sources (such as a particular e-commerce retailer) are excluded from providing business information.
At 140, the process 100 can associate commercial information related to the detected object with a particular video frame. In some implementations, business information related to one or more objects detected in a particular video frame can be associated with information related to the particular video frame (e.g., a frame number, a timestamp, and/or any other suitable information that can be used to identify the video frame). In some embodiments, one or more objects can be selected from a plurality of objects detected in a video frame, as described below in connection with fig. 4. In this example, business information corresponding to the selected object can be associated with the video frame.
In some implementations, the commercial information can be associated with video content. For example, the commercial information can be stored in association with any suitable program information about the video content, such as a program title, a channel number of a channel providing the video content, and so forth. In some implementations, the commercial information corresponding to the video frames can be time stamped to associate with the video content.
In some implementations, the process 100 can associate and store the commercial information, program information related to the video content (e.g., channel number, program title, etc.), information related to the video frames (e.g., frame number, timestamp, etc.), such that in response to receiving a subsequent request for commercial information related to a particular video frame of the video content, the server can retrieve the stored commercial information related to the particular video frame of the video content, and/or any other suitable information.
In some implementations, the process 100 can monitor channels providing broadcast television content and store commercial information related to the broadcast television content in a database indexed by program and video frame. In a more specific example, process 100 can store commercial information in a database every N milliseconds, along with a time-stamped video frame, while a television provider or any other suitable content provider is broadcasting a program.
At 150, the process 100 can determine whether playback of the video content by the media playback device has been paused. For example, process 100 can receive an indication (e.g., an HTTP message) from a media playback device that playback of video content on the media playback device has been paused. In some implementations, the indication can correspond to a pause request received by the media playback device (e.g., step 220 of fig. 2).
In some implementations, the indication can be generated by the media playback device (e.g., step 230-step 240 of fig. 2), and can include any suitable information related to the video content. For example, the indication can include program information related to the video content, such as a program title, channel number, and the like. As another example, the indication may include information related to one or more video frames of the video content, such as a frame number, a timestamp, and/or any other suitable information that can be used to identify a video frame. In a more specific example, the indication can include information corresponding to a video frame (such as a video frame being played back by the media playback device when the pause request is received) that corresponds to a pause request that triggers transmission of the indication from the media playback device.
In some implementations, in response to determining that playback of the video content using the media playback device has not been paused ("no" at 150), process 100 may return to 110.
Alternatively, in response to receiving an indication that video content being played back on the media playback device has been paused ("yes" at 150), the process 100 can identify a video frame associated with the indication at 160 and determine whether commercial information has been associated in association with the determined video frame. For example, the process 100 can extract timestamps or other information related to video frames and program information related to video content from the indication received at 150. Process 100 can then determine whether commercial information has been stored in association with the video frame and the video content (e.g., existing commercial information associated with the program information and the timestamp).
In some implementations, in response to determining that commercial information has been stored in association with the determined video frame, at 170, process 100 may retrieve the stored commercial information and may then transmit a reply including the stored commercial information. In some embodiments, the reply may be transmitted using any suitable communication protocol, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and the like.
In some implementations, the response can include any suitable information that can be used to present commercial information associated with the video content. For example, the response may include commercial information associated with the video frame corresponding to the indication. In a more specific example, the response can include a link (e.g., a URL), a QR code, and/or any other suitable mechanism to the commercial information associated with the video frame. In another more specific example, the response can include images, animations, audio content, segments of Web content, and/or any other suitable content that can be used to present the commercial information associated with the video frame.
In some implementations, the response can include any suitable information related to generating and/or presenting graphical content for presenting the business information. For example, the response can include location information regarding the location and/or size of the screen area in which the commercial information can be presented. In a more specific example, such information can include one or more coordinates (e.g., x, y, and/or z coordinates) that can define a starting location, an ending location, and/or any other suitable parameter of the area in one or more particular dimensions (e.g., x, y, and/or z dimensions). In another more specific example, the set of instructions can include one or more coordinates defining a location and/or size of the region relative to the region where the video content can be displayed (such as an offset between two regions, an overlapping region where both the video content and the graphics content can be rendered, etc.).
As another example, the response can include one or more rendering instructions that can be used to combine the video content and the graphical content item that includes the commercial information for presentation. In a more specific example, the response can include information related to a color, a transparency level, and/or any other suitable parameter that can be used to overlay a graphical content item (e.g., the graphical content item as shown in fig. 5B) that includes commercial information over a video frame of the video content.
In some embodiments, at 170, process 100 can return to 110 after transmitting the reply.
Turning to fig. 2, a flow diagram of an example 200 of a process for presenting business information related to video content is shown, according to some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.
As shown, the process 200 begins by presenting video content using a media playback device. In some implementations, the video content can include one or more programs (e.g., news programs, talk shows, sports programs, etc.) from various sources, such as over-the-air programs, programs broadcast by cable television providers, programs broadcast by telephone television providers, programs broadcast by satellite television providers, on-demand programs, OTT (over-the-top) programs, internet content, streaming media programs, recorded programs, and so forth. In some implementations, the media playback device can be a digital video recorder, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a television, and/or any other suitable device capable of presenting video content.
In some implementations, when presenting video content, at 220, the process 200 can determine whether a request to pause presentation of the video content has been received. In some embodiments, the pause request can correspond to any suitable user input, and the pause request can be received using any suitable device. For example, process 200 can determine that a pause request has been received in response to receiving a voice command indicating that a user wishes to pause presentation of video content. In a more specific example, the voice command "pause" may be provided by a user consuming video content and detected by an audio input device (e.g., a microphone coupled to a media playback device, a mobile device, etc.). As another example, process 200 can determine that a pause request has been received in response to receiving a user selection of a pause button using an input device (such as input device 716 shown in FIG. 7).
In some embodiments, the pause request may be transmitted and received in any suitable form, such as one or more infrared signals, High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) commands, WiFi signals, and/or any other suitable control signals.
In some implementations, in response to determining that a pause request has not been received ("no" at 220), the process 200 can return to 210 and continue presenting the video content. Alternatively, in response to determining that a pause request has been received ("yes" at 220), the process 200 can identify a video frame corresponding to the pause request at 230. For example, a video frame being presented by the media playback device when a pause request is received may be identified as the video frame corresponding to the pause request. In some implementations, the process 200 can associate the identified video frame with a timestamp (e.g., a presentation timestamp), a frame number, and/or any other suitable information capable of identifying the video frame.
In some implementations, upon receiving the pause request, the process 200 can record the video content at a suitable storage device (e.g., using a media playback device or any other suitable device) and/or store the video content for subsequent presentation of the video content.
At 240, process 200 can transmit an indication that presentation of the video content has been paused. In some implementations, the indication may be transmitted using any suitable protocol, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and so forth.
In some implementations, the indication can include any suitable information related to the video content. For example, the indication can include program information that identifies the video content. In a more specific example, the program information can include a program title of the video content, a channel number of a channel providing the video content, and/or any other suitable information that can be used to identify the video content and/or a source of the video content. As another example, the indication can include a frame number, a timestamp, and/or any other suitable information related to the video frame corresponding to the pause request.
At 250, the process 200 can receive a reply including commercial information associated with the identified video frame. For example, in some embodiments, an acknowledgement generated and transmitted as described above in connection with fig. 1 can be received. In a more specific example, the response can include commercial information related to one or more objects detected in the identified video frame, such as URLs, images, animations, text segments, audio content, and the like, which can be used to present commercial information related to one or more items of merchandise (e.g., products, services, and the like) corresponding to the objects.
As another more specific example, the response can include information that can be used to present the commercial information associated with the identified video frame, such as one or more rendering instructions related to generating and/or rendering a graphical content item for presenting the commercial information, location information related to a location and/or size of a screen area in which the graphical content item can be presented, and so forth.
At 260, the process 200 can present the business information associated with the identified video frame. In some implementations, the business information can be presented using any suitable device. For example, as described below in connection with fig. 5B and 5C, the commercial information can be presented on a display connected to the media playback device (such as display 714 shown in fig. 7). Alternatively or additionally, as described below in connection with fig. 5D, the commercial information may be presented on a second screen device, such as a mobile device (e.g., mobile device 611 as shown in fig. 6).
In some implementations, the business information can be presented using any suitable content, such as text, images, icons, graphics, video, animations, audio clips, hypertext, hyperlinks, sound, and so forth.
In some implementations, the commercial information can be presented on the display along with a video frame corresponding to the pause request. For example, the commercial information may be presented in association with one or more objects in a video frame. In a more specific example, as described below in connection with fig. 5B, business information (e.g., business information 530) associated with a given object may be presented in association with the object (e.g., object 521) in a video frame. In another more specific example, as described below in connection with fig. 5C, business information related to a given object in a video frame can be presented using graphical content items (e.g., URLs, images, animations, text clips, user interfaces, etc.) that include such business information. In some implementations, multiple graphical content items may be generated for multiple objects of a video frame.
In some implementations, one or more graphical content items can be generated and/or presented based on the response received at 250. For example, a graphical content item can be generated based on a URL contained in the response. As another example, the graphical content item can be mixed with the video frame corresponding to the pause request based on rendering instructions contained in the received reply, color, transparency level, and/or any other suitable parameter contained in the reply. Additionally, the graphical content item may be superimposed on the video frame based on location information contained in the response (e.g., coordinates of a screen area in which commercial information can be presented).
In some implementations, the process 200 can allow a user to interact with one or more graphical content items. For example, process 200 can allow a user to scroll through different graphical content items corresponding to objects by scrolling vertically or horizontally on a mobile device, a media playback device, and/or any other suitable device. In a more specific example, in response to receiving a pause request or any other suitable request from a user, the process 200 can present the graphical content item within the paused video frame. When scrolling through different graphical content items, the process 200 can selectively present the business information (e.g., price, product specifications, seller information, etc.) associated with each highlighted graphical content item without leaving the presented video content or leaving the media application that is playing back the video content. As another example, the process 200 can select the ranked graphical content items based on a user selection of appropriate criteria (e.g., popularity) and can automatically present individual content information corresponding to the objects of the video frames on the display. As yet another example, with graphical content items, the process 200 can provide the user with an opportunity to perform one or more purchase actions (e.g., add an item corresponding to a selected graphical content item to a shopping cart/preference list, place an order, make a payment, etc.) with an item of merchandise corresponding to an object of a video frame.
In a more specific example, process 200 can present one or more graphical content items for interaction in response to receiving a pause request or any other suitable indication from a user. As described herein, the one or more graphical content items including commercial information can be displayed in an overlay over a paused video frame, or can be displayed in gaps between objects detected in a video frame. In response to selecting one of the graphical content items, the corresponding merchandise item may be purchased and confirmation of the purchased merchandise item may be presented on the display. In some implementations, the process 200 can present the user with a purchase confirmation overlay (e.g., "do you confirm that you want to purchase it. Instead of purchasing the item of merchandise corresponding to the selected graphical content item, the item of merchandise can be placed in a queue for later purchase. As another more specific example, one or more graphical content items for purchasing the merchandise item and/or for saving the merchandise item for subsequent purchase can be provided on a second screen device (such as mobile device 611 in conjunction with fig. 6). For example, in response to selecting multiple merchandise items within one or more paused video frames, the selected merchandise items may be saved in a purchase queue accessible using a mobile device associated with a media playback device presenting the video content.
As described herein, it should be noted that the process 200 can provide the user with an opportunity to provide consent or authorization to perform an action, such as detecting an object in a video frame, presenting commercial information related to an item of merchandise, submitting payment information for purchasing an item of merchandise, and/or placing an item of merchandise in a queue. For example, upon loading the application on a media playback device (such as a television device), the application can prompt the user to provide authorization for delivering commercial information, delivering payment information, and/or presenting content. In a more specific example, in response to downloading and loading an application on the media playback device, the user can be prompted by a message asking the user to provide consent before performing these actions. Additionally or alternatively, each time the user selects an item of merchandise for purchase or for placement in the queue, the user can be prompted by an entitlement message that requires the user to provide consent to use the payment information or any other suitable user information related to purchasing the item of merchandise.
At 270, process 200 can determine whether a request to resume presentation of video content has been received. In some implementations, the request can correspond to any suitable user input (e.g., a voice command, a gesture command, a user selection of a play button, etc.) and can be received using any suitable device (e.g., a microphone, a gesture recognition system, a remote control, a mobile phone, etc.).
In some implementations, in response to determining that a request to resume presentation of video content has not been received ("no" at 270), the process 200 can return to 260 and can continue to present the commercial information associated with the video frames. Alternatively, process 200 can return to 210 and can resume video content presentation. For example, process 200 can present video content from a video frame corresponding to a pause request (e.g., based on video data stored in response to the pause request).
Turning to fig. 3, a flow diagram of an example 300 of a process for obtaining business information related to an object in a video frame is shown, according to some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.
As shown, the process 300 may begin by detecting an object in a video frame at 310. In some embodiments, the object can be detected using any suitable object detection technique (such as template matching, image segmentation, edge detection, detecting objects based on features, etc.) or combination of techniques.
At 320, the process 300 can obtain an image of the detected object. For example, the process 300 can generate an image that includes a portion of a video frame that contains the detected object. Additionally or alternatively, the process 300 can process the image using any suitable image processing technique to generate a grayscale image, an edge-enhanced image, a deblurred image, a bitmap image, or the like.
At 330, the process 300 can generate a fingerprint of the image of the detected object. In some embodiments, the fingerprint can be generated using any suitable image fingerprinting technique. The image fingerprint may be a digital representation generated from the image of the detected object obtained at 320. In some implementations, the image fingerprint of the detected object can include any suitable characteristic of the image of the detected object. For example, the fingerprint can include optical characteristics of the image, such as brightness, grayscale, gradient, color, and the like. As another example, the fingerprint can include geometric features of the detected objects in the image, such as edge templates, browsing directions, dimensions, shapes, surface features, and the like.
In some implementations, at 340, the process 300 can compare the generated image fingerprint to a plurality of reference image fingerprints. For example, the generated image fingerprint may be compared to an image fingerprint generated based on image data of a collection of merchandise items (e.g., products, services, etc.). In these examples, the process 300 may access a database and/or any other suitable storage device that stores image fingerprints indexed by merchandise items for comparison.
In some implementations, the process 300 can compare the generated image fingerprint to a given reference image fingerprint by measuring differences between the generated image fingerprint and the reference image fingerprint based on one or more suitable metrics, such as Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD), Sum of Absolute Transformed Differences (SATD), sum of variance (SSD), and so forth.
At 350, the process 300 may determine whether a match is found. In some implementations, the process 300 may identify the reference image fingerprint as a matching fingerprint in response to determining that a difference between the generated image fingerprint and the reference image fingerprint is less than a predetermined threshold.
If no matching image fingerprint is found ("no" at 350), the process 300 can return to 310 and object detection can be performed on the video frame or any other suitable video frame. Alternatively, in response to detecting a matching image fingerprint ("yes" at 350), at 360, the process 300 can identify a merchandise item associated with the matching image fingerprint.
At 370, the process 300 can associate the commerce information corresponding to the merchandise item with the detected object. For example, the process 300 can retrieve any suitable information related to the item of merchandise, and the retrieved information can then be stored in association with an identifier (e.g., an index number) that identifies the object. In some implementations, the information related to a merchandise item may include an identifier (e.g., a product identifier) that can identify the merchandise item, a description of the merchandise item (e.g., a product name), information related to a seller that provided the merchandise item, information related to the manufacture of the merchandise item, consumer reviews and/or ratings of the merchandise item, pricing information related to the merchandise item, information related to a platform on which the merchandise item can be purchased (e.g., an e-commerce website), and so forth.
Turning to fig. 4, a flow diagram of an example 400 of a process for associating commercial information with video frames is shown, according to some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter.
As shown, the process 400 may begin by obtaining business information corresponding to a plurality of objects in a video frame, at 410. In some embodiments, the business information may be obtained in any suitable manner. For example, as described above in connection with fig. 3, the process 300 can be used to obtain business information corresponding to a particular object in a video frame.
In some embodiments, the business information can include any suitable information related to the item of merchandise (e.g., product, service, etc.) corresponding to the object. For example, the business information related to a particular merchandise item can include information related to a seller providing the merchandise item, consumer reviews and/or ratings of the merchandise item, pricing information regarding the merchandise item, and so forth.
At 420, the process 400 can rank the objects based on business information associated with the objects. In some implementations, ranking may be performed based on any suitable criteria or criteria, such as by popularity (e.g., based on consumer reviews and/or ratings related to the item of merchandise corresponding to the object, based on social media information, such as trend information and/or hotspot information related to the item of merchandise corresponding to the object, etc.), by product category (e.g., based on product name and/or classification associated with the item of merchandise), by price (e.g., based on price of the item of merchandise corresponding to the object), by source (e.g., whether a seller of the item of merchandise signed for a service provided by process 400), and so forth.
In some implementations, the process 400 can rank the objects based on social media information associated with the objects. For example, one or more capture modules can receive social media information from one or more social networks related to the merchandise items corresponding to the objects. In a more specific example, the process 400 can extract keywords related to the merchandise item from the received social media information. The process 400 can then determine a social score for each extracted keyword related to the item of merchandise based on the number of mentions, likes, and/or other social media indicators, and can rank the objects corresponding to the item of merchandise based on the determined social scores for the extracted keywords.
At 430, the process 400 can select one or more detected objects based on the ranking. For example, the process 400 can select a predetermined number of objects based on the ranking. In a more specific example, the process 400 can select several objects (e.g., the top 5 objects) associated with a particular rank. In another more specific example, the process 400 can select a percentage of objects based on the determined ranking.
At 440, process 400 can associate business information corresponding to the selected object with the video frame. For example, the process 400 can associate the business information corresponding to the selected object with information about the video frame (e.g., a frame number, a timestamp, etc.) and store the business information corresponding to the selected object so that the stored business information corresponding to the selected object with the video frame can be retrieved in response to receiving a subsequent request for the business information related to the video frame.
It should be noted that the above-described steps of the flowcharts of fig. 1-4 can be performed or carried out in any order or sequence and are not limited to the order or sequence shown and described in the figures. Also, where appropriate, some of the above-described steps of the flowcharts of FIGS. 1-4 can be performed or implemented substantially simultaneously or in parallel to reduce latency and processing time. Further, it should be noted that fig. 1-4 are provided as examples only. At least some of the steps shown in the figures may be performed in an order different than presented, performed simultaneously, or omitted simultaneously.
Turning to fig. 5A, an example of a user interface 500 for presenting video content is shown, according to some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. In some implementations, the user interface 500 can include a control panel 510, a video content display area 520, and/or any other suitable user interface element.
In some implementations, the control panel 510 can include a plurality of user interface elements for performing control functions associated with video playback, such as a skip backward or forward button (not shown), a play button 512, a pause button 514, a stop button (not shown), a mute button (not shown), a volume control bar (not shown), and any other suitable video control interface elements. In some embodiments, control panel 510 may contain more or fewer video control interface elements than shown in FIG. 5A, or may be omitted (e.g., in the case of voice control).
In some implementations, any suitable video content can be presented using the content display area 520. In some implementations, if a pause request is received (e.g., clicking on the pause button 514), a video frame corresponding to the pause request (e.g., the video frame identified at 230) can be presented in the video content display area 520.
5B, 5C, and 5D show illustrative examples of user interfaces for presenting business information related to video content, according to some embodiments. For example, one or more commercial information presentation items 530 can be used to present commercial information related to one or more detected objects 521 or 523 within the video frame corresponding to the pause request.
Although not shown in fig. 5B, 5C, or 5D, in some implementations, one or more detected objects 521 and 523 within a video frame corresponding to a pause request can be indicated in the video content display area 520. In some implementations, the one or more objects 521 and 523 detected at 120 in conjunction with fig. 1 can be represented in the video content display area 520 in any suitable manner. For example, one or more objects 521 and 523 may be represented by one or more user interface elements (such as one or more pointers, one or more light points, one or more color points, enhanced frames of one or more objects, etc.). As another example, when a mouse pointer is moved by a user to a location of a detected object, the detected object can be indicated using a sound, a light, a pop-up window, and/or any other suitable user interface element.
In some implementations, the business information presentation item 530 can present any suitable business information related to the detected object 521 or 523, such as a snippet of the business information (e.g., a quick fact or any other suitable text snippet), a thumbnail image, a link to a web page for additional content (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a barcode (e.g., a Quick Response (QR) code), an extracted keyword mentioned in the subtitle information, and so forth.
In some implementations, the business information presentation items 530 can be presented in any suitable manner. For example, as shown in FIG. 5B, the commercial information presentation item 530 can be provided within a floating window that overlays the video content presentation area 520. In a more specific example, the commercial information presentation item 530 can be provided as transparent, wherein the commercial information can be overlaid on the video content presentation area 520. In another example, as shown in FIG. 5C, one or more commercial information presentation items 530 can be provided and listed in a commercial information window 540 positioned adjacent to the video content presentation area 520. In yet another example, as shown in fig. 5D, a video frame corresponding to the pause request can be presented on a first screen device 591 (e.g., media playback device 613 described in connection with fig. 6), while one or more commercial information presentation items 530 are provided and listed in a commercial information window 540 that can be presented on a second screen device 592 (e.g., mobile device 611 described in connection with fig. 6).
In some implementations, one or more of the business information presentation items 530 can be associated with one or more of the objects 521. In some implementations, one or more of the business information presentation items associated with the one or more objects 523 can be hidden or omitted. In some implementations, the business information presentation item 530 associated with the object 523 can be presented in response to receiving a user request, such as selecting the object 523. It should be noted that although three commercial information presentation items 530 are shown in FIGS. 5B, 5C, and 5D, respectively, any suitable number of commercial information presentation items (including one and none) can be presented to the user.
Although not shown in fig. 5B, 5C, or 5D, in some implementations, the business information presentation item 530 can interact with a user. For example, if the user is not interested or is no longer interested in the business information presented on the business information presentation item, the business information presentation item 530 can be removed from the user interface 500. In a particular example, in some implementations, the business information presentation item 530 can be eliminated by clicking or tapping on the business information presentation item 530 or on an "eliminate" icon (e.g., "X" or any other suitable icon on the corner of the business information presentation item 530). As another specific example, in some implementations, the business information presentation item 530 can be eliminated by sliding or dragging the business information presentation item outside the boundaries of the user interface 500. Similarly, in some implementations, the business information presentation item 530 can be selected by clicking, tapping, or any suitable mechanism.
As another example, the commercial information presentation item 530 can be selected to perform an action or present additional information (e.g., access a link to review an introduction or specification related to a merchandise item corresponding to the detected object). In a more specific example, if the commerce information presentation item 530 presents a link to a merchandise website, the commerce information presentation item 530 may be selected and, in response, an action may be performed, such as running a Web browsing application that accesses information and/or purchases a selection with the corresponding merchandise item. As another more specific example, if the commerce information presentation item 530 presents a video that introduces a corresponding merchandise item, the commerce information presentation item 530 can be selected and, in response, the video can be displayed to the user. In another suitable example, the commerce information presentation item 530 can include one or more user interface elements that allow the user to purchase the corresponding merchandise item (e.g., place an order and/or make a payment). In another suitable example, selecting a commercial information presentation item 530 can cause the corresponding merchandise item to be placed in a queue for later purchase decision making.
Turning to fig. 6, an example 600 of an overview schematic of a system for presenting business information related to video content is shown, according to some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. As shown, the system 600 may include one or more video content servers 621, one or more video processing servers 623, one or more merchandise servers 625, a communication network 650, one or more mobile devices 611, one or more media playback devices 613, communication links 631, 633, 635, 641, 643, 645, 647, and 649, and/or other suitable components.
The video content server 621 may include one or more servers that can stream media or provide video content and/or perform any other suitable functions. For example, the video content server 621 may include a telephone television provider, a satellite television provider, a video streaming service, a video hosting service, and the like.
