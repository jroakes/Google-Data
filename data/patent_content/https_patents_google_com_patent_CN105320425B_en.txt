It is configured as at least part of the feature and function of limitation access calculating equipment 10 and/or is consumed with limitation calculating equipment 10
Quantity of power the mode of operation that operates of mode.For example, calculating equipment 10 when calculating equipment 10 and operating in limitation mode of operation
UID12 can be deactivated.In addition, calculating equipment 10 can be configured as presentation locking when in limitation mode of operation
Screen GUI (for example, GUI 14), but can stop or avoid output pattern content for showing.
On the contrary, term " full operational state " is used to be generally described calculating as present disclosure is used in the whole text
Equipment 10 is configured as allowing to access at least part for the feature and function for calculating equipment and/or be disappeared with allowing to calculate equipment 10
At least part of the mode of operation that the mode of consumption maximum amount of power operates, this feature and function is when computing device operation is in limitation
It is confined when mode of operation.In addition, when be in full operational state when, calculate equipment 10 UID 12 can be activated and
Calculating equipment 10 can be configured as output pattern content (for example, GUI 16A and 16N) for showing at UID 12.
In some instances, access modules 24 can be a part for the operating system for calculating equipment 10 and determine
The input instruction user detected at UID 12 wishes to be converted to calculating equipment 10 completely
Mode of operation is to provide a user the access to the feature or function for calculating equipment 10.For example, if UID 12 and UI module 20
Detect the input at UID 12, when calculating equipment 10 operates in limitation mode of operation, access modules 24 can to count
It calculates equipment 10 and is converted to full operational state.
In some instances, access modules 24 can be calculate equipment 10 operating system a part and make or
Configuring computing devices 10 are converted to limitation mode of operation to save battery electric power, in user and calculate inactive between equipment 10
Access or limitation is prevented to calculate the feature or function of equipment 10 after period (for example, pause).For example, if UID 12 and UI
Module 20 does not detect the input at UID 12 whithin a period of time (for example, five minutes), and access modules 24 can make
It calculates equipment 10 and is converted to limitation mode of operation.
Access modules 24 can issue commands to UI module 20 so that UI module 20 makes to succeed in one's scheme depending on access modules 24
Calculation equipment 10 operates in full operational state and still limits mode of operation and enable or disable (for example, activation or deactivation) UID
12.Access modules 24 can send graphical content and instruction and to depend on access modules 24 calculating equipment 10 be operated in completely
Mode of operation still limits mode of operation and rendering or the image of GUI is presented.
Access modules 24 can receive input data and graphic element position data from UI module 20, and based on from UI
The data of module 20 determine whether to be converted to another mode of operation from a mode of operation is operated in.For example, GUI 14 is wrapped
Include release region 18, user can provide the input (for example, gesture) from the region and come so that calculating equipment 10 from operating in
Limitation mode of operation, which is converted to, operates in full operational state.When UID 12 detects the input of the user at release region 18
Access modules 24 can receive and analyze the input data obtained from UI module 20, and determine whether to move back so that calculating equipment 10
Mode of operation is limited out or is maintained at limitation mode of operation.Access modules 24 may determine whether so that calculating equipment 10 from operation
It is converted in limitation mode of operation and operates in full operational state.Access modules 24 can be received from UI module 20 and be inputted to user
The instruction of (for example, data, touch event) and based on user input determine user input whether have meet unlock threshold value
Characteristic (for example, length, speed, mode) be converted to and operated in from limitation mode of operation is operated in so that calculating equipment 10
Full operation state.Access modules 22 can make calculating equipment 10 exit limitation mode of operation and be converted to different conditions, from this
Different conditions user is accessible to be stored in the shielded information calculated in equipment 10, accessed at UID 12 GUI 16A and
16N, and/or the feature of access application module 30.
UI module 20 can serve as the intermediary between the various assemblies for calculating equipment 10 based on (for example, being examined by UID 12
Measuring) input makes a determination and generates output (for example, at UID12 present).For example, UI module 20 can be from using mould
Block 30A as input receive graphical content and instruction with present webpage GUI rendering or image using shown at UID 12 as
GUI 16A.UI module 20 can receive graphical content and instruction from application module 30B as input notice center GUI is presented
Image or rendering using at UID 12 display as GUI16N.
UI module 20 can receive from the user detected with UID 12 as input from UID 12 and input related information
The sequence of the touch event of generation.UI module 20 can determine that one or more location components in the sequence of touch event are close
The selection (for example, release region 18 of GUI 14) of one or more graphic elements.UI module 20 can be used as output to module
22,24 and/or 30 transmission are from the sequence of the received touch event of UID 12, and together with position, at this location, UID 12 is in UID
Each graphic element is presented at 12 so as to the further processing of module 22,24 and/or 30 input by user.
UI module 20 can make UID 12 present with calculate the component of operating platform of equipment 10, module 22 or 24 or
The associated GUI of person's application module 30 (for example, GUI 14,16A and 16N).In other words, UI module 20 can be output information to
UID 12 so that 12 output pattern content of UID to show and can send additional information to UID 12 so that UID 12
It avoids or stops output pattern content to show.In order to minimize user with calculate equipment 10 interact so as to make calculating equipment
10 are presented him or she in graphical information the time it takes amount desired at that time, and UI module 20 can be automatic (for example, not having to user
Intervene) prediction, infer or determine, to which associated corresponding GUI of one of application module 30 in specific time at UID 12
It presents, navigates to corresponding GUI in the specific time without user.
For example, when calculate equipment 10 activate UID 12 when, UI module 20 can make UID 12 present default GUI or with behaviour
Make the associated GUI of system, input can be provided from the GUI user to navigate and call special characteristic, function or is set in calculating
The application 30 executed at standby 10.When calculating the activation UID 12 of equipment 10, access modules 24 can make UI module 20 that GUI be presented
14.When the limitation access that access modules 24 make calculating equipment 10 that GUI 14 be presented from UID 12 is converted to full operational state
When, UI module 20 can be inferred based on the context of the calculating equipment 10 received from context module 22, predicted or be determined whether
The GUI (for example, GUI 16A) of one of the application 30 used before presenting, or present associated with the notice received recently
Application one of 30 GUI (for example, GUI 16N).
UI module 20 can determine it is associated with each application module 30, this will be wanted access in specific time user answer
The corresponding possibility degree (for example, probability, score) of GUI, and changed from a state calculating equipment 10
To after another state, the GUI with highest possibility degree is presented at UID 12.In other words, UI module 20 can be with
Assign probability, score and/or possibility degree to each application module 30.In order to minimize user from a GUI navigation under
One the time it takes, calculating equipment 10, from UID 12, output pattern content has not been turned with the limitation mode of operation that shows
It changes to UID 12 and restores the output of graphical content so that after the full operational state that shows, UI module 20 can be presented in UI module 20
It determines the GUI of one of most probable application module 30 accessible by user.
UI module 20 can be based on the associated corresponding possibility degree of each application module 30 from context mould
The context for the calculating equipment 10 that block 22 receives.In other words, UI module 20 can be based on field received by calculating equipment 10
Border information determines which or multiple application modules 30 " being relevant in terms of context " calculate the identified context of equipment 10.
As used herein, if one or more application module 30 has in specific time and calculate the field of equipment 10
Border (for example, position, event, meeting or other to the associated characteristic of context) relevant content, one or more attributes and/
Or one or more characteristics, the one or more application module 30 can be with context correlations.For example, the context for calculating equipment 10 can be with
Indicate that calculating equipment 10 has similar to when people when reading the information at the screen for being presented on and calculating equipment hold by calculating equipment 10
Direction when in manpower towards degree.One or more application module 30 can be executed and be read (for example, at UID 12
E-book or the page of document etc. is presented) relevant function.UI module 20 can be determined when the context instruction for calculating equipment 10
When calculate equipment 10 is hold as this book, context is and the one or more application module of execution relevant function with reading
30 contexts are relevant.
In some instances, file UI module 20 can receive context information from context module 22 essentially in real time.At it
In its example, UI module 20 can receive context information from context module 22 at the various moment earlier and be come using information earlier
Study and generation rule (for example, using artificial intelligence or machine learning techniques) are to determine 30 context of one or more application module
It is related and may be used by a user and calculate equipment 10 the access of particular moment later a possibility that.For example, UI module 20 can be with
There is provided calculate the context of equipment 10 as input to based on machine learning or regular system determine user will want with field
A possibility that border associated particular moment accesses one or more application module 30.UI module 20 can be from based on machine learning
Or the system of rule will most probably want to which application accessed in particular moment as the output probability of acceptance, score or instruction user
Other instructions of module 30.In some instances, UI module 20 can be by two highest order application modules 30 (for example, having
Two application modules 30 of highest possibility degree) application module 30 accessing as most recent of ranking or and most recent
The notice received is (for example, be converted to second or limitation mode of operation from first or full operational state since calculating equipment 10
The notice being most recently received afterwards) an associated application module 30.
Technology is described in further detail presently in connection with Fig. 1.In the specific non-restrictive example of Fig. 1, calculates equipment 10 and exist
It, can be from operating in the first operation shape when output is to show with the first application associated graphic user interface in multiple applications
State, which is converted to, operates in the second mode of operation.For example, when access modules 24 make calculating equipment 10 operate in complete access module
When, application module 30A (for example, web browser application) can send graphical content to UI module 20 so that UID 12 is in UID
GUI 16A is presented at 12.When the user for calculating equipment 10 cooks, it can be located in his or her family kitchen and watch
The recipe presented in GUI 16A.Fig. 1 is shown, and at the moment 0, after inactive period from the user, access modules 24 can
It is converted to limitation mode of operation so that calculating equipment 10 and deactivates or stop to power to UID12.
After the moment 0, when operating in the second mode of operation, phase can be applied with first to avoid output by calculating equipment 10
Associated graphic user interface, and receive and apply associated notice with second in multiple applications.For example, when calculating equipment
10 operate in limitation mode of operation when, access modules 24 can make UI module 20 avoid at UID 12 export GUI 16A (example
Such as, in order to save electric power).In addition, application module 30N is (for example, notice when calculating equipment 10 operates in limitation mode of operation
It is served by) it can receive to the new notice received by calculating equipment 10 (for example, Email, instant message, voice/view
Frequency message) instruction (for example, data).Notice can be queued in by application module 30N will be in some following point (for example, working as UID
12 when being reactivated) it is rendered as in the notification queue of graphical content.
The context for calculating equipment 10 can be determined by calculating equipment 10.For example, context module 22 can periodically update calculating
The degree of the position of equipment 10 or determination direction associated with equipment 10 is calculated.When determining context, context module 22 can
With determine it is following at least one: position associated with equipment 10 is calculated, time of day, movement associated with calculating equipment 10
Degree, with calculate the associated direction of equipment 10, with calculate the associated air pressure of equipment 10 or with calculating equipment 10 it is associated
Ambient light level.By determine context, context module 22 can determine calculate equipment whether in the pocket of user, in desktop
It is upper, in manpower etc., and provide about calculate light, direction or the context information of placement of equipment 10 to UI module 20 so as to
More preferable prediction user may want to which GUI accessed.
Context module 22 can be with output position data to UI module 20, and data instruction is since calculating equipment 10 from UID 12
The UID12 of the full operational state transformation of GUI 16A till now is presented to shut down and stop display GUI 16A, calculates equipment 10
Position changes not yet.
It is based at least partially on context and notice, UI module 20 can determine that user associated with equipment is calculated will count
Equipment is calculated to operate in after the first mode of operation and answer in user's access first from operating in the second mode of operation and be converted to
With degree a possibility that the second application (for example, application module 30N) of access before.In other words, UI module 20 is it is expected that meter
The user for calculating equipment 10 will be more likely to want the initially access after calculating equipment 10 and having changed back to full operational state and answer
It is applied with which of module 30.
UI module 20 can be inputted from the context information that context module 22 obtains to the algorithm based on machine learning or rule
In and determine associated with application module 30 possibility degree to identify with sufficiently high possibility degree to indicate to use
Family may want to access one of application module 30 of the application first.For example, UI module 20 can be gone through with input position history, direction
History or other context informations are into the machine learning algorithm of UI module 20.For example, if calculating the context instruction of equipment 10, since
Since calculating 10 last time of equipment is converted to limitation mode of operation, the position for calculating equipment 10 and/or the direction for calculating equipment 10 do not have
If having change, the machine learning algorithm of UI module 20 can determine high probability (for example, being greater than 50 percent): count
When calculating the output of graphical content of the recovery of equipment 10 at UID 12, user will think before one of any other application module 30
Access application module 30A (for example, the application finally used before transformation).Because notice be by application module 30N recently
Received, UI module 20 can determine that user is in office once calculating the presentation for the graphical content that equipment 10 is restored at UID 12
A possibility that may want to access application module 30N before what other application degree.UI module 20 can determine more small probability (example
Such as, ten) less than 5 percent: if information for example associated with notifying is (for example, text information, time data, type
Data, user data etc.) indicate that notice is unrelated with the current context of equipment 10 is calculated, user may want to access application module
30N。
From operating in after the second mode of operation is converted to and operates in the first mode of operation, and may in response to determining
Property degree meet possibility threshold value, calculate equipment 10 may output with show with the second associated graphic user interface of application or
Associated graphic user interface is applied with first.For example, user can provide input (for example, hand at the position of UID 12
Gesture).Access modules 24 can make UI module 20 export GUI 14 to show.User can provide additional defeated at UID 12
Enter, at this time at the position of the display release region 18 of UID 12.Access modules 24 can determine and at release region 18
Input associated touch event meet access modules 24 make calculate equipment 10 from operate in limitation mode of operation be converted to behaviour
Make in the certificate of full operational state.
In moment 1A, calculating equipment 10 can determine that possibility degree associated with application module 30A is more than threshold value (example
Such as, 5 percent ten).In this way, when UI module 20 receives recovery output pattern content at UID 12 from access modules 24
When order, UI module 20 can make UID 12 that GUI 16A (for example, the GUI for the application that most recent uses) be presented automatically.
Fig. 1 is further illustrated, and in some instances, is operating in first from operating in the second mode of operation and be converted to
After mode of operation, and in response to determine associated with application module 30N possibility degree more than threshold value and be than with answer
With the higher possibility degree of the associated possibility degree of module 30A, calculating equipment 10 can be to avoid output and the first application
Associated graphic user interface, but export to show and apply associated graphic user interface with second.In other words, UI
Module 20 can determine possibility associated with application module 30A it is insufficient it is sufficiently high with guarantee GUI 16A immediately and from
Dynamic display, but the sufficiently high display to guarantee GUI 16N of possibility associated with application module 30N.In this way, in moment 1B,
Since application module 30N is (for example, be converted to second or limitation operation shape from first or full operational state since calculating equipment 10
Since state, associated application has been notified with what is be most recently received), UI module 20 can make UID 12 present at UID 12
The GUI 16N of application module 30N.
In this way, the notice for calculating the context of equipment and receiving can be depended on according to the calculating equipment of these technologies, from
It is dynamic to present it is more likely that in the interested GUI of specific time user.After restoring that graphical content is presented, GUI is being presented or is permitting
Perhaps access may be before the application that specific time user is most interested in, and calculating equipment can take less time, and dive
Needing less additional input from the user.Once calculating equipment to be configured as restoring that graphical content is presented, pass through determination
User wants what is watched, and user's offer input can be mitigated to navigate to the demand of specific GUI by calculating equipment.By mitigate or
Person at least reduces required input amount from the user, and when user interacts with calculating equipment, calculating equipment can receive less mistake
Erroneous input.By reducing the quantity of input from the user, and the quantity of mistake input is reduced, calculating equipment can execute more
Few operation and the less electric power of consumption.

Family will want which application module accessed when calculating equipment 10 and being converted to different modes of operation from a mode of operation
30.It is set in general, the prediction module 64 of UI module 20 can receive " context " from context module 22 and determine to calculate based on context
Whether standby 10 user is more likely to want to interact with one of the application module 30 that most recent accesses or whether user is more likely to think
What is accessed and be most recently received notifies one of related application module 30.
For example, prediction module 26 may rely on machine learning algorithm and/or rule-based system comes for each application
Module 30 determines that the user for calculating equipment 10 will want calculating equipment 10 from the second mode of operation (for example, limitation operation
State) be converted to access after the first mode of operation (for example, full operational state) application module 30 it is corresponding a possibility that
Degree (for example, probability).Prediction module 26 can provide calculate equipment 10 context as input to machine learning algorithm and/or
Rule-based system and receive corresponding probability, binary result or instruction compared to each other application module 30
User is by other values a possibility that desiring access to application module 30.
Prediction module 26 can periodically update calculated possibility degree associated with application module 30.For example,
At the first moment, when calculating equipment 10 and initially from the first mode of operation being converted to the second mode of operation, prediction module 26
It can determine a possibility that associated with application module 30A initial degree.In following instant, for example, being connect calculating equipment 10
It receives after notice associated with application module 30N and/or when calculating the scene change of equipment 10, prediction module 26 can be with
Determine update associated with application module 30A a possibility that degree, may it is higher than predetermined possibility degree or
It is lower.
In operation, when output is to show with the first associated graphic user interface of application in multiple applications, calculate
Equipment 10 can operate in the second mode of operation from operating in the first mode of operation and being converted to.For example, when UI module 20 makes UID
When 12 presentation GUI (for example, GUI 16A) associated with application module 30A, access modules 24 be can detecte in input equipment 42
The input at place is (for example, Client-initiated order enters standby mode and operate in limitation operation shape so that calculating equipment 10
State).In response to input, access modules 24 can deactivate UID 12 and UI module to stop to export GUI 16A to show.
When operating in the second mode of operation, calculating equipment 10 can be used to avoid output with the first associated figure of application
Family interface, and receive and apply associated notice with second in multiple applications.For example, entering limitation behaviour calculating equipment 10
After making state, prediction module 26 can receive context associated with equipment 10 is calculated from context module 22.
When and if calculate equipment 10 changed back to full operational state when, later, prediction module 26 can protect
It deposits or stores context and determine that the user for calculating equipment 10 may want to restore a possibility that interacting with application module 30A journey
Degree.Application module 30N can be notified from notice service reception and be queued to notice will be in certain following point (for example, working as UID
12 when being reactivated) it presents as in the notification queue of graphical content.Because of application module 30N and the notice received recently
It is associated, when and if prediction module 26 can determine calculating when calculating equipment 10 and having changed back to full operational state
The user of equipment 10 may want to restore a possibility that interacting with application module 30N degree.Prediction module 26 can periodically connect
The context updated is received, and depends on context whether to change and determine instruction application module 30A and/or 30N being to work as to calculate equipment
10 users when returning to full operational state are by degree a possibility that the update for wishing the preferred application module 30 immediately accessed.
From operating in after the second mode of operation is converted to and operates in the first mode of operation, and may in response to determining
Property degree meet possibility threshold value, calculating equipment 10 can export to show and the first associated graphic user interface of application.
For example, access modules 24, which can order, calculates equipment 10 and 20 recovery operation of UI module in full operational state.UI module 20 can
To analyze the answering with highest possibility degree with the associated corresponding possibility degree of each application module 30 and selection
Use one of module 30 as in the application module 30 that user will desire access to when being reactivated of UID 12.When and if can
When energy property degree is more than with other application 30 associated corresponding possibility degree of module, UI module 20 can be determined using mould
A possibility that block 30A, degree met threshold value.In other words, when UI module 20 is determining whether in any other application module 30
When the GUI 16A of application module 16A being presented before any other GUI, threshold value can correspond to associated with application module 30N
