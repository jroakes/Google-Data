Fig. 2 illustrates this locality communication between a plurality of 200 mobile radio stations 202,204,206,208,210,212.In Fig. 2, each mobile radio station be at least discontinuously together isomorphism become other mobile radio station of local group 214 to carry out radio communication.For radio communication, what local group 214 was used is the low power wireless communication technology, such as bluetooth.Also can use other suitable wireless communication technology or agreement.In explanation embodiment, each mobile radio station can communicate with other each mobile radio station on relatively short distance.For example, each other in ten meters, just can set up the reliable radio communication that provides bi-directional data and out of Memory to launch at mobile radio station.In addition, for the Radio Link shown in Fig. 2, also can set up cross link.For example, mobile radio station 206 can communicate with mobile radio station 210, and mobile radio station 204 can communicate with mobile radio station 208.
Therefore, the local wireless circuit of each mobile site allows to carry out the Local Radio Communications of data and out of Memory.Preferably, the member in the supervision group, and member tabulation maintained at least one member.In in newcomer's adding group, they just can add session.When the member leaves, may notify leaving away of they, or not announce leaving away of they.Preferably, carrying out radio communication on this rank, is sightless basically for the user of each mobile radio station.Yet the Radio Link of setting up between mobile radio station provides a kind of and can have been used by each wireless device or their user, to carry out the resource of file transfer or transmission out of Memory.
Fig. 3 illustrates and be used for sharing the method for handling load between the member of the local communication set 300 of wireless communication system shown in Figure 1 100.Local group 300 comprises first mobile radio station 304 and relevant mobile radio station, such as mobile radio station 308.Specify first mobile radio station 304 to represent member's reception transmitting in the group from remote radio equipment.This appointment is to make by the member in the group is collaborative.
Although show the approximate central authorities that are positioned at group 200 of mobile radio station of appointment at Fig. 3, this is for the purpose of the convenience.The member of group 300 can be distributed in any suitable position, and unique restriction is to transmit and receive reliably.The member of group 300 can be in the not chummery of building or on the different floor.
In Fig. 3 among the embodiment of graphic extension, first mobile radio station, 304 receiving downlink wireless transmission signal 302.In explanation embodiment, downlink wireless transmits and 302 uses mobile communication protocol emission such as cell phone system by all remote radio equipments of going into base station of wireless telephone system.Downlink wireless transmits and 302 can comprise the data of representing voice or out of Memory.In addition or in fact, downlink wireless transmits and may comprise Alarm Communication such as paging channel.
First mobile radio station 302 is judged transmit 302 recipient of downlink wireless.This passes through (for example) demodulation sign indicating number downlink transmission signal 302, and reads the data that are embedded in the down link signal 302 and finish.The recipient is by by the mobile logo that embeds corresponding to the data in recipient, paging channel or the voice channel number, or other suitable method is determined.
When the recipient corresponding to relevant mobile radio station or when organizing other member in 300, first mobile radio station 304 just will transmit 302 information on (such as the link 306 that is transmitted into second mobile radio station 308) on the low-power local wireless about downlink wireless, be transmitted into relevant mobile radio station.In one embodiment, information broadcast is given all members of group 300.In another embodiment, information is encoded and encrypts, so that have only recipient's (mobile radio station 308) to receive.
Relevant mobile radio station (mobile radio station 308) can with any one easily mode be associated with first mobile radio station.Here can imagine that the member of local communication set 300 will share identification information with other wireless device in the set of wireless devices 300.The member of group collaborative receiving downlink between them transmits (such as downlink transmission signal 302), and specifies reception mobile radio station (such as mobile radio station 304) to come the receiving downlink signal.Then, the mobile radio station of appointment receives, decodes and handles the downlink transmission signal, it is sent to the recipient in the radio communication group 300.
Paging channel on a kind of down link 302 in particular cases, the mobile site of appointment subsequently receives the paging channel from the remote radio equipment of the wireless communication system that mobile radio station moved.The mobile radio station of appointment is discerned the recipient of paging channel in paging channel, judge the correspondence of recipient and their identification informations separately then for the one or more wireless devices in the group.For example, the identification information of Gong Xianging may be stored in the memory of mobile radio station of appointment.When receiving paging channel or other communication, search for canned data with sign recipient's down link signal in information be complementary.If found the information of coupling, just will be transmitted to the recipient about the information of down link signal or paging channel.If do not have coupling or corresponding information, just abandon down link signal or paging channel.Therefore, first mobile radio station 304 other member in the radio communication group, between a plurality of mobile radio websites that comprise at least one relevant mobile radio station (second mobile site 308) (group 300), the follow-up downlink wireless of collaborative reception transmits.
Whole mobile radio stations except a mobile radio station are not the websites of appointment.Just as the situation of the mobile radio station of appointment, other wireless device in unspecified mobile radio station and the local wireless devices group is shared identification information.These not intended wireless device receive the appointment of free local group, be used to all wireless device paging receiving channels and other downlink transmission signal in the local group wireless device, about the information of paging channel and other downlink transmission signal.
Therefore, no matter when when one group of user accumulates in very near distance, make the method and apparatus that explains through diagrams, just can reduce the processing load on any mobile radio station in the group by sharing the processing load between the mobile radio station in group.For example, the user of mobile radio station in group accumulates in the place of heavy traffic, or in privately owned place when (such as at the meeting room meeting), these users can use two wireless communication systems that separate.First wireless communication system provides the duplex radiophone service for the voice-and-data emission.Local communication system (such as bluetooth) provides second wireless communication system.
According to explanation embodiment, decoding work is distributed between all members in the group of the mobile radio station in the scope of each other local radio communication circuit, rather than by each mobile radio station independently the demodulation sign indicating number from the down link signal of the base station of first wireless communication system.In this manner, in a preset time, have only a mobile radio station to need decode downlink signals.Other mobile radio station does not need to the required analog front circuit of receiving downlink signal, decoder, controller and suchlike partial power on.Signal is a member who sends in the group if the mobile radio station of appointment is judged downlink transmission, will send the recipient to about the information of downlink transmission signal on local wireless.After the mobile radio station of appointment receives the decode information, just with the result by short distance, lower powered local wireless communications link, send in the group all contiguous equipment.
Decode operation can be distributed between user's group in any suitable manner.In one embodiment, among a plurality of mobile radio stations in the group, first mobile radio station of specifying a mobile radio station to transmit selectively as receiving downlink.In another embodiment, among a plurality of mobile radio stations in the group, decoding work may be finished as first mobile radio station of decoding downlink transmission signal by sequentially specifying a mobile radio station in a plurality of mobile radio stations.
In first example of this embodiment, sequentially specify each mobile radio station receiving downlink signal in a predefined time cycle.After this past time cycle, in order, give another mobile radio station with the responsibility that receiving downlink transmits.
In second example, each mobile radio station receives the downlink transmission signal of predefine quantity, transmits such as one.After reaching predefined quantity, give mobile radio station follow-up in the group with the responsibility that receiving downlink transmits.
At another one embodiment, may between a plurality of mobile radio stations, determine a mobile radio station with best wireless receiving characteristic.An example is to determine best received signal intensity indication (RSSI).Then, determined mobile radio station may be appointed as and be used for first mobile radio station that receiving downlink transmits in the group.For example, in meeting room, a user is near window in the user of mobile radio station group, and has under the situation about receiving preferably from the ability of the downlink transmission signal of remote radio equipment, and this embodiment may be suitable especially.
Here also have an embodiment, may between a plurality of mobile radio stations, determine a mobile radio station with special battery capacity.This may comprise that determining one has the maximum battery capacity mobile radio station of (such as maximum storing electricity or long discharge time), may comprise that maybe determining one has the minimum battery capacity mobile radio station of (such as minimum storing electricity or the shortest discharge time).An example is to judge the sign of the remaining power energy of each mobile radio station.Each mobile radio station is informed its remaining power energy the member in the local group again.According to this information, determine a mobile radio station with special battery energy.By using this information, for example,, the mobile radio station of determining can be appointed as first mobile radio station that receiving downlink transmits if it has maximum energy contents of battery.On the contrary, if the mobile radio station of determining is to have the minimum energy content of battery, then may indicate not with its first mobile radio station that transmits as receiving downlink.
Fig. 4 illustrates the method for the prior art of emission wireless signal in the wireless communication system of time division multiplexing (TDD).In the TDD system, hocket to the downlink transmission signal of mobile site in uplink transmit signals from the mobile site to the base station and base station.Therefore, first uplink transmit signals, 402 back are downlink transmission signals 406.Downlink transmission signal 406 back are follow-up uplink transmit signals 408.Each downlink transmission signal also further is subdivided into a plurality of time slots.In Fig. 4, downlink transmission signal 406 comprises first time slot 410, second time slot 412, the 3rd time slot 414 and the 4th time slot 416.In the system of graphic extension, for each independently time slot 410,412,414,416 distribute a plurality of users.Therefore, with reference to the mobile radio station group 300 among the figure 3, in first time slot 410, downlink time slots distributed to first mobile radio station 304 that is labeled as S1.In such wireless communication system, each website must receive in being assigned to its time slot and transmit, and to decoding at gap information, with the recipient who determines to transmit.The zone that is labeled as S1 of first time slot is corresponding to the information that transmits that sends to the first mobile radio station S1.The time slot of cross-hatched area has shown other user's communications of distributing in the system.By similar mode, the mobile radio station that is labeled as S2 and S3 is distributed to second downlink time slots 412.Further, with other member in the group, the mobile radio station that is labeled as S4, S5 and S6 is distributed to third and fourth time slot 414,416.In prior art embodiments shown in Figure 4,, give the base station with time slot allocation randomly for any mobile radio station.
By the mobile radio station in the designated groups in such a way, by group specified be used for whole time slots that mobile radio station that receiving downlink transmits must receiving downlink signal 406, but do not need to power up for uplink signal 402,408.The mobile site of appointment reduces power consumption by during uplink signal 402,408 its receiving circuit being cut off the power supply.
Fig. 5 illustrates the sequential chart that distributes time slot in the wireless communication system in claim 1.In Fig. 5, uplink transmit time 402,408 and downlink transmission time 410 remain alternately.Similar part among Fig. 5 and Fig. 4 is, down link signal 410 still is divided into four time slots, comprises time slot 410,412,414,416.Yet in the system of Fig. 5 graphic extension, the radio communication that sends to any mobile radio station in a plurality of or the one group of mobile site is launched in same predefined common period.Can select any time as cycle common time.In the embodiment shown in fig. 5, the times selected cycle is a time slot 410.As shown in the figure, these transmit (if any) that are transmitted into the mobile radio station that is labeled as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 all are dispensed on emission in first time slot 410.
In this manner, time slot has been carried out optimum distribution, all users in guaranteeing to organize send in same time slot.This has simplified the decoding to information, sends to all mobile radio stations in the group in the mobile radio station of described information in group.So just avoided shown in Fig. 4, contiguous user's information is distributed in a plurality of time slots 410,412,414,416 situation.In Fig. 5, all users share same time slot 410, this means that the mobile radio station of appointment only needs to power up for its receiving circuit during first time slot 410.
Realize this point, require to have information about the sign of the mobile radio station that forms this group to the base station of mobile site emission information.Therefore, a mobile site in the group preferably a mobile site from the wireless communication system identification information of each mobile site that will be used for a plurality of mobile sites from a plurality of mobile sites be transmitted into remote radio equipment.
