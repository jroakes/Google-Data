In frame 606, decoder 400 selects tone to determine the frequency of those tones.In some embodiments, decode
Device 400 selects the tone of maximum to determine frequency.For example, decoder 400 can select two tones with peak power.Such as
It is described in more detail below, then decoder 400 can use the maximum tone to determine combination of frequency.
In block 608, the estimate symbol phase of decoder 400.
Fig. 7 B illustrate the example peak 710,712 and 714 according to some embodiments.The identification data signals of decoder 400
Peak (for example, peak 710,712 and 714) so that the symbol phase of DTMF symbols in data-signal is synchronous.
In each embodiment, in order that signal is divided into the frame that length is T by symbol frame synchronization, decoder 400, often
Individual frame encodes a symbol.Decoder 400 makes the Phase synchronization of frame, to determine when interval is corresponding with frame.
In order to estimate frame phase, decoder 400 is calculated
Then it is τ by frame phase estimation*=arg maxτ amax(τ) modulo T. this allow in time migration τn=τ*+
Tn. place quotes the correlation in n-th frame.
In block 610, decoder 400 and then each combination of frequency is mapped to symbol, so as to according to the combination of frequency come
Determine symbol.As described above, each combination of frequency includes one or more of frequency frequency.
In frame 612, then decoder 400 determines data according to symbol.Then, occur neatly connecing in the set time
The broadcast of receipts is used as the big output of the K pitch detector in pitch detector and its in pitch detector
The small output of his pitch detector.In some embodiments, decoder 400 is then using inverse mapping S-1It is big by K to determine
The symbol that the combination of pitch frequency is represented.
Depending on such as computational efficiency, noise robustness and to move (Doppler frequency shift) robustness target weight
, there are the several ways that can realize pitch detector in the property wanted.The example for being described in more detail below such detector is implemented
Mode.
In some embodiments, decoder 400 can use simple pitch detector.For example, pitch detector 402
It can be simple pitch detector.In each embodiment, the incoherent simple tone detector in phase.For with
In detection frequencyTone simple tone detector, detector 400 can calculate：
Complex base band, and the second row estimation local signal power are converted under the first row, wherein h (t) is following form
Second order gamma (Gamma) smoothing filter：
Wherein τ is the time constant for controlling filter bandwidht.
As it was previously stated, the energy of tone is spread by tone window in Fourier domain.Detector wave filter h should be selected
(t) bandwidth so that it captures the energy of most of tone.In each embodiment, bandwidth is sufficiently wide to tolerate Doppler
Frequency displacement.If most probable velocity is vmax, then the pitch frequency satisfaction observed：
Wherein c is the velocity of sound (being 340m/s near sea level).
Correspondingly, when the wider bandwidth in Fourier domain means that impulse response h (t) should more be concentrated on than window w (t)
In domain.In order to realize more noise reductions, decoder 400 can apply the second smoothing filter g (t) so that detector
Whole structure is assembled in whole length of window,
Although simple pitch detector is uncorrelated on signals Phase, the formula is practical and reliable tone inspection
Survey device.Simple pitch detector may not make full use of b (t) complex phase, because final score value is being polymerize into it with g (t)
It is preceding that it is eliminated by square magnitude (square magnitude) computing.
In some embodiments, decoder 400 can use relevant tonal detector, to make full use of answering for b (t)
Phase.For example, pitch detector 402 can be relevant tonal detector.In each embodiment, relevant tonal detector is phase
Related more complicated pitch detector on position, it improves noise robustness relative to simple detector.
Relevant tonal detector starts in a similar way, modulates to move down into complex base band first
Then extracted (decimation).Due to Doppler frequency shift, there is the residual modulation of frequency on signalBase
Band signal only takes up small bandwidth near 0Hz, therefore extraction may be quite radical.Decoder 400 is averaged to hold by unit
The row extraction.Then, decoder 400 is carried out smoothly using gamma filter, and then carries out down-sampling to result.
Following steps are the relevant tonal detector places different from simple tone detector.Preset time offset THS and many
General Le frequency displacement δ, the baseband signal of extraction is related to DTMF tone window,
Fig. 8 A illustrate the example tone window 800 according to some realizations.As illustrated, decoder 400 uses M=10
Block to perform tone window w (t) least square fitting that block contributes weight.
Fig. 8 B illustrate the exemplary plot of the contribution weight 810 according to some embodiments.It is illustrated that each piece independent
Contribute weight.
In each embodiment, when the actual time and frequency shift (FS) of (τ, δ) matched signal, the value is maximum.
In some embodiments, decoder 400 up-samples (τ, δ) to perform strong search (brute force in grid
search)。
In order to efficiently calculate correlation, integrating range [0, T] is approximately M section by decoder 400, and will be modulated approximate
To have constant phase on each section,
Wherein M is the number of block.
It shown below how decoder 400 approximate obtains further efficiency by another.Block is relatedb
(t+ τ) w (t) dt are relative with the block of window, and it is smooth function.Decoder 400 can contemplate the approximate of following form
Wherein wmIt is the wave filter corresponding with w (t) block.These impulse responses of these wave filters are allowed to have one
It is a little overlapping, and least square fitting its be used so that combinations thereof is similar to w (t).
In some embodiments, decoder 400 makes tone correlation criterion so that input is unchangeably multiplied by perseverance by system
The certainty ratio factor.In some embodiments, decoder 400 also carries out criterion to cause noise by criterion to tone correlation
Change.Noise is carried out criterion to determine signal in the way of allowing the score value of generation being compared with fixed constant threshold
Quality.
Tone correlation is power signal, because the amplitude that they are square.If baseband signal is white Gauss noise, sound
Phase modulation is closed and x2(2) proportionally it is distributed, x2(2) there is the average value proportional to baseband noise variance.In some embodiments
In, for effective criterion, decoder 400 can be by tone correlation divided by the partial estimation of noise average.
For each time τ, decoder 400 can perform following operation.In some embodiments, 400 pairs of decoder
In maximized each pitch frequency on δSet up the related list of tone：
In some embodiments, then decoder 400 is ranked up to list.It is assumed that signal to noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently large, then
Maximum K is related to correspond to DTMF tone, and relatively low (N-K) individual value corresponds to noise.Make ΦnoiseIt is and relatively low (N-K)
The corresponding frequency sets of value.(it is sufficient to find k-th maximum, because list need not sort completely).
In some embodiments, decoder 400 then will be in δ and in ΦnoiseIn frequency on to tone correlation sum：
In some embodiments, decoder 400 carrys out smooth noise associated averages in time using smoothing filter g
Then, μ is measurednoise(t) it is approx proportional to baseband noise variance.Tone it is related by pointwise divided by
And criterion,
The correlation with best match Doppler frequency shift is then used only, therefore it can be maximized on δ,
In each embodiment, when decoder 400 is decoded to symbol, the DTMF symbols neatly received should
Produce K big tone related related to (N-K) individual small tone.In each embodiment, decoder 400 can be applied following
One or more of pre-defined rule is for broadcast detection and avoids the mistake caused by interference.Retouch in more detail below
State such pre-defined rule.
In some embodiments, the big correlation less than K may indicate that no DTMF broadcast is movable, and institute
Any tone heard all is ambient noise.In some embodiments, the big tone more than K shows to exist and DTMF is broadcasted
Strong interference, and if k-th maximal correlation is not separated well with (K+1) individual maximal correlation, then can not carry out
Decoding unambiguously.According to these rules, decoder can recognize the frame for seeming the presence of effective DTMF symbols, and in decoding
Only include these frames.
