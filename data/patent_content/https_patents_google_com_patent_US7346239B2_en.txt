Definitions
- the present invention relates to a device for crossing optical beams, in particular in an integrated optical circuit.
- optical telecommunication systems information is typically coded in short optical pulses by suitable optical sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or semiconductor lasers, which pulses are transmitted along an optical-fibre network and received by photodetectors.
- suitable optical sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or semiconductor lasers, which pulses are transmitted along an optical-fibre network and received by photodetectors.
- LEDs light-emitting diodes
- semiconductor lasers which pulses are transmitted along an optical-fibre network and received by photodetectors.
- TDM time-division multiplexing
- a simple way of increasing the amount of data that can be transmitted by a single optical fibre is to make the incoming electronic bits as short as possible.
- Current optical systems have achieved data rates up to 40 gigabits per second.
- DWDM dense wavelength division multiplexing
- Integrated optical circuits may be either monolithic or hybrid and comprise active and passive components, typically realized on a semiconductor or dielectric substrate, used for coupling between optoelectronic devices and providing signal processing functions.
- integrated circuits provide for designing of integrated components and waveguides substantially in a two-dimensional structure
- one problem in integrated optical circuits is crossing of different waveguides. This problem occurs for example in case of optical switching, where a plurality of optical inputs are directed to a plurality of optical outputs, and crossing is necessary in order for each input to connect to every output.
- U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,860 provides a solution to this problem by providing, at the intersection between two waveguides, a photonic crystal resonator.
- Photonic crystals are dielectric structures having a periodic variation (or modulation) of the dielectric constant along one, two or three directions of space (and the crystal is therefore referred to as a 1-D, 2-D or 3-D photonic crystal).
- a 2-D photonic crystal typically comprises a piece of dielectric material (for example an optically thin slab) wherein a periodic array of regions of different refractive index is realized. These regions may be defined, for example, by cylinders filled of air or other predetermined substances or materials.
- Photonic crystals have band gaps that restrict the propagation of light in certain frequency ranges. Their discovery in recent years has caused a rethinking of conventional methods for manipulating light, and has led to proposals for many novel optical devices. In particular, it has been shown that a linear defect in a photonic crystal (i.e. a break in the periodicity of the crystal along one line) allows light with wavelength within the bandgap to be guided, by relying on the band gap restriction instead of index confinement to prevent light from escaping. Similarly, a defect at a single location (a point defect) creates a resonant cavity, which traps light in a small region.
- a linear defect in a photonic crystal i.e. a break in the periodicity of the crystal along one line
- index confinement instead of index confinement to prevent light from escaping.
- a defect at a single location creates a resonant cavity, which traps light in a small region.
- FIG. 1 shows one possible embodiments as depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,860.
- a photonic crystal 10 has a first and a second waveguide 11 , 12 perpendicular to each other, defined by respective linear defects, and a resonant crossing region 13 , formed by a single defect.
- the single defect is defined by a dielectric rod of larger radius than the other rods of the crystal.
- the situation is described by simple one-dimensional resonant tunneling, wherein the crossing waveguide is effectively invisible.
- a guided mode when incident upon the crossing from one of the waveguides, it can only couple to the resonant state that is symmetric with respect to the axis of that waveguide.
- the other resonant state which is anti-symmetric, is orthogonal to that guided mode by symmetry.
- the symmetric resonant state can only decay into the input and output waveguides, since this state is orthogonal to the modes in the crossing waveguide.
- This structure allows optical modes to propagate with 100% transmission (throughput) from an input waveguide to the output waveguide on the opposite side of a crossing, with no reflection and with 0% transmission (crosstalk) to the crossing waveguide.
- the Applicant has considered possible different X-crossing structures using photonic crystals.

- planar photonic crystal may have, under certain conditions, a self-collimation effect in the second energy band (i.e. the energy band over the fundamental band). As disclosed in the article, these conditions determine a negative group velocity.
- the Applicant has further investigated the light propagation properties of regular photonic crystals and considered the possibility of using such structures for X-crossing purposes.
- the Applicant has found that, by opportunely choosing the geometrical and physical characteristics of a photonic crystal and the operative wavelength, it is possible to use such photonic crystal at said wavelength as a X-crossing device having no crosstalk.
- This particular device has no predefinite waveguide since the beams propagating into the device self-collimate, due to an effect of “photon guiding” characteristic of a photonic crystal designed according to the teaching of the present invention. Collimated propagation is allowed along the crystal axes, and the device is therefore suitable for crossing of two beams if the periodic array of the photonic crystal has a square geometry, and two or three beams if the periodic array has a triangular geometry.

- photonic crystal 1 has a structure that does not vary along an axis z parallel to the axes of holes 2 , and that varies periodically in a plane x-y perpendicular to axis z.

- photon guiding or “waveguiding”, is achieved if the photonic crystal 1 is so designed, and the electromagnetic radiation propagating therein has such a wavelength, that a substantial fraction of the energy of the electromagnetic radiation is made to flow in a direction coinciding with one of the crystal axes.

- Preferred conditions for photon guiding may be expressed in terms of variance ⁇ .
- a preferred condition of “photon guiding” along a crystal axis occurs when, starting from a isotropic distribution of the wave vectors within an angular range of 60° ( ⁇ /3) about said axis (which is twice the angular extension of the first irreducible Brillouin zone), the group velocity vectors corresponding to said wave vectors are rearranged, as concerns module and direction, so that at least 50% of the group velocity vectors become directed within an angular range of 20° ( ⁇ /9) about said axis (i.e.

- the Applicant has verified that in such a crossing there is no interaction (i.e., no cross-talk) between the electromagnetic fields of the two beams. Possible X-crossing will be described in the following.
- a same photonic crystal according to the present inventions may be therefore applied in different ways, for example for guiding a plurality of parallel light beams evenly or differently spaced from each other and having the same or different dimensions, or for guiding a plurality of light beam propagating along different directions (coinciding with crystal axes) and having the same or different directions, which may cross each other in a same or in different regions of the crystal (for example: a beam propagating in a first direction may cross, one after the other, two further beams propagating in a second direction; three beams propagating in three different directions may cross in a same region).

- the wave surface represents the wave front that would emerge from a point source. It can be shown that, for each point of the constant energy surface, the corresponding group velocity is directed perpendicular to said surface.
- P. Etchegoin and R. T. Phillips illustrates possible shapes for these surfaces for photon phocusing.
- these surfaces shall have particular shapes, in particular the constant energy surface (in the k x -k y plane) shall have straight portions with the broadest possible extension, and the group velocities shall be directed outwards with respect to the centre of the diagram. The wider and the flatter are said portions, the larger will be the range of group velocities having the same direction (i.e. the more collimated will be the guided light).
- the constant energy surface shall have a substantially hexagonal shape, with straight portions defining the edges of the hexagon.
- the constant energy surface shall have a substantially square shape, and the group velocities will be highly concentrated in the directions perpendicular to the four edges, i.e. in four different directions equally angularly spaced (of ⁇ /2).

- FIG. 4 b shows the corresponding wave surface (v gx -v gy plane).
- a isotropic distribution of the group velocities and in particular an isotropic distribution of the wave vectors about a predetermined crystal axis in an angular range of ⁇ /3 for a triangular array, and of ⁇ /2 for a square array, has to be considered as a starting condition, and the parameters R, n and ⁇ n may be varied for example as follows.
- the parameter R may be varied in a range that is chosen by taking into account the current technological difficulties in realizing large aspect ratio holes arrays in photonic crystals.
- a suitable range is for example between 0.15 and 0.45.
- the parameter n may be is varied in a range of values including those of the currently most suitable dielectric materials for the manufacturing of photonic crystals, such as SiO 2 , SiO x N y and GaAs: for example the values 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.25 and 3.5 may be considered.
- the third parameter ⁇ n may be varied of a predetermined amount (for example 1 ⁇ 10 ⁇ 4 ) in a predetermined range, for example starting from the maximum value ⁇ n,max of the first band, until a predetermined condition is satisfied, as explained below.
- a predetermined amount for example 1 ⁇ 10 ⁇ 4
- the simulation model previously mentioned may be advantageously applied in this stage to each couple of values of R and n within the specified ranges, determining each time the value of ⁇ n that optimizes the distribution of the group velocity r( ⁇ ).
- the parameter ⁇ n is varied of the predetermined amount until the group velocity distribution r( ⁇ ) is optimised in terms of average ⁇ , variance ⁇ , height ⁇ h, kurtosis K and percentage of representative points that are within a predetermined angular range ⁇ about the considered direction.
- This angular range is chosen equal to ⁇ /9 for a triangular array geometry and ⁇ /6 for a square array geometry.
- the optimum value of ⁇ n is the one that minimizes ⁇ and K and maximizes ⁇ h and the percentage of points within the angular range ⁇ .
- FIG. 5 is an illustrative representation of a group velocity distribution, with an indication of the said parameters, which are defined as follows (definition of ⁇ is reported again for sake of clarity):
- K ⁇ i ⁇ ( ⁇ i - ⁇ ) 4 ⁇ r ⁇ ( ⁇ i ) ⁇ i ⁇ r ⁇ ( ⁇ i ) .
- the curve of the group velocity distribution is relatively sharp and has the maximum height ⁇ h. If ⁇ n is varied in one direction or the other with respect to its optimum value, the distribution undergoes an abrupt decrease of ⁇ h, and an increase of the kurtosis K and of the variance ⁇ . In particular, variations of the parameter ⁇ n with respect to said optimum condition determine either a broadening of the distribution or the appearance of a ring in the curve, and it can be demonstrated that both conditions are undesirable.
- All the terns of value of R, n and ⁇ n so detected identify a crystal structure, a bulk material and a wavelength suitable to have photon guiding.
