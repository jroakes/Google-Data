Search encyclopedia---search encyclopedia layer allows user can in electronic encyclopedia, search the text in e-book.User selects text in e-book, then uses search encyclopedia layer to search the text of selecting in encyclopedia.Search encyclopedia layer display of search results (for example relevant encyclopaedical article).
In one embodiment, can use more than one deck and/or can use at same time the Multi-instance e-book content of different choice or mark (for example for) of identical layer at same time.In another embodiment, layer can not be mutually mutual.Although can use multilayer (may for the content of identical selection or mark) simultaneously, layer is isolated mutually.
In one embodiment, client tier support module 144 comprises and enables/stop using layer, starting layer, indicates mark exist and provide application programming interface (API) relevant function to layer.About enabling/stop using layer, client tier support module 144 makes user can enable/stop using layer.Can in layer popup menu, provide the layer that the layer enabled is stopped using as option (referring to the manual starting discussion of layer) can not.Also can automatically show the mark (referring to the automatic starting discussion of layer) associated with the layer of enabling.In one embodiment, it is " starting automatically " that user can indicate the layer of enabling, and this makes layer when electronic reader module 142 shows the e-book content associated to relevant mark, be started (describing below).In one embodiment, graphic user interface is enumerated " installation " layer (depots 128 indication being set by client layer), and user chooses various frames to enable/stop using these layers (and may mark they be " automatically starting ") by choosing/going.Then client tier support module 144 is stored these settings and these is arranged available.
About starting layer, client tier support module 144 starting layers (being the example of layer creating), thus layer module carried out by client device.The example of display layer in the main window of electronic reader module (content that for example layer is dynamically played up).In one embodiment, can be in various patterns, such as stack (floating above whole page e-book content), replace (above specific e content, floating, " hide " thus e-book content), side window lattice (may in the side window lattice adjacent with e-book content, exist with the form of small-sized preview that can be mutual with it) and edge margin (may in the edge margin region in e-book content, exist with the form of very limited preview) in display layer.Electronic reader module 142 allocated display area, layer can be in this viewing area with interior establishment user interface (UI) control.Electronic reader module 142 instruction level are rendered into itself in suitable viewing area, and notify the situation that it plays up itself therein (for example superpose, replacement, side window lattice or edge margin) to layer.The viewing area of distributing depends on the display mode of layer.In one embodiment, layer can not be revised size, the moving display area of its viewing area or in viewing area, create in addition UI element.In another embodiment, layer can be asked character (for example display mode, viewing area size, position, viewing area and peg state) and/or notified any change of its display environment.
In one embodiment, when client tier support module 144 starting layer, client tier support module 144 also sends layer usage data to server layer support module 134.Server layer support module 134 is accumulation layer usage data then.In one embodiment, layer usage data comprises context, e-book situation (referring to layer API and situation object discussion), web browser information and/or the client device information of the layer ID of the layer of starting, the display mode that starts therein layer, user ID, e-book ID, association (for example selecting or mark).
Client tier support module 144 provide manually and automatically these two kinds for starting the mode of layer.The manual starting of layer relates to the ejection window that makes user can start layer.In response to user, select e-book content (being presented by electronic reader module 142), client tier support module 144 is used client available layers module 146 (discussing below) to can be used for and the content exchange of selecting to determine which layer.Then client tier support module 144 shows the popup menu of enumerating available layers.In one embodiment, according to clooating sequence, in popup menu, enumerate available layers.An example of clooating sequence is lexicographic order.Another example of clooating sequence be popularity (for example use certain layer (layer ID) with the certain electric philosophical works (e-book ID) or with the mutual popularity of certain content scope in the certain electric philosophical works).For example the layer usage data based on 134 storages of server layer support module determined popularity.Client tier support module 144 obtains layer usage data from server layer support module 134, and usage data sorts to them with the popularity according to available layers.In response to user, from menu setecting layer entry, use specific display mode about the content of selecting, to start the example of this layer.
The automatic starting of layer relates to the layer data with e-book relevance.In response to e-book content, by electronic reader module 142, shown, client tier support module 144 determines whether any layer data and e-book relevance.If layer data and e-book relevance (if e-book content is by " mark "), whether definite this layer data of client tier support module 144 is indicated and should automatically be started layer.In one embodiment, exist wherein layer data can indicate two kinds of modes should automatically starting layer.A kind of mode is that the layer of layer data (for example layer ID data item in table 1) indication is indicated as being " starting automatically " (part of the discussed above enabling/layer of stopping using) by user.Another way is that the content pattern (for example pattern data item in table 1) of the mark of a) layer data indication is specified the layer that should automatically start layer data indication, and b) layer being enabled by user of layer data indication.Then client tier support module 144 is used specific display mode about layer data and starting layer automatically.Even if attention correlation electron book content is not yet selected by user, automatic landing starting still makes a layer content (mark or data that for example layer provides) shown.
The module of noting layer can must exist at layer example before starting on client device 140.While in one embodiment, receiving available layers list in the step 430 of Fig. 4 from depots 120 to client device 140 transport layer modules (via processing server 130 and network 110).For example transmit the module of the available layers of the module of all available layers or only transmission (as indication in depots 128 is set at client layer) " installation ".In another embodiment, transport layer module when for example attempting, with manual (using popup menu) or (for example, based on layer data) starts layer automatically.For example client tier support module 144 detects and attempts and to server layer support module 134, send (via network 110) for the request of relevant layers module as response.Server layer support module 134 receives request and to client tier support module 144, sends relevant layers module (via network 110) as response.In more another embodiment, what its appropriate time transport layer module in office.
Notice that layer module can exist owing to being transmitted in the past on client device 140.In one embodiment, when ending to carry out, electronic reader module 142 deletes the layer module on client device.In another embodiment, even if the layer module on client device still retains after electronic reader module ends to carry out on client device.If layer module retains, (for example, as module release number is indicated) later update module as required.
About indication mark, exist, client tier support module 144 can visually be indicated the e-book content associated with marking (part for layer data) (being presented by electronic reader module 142).The for example eye-catching demonstration of client tier support module 144 or in addition the patternization e-book content (be called " content of mark ") associated with mark.In one embodiment, client tier support module 144 content of the associated mark of the mark that is activated with its associated layers of indication visually only.In this embodiment, client tier support module 144 is not visually indicated the content of the mark of the mark association that its associated layers is deactivated.
In one embodiment, the Show Styles of the content of mark (" the content pattern of mark ") is configurable from fixing option set.Option for example comprises simple formatting, display mode and automatic landing starting.Simple formatting for example comprises text style option (for example font, color, eye-catching demonstration, italic, runic, underline and add profile) and designator (for example mini-icon or small circle), and these designators shown layer with indication particular type in e-book edge margin or on e-book content side has near content available this position.In one embodiment, in the page slide block that the content of mark presents in electronic reader module 142, be instructed to.This makes user be easy to turn back to the page of the content with mark.Display mode for example comprises, for example, for starting therein the acquiescence of certain layer (layer associated with mark) or preferred display mode (superpose, replacement, side window lattice or edge margin).Automatic starting certain layer (for example layer associated with the mark of the relevance marking) when automatic landing starting appointment should be shown by electronic reader module 142 in the content of mark.Attention can separate use simple formatting, display mode and automatic landing starting.For example, if use automatic landing starting, without simple formatting, the content of mark does not differently occur with the content of non-mark; Yet starting layer automatically when showing the content of mark.
Can on the basis of situation one by one, Show Styles be set, therefore can differently show the different instances (for example for by the green eye-catching demonstration of the eye-catching demonstration comparison of the yellow of the different paragraphs of identical edge margin remarks layer mark) of the e-book content that the mark preserved from identical layer is associated.Attention, when preserving existing mark, can be revised the content pattern of the mark of layer data.For example consider to make epigraph can be added to the epigraph layer of e-book.The content pattern of the mark of the layer data of epigraph layer specifies the content of mark differently not occur with the content of non-mark.Yet when showing the content of mark, in overlay model starting epigraph layer (floating above the whole page e-book content of the content that comprises mark) automatically, and show (as appointment in the mark part of the layer data at epigraph layer) epigraph.User checks epigraph and closes epigraph layer.In response to closing epigraph layer, upgrade the content pattern of the mark of the layer data of writing inscription layer.When specifying in the content that shows mark next time, automatically do not start the pattern upgrading epigraph layer.Replace, icon is shown in edge margin, and can be with visit the epigraph of storing in the mark part of layer data of writing inscription layer.
Notice that layer data must exist before mark (part for layer data) can be shown on client device 140.In one embodiment, in response to the request from client tier support module 144, (via processing server 130 and network 110) (seeing the step 440 and 460 Fig. 4) from depots 120 to client device 140 transport layer data.
In one embodiment, layer can not be drawn its pattern for the content that marks.In this embodiment, client tier support module 144 is used configurable pattern (for example being selected by user) to indicate the content of mark.In one embodiment, layer data can be specified its pattern for the content that marks.For example the content pattern of mark is by pattern data item indication (in Table 1).
In one embodiment, for " layer side window lattice " of e-book, comprise and show region of e-book content and another region (" layer side window lattice ") of display layer content (for example mark).Layer side pane's area is adjacent with e-book content area, and can be big or small different with respect to e-book content area.While showing e-book in side pane view, while showing the content of relevant mark in e-book content area, starting layer (regardless of the content pattern of the mark of appointment in layer data and no matter whether layer is indicated as being " starting automatically ") automatically in side window lattice display mode.In another embodiment, for " layer show " view of e-book shown in single view according to classification, according to conspicuousness or for example, with significant any alternate manner tissue, associated with e-book all layers of content (marking).For example layer shows that view is showing the mark (no matter whether also show e-book content) corresponding with the page of e-book on basis page by page.
The API (being called " layer API ") being provided by client tier support module 144 is provided layer.In one embodiment, client tier support module 144 provides JavaScript API.Layer API comprises various functions.Illustrative functions is below described.
(i) for obtaining the function of following e-book content, for this e-book content layer transferred and layer can adhere to mark (being called " context ") to this e-book content.For example function use is described executable code of object reference (" readjustment ") of context.Context can comprise various types of contents (for example content of text, audio content and picture material).Context can comprise the inclusive segment of a plurality of marks.The section that can identify these marks in whole context is indivedual scopes.Context object is provided for accessing the method for these scopes.
(ii) for preserving content pattern and associated they and the context of mark (part for layer data) and mark, thus the function of replacing the mark of any previous preservation and the content pattern of mark.
(iii) for loading this one deck, previously preserved and the mark (part of layer data) associated with context.
(iv) for the e-book of the navigating function of (which part of controlling e-book is shown by electronic reader module 142).In one embodiment, this function comprises for the one page that navigates backward, the one page that navigates forward, goes to concrete chapters and sections, goes to concrete page, goes to the particular location in page and go to the ability of a particular content (for example image, table or figure).
(v) for for example, the function with interior search (using the function from electronic reader module 142) in e-book.Show search pane, and eye-catching display of search results.It is visual that layer keeps.
(vi) thus for closing the no longer function of display layer of layer example.
