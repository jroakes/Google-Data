where j, k and l are counting or real numbers. Preferred values for j, k and l are: j about 30 seconds; k between about 30 seconds and about 180 seconds; l between about 180 seconds and about 1800 seconds, and greater than 1800 seconds the user is out to lunch. Thus, the UAD value associated with each keyword database entry can be updated by adding a query generated value to the current UAD value. The UAD counter is simply the number of times a user activity has involved the record. Although linear incrementation is preferred, the counter can be fractionally incremented with the fractional amount dependent on the type of user activity involved. Of course, any assignment protocol can be used as long as it discriminates based on user activity.
