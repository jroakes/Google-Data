Fig. 4 is that diagram provides the process flow diagram to the process of the answer of online problem.
In each accompanying drawing, identical reference symbol is indicated identical element.
Embodiment
Fig. 1 is to provide the figure to the system of the automatic answer of online problem.In this system, client 101 can be desktop application or present the web browser for the web application of online chatting.This web browser or desktop application receive input from login user, and using this input as message communicating to another user maybe by this information broadcast to user's group of logining into same service.Client can also be the BBS (Bulletin Board System) application with other users' asynchronous interactive to user's supply.As an alternative, client 101 can also be accept from user's problem and the web portal interface to the answer of problem is provided.
The request that server 111 is positioned at another place, network site and processes from client 101 by its processor 115.Corpus of documents 114, the first storage vault 112 and the second storage vault 113 and server 111 data communication.Corpus of documents 114 is collection of document that search engine crawls by the Internet.The first storage vault 112 storage problems with and corresponding answer, and the second storage vault 113 is configured to keyword set that storage obtains from particular problem and corresponding to the answer of problem.
In some embodiments, server 111 comprises storage vault maintenance module 117 and issue handling module 118 at its storer 116.118 pairs of requests relevant with particular problem from client 101 of issue handling module are processed.Storage vault maintenance module 117, by from corpus of documents 114 extraction problem and answer data, is safeguarded and is upgraded the data in the first storage vault 112 and the second storage vault 113.
In the alternative embodiment, storage vault maintenance module 117 can be deployed on the server that is independent of server 111.Storage vault maintenance module 117 on this separate server and the first storage vault 113 and the second storage vault 114 communicate, and periodically or continue to use new problem and the answer data obtained from corpus of documents 114 to be upgraded the data two storage vaults.
As an alternative, the first storage vault 112 and the second storage vault 113 and corpus of documents 114 can be positioned at place, different network site, and for example the server by the network such as LAN or the Internet and trustship storage vault maintenance module 117 communicates.
Fig. 2 is diagram to answering for storage problem with keyword set, answering the process flow diagram of establishment and the maintenance of right data storage bank.Storage vault maintenance module 117, for example, operation, is responsible for from corpus of documents 114 identification problems-it is right to answer the program with the right data of keyword set for the question answering that is maintained in two storage vaults.Corpus of documents can comprise the usable record file that by search engine, is crawled and be stored in the chatroom message in index data base, the content of webpage etc.As used in this, the stored alternative document of data and the storage scheme that chatroom record, record are stored webpage thereon and provide by chat sessions is provided term " chatroom log file ".Corpus of documents 114 can also be the data storage that receives the content of various users' submissions.Storage vault maintenance module 117 can continue or periodically to any data of recently adding of corpus of documents 114 inquiry, and to these data analysis identify problem that the user submits to and possible answer.
In some embodiments, the personally identifiable information who removes the user answers to process, so that problem does not have associated with corresponding answer with the user.For example, in storage or use problem with before answering, can make problem and answer anonymous in one or more modes, so that remove individual discernible information.Similarly, can make user's identity anonymity so that can not determine individual discernible information for the user, but and any identifying information vague generalization that makes customer problem or answer (for example, carry out vague generalization based on the user population characteristic), rather than be associated with the specific user.Can make to have obtained the user of positional information the geographic position vague generalization (such as to city, postcode or state/province level), so that can not determine user's ad-hoc location.
Following example has illustrated establishment and the maintenance to the data storage vault.Suppose that the user has inputted problem " where is world exposition2010held (where holding World's Fair 2010 ?) in online chat room " and other people have provided answer " Shanghai(Shanghai) ", and search engine has crawled the content of whole dialogue.Storage vault maintenance module 117 can be by coming identification problem and answer by one or more text analyzing routines and/or language analysis routine.For example, storage vault maintenance module 117 can by the identification question mark "? " or keyword " where(is where) " carry out identification problem, and for example next-door neighbour's message after this problem from another user is defined as to the answer to this problem.Storage vault maintenance module 117 can also be used field classification, such as " Q " and " A " specificator, and for example " Q:where isworld exposition2010held " and " A:Shanghai ".
In some embodiments, can further crawl question answering pair from existing web document.The Web document can comprise unique keyword as " problem " and " answer " or such as the simpler specificator of letter " Q " and " A ".In one example, storage vault maintenance module 117 is answered the web document is resolved for potential problems.When having identified the existing of the rear keyword " problem " immediately following colon, it can determine that the text after this keyword is actually problem.Its will be after colon until question mark or fullstop, the text storage till occurring such as first of fullstop etc. is potential problems.
117 pairs of documents of storage vault maintenance module further resolve and identify immediately first the occurring of text string " answer: ", read in this character string after until the text of the first fullstop and the text is stored as to the answer to problem.In some embodiments, calculate end in problem until the distance between the beginning of answering.If find that this distance surpasses threshold value, if such as 50 or 100 characters or identification string " answer: " never, the problem that module 117 will before read abandons as invalid, and advance to into possible character string " problem: " and " answer: " right, the residue text in the web document is resolved.
In some embodiments, in order to keep identified problem and to answer relative being short and sweet, by identified problem with and the length of corresponding answer be limited in maximum length.For example, if problem comprise be greater than 50 characters (or word) if or answer to comprise and be greater than 30 characters (or word), will abandon problem and answer right.
In further embodiment, for record to the difference of particular problem answer with and the respective row name, the answer that can be extracted with the structure storage of following form:
struct?value{
string?answer;
int?count;
}
The text that wherein parameter " answer " storage is answered, and parameter " count " value of illustrating " answer " has been stored the number of times of storehouse maintenance module 117 identifications.Can rank or score value using this counting as this particular answer to problem treat.In some embodiments, be confirmed as the expression that the text of two similar answers can be in character string.For example, can ignore hyphen, it is identical etc. that numeral spelling and numeral can be considered to.
Can utilize various other technologies come identification problem with and corresponding answer.
All described above, the problem that the use particular technology is identified from corpus of documents and answer can be that problem and the answer of incorrect identification is right.The problem of incorrect identification and answering being do not meet one or more predefine standards or put the text of letter threshold value.Can utilize various technology identify inappropriate question answering to and it is got rid of outside storage vault.For example, can get rid of problem or the answer that comprises the rubbish word, can not be resolved, look like random word or character etc.In addition, there is right to also being considered to inappropriate answer lower than the low score value of threshold value within the predetermined period, because this answer may be inaccurate.System can be by tolerating incorrect or inaccurate problem and the answer information in the first storage vault 112 or the second storage vault 113 with these example mistake treatment technologies.
In some embodiments, the problem of institute's identification and answer before can be in being stored in two storage vaults and further stand process of normalization with standardization.Such standardization comprises from the sentence of problem or answer and removes unnecessary word; Proofread and correct any misspelling; Remove unnecessary punctuation mark; Proofread and correct incorrect punctuation mark; Remove unnecessary space etc.For example, as the primal problem obtained can be " where is world exxposition2010held ", wherein " exxposition " has misspelling, and has unnecessary space between " 2010 " and " held ".Process of normalization can be identified the such key error in this problem, and the problem automatic calibration is become to the canonical form of " where is world exposition2010held ".
Similarly, can use top process of normalization to remove so obvious key error from the answer corresponding to problem.Existing issue and answer that therefore the answer of proofreading and correct more may be mapped in storage vault are right.
In addition, when storage vault maintenance module 117 by new problem and answer to be mapped to existing issue and answer to the time, storage vault maintenance module 117 be existing to the increase score value in storage vault.This score value indication problem and right degree of confidence or the quality of answer, and the increase of the increase of score value indication degree of confidence or quality (for example, problem and the increase of answering right accuracy).
For example, in question answering, to after being identified, in step 202, storage vault maintenance module 117 can be by this to adding the first storage vault 112 to.At first storage vault maintenance module 117 by inquiry has the entry of this problem and answer to storage vault, determines whether this question answering is to being present in the first storage vault 112.Can the exact matching (or exact matching of standardization text) by text make question answering to whether being present in determining in the first storage vault 112.If such is present in the first storage vault 112 being determined, in the first storage vault 112, by the score value that makes this entry, increases 1(or depend on used marking scheme, some other increment) complete adding procedure.(for example there do not is such entry if find in the first storage vault 112, in storage vault 112, do not exist recently identification to existing right coupling), add this problem and the right new entry of answer to storage vault, and be this entry storing initial score value unit value or the minimum value of used specific marking scheme (for example, for).
Also can use other scoring technologies.For example, the right score value of the question answering in the first storage vault can be based on the weighting score value of some other parameters, described parameter such as from the popularity in the right source of extraction question answering.Those higher score values that the never so welcome knowledge base of question answering contrast that can give to extract from welcome knowledge base is extracted.For example, question answering on score value be at least be subject to same problem answer on be included into frequency in the first storage vault 112 and same problem answer on the accumulation score value that affects of the popularity of each provenance, therefore, reflected question answering in the first storage vault 112 popularity to self.
By question answering to the step of adding the first storage vault 112 to after, before keyword set being added to the second storage vault 113, in step 203, will resolve to obtain keyword set to problem.The step of in some embodiments, resolving problem comprises uses the language model corresponding with the language of the problem of writing that problem is divided into to word set.For example, for " potato is ' getting fat ' or ' fat-reducing '? " the problem of (Is potato fattening or not), this problem will be identified as writing with Chinese, and be further processed to obtain the sentence structure of this problem with Chinese language model, thereby this problem is divided into to the word set that comprises subject, verb, predicate part, conjunction etc.
In some embodiments, can further assist problem (for example is divided into to language construction by the search terms set by particular search engine, word, phrase etc.), thus but identify welcome any new word or the phrase that can not only be identified by the language to problem or semantic analysis that become recently.In the above example, word " getting fat " may correctly be recognized as the word of identification in specific dictionary, but can be by this word is compared to identify with the search terms set.This search terms set can be safeguarded by search engine, and for it, the part search terms is the word of recently creating.
Further, can remove from the word list of so obtaining this language and the most often to occur and some stop words about the customizing messages of the character of problem is not provided.Therefore remaining word forms the keyword set of waiting to be added to the second storage vault 113.
In some embodiments, before the keyword set by so obtaining is added the second storage vault 113 to, can determine the size of this keyword set and itself and predetermined threshold value are compared.For example, for example, if the size of this collection (is less than the ambiguity threshold value, three words, four words etc.), not by the keyword set that obtains from problem with and corresponding answer add the second storage vault 113 to, because, can be by top process be obtained to identical keyword set for another problem that is different from this problem on language.But this has reduced inputs problem the user obtains the answer corresponding from different problems, because as from the keyword set obtained of problem of input in the situation identical with the keyword set of different problems being stored in the second storage vault 113, the possibility of possible inaccurate answer.
If as the size of the keyword set obtained is determined to be higher than threshold value (step 204), by the keyword set of problem with corresponding to the answer of this problem, add the second storage vault 113(step 205 in the above).By keyword set and answer particular step to adding the second storage vault 113 to as mentioned above by problem with answer adding those of the first storage vault to similar.
Can also come problem identificatioin whether to be present in storage vault with keyword resolution.In these embodiments, at first problem is resolved, then to repository search exact matching or keyword coupling.
Fig. 3 A-3B is added to the question answering of the first storage vault 112 and the second storage vault 113 to keyword set, answering right exemplary storage vault.Fig. 3 A is the table of the sample data in the first storage vault 112.In this table, when determining that another problem is whether identical with in these problems in these row one, for example during exact matching, can whole be used as the problem of text-string.
Fig. 3 B is the table of the sample data in the second storage vault 113.In this table, row " keyword set " are included in the lists of keywords of each entry.By define different keywords with branch.Delimiter between keyword can be colon, form space etc. as an alternative.The keyword set of determining the input problem whether be stored in the second storage vault 113 in keyword set in one when identical, each keyword in the keyword set of input problem and each keyword in the existing keyword set in this storage vault can be compared, have the exact matching of this keyword.In some embodiments, only work as two keyword set and there is identical keyword set, and no matter, while listing the order of these keywords, these two keyword set just are complementary.For example, consider that the input problem is " world exposition2010, where is it held ".The keyword set of this problem can be " world exposition; Where; Held ", it will be confirmed as and the keyword set " where obtained from problem " where is the world exposition2010held "; World exposition; Held " identical.
Can also use other match-on criterions, such as the broad match that wherein keyword can be replaced by another word (" shoes " is replaced by " sneakers "), phrase match etc.
Can also at the first storage vault 112 and the second storage vault 113 the corresponding question answering in both to or keyword set answer each right entry and safeguard other attributes.These attributes can be add recently question answering to or keyword set is answered the right time, in the nearest past, for example in the past six months, add question answering to or keyword set answer right frequency etc.When attempting to obtain while answering for problem, this information can be used to question answering to or keyword set answer right popularity and give weight.
Can be to respectively question answering being carried out to the alternative order to the top step of answering adding two storage vaults to keyword set.
Fig. 4 is that diagram provides the process flow diagram to the process of the answer of online problem.In step 401, problem is received and passes through submitted such as the client of chat application from user (requestor).In some embodiments, on client, provide control to submit a question to particular server for the answer (answer) of storing for the problem of coupling in storage vault for the user.For example, when the user just organizes chat and has inputted problem " where is the exposition2010held " with other users in chatroom, the user can click on its interface, this message is sent to the server of realizing above-mentioned module for the control of processing, rather than this problem is sent to user's group.As an alternative, the user can be input to problem in the textview field on webpage, and by the web interface, this problem is submitted to server.
After server place Receiver Problem, in step 402, issue handling module 118 may be advanced to determines whether there has been identical problem in the first storage vault 112.If there are the one or more entries with same problem in the first storage vault 112, the correspondence of retrieving in each of these entries is answered for further processing.In some embodiments, will for before inquiring about the first storage vault 112, to this problem, further standardize from the problem of client.This process of normalization can comprise as appointment in the above, from the sentence of problem, removes unnecessary word; Proofread and correct any misspelling; Remove unnecessary punctuation mark; Proofread and correct incorrect punctuation mark; Remove unnecessary space etc.
For example, if (can not find the entry of the problem identical with the problem with received in the first storage vault 112, for this problem, do not return results), issue handling module 118 can resolve to obtain the keyword set (step 404) corresponding to this problem to received problem.Except the size of the keyword set by obtained and ambiguity threshold value compare, this analyzing step can with described in step 203 in Fig. 2 similar (for example, use the language model corresponding with the language of the problem of writing, and use alternatively the collected search terms of search engine that answer is divided into to word set).The keyword set of received problem is used as to the key of inquiry the second storage vault 113.If exist the one or more entries or the other and enough degree of confidence that have identical keyword set in row " keyword " to be complementary in the second storage vault 113, its correspondence of retrieving in row " answer " is answered and it is returned to issue handling module 118(step 404).
In step 405, the answer of the problem received retrieved from the first storage vault 112 or the second storage vault 113, if any, sort according to the corresponding score value of these answers.As an alternative, when each in the answer in result is determined the rank score value, can use other information, such as nearest interpolation question answering to or keyword set answer the right time, in the past within six months, add question answering to or keyword set answer right frequency.
Finally, in step 406, issue handling module 118 sends to problem to pass through the client 101 that the network source such as the Internet rises the answer collection of the sequence of received problem.In some embodiments, the parameter value received together with problem according to the client 101 from the request of sending, only rank is the highest, answer institute's requested number sends to the client 101 of the request of sending.For example, the client 101 of sending request may only be asked the answer to submitted to problem.In this case, issue handling module 118 will be selected the answer of high rank, and send it to client 101.
In the alternative embodiment, can before any answer of step 402 pair the first storage vault 112 inquiry problems, carry out and this problem analysis be become to the step of keyword set after the client problem from the request of sending.As an alternative, the step of analyzing step and inquiry the second storage vault 113 can be carried out with the step of inquiry the first storage vault simultaneously, to save the additional wait time of the problem received being processed sequentially to inquire about two storage vaults.
In the variant of this embodiment, even find the coupling in the first storage vault, also can inquire about two storage vaults.Therefore, in this embodiment, can return to the answer from two storage vaults, and return results for its respective queries from both.Carry out in the time of to two processes and can realize such as the programming technique of the thread in multitask by utilizing.
