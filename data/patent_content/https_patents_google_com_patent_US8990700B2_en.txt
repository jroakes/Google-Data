- the rated places category 232 D provides, when selected, in the display region 202 , the ratings cards 216 that have been previously rated. For example, when one or more of the ratings cards 216 is rated, explained further below, the rated ratings cards 216 are displayed in the display region 202 .
- the friends list category 232 E provides, when selected, a listing of all friends (such as the users 108 A- 108 F) of the searching user providing the search query 214 .
- the similar people category 232 F provides, when selected, other users (such as the users 108 A- 108 F) that are determined, by the ratings engine, to be similar to the searching user providing the search query 214 .
- the ratable entities search engine can use any appropriate algorithm to determine the similarity between two users and can be based on a similarity of what ratable entities are rated by the two users and how the two users rated the same ratable entities. For example, if the two users have rated the same ratable entities, the two users are more likely to be considered similar since they have similar interest in the two entities. Additionally, if the two users have rated the same ratable entities with similar ratings, the two users are more likely to be considered similar, since they hold the same view of the two entities.
- the ratings cards 216 include the first interface 226 .
- the first interface 226 provides a ranking interface for the user to provide input for rating the ratable entity associated with the ratings cards 216 .
