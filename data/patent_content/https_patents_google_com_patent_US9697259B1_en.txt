Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to using data that represents previously submitted user queries to adjust search results.
- Internet search engines aim to identify documents or other items that are relevant to a user's needs and to present the documents or items in a manner that is most useful to the user. Such activity often involves a fair amount of mind-reading—inferring from various clues what the user wants. Certain clues may be user specific. For example, knowledge that a user is making a request from a mobile device, and knowledge of the location of the device, can result in much better search results for such a user.
- Clues about a user's needs may also be more general. For example, search results can have an elevated importance, or inferred relevance, if a number of other search results link to them. Such an approach to determining relevance may be premised on the assumption that, if authors of web pages felt that another web site was relevant enough to be linked to, then web searchers would also find the site to be particularly relevant. In short, the web authors “vote up” the relevance of the sites.
- the methods include receiving data representative of a search query from a user search session.
- the methods also include identifying a plurality of search results based upon the search query.
- Each search result is associated with a plurality of user characteristics and data that represents requestor behavior relative to previously submitted queries associated with the respective search result.
- the methods also include ordering the plurality of user characteristics based upon the data that represents requestor behavior relative to previously submitted queries and the respective search result.
- the methods also include adjusting the ordered plurality of user characteristics based upon at least one predefined compatibility associated with the user characteristics.
- the methods also include ranking the search results based upon the adjusted plurality of user characteristics.
- the methods include receiving data representative of a search query from a user search session.
- the methods also include identifying a plurality of search results based upon the search query.
- Each search result is associated with data that represents requestor behavior relative to previously submitted queries.
- the requestor behavior is associated with a plurality of languages used at a location of the user.
- the methods include combining the data that represents requestor behavior that is associated the plurality of languages used at user location.
- the methods also include ranking the search results based upon the combined data that represents requestor behavior.
- Combining the data that represents requestor behavior may include applying a weight to the data that represents requestor behavior relative to previously submitted queries for the plurality of languages.
- the location of the user may be associated with a country.
- Particular embodiments of the described subject matter can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages.
- user characteristics e.g., user languages, user locations, etc.
- information associated with previous searches may be exploited to accentuate or downplay the rankings of search results.
- FIG. 1 shows an example information retrieval system.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example information retrieval system and components.
- FIG. 4 illustrates refining search results.

- FIG. 7 shows a schematic diagram of an example computer system.
- FIG. 1 shows an example system 1000 for improving the relevance of results obtained from submitting search queries as can be implemented in an internet, intranet, or other client/server environment.
- the system 1000 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components and techniques described below can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in the system 1000 . Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums.
- a user 1002 can interact with the system 1000 through a client device 1004 ( 1004 a , 1004 b , 1004 c ) or other device.
- the client device 1004 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
- the client device 1004 can include a random access memory (RAM) 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and a processor 1008 .
- the processor 1008 is structured to process instructions within the system 1000 .
- the processor 1008 is a single-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 is a multi-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 can include multiple processing cores and is structured to process instructions stored in the RAM 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 1004 ) to display graphical information for a user interface.
- a user 1002 a can connect to a search engine 1030 within a server system 1014 to submit a query 1015 .
- a client-side query signal 1010 a is sent into a network 1012 and is forwarded to the server system 1014 as a server-side query signal 1010 b .
- Server system 1014 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations.
- the server system 1014 includes a memory device 1016 , which can include the search engine 1030 loaded therein.
- a processor 1018 is structured to process instructions within the system 1014 . These instructions can implement one or more components of the search engine 1030 .
- the processor 1018 can be a single-threaded processor or a multi-threaded processor, and can include multiple processing cores.
- the processor 1018 can process instructions stored in the memory 1016 related to the search engine 1030 and can send information to the client device 1004 , through the network 1012 , to create a graphical presentation in a user interface of the client device 1004 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser).
- the server-side query signal 1010 b is received by the search engine 1030 .
- the search engine 1030 uses the information within the user query 1015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 1030 can include an indexing engine 1020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus, and the index information for the documents in the corpus can be stored in an index database 1022 .
- This index database 1022 can be accessed to identify documents related to the user query 1015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- the search engine 1030 can include a ranking engine 1052 to rank the documents related to the user query 1015 .
- the ranking of the documents can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance.
- a document is linked to (e.g., is the target of a hyperlink) by many other relevant documents (e.g., documents that also contain matches for the search terms)
- it can be inferred that the target document is particularly relevant. This inference can be made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they can be considered more relevant, and the first document can be considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants. The technique is exemplified in some systems that treat a link from one web page to another as an indication of quality for the latter page, so that the page with the most such quality indicators is rated higher than others. Appropriate techniques can also be used to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the relevance of a page.
- the ranking engine 1052 can receive an additional signal from a rank modifier engine 1056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the documents.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 provides one or more prior models, or one or more measures of relevance for the documents based on one or more prior models, which can be used by the ranking engine 1052 to improve the search results' ranking provided to the user 1002 .
- a prior model represents a background probability of document result selection given the values of multiple selected features, as described further below.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can perform one or more of the operations to generate the one or more prior models, or the one or more measures of relevance based on one or more prior models.
- rank modifier engine 1056 may be provided to the rank modifier engine 1056 for improving the ranking of documents.
- information associated the search requester may be identified and used to adjust rankings of search results. Such information may include the language used by the search requester, the geographic location of the search requester, etc. Similar information associated with previous search requesters may also be used to adjust rankings.
- the search engine 1030 can include a rank refiner engine 1058 that may implement one or more adjustment techniques. In one arrangement the rank modifier engine 1056 may modify rankings based on one of three distinct levels.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 may rely upon information from similar queries previously initiated by search requesters using the same language and from the same general location (e.g., country) as the current search requester. If such information is lacking, the rank modifier 1056 may attempt to modify rankings at a second level.
- the second level may allow additional information from previous searches to be used. For example, the second level may use information from similar queries previously initiated by search requesters that use the same language as the current search requester, but independent of the location of the previous search requesters. As such, additional useful information may become available by expanding the pool of previous search information. If a statistically significant amount of information is still absent, the rank modifier engine 1056 may further expand the pool to include data from all previous searches that were similar to the current search. As such, search information independent of search requester language and location may be used.
- such a three-level arrangement allows the rank modifier 1056 to exploit information shared by search requesters for ranking search results.
- similarities associated with user languages e.g., Russian and Ukrainian
- the rank modifier 1056 may be unable to identify previous search requests provided in Russian that are similar to a current Russian search request.
- the rank modifier 1056 may elect to open the search pool to include previous searches independent of language.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may allow previous search information to be exploited, which may provide more relevant result rankings for the search requester. Similar to accounting for language similarities such as compatibility, the rank refiner engine 1058 may also exploit other similarities associated with searchers. For example, similarities associated with searcher locations (e.g., country of the searcher) may be considered.
- similar geographical locations e.g., bordering countries such as Mexico, Canada, the United States, etc.
- locations with common culture and climate e.g., northern African countries
- similarities may be used for adjusting the rankings of search results.
- language and location similarities may be used to define additional levels that may be inserted between somewhat abrupt levels (e.g., between a common language level and a language independent level).
- similarities e.g., compatible languages, similar locations
- various types of information may be used.
- search requester characteristics e.g., language, location, etc.
- search requestor characteristics may be provided by the search requestor (e.g., language used to provide a search request), or may be inferred by analyzing data related to the search request or a series of search requests, or determined in some other manner.
- information related to interactions between the search requestor and search results e.g., click data, refining queries, etc.
- Data representing the similarities may be cataloged in a database (e.g., the index db 1022 ). From the information, search result scoring and ranking (e.g., as performed by the ranking engine 1052 and the rank modifier engine 1056 ) can be adjusted to account for such language, location and other types of similarities.
- the search engine 1030 can forward the final, ranked result list within a server-side search results signal 1028 a through the network 1012 .
- a client-side search results signal 1028 b can be received by the client device 1004 a where the results can be stored within the RAM 1006 and/or used by the processor 1008 to display the results on an output device for the user 1002 a.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system. These components can include an indexing engine 2010 , a scoring engine 2020 , a ranking engine 2030 , a rank modifier engine 2070 , and a rank refiner engine 2080 .
- the indexing engine 2010 can function as described above for the indexing engine 1020 .
- the scoring engine 2020 can generate scores for document results based on many different features, including content-based features that link a query to document results, and query-independent features that generally indicate the quality of document results.
- the content-based features can include aspects of document format, such as query matches to title or anchor text in an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) page.
- the query-independent features can include aspects of document cross-referencing, such as a rank of the document or the domain.
- the particular functions used by the scoring engine 2020 can be tuned, to adjust the various feature contributions to the final IR score, using automatic or semi-automatic processes.
- the ranking engine 2030 can produce a ranking of document results 2040 for display to a user based on IR scores received from the scoring engine 2020 and one or more signals from the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the rank modifier engine 2070 can adjust rankings at least in part based on data received from the rank refiner engine 2080 .
- other sources may provide information to the rank refiner engine 2080 .
- queries entered into a user interface may be provided to the rank refiner engine 2080 .
- the rank refiner engine 2080 provides information to the rank modifier engine 2070 for ranking adjustments, however other architectures may be implemented.
- information may be provided by the rank refiner engine 2080 to the indexing engine 2010 or one or more other components of the information retrieval system.
- a tracking component 2050 can be used to record information regarding individual user selections of the results presented in the ranking 2040 .
- the tracking component 2050 can be embedded JavaScript code included in a web page ranking 2040 that identifies user selections (clicks) of individual document results and also identifies when the user returns to the results page, thus indicating the amount of time the user spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 2050 can be a proxy system through which user selections of the document results are routed, or the tracking component can include pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- the client e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- Other implementations are also possible, such as by using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) clicked by the user.
- the recorded information can be stored in the result selection log(s) 2060 .
- the recorded information can include log entries that indicate, for each user selection, the query (Q), the document (D), the time (T) on the document, the language (L) employed by the user, and the country (C) where the user is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- Other information can also be recorded regarding user interactions with a presented ranking, including negative information, such as the fact that a document result was presented to a user, but was not clicked, position(s) of click(s) in the user interface, IR scores of clicked results, IR scores of all results shown before the clicked result, the titles and snippets shown to the user before the clicked result, the user's cookie, cookie age, IP (Internet Protocol) address, user agent of the browser, etc. Still further information can be recorded, such as described below during discussion of the various features that can be used to build a prior model. Moreover, similar information (e.g., IR scores, position, etc.) can be recorded for an entire session, or multiple sessions of a user, including potentially recording such information for every click that occurs both before and after a current click.
- negative information such as the fact that a document result was presented to a user, but was not clicked, position(s) of click(s) in the user interface, IR scores of clicked results, IR scores of all results shown before the clicked result,
- the information stored in the result selection log(s) 2060 can be used by one or more components of the information retrieval system.
- information could be provided to the rank refiner engine 2080 and the rank modifier engine 2070 in generating the one or more signals to the ranking engine 2030 .
- a wide range of information can be collected and used to modify or tune the click signal from the user to make the signal, and the future search results provided, a better fit for the user's needs.
- user interactions with the rankings presented to the users of the information retrieval system can be used to improve future rankings.
- language and location similarities associated with the search requester can be used to adjust rankings.
- the user interaction and the data representing language and location similarities may be provided to one or more server systems (e.g., server system 1014 ) for use and storage (e.g., database 1022 ) for later retrieval.
- the components shown in FIG. 2 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations.
- the scoring engine 2020 and the ranking engine 2030 can be merged into a single ranking engine, such as the ranking engine 1052 of FIG. 1 .
- the rank refiner engine 2080 , the rank modifier engine 2070 and the ranking engine 2030 can also be merged, and in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of document results after a query.
- a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example information retrieval system.
- a server system 3050 includes an indexing engine 3060 and a scoring/ranking engine 3070 .
- a client system 3000 includes a user interface for presenting a ranking 3010 , a tracking component 3020 , result selection log(s) 3030 and a ranking/rank modifier engine/rank refiner engine 3040 .
- the client system 3000 can include a company's enterprise network and personal computers, in which a browser plug-in incorporates the ranking/rank modifier engine/rank refiner engine 3040 .
- the scoring/ranking engine 3070 can return the search results along with either an initial ranking or the actual IR scores for the results.
- the browser plug-in can then re-rank the results locally based on tracked page selections for the company-specific user base.
- an exemplary set of search result information is used to illustrate operations of the rank refiner engine 1058 .
- the operations are used to define a level that accounts for language similarities.
- a search requester may be an English speaking individual that is from Germany.
- the language of the requester and the associated country of the requester may be identified from input information (e.g., search language used by the requester, etc.).
- input information e.g., search language used by the requester, etc.
- a collection of documents are identified as possible search results that may provide the requester with sought after information.
- the provided search query can be paired with each identified document.
- the entered query produces a collection of documents in a variety of languages.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 processes the document collection based upon the languages detected for each query and document pair.
- a collection of language data 400 is associated with four languages (e.g., English 402 , German 404 , Spanish 406 and Chinese 408 ).
- corresponding click data is also identified for this query/document pair.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 produces a metric for comparing use of the document for each language. In this arrangement, a fraction (referred to as a click fraction) is calculated for each of the identified languages.
- the click fraction may represent a ratio between the number of instances that the document was selected (for that respective language) and the total number of instances that the document was selected (for all of the languages).
- a collection of click fractions 410 is presented adjacent to the corresponding language collection 410 (e.g., click fraction 412 for English 402 , click fraction 414 for German 404 , click fraction 416 for Spanish 406 , and click fraction 418 for Chinese 408 ).
- the rank refiner engine 1058 orders the languages included in the collection 410 based upon the values of the click fractions.
- the click fractions are ordered in a descending manner and are presented by language collection 420 and corresponding click fraction collection 422 .
- the click fraction associated with the Chinese language is the largest followed by the English, German and Spanish languages.
- the click data demonstrates a strong relationship between this query/document pair and the Chinese language, however, the Chinese language and the language of the query requestor (i.e., the English language) may be considered dissimilar, and some may even consider the two languages as being incompatible. As such, the click data associated with the Chinese language (from the query/document pair) may skew ranking results.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may adjust the language collection 420 and the corresponding click data collection 422 to separate languages considered incompatible (with the language of the requester) and languages considered compatible (with the language of the requester).
- the rank refiner engine 1058 produces language collection 424 and corresponding click fraction collection 426 .
- languages considered incompatible e.g., Chinese language 408
- languages considered compatible e.g., English 402 , German 404 and Spanish 406
- the rank refiner engine 1058 correspondingly adjusts the click fraction information to produce click fraction collection 426 .
- the rank refiner engine 1058 also adjusts the language data.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 has identified an incompatible language (e.g., Chinese) with a considerable click fraction.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may adjust the click fraction or remove the language entry in its entirety. For example, one or more weights may be applied to the click fractions such that the significance of incompatible languages is noticeably reduced.
- References to incompatible languages (and associated data), as defined by the rank refiner engine 1058 may also be removed from the collections.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 identifies the incompatible languages at the head of the language collection 424 and removes the identified languages from the collection along with the corresponding click fraction information from the click fraction collection 426 .
- the information associated with the incompatible language (Chinese) is removed from both collections 424 and 426 .
- other techniques may be used to identify information for removal. For example, click fractions for one or a few languages may be significantly statistically different (e.g., larger) from click fractions associated with the majority of other languages. Based upon this significant difference in click fraction, the language (or languages) associated with the outlier click fractions may be removed from the language collection 424 .
- collection information of a reduced size remains.
- a language collection 430 and a corresponding click fraction collection 432 with three entries each remain.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 determines the number of instances that the document has been selected (or another type of click data) for each language and the total number of instances that the document has been selected. From the data associated with remaining languages, the rank refiner engine 1058 re-orders the languages for this query/document pair. For example, click fractions may be re-calculated for each of the remaining languages, and the languages may be re-ordered based on the re-calculated click fractions.
- a language collection 434 and a click fraction collection 436 illustrate the re-calculated click fractions (e.g., click fraction 438 , click fraction 440 and click fraction 442 ) for the remaining languages (e.g., English, German and Spanish).
- Similar operations may be executed by the rank refiner engine 1058 .
- quantities may be calculated for scoring and ranking the documents. For example, the click data associated with the remaining languages for this query/document pair may be summed to provide the click count for the document. Similar quantities may be calculated for each document. By summing the click counts for each document (for the remaining languages) a click count may be determined for the query (for the remaining languages). Similarly, a fraction can be computed for each document, for example, from the ratio of the two sums (e.g., a ratio of the sum of click count for the document for the remaining languages and the sum of the click counts for the query).
- a level may be defined from the quantity: LD* B +(1 ⁇ LD)* L+; where B represents the total number amount of click data (e.g., selections) independent of language and L+ represents the amount of click data (e.g., selections) for a specific language or languages after accounting for possible languages incompatibilities (e.g., as represented in the language collection 434 and the click fraction collection 436 ).
- the quantity LD (referring to as language demotion score) is a measure of a user's ability to understand the corresponding document.
- LD may have a range from 0 (e.g., represents a low probability that the language of the user is compatible with the language of the document) to 1.0 (e.g., represents a high probability that the language of the user is compatible with the language of the document).
- the quantity may be provided to one or more components (e.g., rank modifier engine 1056 , ranking engine 1052 , indexing engine 1020 ) and used as a factor in ranking the documents associated with the query.
- One or more weights may also be used with the computed quantity for scoring and ranking.
- click data associated with particular countries and country independent click data may be utilized. Click data associated with particular languages and language independent click data may also be provided to one or more components (individually or in combination with the click data associated with one or more countries) for use in determining document scores and rankings.
- While the previous example illustrated in FIG. 4 is associated with a plurality of languages (and associated click fractions) for query/document pairs, the technique may also be used for other characteristics associated with a search requester. For example, rather than refining the query/document pair information based upon of plurality of languages (associated with each query/document pair), click data associated with a plurality of countries may be used for refining query/document pair information. Further, the rank refiner engine 1058 may use the click data (e.g., click fractions) in a similar manner based upon country compatibility (rather than language compatibility). As such, the click data from similar countries, as defined by the rank refiner engine 1058 , may be exploited for scoring and ranking particular documents.
- click data e.g., click fractions
- country compatibility a level may be defined by the quantity: L *CD+(1 ⁇ CD)* C+; where the quantity CD (referring to as country demotion score) is a measure of a user's ability to understand a document based upon the country of the user and the country of the document.
- C+ is determined by producing and ordered list that includes, for example, click data (e.g., click fractions) of countries that are compatible to the country of the user. For example, countries in the same general proximity (e.g., bordering countries such as Mexico and the United States) may be considered by the rank refiner engine 1058 to be compatible. countries that share similar cultures, climates, and other characteristics may also be considered to be compatible.
- L represents the click data associated with the language of the user.
- levels are defined to account for compatibilities among user languages and locations. As such, these additional levels may be used to exploit user interactions (e.g., click data) so the ranking of particular search results may be enhanced. Additional types of levels may also be defined for enhancing search result ranking, for example, user locations such as regions of a country, individual cities and metropolitan regions may be used for defining compatibilities. In one instance, a level may be defined to account for the different languages that are used in a single country (associated with a user). For example, a query is identified as being provided from an English speaking individual from Germany. Operating with a level that is associated with both the language and the country of the user, a relatively small amount of previous queries (that are similar to the current query) may be detected, for this example.
- another level may be activated for identifying similar queries.
- the level that uses queries from all English speaking individuals may be used.
- such an abrupt change in level types may discount query information associated with different user languages (e.g., German) but from the same location (e.g., Germany), and which may be pertinent to the subject query.
- a level may be defined that uses queries and user information associated with multiple languages used at a particular country.
- information e.g., queries, click data
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may collect click data for each language associated with the user's country (e.g., for an English speaking user in Germany, click data is also collected from Germany speaking individuals, French speaking individuals, etc.). Once collected, the rank refiner engine 1058 may process the click data, for example, one or more weights may be applied to the click data associated with each language. Constraints may also be applied to the weighted or un-weighted click data, for example, the click data may be constrained to one or more limits (e.g., an upper limit, a lower limit, etc.).
- limits e.g., an upper limit, a lower limit, etc.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may use the processed click data to define one or more levels.
- the processed click data may be used in combination with click data associated with the language and country of the user to define a level.
- the level may be defined with the quantity: C +LD* C*; where C represents the click data associated with the language and country of the user.
- the quantity LD refers to language demotion score and is a measure of a user's ability to understand the corresponding document.
- LD may have a range from 0 (e.g., representative of a low probability that the language of the user is compatible with the language of the document) to 1.0 (e.g., representative of a high probability that the language of the user is compatible with the language of the document).
- the quantity C* represents the processed click data for each of the languages associated with the country of the user.
- a flowchart 500 represents some operations of a rank refiner engine (such as the rank refiner engine 1058 shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the operations may be executed by a single computing device (such as the server system 1014 shown in FIG. 1 ) that includes a search engine. In some arrangements, multiple computing devices may also be utilized.
- operation execution may be distributed among two or more sites (e.g., server system 1014 and client 1004 ).
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may use predefined compatibilities associated with characteristics of a search requester (e.g., location of the search requester, language used, etc.) to refine search results. To provide this functionality, the rank refiner engine 1058 may execute operations such as receiving 502 search results based upon a search query. In one example, for each document provided from a search query, click data may be provided to the rank refiner engine 1058 that is associated with previous queries from users with similar characteristics (e.g., language used, location, etc.). Operations of the rank refiner engine 1058 may also include ordering 504 the characteristics associated with the search results. For example, the languages or countries associated with a search results may be ordered based upon the click data associated with each corresponding characteristic.
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may adjust 506 the ordered characteristics based upon one or more predefined compatibilities associated with the characteristics. For example, two or more particular languages may be considered compatible based upon similarities of the languages. Similarly, two or more countries may be considered compatible based upon similarities (e.g., similar geographic location, culture, climate, etc.). In some arrangements, some data associated a particular search results (e.g., click data associated with languages considered incompatible) may be removed or weighted to decrease its significance. Operations of the rank refiner engine 1058 may also include providing 508 the adjusted characteristic information for further processing of the search results (e.g., scoring, ranking, etc.). For example, the information may be used to define one or more levels for processing results such that certain types of search results are promoted.
- a flowchart 600 represents other operations of a rank refiner engine (such as the rank refiner engine 1058 shown in FIG. 1 ). Similar to the operations associated with flowchart 500 of FIG. 5 , the operations may be executed by a single computing device (such as the server system 1014 shown in FIG. 1 ) that includes a search engine. In some arrangements, multiple computing devices may also be utilized. Along with being executed at a single site (e.g., server system 1014 ), operation execution may be distributed among two or more sites (e.g., server system 1014 and client 1004 ).
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may define a level for ranking search results that assists promoting local documents identified from the search results. For example, click data associated with multiple (or all) languages used at the location of the search requester may be exploited. To provide this functionality, the rank refiner engine 1058 may execute operations such as receiving 602 search results that are based upon a query from a search requestor at a particular location. Operations of the rank refiner engine 1058 may also include identifying information associated with similar queries (e.g., click data) that is associated with multiple languages used at the location of the search requester. Once identified, the rank refiner engine 1058 may process this information for promoting search results (e.g., documents) that are local to the search requester based upon the languages associated with the location.
- search results e.g., documents
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may combine 606 appropriate information (e.g., click data) associated with the multiple languages for each search result and provide 608 the information for ranking the search results.
- appropriate information e.g., click data
- the rank refiner engine 1058 may assist in defining a level of ranking search results to promote local search results (e.g., documents) that may be more relevant to a search requester than foreign search results.

- the signal is typically only adjusted after the clicks were already aggregated, which can result in some loss of precision.
Abstract
Description
LD*B+(1−LD)*L+;
where B represents the total number amount of click data (e.g., selections) independent of language and L+ represents the amount of click data (e.g., selections) for a specific language or languages after accounting for possible languages incompatibilities (e.g., as represented in the
L*CD+(1−CD)*C+;
where the quantity CD (referring to as country demotion score) is a measure of a user's ability to understand a document based upon the country of the user and the country of the document. Similar to L+, C+ is determined by producing and ordered list that includes, for example, click data (e.g., click fractions) of countries that are compatible to the country of the user. For example, countries in the same general proximity (e.g., bordering countries such as Mexico and the United States) may be considered by the rank refiner engine 1058 to be compatible. Countries that share similar cultures, climates, and other characteristics may also be considered to be compatible. In this quantity, L represents the click data associated with the language of the user.
C+LD*C*;
where C represents the click data associated with the language and country of the user. As used above, the quantity LD refers to language demotion score and is a measure of a user's ability to understand the corresponding document. For example, LD may have a range from 0 (e.g., representative of a low probability that the language of the user is compatible with the language of the document) to 1.0 (e.g., representative of a high probability that the language of the user is compatible with the language of the document). The quantity C* represents the processed click data for each of the languages associated with the country of the user. By applying the language demotion score to the quantity C*, local documents (e.g., German documents in this example) that are relevant may be promoted.
