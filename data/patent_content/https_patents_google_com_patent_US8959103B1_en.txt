- This specification generally relates to search engines, and one particular implementation relates to evaluating reordering rules that are used in revising search queries or in scoring resources that are identified in response to search queries.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of evaluating a query term reordering rule based on determining whether a user has (i) selected a search result that includes two or more query terms in an order that is different than the order in which the two or more query terms occur in the corresponding search query (referred to as a “click evaluation” of a query term reordering rule), or (ii) selected a search result that ranks below a search result that includes two or more query terms in the order that is different than the order in which the two or more query terms occur in the corresponding search query (referred to as a “skip evaluation” of a query term reordering rule).
- the reordering engine may infer, through a user's clicking on or skipping a particular search result, that the occurrence of the reordered query terms in the particular search result played some part in the user's decision to select or not select the particular search result.
- This insight may be used to measure the quality of the reordering rule, for example to allow the search systems to determine whether other search queries should be revised to reorder query terms, or whether occurrences of the query terms, in the different order, should be scored as highly as occurrences of the query terms, in the original order, in resources that are identified in response to other search queries.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing query log data that identifies, for an initial search query, two or more query terms that are included in a particular order in the initial search query, search results that were generated using the initial search query, and a particular search result selected by the user.
- a determination is made, using the query log data, that the particular search result includes the two or more query terms in a different order than the particular order in which the two or more query terms are ordered in the initial search query.
- a click count is incremented for a query term reordering rule associated with the two or more query terms.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing query log data that identifies, for an initial search query, two or more query terms that are included in a particular order in the initial search query, search results that were generated using the initial search query, a ranking of the search results, and a particular search result selected by the user.
- a determination is made, using the query log data, that a search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes the two or more query terms in a different order than the particular order in which the two or more query terms are ordered in the initial search query.
- a skip count is incremented for a query term reordering rule associated with the two or more query terms.
- the actions include assigning a score to the query term reordering rule based on the click count and a skip count.
- the score is based on a ratio of (i) the click count to (ii) the click count and the skip count.
- the actions include determining that the score for the query term reordering rule does not meet a threshold, and removing the query term reordering rule from a set of query term reordering rules used to generate revised search queries based on determining that the score does not meet the threshold.
- a first weight is associated with the click count and a second weight is associated with the skip count. The score satisfies:
- the query term reordering rule comprises a query term revision rule for revising search queries by reordering the two or more query terms from the particular order to the different order.
- the query term reordering rule comprises a query term scoring rule for scoring occurrences of the two or more query terms that occur in the different order in resources that are identified in response to search queries. The different order is a reverse of the particular order.
- Click and skip evaluation of reordering rules can identify reordering rules that should be removed from a search system. Click and skip evaluation can also improve the quality of retrieved search results by helping to eliminate search results that users found unhelpful. Click and skip evaluation of reordering rules can also demote (instead of removing completely) reordering rules, allowing low-confidence rules to be used less frequently in retrieving search results.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system that revises search queries to include synonyms of query terms, to reorder query terms, and to optionalize query terms.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system that evaluates query term reordering rules.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate example search results pages and tables that show the example result of evaluating query term reordering rules using click and skip evaluation.
- FIGS. 4 and 5 are flow charts of example processes for evaluating query term reordering rules using click and skip evaluation.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system 100 that revises search queries, for instance to reorder query terms, to optionalize query terms, and to include synonyms of query terms.
- the system 100 includes a client device 110 coupled to a search system 130 over a network 120 .
- the search system 130 receives an original search query 105 from the client device 110 over network 120 , and the search system 130 provides a search results page 155 that presents search results 145 identified as being responsive to the query 105 to the client device 110 over the network 120 .
- the search results 145 identified by the search system 130 can include one or more search results that were identified as being responsive to queries that are different than the original search query 105 .
- the other queries can be obtained or generated in numerous ways, including by revising the original search query 105 .
- the search system 130 can optionally generate a revised search query 135 by reordering the terms of the original search query 105 .
- the search system 130 can optionally generate a revised search query 135 by designating terms of the original search query 105 as optional.
- “reorderings” are terms of the original search query 105 that have been reordered according to a reordering rule
- “optionalizations” are terms of the original search query 105 that have been designated as optional.
- the original search query 105 and the revised queries 135 can be used by a search engine 150 to identify and rank search results.
- the identified search results 145 can be provided to the client device 110 on a search results page 155 .
- the search system 130 can optionally generate reordered original query terms 136 from the original search query 105 by reordering some or all of the original query terms 115 according to various query term reordering rules.
- the search system 130 may or may not add or remove query terms from the original search query 105 when creating the reordered original query terms 136 . For instance, given the original query terms 115 “pants 34 30”, the search system can generate reordered original query terms “34 30 pants” and “pants 30 34”, and can use some or all of the reordered original query terms 136 when revising the original search query 105 .
- the search system 130 can identify candidate optional terms 137 from the original search query 105 , by applying optionalization rules 198 to the original search query 105 . For instance, given the original query “atlanta extreme bungee jump”, the search system can identify some or all of the terms as candidate optional terms 137 , and can designate some or all of the candidate optional terms 137 as optional when revising the original search query 105 .
- the search system 130 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 130 includes a search system front end 140 (or a “gateway server”) to coordinate requests between other parts of the search system 130 and the client device 110 .
- the search system 130 also includes a search engine 150 , a query reviser engine 170 , a synonym engine 180 , a reordering engine 192 , and an optionalization engine 196 .
- an “engine” refers to a software implemented input/output system that provides an output that is different than the input.
- An engine may be an encoded block of functionality, such as a library, a platform, Software Development Kit (“SDK”), or an object.
- the network 120 may include, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or Wi-Fi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any appropriate combination thereof.
- the search system front-end 140 , search engine 150 , query reviser engine 170 , and synonym engine 180 , reordering engine 192 , and optionalization engine 196 can be implemented on any appropriate type of computing device (e.g., servers, mobile phones, tablet computers, music players, e-book readers, laptop or desktop computers, PDAs, smart phones, or other stationary or portable devices) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media.
- the client device 110 includes one or more processors, computer readable media that store software applications (e.g. a browser layout engine), an input module (e.g., a keyboard or mouse), communication interface, and a display.
- the computing device or devices that implement the search system front-end 140 , the query reviser engine 170 , and the search engine 150 may include similar or different components.
- the search system front-end 140 receives the original search query 105 from client device 110 , and routes the original search query 105 to the appropriate engines so that the search engine results page 155 may be generated. In some implementations, routing occurs by referencing static routing tables, or routing may occur based on the current network load of an engine, so as to accomplish a load balancing function.
- the search system front-end 140 also provides the resulting search engine results page 155 to the client device 110 . In doing so, the search system front-end 140 acts as a gateway, or interface, between the client device 110 and the search engine 150 .
- the search system 130 contains many thousands of computing devices to execute for the queries that are processed by the search system 130 .
- Two or more of the search system front-end 140 , the query reviser engine 170 , and the search engine 150 may be implemented on the same computing device, or on different computing devices. Because the search engine results page 155 is generated based on the collective activity of the search system front-end 140 , the query reviser engine 170 , and the search engine 150 , the user of the client device 110 may refer to these engines collectively as a “search engine.” This specification, however, refers to the search engine 150 , and not the collection of engines, as the “search engine,” since the search engine 150 identifies the search results 145 in response to the user-submitted search query 105 .
- a user of the client device 110 enters query terms 115 for the original search query 105 during state (A), and the client device 110 communicates the original search query 105 to the search system 130 over the network 120 .
- the user may submit the original search query 105 by initiating a search dialogue on the client device 110 , by speaking or typing the terms 115 of the original search query 110 , then by pressing a search initiation button or control on the client device 110 .
- the client device 110 formulates the original search query 105 , e.g., by specifying search parameters, and transmits the original search query 105 over the network 120 .
- the query 105 refers to the query 105 as an “original” or an “initial” query, such reference is merely intended to distinguish this query from other queries, such as the revised queries that are described below.
- the designation of the original query 105 as “original” is not intended to require the original query 105 to be the first query that is entered by the user, or to be a query that is manually entered.
- the original query 105 may be the second or subsequent query entered by the user, or the original query 105 may be automatically derived (e.g., by the query reviser engine 170 ) or may be modified based upon prior queries entered by the user, location information, and the like.
- the search system front-end 140 receives the original search query 105 and communicates the original search query 105 to the query reviser engine 170 .
- the query reviser engine 170 can generate one or more revised queries 135 based on the substance of the original search query 105 .
- the query reviser engine 170 generates a revised search query 135 by reordering terms in the original search query 105 .
- the query reviser engine 170 can obtain reordered original query terms 136 for use in revising the original search query 105 from reordering engine 192 .
- the query reviser engine 170 generates a revised search query 135 by designating terms in the original search query 105 as optional.
- the query reviser engine 170 can obtain candidate optional terms 137 for use in revising the original search query 105 from optionalization engine 196 .
- the query reviser engine 170 can generate one or more revised queries 135 using any combination of terms generated by the synonym engine 180 , the reordering engine 192 , and the optionalization engine 196 .
- the query reviser engine 170 communicates original query terms 115 of the original search query 105 to the synonym engine 180 , the reordering engine 192 , and the optionalization engine 196 .
- the synonym engine 180 optionally uses synonym rules 190 to generate synonyms 125 for the original query terms 115 of the original search query 105 .
- the reordering engine 192 optionally uses reordering rules 194 to generate reordered original query terms 136 for the original query terms 115 of the original search query 105 .
- the optionalization engine 196 optionally uses optionalization rules 198 to generate candidate optional terms 137 for the original query terms 115 of the original search query 105 .
- the search system 130 can define a reordering rule for a search query, and can use the reordering rule at a later time to identify reordered original query terms 136 for search queries. For example, for the search query “pants 34 30,” the search system 130 can identify a reordering rule that indicates that “34 30 pants” and “pants 30 34” are reordered original query terms 136 , and can generate a revised search query to include the reordered original query terms 136 .
- the search system 130 can define an optionalization rule for a search query, and can use the optionalization rule at a later time to identify candidate optional terms 137 for search queries. For example, for the search query “atlanta extreme bungee jump,” the search system 130 can identify an optionalization rule that indicates “atlanta bungee jump; extreme (optional)” is an revised search query generated using the optionalization rule, and can generate a revised search query using “atlanta bungee jump; extreme (optional).”
- Reordering rules can be defined to apply generally, or can be defined to apply only when particular query contexts are satisfied.
- the query context of a reordering rule can specify, for example, one or more other terms that must be present in the search query for the reordering rule to apply.
- query contexts can specify relative locations for the other terms (e.g. to the right or left of a query term under evaluation) or can specify a general location (e.g. anywhere in the search query).
- a particular reordering rule can specify that numbers less than 100 should be swapped, but only when numbers less than 100 are not preceded by “pants” in the search query.
- Optionalization rules can be defined to apply generally, or can be defined to apply only when particular query contexts are satisfied.
- the query context of an optionalization rule can specify, for example, one or more other terms that must be present in the search query for the optionalization rule to apply.
- query contexts can specify relative locations for the other terms (e.g. to the right or left of a query term under evaluation) or can specify a general location (e.g. anywhere in the search query).
- a particular optionalization rule can specify that “extreme” should be optionalized, but only when in the context of “bungee jump.”
- the reordering rules can depend on query contexts that define other terms in the original query 105 . In other words, a reordering rule need not apply in all situations. For example, when “555-123-4567” is used as a single-term query, the rule “swap numbers less that 1000” can apply and “123-555-4567” can be returned to the query reviser engine 170 to generate a revised search query. But when the query includes “555-123-4567” followed by “phone number,” a reordering rule might not specify to swap numbers less than 1000.
- the reordering rules can be stored for use by, e.g., the reordering engine 192 , the query reviser engine, 170 , or the search engine 150 .
- the optionalization rules can depend of query contexts that define other terms in the original query 105 . In other words, an optionalization rule need not apply in all situations. For example, when “to” is used as a single-term query, the rule “optionalize to” can apply and “to (optional)” can be returned to the query reviser engine 170 to generate a revised search query. But when the query includes “to” between “New York” and “Los Angeles,” an optionalization rule might specify not to optionalize “to” when between two city names.
- the optionalization rules can be stored for use by, e.g., the reordering engine 192 , the query reviser engine, 170 , or the search engine 150 .
- the reordering engine 192 communicates reordered original query terms 136 to the query reviser engine 170 during state (D).
- the query reviser engine 170 generates one or more revised queries 135 by, for example, including the reordered original query terms 136 in a revised search query 135 .
- the optionalization engine 196 communicates candidate optional terms 137 to the query reviser engine 170 during state (D).
- the query reviser engine 170 generates one or more revised queries 135 by, for example, including the candidate optional terms 137 in a revised search query 135 .
- the query reviser engine 170 communicates the one or more revised queries 135 to the search system front-end 140 during state (E).
- the search system front-end 140 communicates the original search query 105 and/or the one or more revised queries 135 generated by the reordering rule to the search engine 150 during state (F).
- the search engine 150 generates search results 145 that it identifies as being responsive to the original search query 105 and/or the one or more revised queries 135 generated by the reordering rule.
- the search engine 150 can identify search results 145 for each search query using an index database 160 that stores indexed resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet).
- the search engine 150 can combine and rank the identified search results 145 and communicate the search results 145 to the search system front-end 140 during state (G).
- the search engine 150 may generate a score for each search result based in part on query term scoring rules that specify how occurrences of particular terms that occur in the resource identified by the search result are to be counted.
- An example query term scoring rule may specify that occurrences of two or more query terms that occur in the resource identified by the search result are to counted the same, regardless of whether the two or more query terms occur in the same order as they occur in the initial search query, or in a different order, e.g., a reverse order, then the order in which they occur in the initial search query.
- Another example query term scoring rule may specify that occurrences of two or more query terms in the different order in the resource identified by the search result are to be assigned a greater or lesser weight than occurrences of the two or more query terms in the order in which they occur in the initial search query.
- the search system front-end 140 generates a search results page 155 that identifies the highest ranked search results 145 .
- Each of the search results 145 can include, for example, titles, text snippets, images, links, reviews, or other information.
- the query terms 115 , the reordered original query terms 136 , or the candidate optional terms 137 , that appear in the search results 145 can be formatted in a particular way, for example, in bold print.
- the search system front-end 140 transmits code (e.g., HyperText Markup Language code or eXtensible Markup Language code) for the search results page 155 to the client device 110 over the network 120 at state (H), so that the client device 110 can display the search results page 155 .
- code e.g., HyperText Markup Language code or eXtensible Markup Language code
- the client device 110 invokes the transmitted code, e.g., using a layout engine, and displays the search results page 155 on the display 118 .
- the terms 115 of the original query 105 are displayed in a query box (or “search box”), located for example, on the top of the search results page 155 , and some of the search results 145 are displayed in a search results block, for example, on the left-hand side of the search results page 155 .
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system 200 that evaluates query term reordering rules.
- the system 200 includes a client device 260 , a search engine system 270 , and a query term reordering rule system 280 .
- the components illustrated in FIG. 2 can, for example, be implemented as part of the system illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the search engine system 270 receives a search query 261 from the client device 260 and provides search results 264 on a search results page 256 in response to the search query 261 .
- the search results page 256 can also identify the query terms 201 of the search query 261 .
- the search engine system 270 can send a query message 262 that includes query terms 201 of the search query 261 , as originally ordered, to the query term reordering rule system 280 .
- the search engine system 270 can also send a search results message 265 to the query term reordering rule system 280 .
- the search results message 265 identifies the search results 264 of the search query 261 , or identifies the resources referenced by the search results 264 .
- the query terms 201 of the original search query 261 may occur in the resources referenced by search results 264 , in the order in which the terms occur in the search query 261 , i.e., “pants 30 34,” or in an order which is different than the order in which the terms occur in the search query 261 , i.e., “pants 34 30” or “30 34 pants.”
- the search result 202 includes the terms “pants” “and “34 30,” in an order which is different than the order in which the terms occur in the search query 261 .
- the search result 203 also includes the query terms “30 34” and “pants,” in an order which is different than the order in which the terms occur in the original search query 261 .
- the search result 204 includes the query terms “pants” “30” and “34,” in a same order as the terms occur in the original search query 261 .
- Data that reflects user interactions with the search results 264 can be logged and analyzed in order to gain insights that the reordering rule system 280 may use to evaluate particular query term reordering rules. For example, a user selection 266 of a particular search result on search results page 256 can be received by the search engine system 270 and provided as a selection message 267 to the reordering rule system 280 .
- the reordering rule system 280 may in turn evaluate particular query term reordering rules that are used to revise other search queries, or to score occurrences of query terms that occur in resources identified by other search queries. For instance, using click evaluation, the reordering rule system 280 may infer that the occurrence of two or more query terms in a same order, or in a different order, as the terms occur in the original search query may have resulted in a particular search result being selected as part of a set of search results, or may have driven the user's decision to select a particular search result.
- the reordering system 280 may, through skip evaluation, infer that the occurrence of two or more query terms in the same order, or in a different order, as the terms occur in the original search query may have driven the user's decision to skip a particular search result that is ranked higher than the search result that the user selected.
- the search engine 270 identifies search results 202 , 203 , and 204 in response to the search query 261 , which includes the phrase “pants 30 34.” If users generally tend to select search results that include the phase “30 34 pants,” such as by selecting search result 203 , the reordering rule system 280 can gain the insight that that the phrase “30 34 pants” is associated with high quality search results for the original query terms “pants 30 34.”
- a query term revision rule may be invoked to revise future search queries that include the phrase “pants 30 34,” to reverse the order of “pants” and “30 34.”
- a query term scoring rule may be implemented to score occurrences of the phrase “30 34 pants” as highly as, or nearly as highly as, occurrences of the phrase “pants 30 34,” in resources that are identified by the search engine 270 .
- One such rule for example, is a query revision rule that swaps the position of number pairs, relative to the term “pants,” in future search queries.
- the reordering rule system 280 can gain the insight that the phrase “pants 34 30” is associated with lower quality search results for the terms “pants 30 34.” Accordingly, use of a query term revision rule that effects such a reordering can be discontinued, or a query term scoring rule may be implemented to assign a low score to occurrences of the phrase “34 30,” in resources that are identified by the search engine 270 in response to a search query that includes the terms “30 34.”
- various metrics can be computed and combined into score for each reordering rule.
- a separate score can be computed for each reordering rule, in a general context or in particular contexts.
- a “click” occurs when a user selects a search result whose referenced document does not include the reordered original query terms. In other implementations, a “click” occurs when the search result itself, and not the referenced document, does not include the reordered original query terms.
- the selection of a search result is referred to by this specification as a “click,” the selection can also be a voice-based selection, or a selection by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, e.g., a touch-screen device, or any other appropriate selection mechanism.
- both clicks may be given a weight smaller than other clicks, due to the potential ambiguity of the user selection.
- a skip occurs when a user skips over a particular search result that was identified for a revised search query when the referenced document of the skipped search result does not include a reordered original query terms. Skipping over the particular search result occurs when the user selects another search result that is ranked lower than, or displayed beneath, the particular result on a search results page. In other implementations, a “skip” occurs when the search result itself, and not the referenced document, satisfies these criteria.
- FIG. 3A illustrates and example search results page 355 a and a table 300 a that shows the example result of evaluating query term reordering rules using click and skip evaluation.
- the search results page 355 a presents a ranked list of search results in response to a search query 305 a (“pants 30 34”) entered into a search box 310 a .
- the search results page can include a control element 320 (e.g. a button) for initiating a search.
- Each search result 332 a , 334 a , and 336 a includes a title (e.g. “Pants Online” 342 a ) and a snippet (e.g. “ . . . pants 30 34 on sale . . . ” 343 a ).
- a user's selection of a particular search result can be evaluated using click or skip evaluation, resulting in a click or skip being counted for particular reordering rules associated with the particular search result.
- the search results page 355 a can be provided by a search system, for example, search system 130 as shown in FIG. 1 .
- a search system (for example, search system 130 ) can receive user selections of search results on the search results page 355 a and evaluate query term reordering rules based on the user selections.
- a reordering rule system may evaluate the query term reordering rules “swap numbers less than 100” and “preserve number ordering if after pants.”
- the table 300 a shows query term reordering rules 311 a that are under evaluation for revising future search queries.
- the resulting click count 312 a and skip count 313 a are also illustrated in table 300 a .
- FIG. 3A only the reordering rules “swap numbers less than 100” and “preserve number ordering if after pants” are illustrated, although query term reordering rules other than those shown in table 300 a may also be evaluated.
- search result 334 a has been selected by a user.
- search result 334 a has the same number ordering as the search query 305 a “pants 30 34,” and the numbers are followed by pants. Therefore, the selection of search result 334 a is counted as a click for the query term reordering rule “preserve number ordering in context with ‘pants’” and recorded, illustrated under click count 312 a in table 300 a.
- search result 332 a has not been selected by a user.
- search result 332 a has the numbers swapped compared to the search query 305 a “pants 30 34,” and the numbers 30 and 34 are less than 100.
- the search result 332 a was ranked above the search result 334 a because the search result 332 a was listed higher than the search result 334 a on the search results page 355 a . Therefore, because the user selected the search result 334 a and skipped the search result 332 a , the query term reordering rule “swap numbers less than 100” is incremented as illustrated under skip count 313 a in table 300 a.
- FIG. 3B illustrates an example search results page 355 b and a table 300 b that show the example result of evaluating reordering rules using click and skip evaluation.
- the example search results page 355 b is similar to the search results page as shown in FIG. 3A .
- reordering rules “swap numbers less than 1000” and “preserve numbers separated by dashes” are applied to the search query 305 b “555-123-4567.”
- search result 334 b has been selected by a user.
- the selected search result 334 b has the same number ordering as the search query 305 b “555-123-4567,” and the numbers are separated by dashes. Therefore, the selection of search result 334 b is counted as a click for the query term reordering rule “preserve numbers separated by dashes” and recorded, illustrated under click count 312 b in table 300 b.
- search result 332 b has not been selected by a user.
- search result 332 b has the numbers swapped compared to the search query 305 b “555-123-4567,” and the numbers 555 and 123 are less than 100.
- the search result 332 b was ranked above the search result 334 b because the search result 332 b was listed higher than the search result 334 b on the search results page 355 b . Therefore, since the user selected the search result 334 b and skipped the search result 332 b , the reordering rule “swap numbers less than 1000” is incremented as illustrated under skip count 313 b in table 300 b.
- a reordering system can aggregate counts of clicks and skips into a single score to evaluate a particular reordering rule.
- the reordering system can remove a reordering rule whose corresponding score is below a threshold.
- the reordering system can assign a respective weight (e.g. 3 and 5) to a click count and a skip count.
- the weights are empirically determined.
- the reordering system can then compute a weighted ratio using a combination of counts recorded for a particular reordering rule as shown below in Equation (2), using example weights A and B:
- the reordering system can remove or demote a particular reordering rule. After removing the reordering rule from the system, revised queries generated by the search system 130 will not include reordered original query terms identified with the particular reordering rule.

- the system receives an indication that the user has selected a particular search result ( 430 ).
- the system determines that the particular search result includes the two or more query terms in a different order than the particular order in which the two or more query terms are ordered in the initial search query.
- the system instead of analyzing only the provided search result, the system analyzes the entire indexed document for the presence or absence of the reordered original query terms and the original query terms.
- the system increments a click count for the reordering rule that corresponds a query term reordering rule associated with the two or more query terms ( 440 ).
- the system can combine one or multiple click and skip counts into a single score for the reordering rule. Each count can have an associated weight. For example, the system can weight the click count five times more significant than the skip count.
- the system computes a score based on a ratio of click counts to skip counts. The system can then use the score to adjust a confidence score for the particular reordering rule. The system can also remove a reordering rule whose score did not exceed a threshold.

- the system can compute click counts and skip counts for a particular reordering rule offline by processing data stored in a query log.
- Query logs store anonymized data regarding provided search results for a certain period of time (e.g. a week).

Abstract
Description
W1 represents the first weight associated with the click count and W2 represents the second weight associated with the skip count. The query term reordering rule comprises a query term revision rule for revising search queries by reordering the two or more query terms from the particular order to the different order. The query term reordering rule comprises a query term scoring rule for scoring occurrences of the two or more query terms that occur in the different order in resources that are identified in response to search queries. The different order is a reverse of the particular order.
