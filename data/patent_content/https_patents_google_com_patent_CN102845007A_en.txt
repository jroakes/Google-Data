Abstract
Communication is performed for a first communication device having a set of antenna elements. A quality-indication signal is received from a second communication device (e.g., a basestation). A complex weighting is calculated based on the quality-indication signal. A pre-transmission signal is modified based on the complex transmit diversity weighting to produce a set of modified-pre-transmission signals, wherein the modifications are symmetric by making approximately half the magnitude of the transmit diversity modification to one signal in a first direction, and approximately half the magnitude of the transmit diversity modification to the other signal in a second direction, opposite the first direction. Each modified pre-transmission signal from the set of modified-pre-transmission signals is uniquely associated with an antenna element from the set of antenna elements. The set of modified-pre-transmission signals is sent from the set of antenna elements to produce a transmitted signal.

To recall the base station and can transmission be perceived as single composite signal.That is, the base station can receive two or more transmitted diversity signals as the individual signals with amplitude and phase place.The characteristic of the transmitted diversity signals of the combination that the base station received is called as apperceive characteristic in this article.Thereby, for example, move the transmit diversity communication equipment and can send first and second signals, wherein have phase difference between first and second signals.Can this first and second signal of perception at base station place, as the composite signal of the amplitude of phase place with perception and perception.In addition, the path of the signal that the antenna of mobile communication equipment sends respectively possibly suffer different declines, for example different pahtfinder hard losses.Therefore, the signal of an antenna transmission can arrive the base station with first phase shift, and the signal of another antenna transmission can arrive the base station with second phase shift that is different from first phase shift.Therefore, the phase difference between signals of antenna transmission and amplitude difference not (and usually not) equal phase difference and amplitude difference between the transmitting of base station place perception.Therefore, when being received as the composite signal of perception at base station place, transmitting can be constructively or combination devastatingly.Disturbing certainly of this signal generation effect that antenna sent to mobile unit possibly not be that priori is known, and normally can not be by base station measurement.Therefore; Embodiments of the invention can use gradient search disturbance (gradient-seeking perturbation) method (like what in a plurality of distortion, describe among this paper) so that the optimum phase difference between confirming to transmit; Make when being received the combination of signal construction property ground.
According to embodiments of the invention; The processor of mobile communication equipment or control logic can be exported one or more parameters; With the nominal value of the transmit diversity parameter that will distinguish in first signal that sends on first antenna and the secondary signal that will on second antenna, send through adjustment, revise preparatory transmission signals.Like what more fully describe among this paper; According to embodiments of the invention; Can comprise in the modulation to transmit diversity parameter during the disturbance cycle: during the first in disturbance cycle; Use is sent with the transmit diversity parameter that nominal value departs from first direction, and then during the second portion in disturbance cycle, uses the transmit diversity parameter that on second direction, departs from nominal value to send.Distortion also is possible, for example, on a plurality of time slots, on first direction, can have a plurality of continuous disturbances, on a plurality of time slots, on second direction, can have a plurality of continuous disturbances subsequently.In another distortion, mobile unit can wait based on the sequence of quality indicator feedback signal and change transmit diversity parameter.Within the scope of the invention, other method of change transmit diversity parameter also is possible.
An embodiment of operations according to the instant invention, mobile communication equipment can be revised this signal through signal is carried out disturbance.Signal is carried out disturbance can be meant the signal characteristic of modulating this signal with respect to the nominal value of signal, for example, be directed against on the first direction of first feedback interval and revising signal characteristic on the second direction of another feedback interval.The disturbance cycle can be meant second modulation on modulation of first on the first direction and the second direction.In some embodiments of the invention, the disturbance cycle can comprise different (for example longer or more complicated) modulation sequence.As the example (wherein, transmit diversity parameter is relative phase rotation or phase difference) to embodiments of the invention, disturbance can comprise the phase difference on the modulation first direction and modulate the phase difference on the second direction.If feedback communication device (for example; The base station) signal that the feedback information indication that provides uses a disturbance modulation direction to receive is compared with the signal that uses another disturbance modulation direction to receive and is made moderate progress, and then can on the direction of improving, carry out next nominal value adjustment with the amount that can be less than or equal to modulation.
The signal of the antenna transmission of mobile radio station all has amplitude and phase place.Correspondingly, can signal hint property ground be described as the vector with positive scalar amplitude and direction or phase place.In order to make the simple purpose of explanation, can phase place be regarded as the angle of signal vector with respect to the x axle.Therefore, described above, the signal vector that transmits (for example amplitude and phase place) can be known when sending, but mobile unit can not use priori (for example, calculating in theory) that the base station perceives or the phase difference of measuring usually.On the contrary, the base station provides signal quality based on composite signal.According to the embodiment of the invention be used to calculate the mobile device of transmit diversity parameter and the purpose of the method that adopts thus is; When being employed; Permission will transmit to perceive as at the place, base station and not have phase difference basically; Perhaps reduce the component of the perception phase difference that phase change produced of mobile device at least, thereby allow signal constructively combination as follows: make base station perception different amplitude basically, and seldom or not perception phase change.On the contrary, will be appreciated that 180 ° phase difference of the perception at base station place will be avoided, perhaps should make it occur minimizing,, thereby make signal or the noise signal that the base station perception is more weak because it can be so that the signal corruption property of antenna transmission ground disturbs.
To recognize that embodiments of the invention can also be applied to provide the base station of the quality feedback of any kind of.For example, compare with POWER UP that individual bit only is provided or POWER DOWN signal, the base station can provide more detailed information to mobile unit; For example, the base station can be to next transmit diversity parameter of mobile unit proposed recommendations.In this case, the symmetry change of the phase difference among the present invention still can be used.Thereby, for example, can ask in the base station under the situation of specific change of phase difference, mobile unit can be realized the change of this phase difference symmetrically on antenna-path.
Fig. 6 A is symbolically is perceived as the exemplary vector that transmits of combination at the place, base station a sketch map.Therefore, that signal vector A and B submeter are represented is that base station place receives, by the signal A and the B of antenna transmission, each in the said signal have corresponding amplitude (| A| with | B|) and phase place (α and β).Can use amplitude (size) and phase place (angle) that known vector operation obtains consequent signal (vector).
Through head vector is placed on tail ground, will understand is that, when the phase place of (place's perception in the base station) A equals the phase place of (place's perception in the base station) B, promptly when the phase difference of perception when zero, the amplitude of consequent vector has maximum.Therefore; Disturbance scheme described herein is intended to systematically attempt various phase differences and obtains the feedback from the base station; Perceived effect with this variation of confirming phase difference has improved or has worsened signal quality (for example, the signal power of the combination of base station receiver or active base station institute perception).In the situation of signal quality index signal quality improvement, infer that this variation makes the phase difference of perception reduce, and in the situation of signal quality index signal deterioration, infer that this variation makes the phase difference of perception increase.
Yet, feedback communication device (for example base station) can follow the tracks of from revising signal that communication equipment (for example, moving transmission diversity apparatus) receives some receive parameter, for example be used for channel estimating, SIR estimates and/or the purpose of interference eliminated.Can the phase place of reception (combination) signal of base station perception by one of base station tracks such parameter.
A plurality of such reception parameters can be write down in the base station in the process of a plurality of time slots, but to detect the also trend of expectability reception signal.Suddenly or immediately the operation that changes for the base station of the signal phase of base station perception possibly be destructive.Therefore; The transmit diversity parameter of carrying out in order to improve received signal quality particularly the change of phase difference maybe be for example through causing changing suddenly or immediately of the perception phase place that receives signal; And have the successional side effect that destroys the base station perception, also be like this even reduce the phase difference of perception.
Fig. 6 B shows the signal A of first antenna transmission and signal B1 and the B2 that second antenna sends in transmission subsequently, wherein, the phase place of signal B1 is β 1, and the phase place of signal B2 is β 2.The size of mix vector A+B2 is bigger than mix vector A+B1.Yet perception will be carried out to the variation of the phase place of perceptual signal in the base station, and possibly destroy the continuity at place, base station.
According to embodiments of the invention, can reduce because the potential negative effect that the variation of perception phase place causes to the base station.In some embodiments of the invention, can realize modification with the mode that reduces or minimize to the successional destruction of perception phase of received signal to transmit diversity parameter.
Like what describe among this paper; In some embodiments of the invention; Particularly in having the mobile transmission diversity apparatus of two antennas, the step-length that phase change can be applied to offsetting mechanism and be used to realize current nominal or center phase value, wherein; Phase place can be monotonously and disturbance repeatedly continuously, with the fixed value swing and make symbol sebolic addressing alternately, sign preferred orientations and correspondingly revise the center phase value, thereby promote the gradient search process.According to the present invention, can realize such phase change with the mode that reduces or minimize the successional destruction of perception phase place to received signal.
In some embodiments of the invention; Can make amendment to transmit diversity parameter symmetrically; Promptly; Through revising the parameter that first on the first direction transmits, and revise the parameter that second on the second direction transmits simultaneously, make exist at the place, base station seldom or do not have a perceived effect.
For example, in the situation of phase difference, can be through modification being applied to each in a plurality of antennas rather than only being applied to the phase place that a signal in first and second signals is adjusted first and second signals.More specifically; According to some embodiments of the present invention; In order to realize specific phase difference, the phase place of first signal can nearly be expectation phase difference half the on the first direction (for example, positive) by adjustment; The phase place of secondary signal can nearly be expectation phase difference half the on the second direction opposite with first direction (for example, negative) by adjustment.For example, be perceived as in the identical situation by base station receiver, thereby can minimize or even eliminate the perception phase effects of applied transmit diversity phase difference in the power level of two transmitting antennas.
In some embodiments of the invention; For example; If the signal that the expectation phase difference sends on another antenna for the signal that
sends so can be modified
The illustration of embodiments of the invention has been shown in Fig. 6 C, 6D and 6E.Fig. 6 C shows two signal A and the B that sends with specific any phase difference.These signals all are received with respective phase (being respectively α and β), thereby cause receiving phase poor, and the receiving phase difference usually can be different with the transmitter, phase difference.For illustrative purposes, the size of supposing the signal A that receives at base station place and B about equally.
In first disturbance shown in Fig. 6 D; The phase difference of signal is reduced side-play amount or increment
In second disturbance shown in Fig. 6 E; The phase difference of signal is increased side-play amount or increment
Correspondingly, embodiments of the invention can change symmetrical phase the signal that (for example side-play amount or increment) is applied on antenna, send, and make when increased these phase change consequent and with less or be zero identically.Therefore, this summation can have less in place, base station establishment perception size variation or not have the perception phase change, thereby reduces or minimize the successional destruction of the perception phase of received signal that the base station is located.For example, when this algorithm obtained (towards preferred calculated direction) increase or reduces the decision-making of center phase place through dull disturbance, identical mechanism can be applied to phase jump.
In some embodiments of the invention, transmitting antenna can have different efficiency, and this possibly cause unequal combination.Correspondingly, when make up two when transmitting unequally, changes in amplitude can also be followed phase change, its with the efficient of antenna than proportional.Therefore, for example, according to embodiments of the invention, when the efficient of antenna is unequal, so can be based on top The deformation calculation symmetry, top distortion can be considered different efficiency.Therefore, can be applied to the ratio of phase change with the phase change of another branch of a branch with the uneven similarly pro-rata of average power.For example:
The efficient of the wherein efficient of η 1 expression first antenna, and η 2 expressions second antenna.Correspondingly, combination complex vector located will keep less or be zero, and phase change will be perceived as less or not have at the place, base station.Use different capacity to send in the situation of signal at respective antenna, for example, when the corresponding inefficiency of power ratio and antenna be inversely proportional in the situation of the unit of being greater than or less than 1, can carry out similar calculating.
In some embodiments of the invention; Make the process of algorithm decision-making to each; Phase difference

Fig. 9 shows according to embodiment and is used for rotating the flow chart of calculated complex weighting through the phase place that adjustment is associated with each antenna element.Though will describe Fig. 9 with reference to figure 1, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for ease, can use with any configuration of user communication device with reference to the method that figure 9 describes.In addition, though the quality index signal can be to user communication device any suitably signal of type about the information of signal quality to be provided,, suppose that the quality index signal is the power control signal according to the CDMA agreement for the ease of discussing.
In step 900, from the base station 110 via wireless connections 130 to user communication device 120 transmitted power index signals.In step 910, from baseband subsystems 121 to signal modifier 122 (among Fig. 5, also being shown signal modifier 500) transmitting power control signal based on quality indicator based on quality indicator.According to the power control signal pointer of CDMA agreement to one in two probable values of any preset time of section: " increase " value or " reducing " value.The indication of " increase " value representation from the base station to the user communication device, this indication is meant that user communication device should increase the gross power that it transmits." reduce " indication of value representation from the base station to the user communication device, this indication is meant that user communication device should reduce the gross power that it transmits.The particular value of power control signal also relates in this article and comprises power control bit, and power control bit is represented added value or reduced value with binary form.
In step 920, keep this process till power control signal reaches stable state.Power control signal can reach stable state with a plurality of modes.For example, increase-reduce-increase or reduce-increase-continuous sequence of the power control signal that reduces.In case power control signal reaches stable state, this process just proceeds to step 930.
In step 930, the phase place rotation that adjustment is associated with an antenna element.Turn back to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, control logic 502 is calculated new complex weighted, makes the phase place rotation that changes an antenna element.With this complex weighted signal-conditioning unit (for example, signal- conditioning unit 620 and 640, perhaps signal-conditioning unit 630 and 650) that offers to this antenna element.Receive complex weighted after, the rotation of these signal-conditioning units adjustment phase places, thus revise the signal component of sending from this antenna element, and therefore revise the gross power that transmits.
In condition step 940, whether the power control signal of control logic 502 definite later time sections is indicated and is reduced (for example, by reducing value representation).If power control signal indication reduces, caused the base station more preferably to receive to the adjustment of the phase place rotation of an antenna element so and transmitted.In other words, because the base station receives transmitting of gross power with increase,, the base station reduces to indicate so will sending in power control signal subsequently.The phase place rotation that user communication device can continue to attempt this antenna element is optimized, and reduces the gross power that transmits simultaneously.Can reduce the gross power that transmits, this is because user communication device just communicates with better mode and base station.
In condition step 940, if power control signal is not indicated reduce (for example, power control signal indication added value) of the gross power that transmits, phase place rotation adjustment is not effectively so, and this process proceeds to step 950.In step 950, the phase place rotation that logic control 502 will be associated with this antenna element changes to rightabout.Then, this process proceeds to step 920, the rightabout repeating step 920 to 940 that wherein rotates based on phase place.
In condition step 940, if the reducing of the gross power that power control signal indication transmits (for example, the power control signal indication reduces value), phase place rotation adjustment is effective so, and this process proceeds to step 960.In step 960, keep this process till power control signal reaches stable state.In step 970, logic control 502 will change to identical direction with the phase place rotation that this antenna element is associated.Then, this process proceeds to step 920, the equidirectional repeating step 920 to 940 that wherein rotates based on phase place.
Figure 10 shows according to another embodiment and is used for rotating the flow chart of calculated complex weighting through the phase place that adjustment is associated with each antenna element.In step 1000, keep this process till power control signal reaches stable state.In case power control signal reaches stable state, this process just proceeds to step 1010.In step 1010, rotate based on the new complex weighted phase place that is associated with an antenna element of adjusting that control logic 502 calculates.
In condition step 1020, control logic 502 confirms whether the power control signals of time period subsequently indicate reduce (for example, by reducing value representation) of the gross power that transmits.If power control signal indication reduces, caused the base station more preferably to receive to the adjustment of the phase place rotation of an antenna element so and transmitted.Therefore, the preferential direction of phase place rotation is correct, and the further adjustment to the phase place rotation can cause better transmitting on equidirectional.
In condition step 1020, if power control signal is not indicated reduce (for example, power control signal indication added value) of the gross power that transmits, phase place rotation adjustment is not effectively so, and this process proceeds to step 1030.In step 1030, the phase place rotation that logic control 502 will be associated with this antenna element changes to rightabout.Then, this process proceeds to step 1000, wherein, and based on the rightabout repeating step 1000 to 1020 of phase place rotation.
In step 1040, logic control 502 changes the phase place rotation that is associated with this antenna element on identical direction.In condition step 1050, whether control logic 502 definite power control signals of time period have subsequently been indicated and have been reduced (for example, by reducing value representation).If the power control signal indication reduces, the adjustment to the phase place rotation is effectively so, and process proceeds to 1040 once more.Repeating step 1040 and 1050 is till control logic 502 is confirmed the increase of the gross power of the power control signal indication transmitting power of time periods subsequently.At this moment, through rotation averages the phase place rotation that can obtain the best to the phase place during the step 1040, and this process proceeds to step 1060.In step 1060, the phase place of antenna element is rotated the optimum phase rotation value before turning back to.Then, this process proceeds to step 1000, in step 1000, repeats this process to another antenna element.By this way, can repeat this process to each antenna element, to obtain whole optimum values of a plurality of antenna elements.
Figure 11 shows according to another embodiment and is used for rotating the flow chart of calculated complex weighting through the phase place that adjustment is associated with each antenna element.The value that Figure 11 has described two power control bits that receive recently is used for confirming suitable phase place rotation and therefore confirms suitable complex weighted method.
In this embodiment, the mode that the user communication device that uses the CDMA agreement is in same level P with the power that is associated with two adjacent power control groups (PCG) is sent the signal of these two PCG.For this discussion is simplified, suppose that for this embodiment user communication device has two antenna elements, but a plurality of antenna elements of any amount all are possible.Second antenna element is Phi with respect to the phase place rotation of first antenna element in quick PCG.Second antenna element is Phi+Delta with respect to the phase place rotation of first antenna element in the 2nd PCG.
The phase rotation migration of introducing between first and second PCG (being called " Delta ") is provided for the mechanism of the direction of the phase place rotation between definite two antenna elements, and wherein this direction will be improved the signal quality that the place, base station receives.Therefore; Can come the calculated complex weighting in the following manner: if the value of the power control bit of time period is corresponding with the value of the power control bit of the second nearest time period recently; Keeping the phase place rotation of two antenna elements gross power that adjustment transmits in the time of (that is, keeping Phi) so; If the value of the power control bit of time period is different with the value of the power control bit of second time period recently, then the phase place of two antenna elements of adjustment is rotated (that is, Phi) when keeping the gross power that transmits.This embodiment is discussed below more fully.
In step 1100, initialization is rotated with a phase place that is associated in two antenna elements.In step 1110, be that two adjacent PCG introduce phase rotation migration (preceding text also are called Delta).Based on the phase rotation migration of this introducing, transmit to the base station from user communication device.Then, the base station is based on this transmitting power control signal that transmits that has received.
In condition step 1120, confirm whether the value of two power control bits that receive recently is identical.In other words, for each time period, power control bit will have particular value.For example, for CDMA and WCDAM agreement, this time period is respectively 1.25 milliseconds and 666 delicate.The value of definite power control bit with the nearest time period at step 1120 place and the value of the power control bit of the second nearest time period compare.If the value of these two power control bits is consistent, then this process proceeds to step 1130.If the value of these two power control bits is different, then this process proceeds to step 1140.
In step 1130, the gross power that adjustment transmits in the phase place rotation that keeps antenna element.Control logic 502 new is complex weightedly adjusted the gross power that transmits through suitably calculating, and keeps the phase place rotation of two antenna elements.Then, this process proceeds to step 1110, feasible this process that repeats.
In step 1140, when keeping the gross power that transmits, adjust the phase place rotation of these two antenna elements.Control logic 502 is through suitably calculating the new complex weighted phase place rotation of adjusting antenna, and keeps the gross power that transmits.Then, this process proceeds to step 1110, feasible this process that repeats.
By this way, the value of two power control bits that receive recently is used for confirming suitable phase place rotation and therefore confirms suitable complex weighted.Though, do not adjust the power ratio of respective antenna elements according to the gross power that this embodiment adjustment transmits.Hereinafter combines the embodiment of Figure 12 and Figure 13 discussion to solve complex weighted calculating, makes that the gross power that transmits, the phase place rotation and the power ratio of antenna element are adjusted.
Figure 12 shows the power ratio and the phase place that are used for according to an embodiment of the invention through adjustment is associated with each antenna element and rotates the flow chart of calculated complex weighting.In this embodiment, consider the element threshold test before in the arbitrary phase rotation or the power ratio of adjustment antenna element.Equally, in order to simplify this discussion, suppose that for this embodiment user communication device has two antenna elements, but a plurality of antenna elements of any amount all are possible.Through the ratio of inspection antenna element, the base station can use the power control bit of power control signal that feedback is provided.
More specifically, based on the value of threshold value, can adjust the phase place rotation to converge on best basically phase place rotation value.After having confirmed best basically phase place rotation value, can calculate the power ratio of antenna element, till best basically power ratio convergence.This process is an iteration, and can be interrupted at any time to change the arbitrary parameter such as phase place rotation or power ratio.
In step 1200, measure the power ratio of two antenna elements.In condition step 1210, confirm whether power ratio is lower than predetermined threshold.If power ratio is not less than predetermined threshold, then this process proceeds to step 1240.If power ratio is lower than predetermined threshold, then this process proceeds to step 1220 and rotates with tuning phase place.
In step 1220, change the phase place rotation to search maximum.In condition step 1230, the rotation of inspection phase place is to confirm whether it is best basically value.If this phase place rotation is not best basically value, then this process proceeds to step 1220, and in step 1220, the process that is used to search best basically phase place rotation value continues.If the phase place rotation is best basically value, then this process proceeds to step 1240.
In step 1240, change power ratio to search maximum.In condition step 1250, the inspection power ratio is to confirm whether it is best basically value.If this power ratio is not best basically value, then this process proceeds to step 1240, and in step 1240, the process that is used to search best basically power ratio continues.If power ratio is best basically value, then this process proceeds to step 1200, in step 1200, and whole process repeated.
In a word, can adjust the power ratio that is associated with antenna element then, come the calculated complex weighting through at first adjusting the phase place rotation that is associated with antenna element.By this way, can adjust phase place rotation and power recently optimize basically send from user communication device, transmitting in the base station reception.
Figure 13 shows the power ratio and the phase place that are used for according to another embodiment of the present invention through adjustment is associated with each antenna element and rotates the flow chart of calculated complex weighting.Similar with Figure 11, Figure 13 has described two power control ratio paricular values that receive recently and has been used for confirming suitable phase place rotation.Yet, in Figure 13, the power ratio that adjustment is associated with two antenna elements after having adjusted the phase place rotation that is associated with second antenna element.The process of adjustment power ratio is with top to adjust the process that phase place rotates with reference to Figure 11 being used to of describing similar.
In this embodiment, the mode that the user communication device that uses the CDMA agreement is in same level P with the power that is associated with two adjacent power control groups (PCG) is sent the signal of these two PCG.Equally, in order to simplify this discussion,, suppose that user communication device has two antenna elements, but a plurality of antenna elements of any amount all are possible for this embodiment.
First antenna element is Lambda with the power ratio that is associated with a PCG between second antenna element.First antenna element is Lambda+Zeta with the power ratio that is associated with the 2nd PCG between second antenna element.(that is, Zeta) mechanism that is used for confirming changing the direction of the power ratio between two antenna elements is provided, wherein said direction will be improved the signal quality that the place, base station receives to the skew of the power ratio introduced between first and second PCG.Therefore; Can come the calculated complex weighting in the following manner: if the power control ratio paricular value of time of reception section conforms to the power control ratio paricular value of the second nearest time of reception section recently, the gross power that then adjustment transmits in the power ratio that keeps two antenna elements; If the power control ratio paricular value of time of reception section is different with the power control ratio paricular value of the second nearest time of reception section recently, then when keeping the gross power that transmits, adjust power ratio Lambda.This embodiment is discussed below more fully.
In step 1300, phase place rotation and power ratio that initialization is associated with two antenna elements.In step 1310, be that two adjacent PCG introduce phase rotation migrations (above be also referred to as Delta).Based on the phase rotation migration of this introducing, transmit to the base station from user communication device.Then, the base station transmits transmitting power control signal based on what this had received.
In condition step 1320, confirm whether two power control ratio paricular values that receive recently are identical.If these two power control ratio paricular values are consistent, then this process proceeds to step 1330.If these two power control ratio paricular values are different, then this process proceeds to step 1340.
In step 1330, the gross power that adjustment transmits in the phase place rotation that keeps antenna element.Control logic 502 new is complex weightedly adjusted the gross power that transmits through suitably calculating, and keeps the phase place rotation of two antenna elements.Note, during this step, also keep the power ratio of these two antenna elements.Then, this process proceeds to step 1310, feasible this process that repeats.
In step 1340, when keeping the gross power that transmits, adjust the phase place rotation of these two antenna elements.Control logic 502 is through suitably calculating the new complex weighted gross power of adjusting the phase place rotation of antenna and keeping transmitting.Attention also keeps the power ratio of these two antenna elements during this step.This process proceeds to condition step 1345 then.
In condition step 1345, confirm whether the phase place rotation through adjustment that step 1340 produces is best.If this phase place rotation is not best basically, then this process proceeds to step 1310.If this phase place rotation is best basically, then this process proceeds to step 1350.
In step 1350, be that two adjacent PCG introduce power ratios skew (above be also referred to as Zeta).In condition step 1350, confirm whether two power control ratio paricular values that receive recently are consistent.If two power control ratio paricular values that receive recently are consistent, then this process proceeds to step 1380.If two power control ratio paricular values that receive recently are different, then this process proceeds to step 1370.
In step 1370, the power ratio of adjustment antenna element when keeping gross power that transmits and the phase place that keeps two antenna elements rotation.Control logic 502 is through suitably calculating the new complex weighted gross power of adjusting the power ratio of antenna and keeping transmitting and the phase place rotation of two antenna elements.Then, this process proceeds to step 1350, makes repeating step 1350 and 1360, till two value unanimities of the power control ratio paricular value that receives up to date.
In step 1380, the power that adjustment transmits in power ratio that keeps antenna element and phase place rotation.Control logic 502 is through suitably calculating new complex weighted power ratio and the phase place rotation of adjusting the gross power that transmits and keeping antenna element.In condition step 1390, determine whether to have lost monitoring.If do not lose monitoring, then this process proceeds to step 1350, makes the process that repeats tuning power ratio that is associated with antenna element and the gross power that transmits in step 1350 in to 1390.
Turn back to condition step 1390, if lost monitoring, then this process proceeds to step 1310, wherein, step 1310 to 1390 in repeated optimization phase place rotation and the process of optimizing power ratio subsequently.
Top discussion discloses the mobile transmit beam-forming diversity system of service quality index signal, and it can not need any new standardization dynamical feedback signaling between network and the mobile unit.Base station receiver possibly recognize not that mobile unit is in open loop beam shaping diversity mode, that is, need not handle (channel estimating, demodulation, decoding synchronously) to base station receiver in order to make mobile unit adapt to this pattern and carry out any change.Mobile transmit beam-forming can realize and the phase shift similar performance that phase shift has just caused the phase difference between first-class and second stream.Some algorithms of confirming phase difference according to one or more quality index signals (that is up-link power control bit) are provided here.
