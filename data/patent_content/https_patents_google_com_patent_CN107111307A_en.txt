A group of planes can additionally be operated in such manner, and the mode can be conducive to a part of map being published to these robots
Device.It should be understood that, although only two maps are illustrated, but it is other in the middle of the map that updates in some cases can be
Come forth and can be cited herein during the execution of task.
As shown, Fig. 4 B and 4C map includes representative and the warehouse 400 of the various robot devices illustrated in Fig. 4 A
In object such as pallet and storage rack representative.Fig. 4 B map is included from electrical forklift 402, AGV 410 and pedestal machine respectively
The representative of the prediction track in future 418,420 and 422 of device people 408.In addition, map includes the prediction place in future 424 of pallet 404
Representative.Especially, Fig. 4 B map (and Fig. 4 C map, or be described herein but unshowned other maps) can show
Go out the prediction place in future and track of the particular point in time in future or multiple particular point in times in future.Thus, map
It can indicate when robot device where performs the corresponding task stage (for example, how base machine people 408 will be appreciated by pallet 404
When will be located at base machine people near, so base machine people can prepare or start from pallet unload box).
As a part for task, it can be predicted along track 418 and be advanced so that pallet 404 to be transported from electrical forklift 402
To prediction place in future 424.In addition, after pallet 404 is transported to prediction place 424 in future, AGV 410 can be predicted from
Its current location advances to be loaded with the box from pallet 404 by base machine people 408 along track 420.Correspondingly, base

The map of Fig. 4 C renewal respectively include base machine people 408, the AGV 416 of AGV 410 and the 2nd prediction in the future
The representative of track 426,428 and 430.In addition, map includes the generation in the prediction place in future 432 of the box removed from pallet 404
Table.As a part for task, base machine people 408, which can be predicted along track 426, to rotate with by the box from pallet 404
Son is loaded into AGV 410.Advance to take box to robot truck in addition, AGV 410 can be predicted along track 428
Loading machine 412, box is loaded into truck by robot truck loading machine.Further, the 2nd AGV416 can be by
Prediction is advanced along track 430, so as to which base machine people is removed and may be moved adjacent to later from AGV 410 road
408 place is loaded with the box being used to from pallet.Correspondingly, certain time point during the execution of task, planning system
Map can be updated to change the 2nd AGV 416 track in predetermined prediction future, prediction track in future 430 is derived from.
2nd AGV 416 can not be involved in by box from the task that pallet 404 takes to and is loaded on truck, but
It is that can be involved in the other tasks performed in the consistent region in the region with performing other tasks in warehouse 400, and
And be thus configured to control and manage the 2nd AGV planning system and can announce the map for the 2nd AGV.Especially, scheme
Map shown in 4C can be published to the 2nd AGV 416, or its modification, such as including at least predicting track in future 428

The cotasking stage of robot truck loading machine 412.In example, if the AGV 410 or other machines that are related in task
People's device is delayed by (for example, running into barrier), then the deadline of task is by based on to reflecting that delay and reflection are accordingly repaiied
Change any prediction future place more newly arriving for map correspondingly adjust.
In addition to those described on Fig. 4 A, 4B and 4C or alternatively, other examples task and corresponding
Figure updates and situation is also possible.
In example, received task process data can include disappearing for the completion for indicating the execution of given task phase
Breath.Correspondingly, control system can make at least one robot device in one or more of robot devices in response to
Indicate the message of the completion of the execution of given task phase and perform and Given task stage continuous another task phase.At it
In its example, task process data that can be based on the completion of the execution including instruction task received or based on control system
System otherwise determines that the execution of task has been done to perform completely new task.Determined in response to such, control
System can update map with the completion for the execution for indicating or otherwise notifying robot device's task.Control system is right
It can select to select pending follow-up work from multiple tasks afterwards, and hold one or more of group of planes robot device
The row follow-up work.Control system can select follow-up work according to the map of renewal.For example, the map updated can indicate one
Group robot device is predicted in the region-of-interest of environment or close to region-of-interest, in the region-of-interest, this group of machines
People's device can perform Given task, such as pick up the object inadvertently fallen off by other robot devices and be used as influence region-of-interest
In robot device route barrier object.Thus, control system can make the group robot device be based on renewal
Map in such instruction perform Given task.Other examples are also possible.
In example, control system can determine the expection deadline of the execution of task based on the map of determination.So
Afterwards, update map and/or in response to receive task process data after, control system can more new task execution expection it is complete
Into the time.Similarly, control system can determine the expection deadline of the execution of at least one task phase.Then, more
New map and/or in response to receiving after task process data, control system can update the execution of at least one task phase
It is expected that the deadline.
In example, control system, the computing system based on cloud or the group of planes for being configured to manage robot device
Other entities of at least a portion robot device can maintain a series of renewals to map.To the map maintained in series
Each renewal can include data, data regulation will for example update the given robot device's that be published in a group of planes
The excellent of renewal is received before other robot devices which of time and/or an instruction group of planes robot device should be in a group of planes
Elder generation's property.Then control system can be published in the renewal maintained in series according to the time and/or priority of regulation.
In some cases, update be published to given robot device stipulated time can depend on various factors,
Time of robot device's inquiry control system to the renewal of its current map is such as given, robot device is given due to each
Kind of reason (for example, and current map deviation, run into barrier, unidentified sight etc.) by its current map
Renewal is sent to control system.So, for example, making one or more of robot devices perform described at least one other
The business stage can receive the inquiry in response to control system and be performed, and can be related to control system by the map of renewal
At least a portion with to be performed by one or more of robot devices according at least a portion of the map of renewal
The instruction of at least one other task phase is (for example, advancing to and picking up what is dropped recently by another robot device
The instruction of object) it is sent collectively to one or more of robot devices.
In these and other situation, control system can determine the priority of the group of planes of robot device, and it limits machine
Relative priority in a group of planes for device people's device, each robot device has corresponding priority.Control system thus can be with
At least a portion of map is sent update to according to the priority of determination, for example, sending update to relatively low preferential
The robot device with higher priority is sent update to before the robot device of level.Control system is it is determined that priority
When can contemplate various factors, one or more of these factors can be combined and use.In example, when described at least one
Region-of-interest (for example, part of device harbour, weighing station, assembly line etc.) in environment occurs for the execution of individual other tasks
When, can first be determined by control system be each at least a portion robot device in the group of planes of robot device
It is no to be related in the execution of task (that is, each whether known be related to or predict and will be related to) to determine priority.Minimum
Degree, in such an example, control system can make to be related to the priority height in the executory robot device of task
In not being related to the priority in the executory robot device of task.
, can be by determining the respective distance from each robot device to region-of-interest, often in further example
Individual robot reaches the corresponding expeced time that region-of-interest will take for, and/or the corresponding expected trajectory of each robot device is
No at least a portion including region-of-interest is (for example, whether robot device can be advanced through region-of-interest and/or will be with occupying
The robot device of region-of-interest or object contact), to determine priority.Control system can for example be based on map and its renewal
The prediction place in future included determines such expected trajectory and time.According to such example, when robot device's tool
Have by update inform map more in the urgent need to when, control system can make the priority of those robot devices higher, especially
It is that renewal to map corresponds to region-of-interest, on the contrary, when robot device have inform renewal it is relatively low in the urgent need to
