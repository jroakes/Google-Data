- the query log 139 includes a web query table 141 for storing information regarding web queries received by the Internet search engine 140 and a shopping query table 143 for storing information regarding queries received by the product catalog system 130 .
- Each table 141 , 143 typically stores each received query, for example in the form of a text string, and the frequency of those received queries over some time period.
- each table 141 , 143 may include the number of times each query was received from different users during the previous week, month, or other period of time.
- the shopping query table 143 also includes, for each query, information regarding products that were selected by the end users 145 after the query was submitted and results were provided to the end user 145 .
- This information regarding products may include, for each query, information identifying the product selected by end users 145 after receiving the query. For example, if end users 145 selected several versions of a particular tablet computer in response to the query “tablet computer,” each of those versions may be included in a table entry for the query “tablet computer.”
- the shopping query table 143 also may include, for each query, the frequency that each product was selected in response to the query. For example, if a first version of the Apple iPad is selected 150 times and a second version of the Apple iPad is selected 300 times, the shopping query table 143 can log this information.
- the shopping query table 143 includes a two dimensional table that is configured such that each column represents a product of the product catalog 137 and each row represents a received query.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a shopping query table 500 , in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- the exemplary shopping query table 500 includes columns 505 for products and rows 510 for queries.
- the cells 515 defined by the columns 505 and rows 510 include the number of times that a product was selected for the corresponding query. For example, Product A was selected 291 times after Query 1 was submitted and was selected 82 times after Query 2 was submitted. If a new query is submitted that is not already included in the shopping query table 143 , the product catalog system 130 can add a new row 510 for that query.
- the product catalog system 130 has access to a previously populated query log 139 .
- the Internet search engine 140 and the product catalog system 130 may already log this information.
- the query log 139 can continue to be updated for each received query. If a previously populated query log 139 is not available, the query log 139 can be populated from received queries until a sufficient amount of data is logged. For example, the query log 139 may be populated according to the method 210 of FIG. 2 discussed in more detail below.
- an alternatives module 133 of the product catalog system 130 analyzes the information stored in the query log 139 to identify alternative products.
- the alternatives module 133 evaluates queries directed to the comparison of two products and further evaluates the association between queries and products selected in response to the queries to identify products that are alternatives to one another.
- the alternatives module 133 can link or otherwise associate alternative products together.
- the alternatives module 133 also can rank product alternatives for each product such that the most relevant product alternatives are presented to users along with a target product. Block 215 is described in more detail below in connection with FIG. 4 .
- the product catalog system 130 receives a query.
- a user operating the end user network device 145 navigate to an Internet website of the product catalog system 130 using the browser application module 150 .
- the user may enter a query for a product and the end user network device 145 transmits the query to the information provider network device 145 .
- a selection engine 135 of the product catalog system 130 selects one or more products for transmission to the end user network device 145 based on the received query.
- the selection engine 135 attempts to identify the target product or category of product that the user is searching for and selects products or categories of products that satisfy the query.
- the selection engine 135 selects alternative products for transmission to the end user network device 145 .
- the selection engine 135 selects from a ranked set of product alternatives for the target product.
- the alternatives module 133 may identify five product alternatives for the target product and rank the five product alternatives based on their respective association with the target product. In such case, the selection engine 135 may select the higher-ranking product alternatives for which to transmit product offers.
- the information provider network device 110 transmits information regarding the selected products and the alternative products to the end user network device 145 .
- the end user network device 145 receives the information regarding the selected products and the alternative products, and the browser application module 150 presents the received information to the end user operating the end user network device 145 .
- the browser application module 145 displays the information regarding the alternative products near the bottom of a display screen under the information regarding the selected products.
- the product catalog system 130 monitors the user's interaction with the products. For example, if the user selects one of the products to obtain a product offer for the product or additional information regarding the product, the browser application module 150 transmits a message to the product catalog system 130 indicating that the product was selected. The browser application module 150 may also navigate to an advertisement landing page or other web page for the selected product. For example, the displayed information for each product may include a link, such as a Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”), to another web page associated with the product.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- the product catalog system 130 updates the query log 139 based on the query and the user's interaction with the products. In one embodiment, the product catalog system 130 compares the query received in block 220 to queries in the shopping query table 143 to determine whether there is an entry for the received query. If there is not an entry, then the product catalog system 130 creates a new entry for the received query in the shopping query table 143 . If the user selected a product, then the product catalog system 130 also updates the shopping query table 143 to indicate that the product was selected for the received query. If the selected product had previously been selected for the received query, for example by another user, then the product catalog system 130 may update the frequency or count for that product and query. If the selected product had not been previously selected, then the frequency may be set at one.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 210 for populating a query log 139 with information regarding queries, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments, as referenced in block 210 of the method 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the Internet search engine 140 or the product catalog system 130 receives a query.
- an end user operating the end user network device 145 may enter a query at a website of the Internet search engine 140 or at a shopping website of the product catalog system 130 .
- the method 210 follows the “Search Engine” branch to block 315 .
- the Internet search engine 140 selects results to provide to the end user network device 145 in response to the query using conventional techniques.
- the information provider network device 110 transmits the selected results to the end user network device 145 and in turn, the browser application module 150 presents the results to the end user operating the end user network device 145 .
- the product catalog system 130 logs information regarding the received query in the web query table 141 of the query log 139 .
- the product catalog system 130 compares the received query to queries in the web query table 141 . If there is a match between the received query and a query in the web query table 141 , then the product catalog system 130 updates the frequency for the matching query to indicate that the matching query was received again. If there is not a match, then the product catalog system 130 provides an entry for the received query in the web query table 141 and enters a frequency of one for the received query.
- the method proceeds to block 350 .
- the method 210 follows the “Shopping Portal” branch to block 330 .
- the selection engine 135 selects products to provide to the end user network device 145 based on the query. For example, the selection engine 135 may identify a product that the end user operating the end user network device 145 is searching for and selected information related to that product. If the end user is searching for a type of product, the selection engine 135 may select a multitude of products related to that type of product.
- the information provider network device 110 transmits information regarding the selected products to the end user network device 145 and in turn, the browser application module 150 presents the information regarding the selected products to the end user.
- the selection engine 135 also may select information regarding alternative products to send to the end user network device 145 as discussed above in connection with block 230 of the method 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the product catalog system 130 monitors the end user's interaction with the products.
- the product catalog system 130 logs information regarding the received query and any selected products in the shopping query table 143 .
- blocks 340 - 345 are the same as or substantially similar to blocks 240 - 245 of the method 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the method 210 proceeds to block 350 .
- the Internet search engine 140 and the product catalog system 130 each monitor for queries from the end user network devices 145 . If another query is received, then the method 210 follows the “Yes” branch back to block 310 . Otherwise, the method 210 ends.
- the Internet search engine 140 and the product catalog system 130 can continue to monitor for queries, provide results in response to queries, and update the query log 139 with information regarding the received queries and any selected products provided in response to the received queries.
- FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 215 for identifying product alternatives, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments, as referenced in block 215 of the method 200 of FIG. 2 .
- the alternatives module 133 generates product-query pairs for at least a portion of the products having information stored in the product catalog 137 .
- a product-query pair includes a product and a query that resulted in that product being selected by an end user. For example, if a query of “Tablet Computer A” resulted in a selection of a product “Tablet Computer A Wi-Fi with 16 GB Memory,” then the alternatives module 133 may generate a product-query pair for that product and that query.
- This product-query pair may be represented in the form of (q,p) where “q” is a string of characters of the query and “p” is a string of characters of the product.
- the product-query pair would be (Tablet Computer A, Tablet Computer A Wi-Fi with 16 GB Memory).
- the alternatives module 133 also counts the number of times that the query resulted in a selection of the product. This count may be represented in the form of n(q,p). For example, if the query “Tablet Computer A” resulted in a selection of the product “Tablet Computer A Wi-Fi with 16 GB Memory,” 200 times, then the n(q,p) for this product-query pair would be 200.
- the alternatives module 133 identifies, for each product, the queries that resulted in a selection of that product.
- the alternatives module 133 also computes a count of the number of times that each identified query resulted in a selection of that product. In certain exemplary embodiments, this count is tracked in the shopping query table 143 as shown in FIG. 5 and discussed above.
- the alternatives module 133 computes a probability for each product-query pair by normalizing the count for each product-query pair. This probability indicates how related the product of the product-query pair is to the query of the product-query pair. For example, a product-query pair having a high probability indicates that the product and query of the product-query pair are more related than a product-query pair having a lower probability.
- the alternatives module 133 computes the probability for a product-query pair by dividing the count for the product-query pair by the total number of occurrences of the query of that product-query pair. For example, the probability for a product-query pair (p,q) may be computed using Equation 1 below. prob( p
- q ) n ( q,p )/ n ( q 1 *) Equation 1
- n(q1*) is the total number of times the query “q” was received by the product catalog system 130 during a given time period and over all products in the product catalog 137 .
- n(q1*) may be computed by summing all of the entries in the row for that query in the shopping query table 143 .
- the probability computation is modified based on the number of product offers in the product catalog 137 for the product.
- Equation 1 may be modified as shown in Equations 2-4 below.
- m ( q,p ) n ( q,p )*sqrt(number of product offers for product p ) Equation 2
- m ( q 1*) sum over all products of m ( q,p ) Equation 3 prob( p
- q ) m ( q,p )/ m ( q 1*) Equation 4
- Equation 2 the original fraction of the number of selections of a product offer for the product “p” divided by the total number of queries “q” is multiplied by the square root of the number of product offers for the product “p” in the product catalog 137 .
- the square root is used in Equation 2, other weightings of the number of product offers relative to the original fraction can be used, including no weighting at all.
- the alternatives module 133 discards the product-query pairs for queries that do not have at least one probability that meets or exceeds a certain threshold, alpha.
- the alternatives module 133 may discard product-query pairs for queries that do not have at least one probability at or above a threshold of 0.1.
- the threshold alpha can be tuned based on the results of the method 215 . If a query does not have at least one sufficiently high probability, this typically indicates that many different products satisfy the query and that the data may not be very useful in identifying alternative products.
- the alternatives module 133 retains the product-query pairs for the products that have a probability that meets or exceeds a second threshold beta and discards the product-query pairs for the products that have a probability below the threshold beta.
- This threshold beta may be set at a different value than the threshold alpha and can likewise be tuned. In one embodiment, the threshold beta is set at 0.05.
- the product-query pairs that remain after the filtering acts of blocks 415 - 420 represent a mapping of the queries to the products.
- the tuning thresholds alpha and beta can be adjusted, for example by the alternatives module 133 or an administrator of the product catalog system 130 , to control the precision of the mapping.
- the alternatives module 133 collects queries from the web query table 141 that are directed to a comparison between two products.
- queries that have a comparison term for example disposed between two products or two query terms each associated with a product, may be deemed a comparison query and collected by the alternatives module 133 .
- Exemplary comparison terms include, but are not limited to, vs, vs., versus, compared to, compares, and against. Queries that include certain questions along with two products or query terms associated with two products also may be considered comparison queries. For example, a query that begins with “Which is better” and includes information regarding two products may be deemed a comparison query by the alternatives module 133 .
- the alternatives module 133 can analyze each query of the web query table 141 (and optionally the shopping query table 143 ) to identify queries having a comparison term or a comparison question and create a table or list of those comparison queries.
- the alternatives module 133 computes or identifies the number of times that each comparison query was received by the Internet search engine 140 (and optionally the product catalog system 130 ). This count is referred to as an occurrence count for each comparison query.
- the alternatives module 133 discards queries having an occurrence count that does not meet or exceed a threshold from the analysis and retains the queries having an occurrence count that meets or exceeds the threshold. This block 435 serves to filter out noise in the data.
- the alternatives module 133 computes the number of comparison queries for each pair of compared products.
- the alternatives module 133 analyzes the comparison queries to identify each pair of products compared in at least one query. For example, the alternatives module 133 may identify the two products for each comparison query and add those two products to a list or table. For each pair of compared products, the alternatives module 133 computes the total number of times that the pair of products was included in a comparison query together. That is, the alternatives module 133 computes the total number of times that the two products were compared in a comparison query. This number can be designated as a comparison count for the pair of products.
- Equations 5-7 provide one method for computing the comparison count for a pair of products, “r” and “s,” where the term “vs” is used to identify comparison queries.
- w ( s,r ) count(“ s vs r ”) Equation 5
- w ( r,s ) count(“ r vs s ”) Equation 6
- v ( s,r ) w ( s,r )+ w ( r,s ) Equation 7
- Equation 5 w(s,r) is the number of queries having a comparison of product “s” with product “r” where product “s” is disposed in the query before the term “vs” and product “r” is disposed in the query after the term “vs.”
- Equation 6 w(r,s) is the number of queries having a comparison of product “s” with product “r” where product “r” is disposed in the query before the term “vs” and product “s” is disposed in the query after the term “vs.”
- the alternatives module 133 computes the total comparison count, v(s,r), for the products “s” and “r” using Equation 7.
- Equation 7 provides a symmetrized version of the comparison count as the ordering in the query typically does not matter. For example, a comparison count of v(Product 1, Product 2) gives the number of times in which the queries (Product 1 vs Product 2) and (Product 2 vs Product 1) were received by the Internet search engine 140 (and optionally the product catalog system 130 ).
- the alternatives module 133 computes an association weight for each pair of products.
- the alternatives module 133 computes the association weight for a pair of products (a,b) based on the frequency of a query [x vs y] given by v(x,y) and the strength of the association between the query “x” and the product “a” (given by prob(a
- Equation 8 may be used to compute the association between two products (a,b).
- u ( a,b ) (sum over queries x )(sum over queries y )prob( a
- the association u(a,b) includes the sum over queries “x” and the sum over queries “y.”
- each of the queries “x” that are deemed to be associated with the product “a” and not discarded in the previous blocks of the method 215 are included in this computation.
- each of the queries “y” that are deemed to be associated with the product “b” and not discarded in the previous blocks of the method 215 are included in this computation. That is, each product-query pair (a,x) remaining in the analysis for the product “a” and each product-query pair (b,y) remaining in the analysis for the product “b” are used to determine whether products “a” and “b” are associated.
- a user may submit a query for the Apple iPad and the Motorola Xoom in a variety of ways that lead to selections of product offers related to these products. For example, users may submit queries “Motorola Xoom,” “Xoom tablet,” and “Motorola tablet” in an attempt to obtain information regarding the Motorola Xoom tablet computer.
- queries “Motorola Xoom,” “Xoom tablet,” and “Motorola tablet” in an attempt to obtain information regarding the Motorola Xoom tablet computer.
- a similar set of queries may be submitted by users searching for information regarding an Apple iPad.
- each of the queries that are deemed to be associated with the Motorola Xoom and each of the queries deemed to be associated with the Apple iPad are used in Equation 8 to determine whether the Motorola Xoom is an alternative to the Apple iPad.
- the alternatives module 133 retains pairs of products having an association weight that meets or exceeds a certain threshold and discards the pairs of products having an association weight that does not meet or exceed the threshold.
- the retained pairs of products are considered by the alternatives module 133 to be alternative products. Some products may be paired with more than one other product in the retained product pairs. Thus, some products may have more than one alternative product.
- the alternatives module 133 can link or otherwise associate products with their identified alternative products.
- the alternatives module 133 ranks the alternative products based on the association weight.
- the selection engine 135 may select alternative products to transmit based on the ranking. For example, if the selection engine 135 selects Tablet Computer A to provide information for based on a query, the selection engine 135 may select alternative products based on their association weights relative to Tablet Computer A.
- the method 215 of FIG. 2 can be modified to account for variants of products.
- a product may come in several colors and/or with several capacities. This can cause the selections of products to be split between the different variants rather than the actual product.
- product selections for queries for a particular music player that comes in various colors and memory capacities may be split between the different variants of the music player. If unaccounted for, this can lead to the product-query pairs for the queries and the music player failing to meet the thresholds discussed in blocks 415 - 420 of the method 215 of FIG. 4 .
- One way to account for this split is to group the variants of each product together and assign the product offer selections to the most popular variant or the most selected variant. In this way, the variant having the product offer selections assigned thereto will typically be associated with the queries and considered in the association weight computations of block 445 .
- This also can account for variants when selecting product alternatives to provide to the end users in response to queries for a target product. For example, it may be desirable to provide information for products that are true alternatives rather than information for variants of the target product.
- that one variant will typically be the only variant that is associated as an alternative product to other products as the other variants will typically be discarded from the analysis in blocks 415 - 420 of the method 215 .
- information for the one popular or most often selected variant may be provided as an alternative product rather than providing information for each of the variants. This enables other product alternatives to be provided in place of the product variants that would otherwise be provided.
- the invention can be used with computer hardware and software that performs the methods and processing functions described above.
- the systems, methods, and procedures described herein can be embodied in a programmable computer, computer executable software, or digital circuitry.
- the software can be stored on computer readable media.
- computer readable media can include a floppy disk, RAM, ROM, hard disk, removable media, flash memory, memory stick, optical media, magneto-optical media, CD-ROM, etc.
- Digital circuitry can include integrated circuits, gate arrays, building block logic, field programmable gate arrays (“FPGA”), etc.
