Definitions
- This specification relates to information retrieval.
- search systems allow users to enter search queries for entities (e.g., government agencies, schools, businesses, and places of interests) and the entities' associated locations.
- entities e.g., government agencies, schools, businesses, and places of interests
- the user enters one or more search terms to express his or her information needs and also specifies a geographic area for which search results are desired.
- the search systems base the determination of the user's interest on the search terms and the geographic limitation the user has entered and return search results that list entities (e.g., listings of businesses) that have locations at or near the specified geographic area.
- Some search systems rank search results based on how well the search results match the search terms, geographic limitations and other search limitations specified in the search queries.
- each candidate search result is scored based at least in part on the distance between a location associated with the candidate search result and a reference location.
- An example reference location can be the geometric center of the specified geographic area. The candidate search results are then ranked according to their scores.
- This specification describes technologies relating to ranking location search results based on a combination of multiple distance measures.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving search query data specifying a geographic identifier, the geographic identifier denoting a geographic region for which search results associated with one or more entities are requested; receiving a plurality of candidate search results, each candidate search result specifying a physical address including a zip code for a respective entity; calculating, by a processor, a respective location relevance score for each of the candidate search result based on a combination of a first comparison between a geographic location represented by the specified physical address and a polygon approximating a boundary of the geographic region and a second comparison between the zip code specified in the candidate search result and respective zip codes of one or more constituent areas of the geographic region; and ranking the plurality of search results based at least in part on the calculated location relevance scores of the plurality of search results.
- the action of calculating the respective location relevance score for each of the candidate search results based on the combination of the first comparison and the second comparison further includes, for each candidate search result: calculating a polygon distance score based on a first distance between the geographic location represented by the specified physical address and the polygon approximating the boundary of the geographic region; in response to determining that the zip code specified in the candidate search result is among the respective zip codes of the constituent areas of the geographic region, applying a first predetermined value as a lower limit to the polygon distance score; in response to determining that the zip code specified in the candidate search result is not among the respective zip codes of the constituent areas of the geographic region, applying a second predetermined value as an upper limit to the polygon distance score; and calculating the respective location relevance score for the candidate search result based on the polygon distance score.
- the action of calculating the polygon distance score based on the first distance between the geographic location represented by the specified physical address and the polygon approximating the boundary of the geographic region further includes: calculating the polygon distance score by evaluating a continuous piecewise function using the distance as input, wherein value of the function increases with increasing distance values from within the polygon and decreases with increasing distance values from outside of the polygon.
- the action of calculating the respective location relevance score for the candidate search result further includes, for each candidate search result: receiving center of location data for the geographic region, the center of location data specifying a central location for the geographic region; calculating a distance-to-center score for the candidate search result based on a distance between the geographic location specified in the physical address of the candidate search result and the central location for the geographic region; and calculating the respective location relevance score for the candidate search result based on the distance-to-center score and the polygon distance score.
- the method further includes selecting the central location based on criteria independent of geometry of the geographic region.
- the central location of the geographic region is a city center location and is greater than a threshold distance away from the geometric center of the geographic region.
- the action of ranking the candidate search result further includes: applying the respective location relevance scores for the candidate search results as respective multipliers to another type of relevance score for the candidate search result.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving search query data specifying an geographic identifier, the geographic identifier denoting a geographic region for which listings of one or more business entities are requested, the geographic region being associated with a polygon approximating a boundary of the geographic region, zip codes associated with constituent areas of the geographic region, and a central location determined according to criteria independent of geometry of the geographic region; receiving a plurality of candidate business listings, each candidate business listing specifying a physical address for a respective business entity; calculating, by a processor, a respective location relevance score for each of the candidate business listings based on three distances to the physical address, a first distance being measured from the polygon, a second distance being measured from a combined area associated with the zip codes, and a third distance being measured from the central location; and ranking the plurality of candidate business listings based at least in part on the derived location relevance scores of the plurality of candidate business listings.
- Three basic distance measures can be used to determine whether a candidate search result is within or outside of an area of interest: (1) the distance-to-polygon method, (2) the zip code match method, and (3) the distance-to-center method.
- the distance-to-polygon method In order to provide search results that are the closest to an area specified by the user in a search query, multiple of these distance measures can be used in combination to avoid over-inclusion and under-inclusion of search results due to imperfection of each distance measure.
- a suitably-chosen scoring function is used to score search results based on their respective distances to a polygon of which the edges approximate the boundary of the area of interest.
- the chosen scoring function allows search results referencing locations outside of the polygon to be considered in the scoring and hence the search result ranking, while at the same time, applying an upper and/or lower bound to the scores depending on the outcomes of the zip code match method for the search results.
- the lower-bounded scores help salvage some search results that reference locations that are outside of the polygon but inside an included zip code area
- the upper-bounded scores help demote some search results that reference locations that are inside the polygon but outside of an included zip code area.
- the distance-to-center measure can be used to provide additional modification to the scoring.
- the choice of the reference location (namely, the “center”) for the location-to-center distance measure can be based on factors other than the geometry of the specified geographic area. Examples of such factors include the type of places being search for, the mode of transportation specified by the user, the size of the specified geographic area, the popularity or dominance of a sub-region in the specified geographic area, and so on.
- the reference locations can be business centers, culture centers, political centers, major highways, major public transit lines, and centers of sub-regions, and so on, within the specified geographic area.

- an address e.g., 100 A Street, B town, CA
- a place of interest e.g., Statue of Liberty, etc.
- the input field 102 also allows a user to specify the name of a geographic area (e.g., Palo Alto, Calif.) within or near which search results are desired.
- a relevant geographic area can be inferred from a location associated with the user (e.g., a location derived from the user's IP address, an address that the user has registered with the search system, or a geographic area currently represented in a map shown to the user in the search interface 100 ).
- the search query is submitted to the search system (e.g., by the user clicking on the “Search Maps” button).
- the search system identifies relevant search results based on the search terms and geographic limitation(s) included in or with the search query, and returns the search results to the client device.
- the returned search results can be presented as a result listing 104 in the search interface 100 .
- each search result represents an entity and includes a name and a physical address of the entity.
- entity refers to any named entity (e.g., commercial establishments, government or private agencies, places of interest, public or private facilities, and so on) that is located at a physical address.
- Each search result can link to a webpage associated with the entity (e.g., an owner-created homepage of the entity or automatically-generated summary page for the entity).

- the map can be overlaid with one or more visual markers to indicate the physical locations of the entities represented by the top-ranked search results (e.g., top 10 search results).
- the search interface 100 allows the user to select each search result individually (e.g., by clicking on an embedded hyperlink in the search result text) to view additional information available about the entity represented by the selected search result. For example, an information window 108 can be presented over the map next to the visual marker of the selected search result to show the additional information.

- FIG. 1 is but one example of a search interface.
- Other layouts of the search interface are possible.
- the different components of the example search interface can be presented on separate webpages, and user interface elements for additional functions can be provided.
- the search interface need not be implemented as a map interface, or even as a webpage.
- Other application interfaces for sending search requests and presenting search results can be implemented.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example a network environment 200 in which an example search system 202 operates.
- the network environment 200 includes and a client device 204 communicating with the search system 202 through one or more networks 206 .
- Examples of the one or more networks 206 include local area networks, wide area networks, wireless networks, peer-to-peer networks, and the Internet.
- Examples of the client device 204 include desktop computers, notebook computers, tablet computers, personal digital assistants, mobile phones, smart phones, and other fixed and mobile electronic devices.
- the search system 202 performs searches for businesses, addresses, and places of interest in response to user-submitted search queries.
- the search system 202 can provide a search interface such as that shown in FIG. 1 . Users accessing the search system 202 through the search interface can enter a search query that specify a geographic area by its name (or by other geographic identifiers of the geographic area) and one or more other keywords or search terms expressing his or her information needs.
- the search system 102 returns a list of search results representing entities located in the vicinity of the named geographic area in the search query and relevant to the entered keyword(s).
- the example search system 202 includes a search engine 208 and a mapping engine 210 .
- the search engine 208 and the mapping engine 210 each has access to a number of data repositories (e.g., databases, search indices, and data logs).
- the search engine 208 has access to an entity data repository 212 .
- the entity data repository 212 includes information regarding entities (e.g., businesses, government agencies, and places of interest, etc.).
- the entity data repository 212 can include entity listings collected via voluntary registration by business owners or commercial business data feeds (e.g., local white and yellow pages).
- the entity data repository 212 may also include information culled from webpages of various entities (e.g., on official websites of government and private entities) on the Internet.
- the entity data stored in the entity data repository 212 can include, for a particular entity, the name, physical addresses of locations of the entity (e.g., lat/long coordinates, street address and postal codes of stores for an entity, etc.), contact information, website URL, etc. of the entity. Other information associated with an entity (e.g., a picture of the physical building or storefront of the entity, etc.) can be stored in the entity data repository 212 as well.
- the entity data repository 212 is implemented as a database or as a searchable index.
- the search engine 208 can identify from the entity data repository 212 entity listings that match the keywords specified in the search query.
- the search engine 208 includes a ranking module 214 that ranks the entity listings based on one or more criteria, such as the locations associated with the entity listings, the popularity, reviews, and user feedback associated with the entity listings. More details of the ranking based on the locations of the entities are provided in other portions of the specification.
- the mapping engine 210 has access to a map images repository 216 and a geographic data repository 218 .
- the mapping engine 210 can correlate addresses and location names to geocodes (e.g., latitude and longitude of a geographic location in the latitude/longitude coordinate system) based on the information in the geographic data repository 218 .
- the mapping engine 210 can also identify map images in the map images repository 216 that correspond to particular locations or geocodes and nearby areas. Further, the mapping engine 210 can overlay other information, such as location markers and routes associated with driving directions, on the map images for presenting to a user.
- the search engine 208 when the search engine 208 identifies listings of matching entities in the entity data repository 212 , the search engine 208 transmits the addresses of the matching entities to the mapping engine 210 .
- the mapping engine 210 matches the entity addresses to geocodes and identifies map images corresponding to the geocodes.
- the search system 202 then generates a search result page that includes an embedded map and the search results representing the matching entities.
- the search results include names and corresponding addresses of the matching entities, and the embedded map includes visual markers indicating physical locations of the matching entities on the embedded map. In some implementations, the visual markers are only provided for the top-ranked results.
- the ranking module 214 of the search engine 208 shown in FIG. 2 has access to the geographic data repository 218 , a zip code data repository 220 , and a center-of-location data repository 222 .
- Each of the geographic data repository 218 , the zip location code data repository 220 , and/or the center-of-location data repository 222 can be provided by one or more third-party systems or internally by the search system 202 .
- the data repositories could also be implemented as a single logical date repository.
- the ranking module 214 can query and obtain data from the data repositories through an interface provided by the third-party systems or the search system 202 .
- the search engine 208 includes one or more other components to process the obtained raw data and provide only the information needed by the ranking module 214 to the ranking module 214 .
- the geographic data repository 218 stores correlations between addresses and location names to their corresponding geocodes (e.g., the latitude and longitude of the geographic location represented by each address and/or location name).
- the geographic data repository 218 can also provide specifications of one or more polygons that approximate the actual boundary of a named geographic area (e.g., a lake, mountain, city, county, district, state, country, park, golf course, etc.). Polygons of a named geographic area may be of various degrees of resolutions. A low resolution polygon has fewer edges than a high resolution polygon. A polygon having a suitable resolution can be chosen by the ranking module 216 to approximate the actual boundary of the geographic area specified in the search query.
- the ranking module 214 can determine whether the location of an entity represented by a search result is within an area of interest (e.g., the geographic area specified in the search query) by comparing the location to the polygon of the area of interest.
- an area of interest e.g., the geographic area specified in the search query
- a basic polygon method used in some conventional search systems, if the location is inside the polygon, the location is considered to be inside the area of interest, and if the location is outside the polygon, the location is considered to be outside of the area of interest.
- a high score is given to a location inside the polygon and a low score is given to another location outside the polygon, even if the two locations are actually very close to each other.
- the basic polygon method is useful in filtering out search results that are associated with locations far away from the area of interest, the basic polygon method may over-include or under-include search results near the edges of the polygon because the edges are merely approximation of the actual boundary of the area of interest.
- a polygon 302 (solid line) representing a hypothetical geographic area (e.g., “Green City”) has been obtained from the geographic data repository 218 using the name or other identifier of the geographic area.
- the actual boundary 304 of the named geographic area e.g., the city limits of “Green City”
- the polygon 302 includes some areas (e.g. area 306 ) that are not part of the named geographic area, while excluding some other areas (e.g., area 308 ) that are part of the named geographic area.
- Entities that are located within the non-overlapping portions of the polygon and the area of interest are arbitrarily included (e.g., entity 310 b ) or excluded (e.g., entity 310 a ) due to the artificially created discrepancies.
- entity 310 b Entities that are located within the non-overlapping portions of the polygon and the area of interest
- entity 310 a Entities that are located within the non-overlapping portions of the polygon and the area of interest are arbitrarily included (e.g., entity 310 b ) or excluded (e.g., entity 310 a ) due to the artificially created discrepancies.
- simple polygons with fewer edges are used to determine whether a search result is within an area of interest. In such cases, the basic polygon method can lead to large errors if not checked or compensated by other location relevance measures.
- the location code data repository 220 provides correlations between addresses and location names to one or more zip codes.
- Each zip code represents a corresponding zip code area.
- An example zip code system is the postal codes used by the United States Postal Service. Similar postal code systems exist in other countries as well.
- a zip code can be a sequence of letters and/or numbers. For example, zip code 43210 represents the Ohio State University area, and the zip code range 20200-20599 includes the zip codes for the Washington D.C. area.
- the ranking module 214 can obtain a list of zip codes (e.g., a zip code range) for the zip code areas that are at least partially inside the geographic region specified in the search query. For example, by querying the zip code data repository 220 with the name of the geographic region specified in the search query, the ranking module 214 can obtain the list of zip codes.
- the zip code contained in the address associated with each candidate search result is compared to the list of included zip codes for the geographic area specified in the search query. If the zip code in the address of a candidate search result is found in the list of included zip codes for the geographic area, the candidate search result is considered to be inside the area of interest. On the other hand, if the zip code associated with the candidate search result is not found in the list of included zip codes, the candidate search result is considered to be outside the area of interest.
- zip codes Despite the apparent connection between geographic areas and zip codes, what zip codes really represent are address groups and mail delivery routes.
- the area covered by each zip code can be larger or smaller compared to a named geographic area.
- the boundary of a zip code area often does not match the boundary of a named geographic area. Two locations on two sides of the same street can belong to two different zip code areas, while two other locations that are far apart can belong to the same zip code area.
- the basic zip code method is a fast and simple method with little computation involved, similar to the basic polygon method, the basic zip code match method cause arbitrary over-inclusion and under-inclusion of potential search results due to the discrepancies between the included zip code areas of the named geographic region and the actual area enclosed in the named geographic region.
- the actual boundary 304 of the named geographic region (e.g., “Green City”) is represented by the dashed line.
- the named geographic region includes at least portions of three distinct zip code areas (e.g., zip code area 312 , zip code area 314 , and zip code area 316 ).
- Zip code area 312 only has a small portion within the geographic region specified in the search query, and a large portion outside of the geographic region specified in the search query.
- a search result 318 is inside the zip code area 312 , but is far away from the specified geographic region. Search result 318 would be an over-included poor search result due to its large distance from the specified geographic region.
- search result 320 is outside of the geographic region by a small distance, and is far closer to the geographic region than search result 318 .
- Search result 320 becomes an under-included search result because it is not within any zip code areas of the geographic region.
- the zip code system is one example of location code systems that specify locations based on a functional representation that is not directly tied to location.
- location codes from another location code system e.g., area codes used for the PSTN telephone network
- area codes used for the PSTN telephone network can be used to determine whether a location referenced by a search result is within a geographic area in a similar manner as described with respect to the basic zip code match method.
- the methods described with respect to zip codes in this specification are also applicable to these other location code systems.
- a continuous scoring function can be used in some implementations.
- the continuous scoring function applies location relevance scores to potential search results based on distances between the locations associated with each potential search result and the polygon approximating the boundary of the specified geographic region.
- a continuous scoring function instead of a binary scoring function (Inside vs. Outside) decision, locations immediately outside of the polygon or the included zip code areas are not rejected outright. Similarly, a location within an included zip code area or the polygon is not outright accepted, either.
- the scoring function results in increasing values for increasing distance from the polygon boundary when the location under evaluation is inside the polygon. This indicates that, for locations inside the polygon, a higher score is given to a location near the center of the polygon than a location near the edge of the polygon.
- the scoring function results in decreasing values for increasing distance from the polygon boundary when the location under evaluation is outside of the polygon. This indicates that, for locations outside of the polygon, a lower score is given to a location far away from the edge polygon than a location near the edge of the polygon.
- the scoring function is continuous across the boundary of the polygon such that two locations near the same polygon edge receive similar scores even if they are on two sides of the polygon edge.
- the scoring function can be two different functions that are piecewise continuous so that a location on a polygon edge results in the same score by both scoring functions.
- scores can be computed for all candidate search results regardless of whether they are within or outside of the polygon or any included zip code areas. All candidate search results can be compared and ranked against one another based on the scores, reducing the chance of over- and under-inclusion of search results.
- a lower limit W 2 can be applied to the scores of location inside the included zip code areas.
- the lower limit W 2 can help recapture some search results that are outside of the polygon but inside an included zip code area. This recapturing is helpful when the polygon under-includes potential search results located inside the geographic area but outside of the polygon (e.g., entity 310 a ).
- an upper limit W 3 can be applied to the scores of locations that are not within any of the included zip code areas. This upper limit W 3 helps to reduce the over-inclusion of search result that are inside the polygon but outside of the area of interest (e.g. entity 310 b ).
- a search result e.g., entity 320
- the ranking module 214 can be considered by the ranking module 214 and possibly recaptured as a valid search result based on its score, even if it is outside of any included zip code area of the geographic region.
- results that are far away from a geographic region e.g., entity 318
- scoring candidate search results based on the combination of the distance-to-polygon measure and the zip code match measure is described with respect to FIGS. 4-5 .
- the ranking module 214 uses a distance-to-center method to score the candidate search results.
- the center of a geographic region is the geometric center (e.g., center 322 ) of the geographic region (e.g., geographic region 304 ). Entity 324 is farther away from the center 322 than entity 328 , and would be given a higher distance-to-center score than entity 328 .
- the geometric center of the geographic region 304 could be a location of no significant to the user, and the distance from a result entity to this location has little to do with the location relevance of the result entity.
- An alternate choice of central location can be found based on criteria independent of the geometry of the geographic region.
- the distance from a result entity to this central location can, in some situations, result in a better measure of the location relevance of the result entity.
- the central location can be chosen to be the current location of the user.
- Result entity 326 is much closer to the current location of the user than result entity 328 , and is potentially a more relevant result to the user than result entity 328 , at least in terms of location.
- the center-of-location data repository 222 can store one or more central locations for each named geographic region.
- the center-of-location data can be predetermined by various processes or computed on the fly based on one or more criteria.
- the central location for a city can be the location associated with the City Hall of the city, the city center of the city, a city landmark, etc.
- the central location for a city, a county, or a state can be the locations associated with major public transit stops, or major high way junctions, etc.
- the criteria for selecting the central location for a named geographic region can be user-dependent, application-dependent, time-dependent, area-dependent, and so on. More details about the selection of central location are found in the description with respect to FIG. 6 .
- the distance-to-center score can be used to generate a distance-to-center multiplier, and the score generated from the combined zip code match and distance-to-polygon measures can be used to generate a distance-to-polygon multiplier.
- the distance-to-center multiplier and the distance-to-polygon multiplier can be used in conjunction with other relevance multipliers to calculate the relevance scores for the candidate search results.
- the distance to central location measure as an additional means to balance the zip code match and the distance to polygon measures, arbitrary over-inclusion and under-inclusion of search results can be reduced further.
- the choice of the central location(s) can be made application-dependent, user-dependent, time-dependent, or area-dependent. Using this additional distance measure, more relevant search results can be identified and provided to the user.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for ranking search results based on combined zip code match and distance-to-polygon measures.
- the process can be performed by the search engine 208 of FIG. 2 , for example.
- the process 400 starts when search query data specifying a geographic identifier is received ( 402 ).
- the geographic identifier denotes a geographic region for which search results associated with one or more entities are requested.
- the geographic identifier can be a name of the geographic region specified by a user in the search query or inferred by the search system based on other information known about the user (e.g., registered address, IP address, current address, etc.).
- Each candidate search result specifies a physical address including a zip code for a respective entity.
- the candidate search results are identified based on other relevance measures, such as keyword matching based on search terms entered by the user.
- the candidate search results are selected from be entity listings stored in the entity data repository 212 of FIG. 2 or webpages indexed in a searchable index.
- Each candidate search result includes a physical address for an entity (e.g., a business entity, a government agency, a public facility, a place of interest, etc.).
- the physical address includes a zip code for mail delivery, such as the zip code used by the United States Postal Services.
- a respective location relevance score is calculated for each of the candidate search results based on the geographic location represented by the specified physical address, a polygon approximating a boundary of the geographic region, and a zip code ( 406 ). For example, a respective location relevance score is calculated for each of the candidate search results based on a combination of a first comparison between a geographic location represented by the specified physical address and a polygon approximating a boundary of the geographic region and a second comparison between the zip code specified in the candidate search result and respective zip codes of one or more constituent areas of the geographic region.
- the polygon approximating the boundary of the specified geographic region in the search query can be obtained from third party data geographic data services.
- the polygon can be a simplified polygon with a reduced number of edges than the original polygon received from the third party geographic data services. By reducing the number of polygon edges, data storage and processing resources required for the first comparison can be reduced.
- the comparison between the polygon and the location represented by the specified address involves determining whether the location is inside or outside of the polygon, and the distance between the location and a nearest edge of the polygon.
- the respective zip codes of one or more constituent areas of the geographic region can be determined by consulting a zip code data repository. By submitting the name of a geographic region to a zip code data lookup service, a list of zip codes or zip code ranges can be retrieved for the constituent areas of the named geographic region.
- the comparison between the zip code for the candidate search result and respective zip codes of the constituent areas of the geographic region involves determining whether the zip code for the candidate search result is among the list of zip codes for the constituent areas of the geographic region. If the zip code is found in the list of zip codes, the entity represented by the candidate search result is deemed to be within the included zip code areas of the geographic region. If the zip code is not found in the list of zip codes, the entity represented by the candidate search result is deemed to be outside of the included zip code areas of the geographic region.
- the location relevance score for a candidate search result is calculated based on a combination of the first comparison and the second comparison.
- the outcome of the second comparison i.e., the zip code match
- the results of the first comparison i.e., the distance
- the plurality of search results are ranked based at least in part on the calculated location relevance scores of the plurality of search results ( 408 ).
- the location relevance scores can be used as multipliers for relevance values obtained from other methods to calculate the ultimate relevance scores of the candidate search results, and the candidate search results are ranked based on the ultimate relevance scores.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for calculating a location relevance score based on combined zip code match and distance-to-polygon measures.
- a polygon distance score can be calculated based on a first distance between the geographic location represented by the specified physical address associated with the candidate search result and the polygon approximating the boundary of the geographic region ( 502 ). This first distance can be calculated based on basic geometric principles.
- the polygon distance score is calculated by evaluating a continuous piecewise function using the distance as input, where the value of the function increases with increasing distance values from within the polygon and decreases with increasing distance values from outside of the polygon.
- an example piecewise function that can be used as the polygon distance scoring function is:
- W and w are adjustable weights for the polygon distance score, Score(D).
- the magnitude of D is the distance values for the location under evaluation.
- D is a negative value if the location is outside of the polygon and a positive value if the location is inside the polygon.
- Example values of W and w are real numbers between 0 and 1. The values of W and w can be tuned based on the quality of the search results generated using different values of W and w.
- a first predetermined value (W 2 ) is applied as a lower limit to the polygon distance score ( 504 ).
- W 2 is a positive real number that is less than 1.
- the lower limit only has an effect on the polygon distance score if the value of initial polygon distance score is below this lower limit W 2 .
- a second predetermined value is applied as an upper limit to the polygon distance score ( 506 ).
- W 3 is a positive real number greater than W 2 and less than 1.
- the respective location relevance score for the candidate search result are calculated based on the polygon distance score ( 508 ).
- the polygon distance score is used as a multiplier in calculating the location relevance score.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an example process 600 for calculating a location relevance score further based on a distance-to-center measure.
- center of location data is received for the geographic region specified in or with the search query, the center of location data specifying a central location for the geographic region ( 602 ).
- the central location is predetermined.
- the central location is determined on the fly based on one or more criteria, e.g., a user's location relative to the geographic region.
- a distance-to-center score is calculated for the candidate search result based on a distance between the geographic location specified in the physical address of the candidate search result and the central location for the geographic region ( 604 ). Then, the respective location relevance score for the candidate search result is calculated based on the distance-to-center score and the polygon distance score ( 606 ).
- the process 600 includes selecting the central location based on criteria independent of geometry of the geographic region. Criteria independent of the geometry of the geographic region include, for example, the user's current location, the business center of the geographic region (e.g., the downtown center), the political center of the geographic location (e.g., the City Hall, the State Capitol, etc.), etc.
- the central location of the geographic region is a city center location and is greater than a threshold distance away from the geometric center of the geographic region.
- multiple central locations can be identified, and the distance-to-center can be measured from any of the identified central locations.
- major public transit hubs or stations within the specified geographic region can be used as the central locations in different implementations.
- the criteria for selecting central locations can be time-dependent, user-dependent, area-dependent, transportation-dependent, etc. In some implementations, the criteria can be changed based on the presence of a combination of the above factors. The choice of the criteria can be user-specified. Alternatively, rules can be set up previously and used to determine the criteria on the fly based on the actual conditions that are present at the time the search is performed. Once the criteria for selecting central locations are determined, the central locations are selected based on the determined criteria, the distance-to-center scores are then calculated based on the selected central locations.
- the respective location relevance scores for the candidate search results are applied as respective multipliers to another type of relevance score for the candidate search result.
- Other types of relevance scores include, for example, a relevance score based on keyword matching for the search terms, the popularity score based on user feedback (e.g., selection of the search result), the location prominence score based on how much it is referenced or mentioned by reviews or webpages of other candidate search results, etc.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an example process 700 for ranking search results based on a combination of multiple distance measures. Details of the process 700 can be found in the description of FIGS. 1-6 .
- the process 700 starts when search query data specifying a geographic identifier is received ( 702 ).
- the geographic identifier denotes a geographic region for which listings of one or more business entities are requested.
- the geographic region is associated with a polygon approximating a boundary of the geographic region, zip codes associated with constituent areas of the geographic region, and a central location determined according to criteria independent of geometry of the geographic region.
- a plurality of candidate business listings are received, each candidate business listing specifying a physical address for a respective business entity ( 704 ).
- a respective location relevance score is calculated for each of the candidate business listings based on three distances to the physical address ( 706 ). For example, the first distance is measured from the polygon, the second distance is measured from a combined area associated with the zip codes, and the third distance being measured from the central location.
- the plurality of candidate business listings are ranked based at least in part on the derived location relevance scores of the plurality of candidate business listings ( 708 ).

Abstract
Description
In the above polygon distance scoring function, W and w are adjustable weights for the polygon distance score, Score(D). The magnitude of D is the distance values for the location under evaluation. D is a negative value if the location is outside of the polygon and a positive value if the location is inside the polygon. Example values of W and w are real numbers between 0 and 1. The values of W and w can be tuned based on the quality of the search results generated using different values of W and w.
