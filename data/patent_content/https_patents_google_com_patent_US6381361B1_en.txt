FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to digital image processing and in particular discloses the production of artistic effects in images utilising restricted gamut spaces.
Further the present invention relates to the field of digital image processing and in particular discloses the production of useful artistic effects.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Almost any artistic painting of a scene utilises a restricted gamut in that the artist is limited in the colours produced as a result of the choice of medium in rendering the image. This restriction is itself often exploited by the artist to produce various artistic effects. Classic examples of this process include the following well known artistic works:
Camille Pissaro “L'île Lacroix à Rouen, effect de brouillard” 1888. Museum of Art, Philadelphia
Charles Angrand “Le Seine à L'aube”—1889 collection du Petit Palais, Genéve
Henri van de Velde “Crépuscule”—1892. Rijksmuseum Kröller Müller, Otterlo
Georges Seurat. “La côte du Bas-Butin, Honfleur” 1886—Musée des Beaux—Arts, Tounai
It would be desirable to produce, from an arbitrary input image, an output image having similar effects or characteristics to those in the above list.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The object of the present invention is to produce a graphical effect of an output image having a limited gamut in accordance with predetermined requirements.
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of automatically manipulating an input image to produce an artistic effect, the method comprising:
predetermining a mapping of an input gamut to a desired output gamut so as to produce a desired artistic effect, said desired output gamut being constructed from at least one sample image; and
utilising said mapping to map said input image to an output image having a predetermined output gamut.
Preferably, the method further comprises the step of post processing the output image utilising a brush stroke filter.
Further, preferably the desired output gamut is constructed by mapping a predetermined number of input gamut values obtained from said at least one sample image to output colour gamut values and mapping a remainder of input gamut values to output colour gamut values by interpolation. The interpolation process can include utilising a weighted sum of said mapping of a predetermined number of input gamut values to corresponding output colour gamut values.
Preferably also, the construction of said desired output gamut comprises scanning the sample image to build a histogram of colors. The construction of said desired output gamut may further comprise mapping to compensate for a scanning device color gamut. The construction of said desired output gamut may also further comprise mapping to compensate for a printing device color gamut.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
Notwithstanding any other forms which may fall within the scope of the present invention, preferred forms of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
FIG. 1 illustrates the steps in the method of the preferred embodiment in production of an artistic image;
FIG. 2 illustrates the process of mapping one gamut to a second gamut;
FIG. 3 illustrates one form of implementation of the preferred embodiment;
FIG. 4 illustrates the preferred form of gamut remapping;
FIG. 5 illustrates one form of gamut morphing as utilised in the preferred embodiment.
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS
In the preferred embodiment, the colour gamut of an input image is “morphed” to the colour gamut of an output image wherein the output colour gamut can be arbitrarily determined by means of experimentation with different output colour gamuts. The preferred embodiment is ideally utilised as a pre-processing step to further artistic manipulation such as replacing the image with brush strokes of particular style wherein the brush stroke derive their colour from the image and the brush strokes having colours related to the target gamut.
The steps in producing a final output image are as illustrated 10 in FIG. 1. The first step 11 is the input of an arbitrary input image. The colour gamut of the input image is then “Morphed” or “Warped” 12 so as to produce an output image having a predetermined colour gamut range. The morphing process being further described hereinafter. Once the output colour gamut is produced, the next step is to apply a suitable brush stroking technique. The brush stroking technique being a post processing step able to be subjected to substantial variation, the actual form of brush stroking utilised not being essential to the present invention. The brush stroking technique is applied 13 so as to produce an output image 14 having a restricted coloured gamut interpretation of the input image.
Turning now to FIG. 2, there is provided an example of the gamut mapping or morphing problem. It is assumed that a single colour space is utilised defining the universe of possible colour values with the universal colour space 21 being utilised which is a L*a*b* colour space. Within this colour space, the input sensor is able to sense a certain range of colour values 22. It is further assumed that the output printing device is able to output colours of a particular range of printer gamut 23. The printer gamut may be smaller or larger than the input sensor colour gamut 22. An artistic gamut 24 is defined in accordance with a particular style. The artistic gamut 24 can be meticulously constructed through the utilisation of various techniques. For example, a sample image having a desirable artistic gamut can be scanned and a histogram of colours built up so as to include a certain range within the L*a*b* colour space. It would be understood by those skilled in the art of computer graphics that FIG. 2 can be interpreted as slices through a 3 dimensional L*a*b* colour space at predetermined intensity values or by means of 3 dimensional volumes within the colour space.
It is therefore necessary to map the colours within input sensor colour space 22 to the artistic gamut 24. Further, the artistic gamut 24 may unfortunately contain “out of gamut” colours for a particular output printer gamut 23. In such cases, it will be further necessary to map the artistic gamut 24 so that the output colours fall within the printer gamut 23.
Turning now to FIG. 3, preferred embodiments of the invention utilise a 3 dimensional look up table eg. 30 which maps L*a*b* values 31 to L*a*b* output values 32. Preferably, the 3 dimensional lookup table 30 is provided in a compact form with only certain points being defined for 3 dimensional mapping and tri-linear interpolation being utilised for the mapping of intermediate values between defined points.
Turning to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a more general example of the process of applying a gamut morphing from one substantially arbitrary input gamut space 40 to a second desired output gamut target space 41. Potentially, the gamut mapping process must deal properly with the points eg. 42 which lie within the input colour gamut space 40 but outside the output colour gamut space 41.
The 3D colour lookup table 30 has a size of (2n+1)3, where n can range from 1 to the maximum colour component precision (i.e. typically 8 bits). An arbitrary warp function can be encoded in the lookup table, which gives a high degree of flexibility to the overall algorithm. The use of the table also results in the performance of the algorithm being independent of the encoded warp function which can be separately prepared. The algorithm has predictable performance for arbitrary warp functions and it does not require the warp function to be continuous, therefore resulting in the algorithm being robust for arbitrary warp functions. Hence, the per-pixel processing is fixed and reasonably simple, and is suitable for hardware implementation.
The lookup table consists of a 3D array of integer or real-valued output colour coordinates arranged in input coordinate order. It thus encodes a forward warp function. The image colour warp required is computed in output image order, one pixel at a time. The algorithm requires random access to the 3D colour lookup table, but since input colours vary smoothly in space, the random access is typically coherent. It requires sequential access to the input and output images.
The essential tri-linear warp algorithm is embodied in the following pseudo-C++ code:
for (int row=0; row<height; row++)
{
for (int col=0; row<width; col++)
{
outputImage[row][col]=Lookup(table, inputImage[row][col]);
}
}
Colour
Lookup(LookupTable& table, Colour& colour)
{
// compute indices
int fracPrecision=colourPrecision—log2(table.nSamples);
int i=colour[0]>>fracPrecision;
int j=colour[1]>>fracPrecision;
int k=colour[2]>>fracPrecision;
// compute interpolation factors
int one=(1<<fracPrecision);
int mask=one−1;
double f=(double)(colour[0] & mask)/one;
double g=(double)(colour[1] & mask)/one;
double h=(double)(colour[2] & mask)/one;
// trilinearly interpolate
Colour c000=table[i+0][j+0][k+0];
Colour c001=table[i+0][j+0][k+1];
Colour c00=Interpolate(c000, c001, h);
Colour c010=table[i+0][j+1][k+0];
Colour c011=table[i+0][j+1][k+1];
Colour c01=Interpolate(c010, c011, h);
Colour c0=Interpolate(c00, c01, g);
Colour c100=table[i+1][j+0][k+0];
Colour c101=table[i+1][j+0][k+1];
Colour c10=Interpolate(c100, c101, h);
Colour c110=table[i+1][j+1][k+0];
Colour c111=table[i+1][j+1][k+1];
Colour c11=Interpolate(c110, c111, h);
Colour c1=Interpolate(c10, c11, g);
return Interpolate(c0, c1, f);
}
The gamut compression process seeks to map the colours in a source gamut to colours in a smaller target gamut in such a way that colour differences in the source gamut are retained and perceptible colour shifts are minimised. Efficient gamut compression can be carried out using the lookup-table-driven process previously described, since the computation of the gamut compression is decoupled from the colour warping.
The gamut compression algorithm involves the construction of a 3D lookup table and is embodied in the following pseudo-code described with reference to FIG. 4:
int fracPrecision=colourPrecision—log2(nSamples);
for (int i=0; i<nSamples; i++)
{
for (int j=0; j<nSamples; j++)
{
for (int k=0; k<nSamples; k++)
{
1. for constructing the lookup table at the colour point at (i<<fracPrecision,j<<fracPrecision, k<<fracPrecision);
2. find nearest point 43 on the luminance axis of the Lab space within the target gamut 41 of FIG. 4;
3. construct a vector from the colour point 42 to a point on luminance axis 43;
4. compute the distance dp of the colour point 42 from the luminance axis 43;(i.e. the length of the vector);
5. compute the intersection 45 of the vector with source gamut polyhedron 40;
6. compute the intersection 46 of the vector with the target gamut polyhedron 41;
7. compute the distance dt from the luminance axis 43 to the target gamut boundary 46 along the vector;
8. compute the distance from the luminance axis 43 to the source gamut boundary 45 along the vector;
9. compute the compression factor as ratio of target distance dt 43-46 to the source distance ds 43-45;
10. compute the scale factor as the ratio of the colour point distance dp 43-42 to source distance ds 43-45;
11. scale the compression factor by the scale factor (so that in-gamut colours compress progressively less);
12. scale the colour point distance dp by the compression factor
13. compute the point on the vector which is the compressed distance from the luminance axis;
14. write this point to the lookup table at (i, j, k);
}
}
}
If either the source or target gamut is known only in palette form, then the gamut polyhedron can be computed from the convex hull of the palette points. Turning now to FIG. 5, the above process can be adapted to map any source gamut 50 to a target gamut 51 utilising a process heretoafter called gamut morphing which has particular application in the creation of artistic effects. Gamut morphing is used to directly control the mapping of colours in the source gamut to colours in the target gamut.
Just like gamut compression, gamut morphing may be used to artificially constrain the gamut of an image to simulate a particular artistic style. Just like gamut compression, efficient gamut morphing can be carried out using the lookup-table-driven algorithm, since the computation of the gamut morph is decoupled from the colour warping process.
With gamut morphing, a number of source gamut colours e.g. 53 are mapped directly to the same number of corresponding target gamut colours e.g. 54. The remaining target colours intermediate of the mapped targets in the lookup table are computed as a weighted sum of the specified target colours (e.g. 54). The target colours are preferably weighted by the inverse squared distance of the corresponding source colours from each lookup table point.
The gamut morphing algorithm is embodied in the following pseudo-code:
int fracprecision=colourPrecision—log2(nSamples);
for (int i=0; i<nSamples; i++)
{
for (int j=0; j<nSamples; j++)
{
for (int k=0; k<nSamples;,k++)
{
. . . construct colour point at (i<<fracPrecision, j<<fracPrecision, k<<fracPrecision)
. . . initialise the weighted sum to zero
. . . initialise the sum of weights to zero
for (int m=0; m<sourceGamut.size(); m++)
{
1. compute the distance from point to a current source gamut point corresponding to m;
2. compute the inverse of the distance squared;
3. call the calculation from step 2 the weight, and add it to the sum of weights
4. scale the corresponding target gamut point by the weight and add it to the weighted sum
}
. . . divide the weighted sum by the sum of weights
. . . write this point to the lookup table at (i, j, k)
}
}
}
It will be evident to those skilled in the art of computer graphics that the aforementioned technique can be utilised to initially restrict the gamut of an image to predetermined areas. Subsequently, brush stroking filters can be applied to the restricted gamut image to produce effects similar to those provided, for example, by the “Pointillisme” techniques.
It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.
