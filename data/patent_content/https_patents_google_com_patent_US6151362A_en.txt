Definitions
- the present invention relates to digital video signal processing techniques which may be used, for example, in connection with digital television, and more particularly to the coding of different channels of a stereoscopic video sequence.
- a stereoscopic video sequence consists of two channels, which are referred to as the left and right channels.
- the two channels can be coded either independently or jointly.
- independent coding the two channels are usually coded at the same bit rate, as there is no particular reason why one channel should be coded with fewer bits than the other channel.
- the same bit rate likely results in similar quality for the two channels because of the similarity between the channels.
- independent coding of the two channels of a stereoscopic sequence is not very efficient because it does not exploit the cross-correlation between two channels.
- MPEG-2 Multi-View Profile employs the cross-correlation between the two channels.
- one channel e.g. the left channel
- the second channel e.g. the right channel
- the base layer channel is coded independently while the enhancement channel is coded based upon the base layer channel. Simulations have demonstrated a better performance when cross-correlation between the left and right channels is utilized.
- MPEG defines three picture types in terms of temporal processing. They are the I (intra-frame coded) picture, P (forward temporal predictive coded) picture, and B (bi-directional temporal predictive coded) picture.
- the input video sequence is often divided into groups of pictures (GoP). Each GoP contains one I picture, a number of P pictures, and optionally a few B pictures between I or P pictures.
- I pictures are "intraframe” coded pictures, which are not based on any other pictures (frames) in the sequence.
- P pictures are "predicted” pictures, which are predicted from previous I or P frames.
- B pictures are "bi-directionally" predicted pictures, which can be predicted from previous and/or future I and/or P pictures.
- schemes for stereoscopic video coding typically used a fixed bit rate for each channel.
- the channel e.g., the right channel
- the independently coded (e.g., left) channel needs fewer bits than the independently coded (e.g., left) channel for similar quality.
- the non-independently coded (e.g., right) channel has additional information for prediction (e.g., the left channel) and it also has no I pictures which typically use many more bits than P and B pictures.
- the present invention provides a method and apparatus having the aforementioned and other advantages.
- a joint rate control strategy is provided with dynamic bit allocation for stereoscopic video coding.
- the bit rates for the two channels are allowed to vary according to the complexity measures of their pictures, but the aggregate rate is maintained at a constant value within the channel capacity of the communication channel over which the data are carried.
- a method in accordance with the invention balances a quality ratio between a plurality of channels of a stereoscopic video sequence.
- a complexity measure for each of the channels is determined.
- the number of bits representing the video sequence between the channels is allocated according to each channel's complexity.
- the allocating step maintains an aggregate bit rate of the video sequence at a substantially constant rate.
- the constant rate is determined by a channel capacity of a communications channel over which the video sequence is to be communicated.
- a corresponding apparatus is also provided.
- FIG. 1 provides an example of a group of pictures (GoP) structure, with arrows indicating prediction directions;
- GoP group of pictures
- FIG. 2 provides an example of picture types for both channels of a stereoscopic sequence
- FIG. 3 illustrates the fullness of a decoder buffer over time under control of the present invention
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating apparatus in accordance with the invention.
- the present invention provides a joint rate control strategy with dynamic bit allocation for stereoscopic video coding.
- a target bit rate is determined for a joint group of pictures (GoP). Then, the target number of bits T for the joint GoP is distributed over the frames within the joint GoP to determine a target rate for a frame.
- the same principle can also be applied to the slice level, wherein for a given target number of bits for a frame, a determination is made as to how many bits should be assigned to a slice of the frame.
- rate control is effected, e.g., by adjusting a quantization parameter in the encoder.
- FIG. 1 shows an example of a GoP structure generally designated 10, where there are one I picture 12, four P pictures 14 and two B pictures 16 between each pair of consecutive I-P, P-P or P-I pictures. Note that in FIG. 1, the arrows 18 and 19 between the I and P pictures show the prediction directions.
- a joint GoP as defined herein is actually a collection of two GoPs, one from each channel of the stereoscopic sequence for the same interval. This is illustrated in FIG. 2, which shows an example of picture types (I, P, B) allowed in the MPEG-2 Multi-View Profile, for both the left and right channels 20, 22 respectively, of a stereoscopic video sequence.
- the left channel 20 is coded independently, and it has all three of the picture types defined in MPEG.
- the right channel 22 is coded based upon the left channel, as indicated by the prediction directions 24, 26 in FIG. 2.
- the right channel has no I pictures, but only P and B pictures. Furthermore, P and B pictures in the right channel are different from P and B pictures in the left channel in the nature of prediction.
- the predictions in P and B pictures for the right channel involve a disparity estimation from the pictures in the left channel.
- the references for P and B pictures in the right-channel can be the pictures in the left-channel.
- the arrows 24, 26 and 28 show the prediction directions. If the GoP length for each channel is N, a joint GoP contains 2N frames.
- a stereoscopic video sequence of two channels is now divided into joint GoPs.
- Each joint GoP has the same total number of left channel I pictures, left-channel P and B pictures, and right-channel P and B pictures as every other joint GoP.
- the same nominal number of bits can be assigned for each joint GoP, that is:
- R channel (bpf) is the channel rate in bits/frame. It is noted that different embodiments are possible where, for example, the I pictures are provided in the right-channel instead of the left-channel.
- T target number of bits
- the next step is to distribute the T bits over the frames within the joint GoP.
- the strategy adopted here is based upon the frame complexity. Similar to Test Model 5 (TM5), as disclosed in ISO/IEC (MPEG-2), "Test Model 5", MPEG 93/457 AVC-491, April 1993 and incorporated herein by reference, a complexity measure for a frame is defined in accordance with the present invention. This complexity measure comprises the product of the (average) quantization parameter (Q) used for the frame and the number of bits (R) generated for the frame by using Q, i.e.:
- T m ,n be the target number of bits assigned for frame (m,n).
- the actual rate for frame (m,n), R m ,n, should be made close to the target rate, T m ,n, by proper rate control, i.e.: ##EQU1##
- the total number of bits generated from the 2N frames in each joint GoP should also be close to the nominal target rate for the joint GoP, T, i.e.: ##EQU2##
- the same quantization parameter should be applied to all of the frames because quantization is the only lossy operation in MPEG video coding.
- TM5 we can weight the quantization parameter by a constant factor for the different picture types, i.e.:
- the constant factors for I and P pictures are equal to 1 and for B pictures the constant factor is 1.4.
- the quality balance between the two channels can also be controlled by introducing a weighting factor for each channel m, w m , as:
- Equations for T m ,n and T can therefore be rewritten as ##EQU5##
- the target number of bits for each frame (m,n) can be determined as: ##EQU6##
- the numerator is the weighted complexity measure for frame (m,n) and the denominator is the sum of the weighted complexity measures for all the frames within the current joint GoP.
- C m ,n is the complexity measure for the picture type of frame (m,n) (Note that after encoding a frame, the complexity measure of the corresponding picture type needs to be updated according to equation (2), set forth above),
- N 1 , N 1P , N 1B , N rP and N rB are, respectively, the number of the remaining I pictures, left-channel P pictures, left-channel B pictures, right-channel P pictures and right-channel B pictures, in the current joint GoP,
- T r is the remaining number of bits in the current joint GoP, defined as:
- R m' ,n' is the number of bits generated for frame (m',n')--the frame coded just before frame (m,n).
- the above equation actually indicates how the remaining number of bits is distributed over the remaining frames within a joint GoP.
- T needs to be updated as follows:
- T is the nominal number of bits assigned for each joint GoP.
- T r The remaining number of bits after encoding the last frame in a joint GoP, T r , can be either a positive or negative number, and it is passed to the next joint GoP by equation (14).
- a slice complexity measure, C is defined as the product of the (average) quantization parameter Q and the number of bits R generated by using Q for the slice. If a frame contains S slices, there will be S slice complexity measures, i.e.:
- T m ,n,r is the remaining number of bits up to slice s-1 for frame (m,n), defined as: ##EQU9## and R s' is the number of bits generated for slice s'. It should be pointed out that all of the C m ,n,s used in equation (16) can actually be calculated from the previously coded frame of the same type by using equation (15).
- the bit allocation strategy according to equation (12) assigns a frame a target rate based upon the frame complexity measure and picture type, as well as the program GOP structure.
- VBR variable bit rate
- encoder buffer modeling and protection is the same as in the constant bit rate (CBR) case.
- the decoder may only be able to decode the base layer channel (e.g. the left channel) which is VBR. Decoder buffer modeling and protection for VBR video is a challenging issue. It is possible to achieve decoder buffer protection by applying additional constraints on the target rate of frames.
- the quantity ##EQU10## is defined as the number of bits transmitted for channel m during the nth frame period, as shown in FIG. 3.
- the decoder buffer will therefore be filled up to ##EQU11## before any bits are moved out. This is depicted in FIG. 3, where it can be seen that the quantity of data in the buffer is maintained between zero and an upper threshold 30 which corresponds to a full buffer.
- the compressed bits for frame n, R m ,n are moved out the decoder buffer and moved into the decoder instantaneously, and between the frame instants of n+N' and n+N'+1, the decoder buffer receives ##EQU12## bits from the network, also shown in FIG. 3.
- ##EQU13 be the decoder buffer fullness at the frame instant of n+N', after the compressed bits for frame n are moved out (FIG. 3).
- ##EQU14 is a local minimum and has to be equal to, or greater than, zero, i.e., ##EQU15##
- the transmission rate for frame n of channel m is set equal to the average number of compressed bits for the N previous frames that are most recently moved out the decoder buffer (FIG. 3), i.e., ##EQU28## where N is the joint GOP length.
- the average input rate to the decoder buffer is equal to the average output rate.
- the total transmission rate of the two channels for any frame period of n, ##EQU29## is also equal to the channel rate, 2R channel (bpf), i.e., ##EQU30##
- the next step in accordance with the invention is to meet these target rates.
- This can be achieved, for example, by adjusting the quantization parameter (Q) in an MPEG encoder.
- the Q can be adjusted on a macroblock-by-macroblock basis according to the channel buffer fullness, as in TM5; however, this may result in a non-uniform picture quality over a frame as discussed in L. Wang, "Bit rate control for MPEG video coding", Proc. SPIE on Visual Comm. And Image Processing, pp. 53-64, May, 1995.
- two identical blocks in a frame may be assigned different quantization parameters just because of the different buffer fullness levels at different times, and therefore are quantized to different quality.
- An alternative is to use a global quantization parameter for all of the macroblocks in a frame.
- identical blocks will be assigned the same quantization parameter and are quantized to the same quality.
- the global quantization parameter is selected so that the resulting rate is closest to the target rate. The rate control issue then becomes how to find such a global quantization parameter.
- Both the iterative and binary algorithms are, however, multi-pass processes, each process involving one quantization and one variable length coding step. Hence, they require more operations than TM5.
- the use of a proper global quantization parameter for a frame usually results in a better subjective picture quality than TM5.
- FIG. 4 A block diagram of apparatus for implementing the invention is provided in FIG. 4. It is noted that the apparatus illustrated in FIG. 4 is for purposes of example only, and that other implementations are possible.
- Left and right channel data are provided to a computer processor 40 and a bit allocation function 42.
- the processor 40 in cooperation with a complexity determination function 44, provides a complexity measure for each channel.
- the complexity measure is passed by processor 40 to the bit allocation function 42, which allocates a number of bits to each of the left and right channels based on the complexity of each channel and the channel capacity of a communication channel 50 over which the data will ultimately be communicated.
- the bit allocated left and right channel data (which is typically fewer bits than the original left and right channel data input to processor 40) is provided to an encoder 46.
- the encoder encodes the data in a conventional manner for transmission, e.g., by compressing the data and providing error correction information as well known in the art.
- the encoded data is provided to a transmitter 48, which provides a data stream for communication to a receiver 52 over channel 50.
- the transmitter will modulate the data onto a suitable carrier if the data is to be communicated at other than baseband.
- the present invention provides a mechanism for controlling and balancing the quality ratio between the two channels of stereoscopic video sequences.
- the bits between the two channels are dynamically allocated according to their corresponding complexity.
- the complexity measure C can be any complexity measure of a frame, and is not limited to the product of Q and R as set forth in the illustrated embodiment.
