Definitions
- the disclosed implementations relate generally to the field of search enhancement, and in particular to determining a television program being displayed in proximity to an electronic device and using that determination to return improved search results.
- Search engines provide a powerful tool for locating content in documents in a large database of documents, such as the documents on the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW), and/or the documents stored on the computers of an Intranet.
- the documents are located using an index of documents in response to a search query, consisting of one or more words, terms, keywords and/or phrases, henceforth called terms, that are submitted by a user.
- Documents in the index of documents may be matched to one or more terms in the search query to determine scores.
- a ranked listing of relevant documents or document locations, based on the scores, is provided to the user.
- Search engines use a variety of methods to more accurately determine which documents in a group of documents are the most relevant to a particular query. Some methods include personalizing results based on user profiles, ranking results based on a specific location or set of locations and using search query trend data to improve results.

- Figure 9 is a flow diagram illustrating the communication between a client and a server system in accordance with some implementations.
- Figure 10 depicts an exemplary user interface in accordance with some imp lementations .
- a TV viewer (sometimes referred to herein as a user) has access to a computer, set top box, smart phone, or other Internet-connected electronic device, while he or she is viewing TV content.
- a TV viewer executes search queries on the Internet-connected device related to the TV content he or she is watching. For example, when the user is watching a TV program about wildlife, he or she might execute searches on the Internet-connected device related to the particular animal species being described in that program.
- a viewer who is watching a movie might execute searches about locations or the actors appearing in the movie.
- Such a viewer when entering a search query might use search terms that are related to but not identical to the particular content being described in the program he or she is viewing. For example, someone watching a TV program with a segment about a particular model of Porsche might execute a search query for "Porsche" or "sports cars" instead of the designation of the particular model that was the subject of the segment.
- Some implementations leverage the fact that some TV viewers enter search queries during, and related to, TV programs they are viewing to improve the quality of the search results returned to such users. In some implementations, this improvement is provided by a search engine with access to comprehensive information about the content and geographic availability of TV programming for many different modes of live TV
- broadcasting e.g., cable, over the air, satellite and Internet- streaming.
- broadcasting e.g., cable, over the air, satellite and Internet- streaming.
- a search engine compares a search query it receives to the content of TV programs that are presumably available to the user who executed the search query (based on the time the search query was submitted and a location associated with the user/the user's device).
- the search engine can determine the location of the user from a user profile or other information entered by the user.
- the search engine can determine the user's/device's location from the IP address of the Internet- connected device employed by the user or, depending on user settings and capabilities of the Internet-connected device employed by the user, location information associated with a GPS receiver in the Internet-connected device, a known location of a nearby WiFi transmitter, or a known location of a nearby mobile/cellular communication tower.
- the search engine When there is an acceptable degree of correlation between the program information and the user's search query (e.g., when the user executes a query for "Porsche" during the same time window a TV program is airing that includes a segment about a particular Porsche model), the search engine returns enhanced search results based on the presumption that the user in question was watching that particular TV program - or that the user in question would be interested in watching that particular TV program.
- the server can return information about one or more of : 1) the "911 Turbo” model (e.g., a link to information on the Porsche.com website about the "911 Turbo"), 2) information about the TV program that is currently airing with that segment, and 3) suggestions of similar programming that is currently airing or airing in the future and that is available to the user.

While conducting natural language processing on a corpus of a text to generated a query profile, the query search server (120, Figure 1) ignores uninteresting words which appear frequently across all writings, such as "a" or "the.” Instead, the query server system (120, Figure 1) focuses on more important words like words identifying people, places, and products, also known as interesting entities.
- the query search system By restricting the search space to interesting entities, the query search system reduces both the time needed to generate the individual query profiles and the time needed for data look up if the profiles are stored in a database.
- the query server system (120, Figure 1) accesses the query profile database 140 to determine categories associated with a given query. For example, if the search query received was "Jaguar," the query profile category list may include “automobiles,” “mammals,” and "sports.”
- the various search enhancement systems (see Figure 1, 124) then use this category information to calculate the degree to which the submitted search query correlates to various television program profiles (as discussed further in Figure 5). This process is described more fully with respect to Figures 6, 7, and 8. This correlation information is used to either determine a television program currently being watched by the user, modify the terms of the search query or suggest a television program of interest to the user based on this information.
- FIG. 5 depicts a block diagram of an exemplary data structure for the television program information database 130 for storing television program profiles 510 in accordance with some implementations.
- the database data structure 130 includes a plurality of television program profile records 510-1 to 510-P, each of which corresponds to a specific television program.
- each television program profile record 510 contains television program metadata, including television program ID 512 that identifies a particular television program, the set of corresponding show times (a set of times, each time corresponding to one period during which the television program is broadcast) 514, a category list for classifying the television program 516, channel information 520, a program description outlining the content of the television program 522, cast information 524, television series information 526, and genre information 528.
- the television program profile also includes one or more related terms 530, associated with the television program.
- members of the category list 516 include one or more pairs of (category ID 517, weight 518).
- the category ID 517 may correspond to a particular type of information such as news, sports, travel, automobiles, etc.
- the weight 518 is a number that measures the relevance between the television program and the corresponding type of information. For example, the television program "Top Gear" may have relatively high weights for the category of sports cars and auto racing, but a low weight for the category of aircraft.
- the category ID 517 corresponds to a "concept cluster," which may be produced by a clustering process for example, which may or may not be easily labeled with a category name.
- the television program category list 516 data including the television program profiles, is used in conjunction with the query profile category lists 417 to determine currently watched television shows, modify search queries, and suggest television programs for a user to watch, as described in Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- individual television program profiles 510 are generated, used and then disposed of without storing the television program profiles in a database or other collective data structure 500.
- individual television program profiles and their associated categories lists are generated through natural language processing.
- the query server system While conducting natural language processing on a corpus of a text to generated a television program profile, the query server system (120, Figure 1) ignores uninteresting words which appear frequently across all writings, such as "a” or "the.” Instead, the query server system (120, Figure 1) focuses on more important words like words identifying people, places, and products, also known as "interesting entities.” By restricting the search space to "interesting entities", the query search system reduces the time needed to generate the individual television program profiles and reduces the time needed for data look up if the profiles are stored in a database.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a process for determining a television program being watched by the user of a client system or displayed in proximity to an electronic device used by a TV viewer, in accordance with some implementations.
- determining includes predicting a television program that is being displayed in proximity to an electronic device based on circumstantial information available at a server, including search queries issued to the server from the electronic device and information on TV programs being broadcast during or nearby a time window when the search query was received.
- Each of the operations shown in Figure 6 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. Optional operations are indicated by dashed lines (e.g., boxes with dashed-line borders).
- the method described in Figure 6 is performed by the television program determination system 124-1 ( Figures 1 and 3).
- the query server system 120 may be configured to:
- the location associated with the user/electronic device has an associated location (602).
- the location associated with the user/electronic device can be determined in by a variety of methods. For example, the location maybe supplied by user input, stored in a user profile locally or remotely, or stored on the user's electronic device by the GPS/location application located in the electronic device 207 ( Figure 2).
- the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) also determines the location of a user's electronic device in accordance with the IP address associated with the user's electronic device.
- location information associated with the user of an electronic device may be stored either at the client device or at the query server system.
- the query server system passes the search query to a television program determination system 124-1 ( Figure 1).
- the television program determination system 124-1 Figure 1 determines, in accordance with the search query profile stored in the query profile database 140 ( Figure 1) associated with the received search query and the television program profiles stored in the television program information database 130 ( Figure 1) for television programs available to the user/electronic device during a specific time window, a television program currently being displayed in proximity to the electronic device, wherein the television program related information includes program descriptions for a plurality of possible television programs available at the associated location (606).
- the phrase, "displayed in proximity to the electronic device” or similar is understood to mean displayed in the same room as the electronic device or otherwise within viewing and/or hearing range of the electronic device, such that the TV program is displayed for, viewed by, or otherwise discernable by a user of the electronic device (even if only through hearing).
- the method for determining is described in greater detail below.
- the determination is made by generating a score for each television program in the plurality of television programs, the score being generated in accordance with the query terms received from the user of an electronic device (608).
- the television program with the highest score is the determination made by the determining module of the query server system (616).
- the query server system generates the score by identifying a first set of categories associated with the search query terms (610). In some implementations, the query server system dynamically determines the first set of categories associated with the search query terms. In some implementations, the query server system determines the first set of categories associated with search query terms in advance and stores the first set of categories in a query profile associated with the query in the query profile database (140 Figure 1). If the first set of categories is determined in advance, the query server system retrieves the query profile from the query profile database. The query server system then identifies a second set of categories associated with each television program (612).
- the categories associated with each television program are determined through a textual analysis of all information stored in the television program information database 130 ( Figure 3) such as the television program name, program descriptions, cast information, television series information, genre information and related terms. In addition, in some implementations information is retained based on user interests and television program selection habits and this information is used to further establish category information for each television program.
- the query server system dynamically determines the second set of categories associated with each television program. In other implementations, the query server system may determine the second set of categories associated with each television program prior to receiving the search query in advance and store the second set of categories associated with each television program in a television program information database 130 ( Figure 1) for later retrieval.
- the query server system applies a matching function to the first set of categories and the second set of categories to obtain a score (614).
- the matching function applied by the query server system can be any function or algorithm that calculates the similarity between to two sets.
- the score generated for each television program in a plurality of television programs is a correlation co-efficient. For example, if a user were to enter the search query "eagles" the query server system will likely to find categories for 'eagles' such as 'music' and 'outdoors.' A documentary on The Eagles, will then be found to have a significant correlation to the search query and will receive a relatively high score. If the user then confirms they are viewing this television program that information may be fed back into the television program information database for future classification.
- the query server system may determine whether the user is, in fact, currently viewing a television program (604).
- the query server system analyzes the content of the received query, as well as the location of the user of the electronic device and the time at which search query was received to make this determination.
- the query server system makes this determination by calculating a correlation score (see above for methods of calculating a score correlating search queries and television programs) for one or more television programs available to the user of the electronic device based on the location information stored at the server. If at least one television program exceeds the predetermined threshold, then one determined television program will be determined as outlined above. However, if none of the correlation scores exceed a predetermined threshold, the query server system determines that the user of an electronic device is not currently viewing a television program. In accordance with some implementations, if the query server system determines that the user of an electronic device is not currently viewing a television program, the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) executes a search through the web crawler data (see Figure 3, 336) using the received search query with no modification (620).
- a correlation score see above for methods of calculating a score correlating search queries and television programs
- the query server system orders the set of possible television programs in accordance with the generated scores (618).
- Figure 7 is a flow diagram illustrating a process for enhancing search results in accordance with a determined television program, in accordance with some implementations.
- Each of the operations shown in Figure 7 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium.
- Optional operations are indicated by dashed lines (e.g., boxes with dashed-line borders).
- the operations shown in Figure 7 are performed by the search query modification system 124-2 ( Figures 1 and 3).
- a query server system 120 ( Figure 1)
- the television program is determined by the server directly accessing information concerning the television program being displayed in proximity to the electronic device.
- the server system can determine the program being displayed in proximity to the electronic device by accessing a device (e.g. a set top box, an Internet-enabled television system, or a home media computing device) that stores information concerning the television channel or television program currently being displayed to a user.
- a device e.g. a set top box, an Internet-enabled television system, or a home media computing device
- the query server system 120 may be configured to:
- the query server system 120 modifies the received search query based on the determined television program (706).
- the query server system 120 accesses a database of television program related information (708).
- the television program related information includes information related to program show times, channel information, program title, program description, program series information, cast information and genre information.
- the query server system 120 determines additional search terms which are associated with both the determined television program and the received search query (710).
- the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) adds the additional search terms to the received search query (712).
- determining additional terms to modify the received search query is accomplished by first determining categories related to the received search query, from a search query profile 417 ( Figure 4), determining categories related to the determined television program, from a television program profile 516 ( Figure 5) associated with the determined television program, and comparing the set of categories associated with the received search query and the set of categories associated with the determined television program. Based on the categories which correlate, the search query modification system 124- 2 ( Figure 1) finds relevant additional search queries.
- the search query modification system 124-2 determines that both the received search query and the determined television program are associated with the category "sports cars" and, more specifically, the Ferrari F550. Based on this determination, the search query modification system 124-2 ( Figure 1) determines that "Ferrari” is a relevant search query term and modifies the received search query to include it.
- Figure 1 performs a search with the modified search query (714).
- the query processing server uses the modified search query to search through the web crawler data (see Figure 3, 336) previously gathered, indexed, and stored by the query server system.
- the search server system 120 ( Figure 1) then returns the search results of the modified search query to the electronic device (716).
- Figure 8 is a flow diagram illustrating the process for suggesting a television program in accordance with a received search query, in accordance with some
- Each of the operations shown in Figure 8 may correspond to instructions stored in a computer memory or computer readable storage medium. Optional operations are indicated by dashed lines (e.g., boxes with dashed-line borders). In some implementations, the operations shown in Figure 8 are performed by television program suggestion system 124-3 ( Figures 1 and 3).
- the query server system 120 may be configured to:
- Figure 1 receives a user's search query from an electronic device (802).
- the search server system 120 ( Figure 1) then determines one or more subjects of interest to the user of the electronic device in accordance with the received search query (804).
- the query server system 120 determines subjects of interest to the user of an electronic device by identifying a first set of categories associated with the received search query terms. In some implementations, the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) dynamically determines the first set of categories associated with the search query terms. In some implementations, the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) determines the first set of categories associated with search query terms in advance and stores the first set of categories associated with a search query in a query profile database for later retrieval 140 ( Figure 1).
- the query server system 120 determines, in accordance with the location associated with the user of an electronic device and the subjects determined to be of interested to the user in accordance with the received search query, at least one television program available during the time window (806).
- the query server system 120 makes this determination by identifying a second set of categories associated with each television program from a set of television programs.
- the query server system 120 applies a matching function to compare the first set of categories associated with the search query terms and the second set of categories associated with each television program in the set of television programs.
- the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) dynamically determines the second set of categories associated with each television program.
- the query server system 120 determines the second set of categories associated with each television program in advance and stores the second set of categories associated with each television program in a television program information database 130 ( Figure 1).
- the television program suggestion system 124-3 ( Figure 1), generates a score for each television program from the set of currently available television programs.
- the score is generated by applying a matching function to the first set of categories associated with the received search query and the second set of categories associated with each television program from the set of currently available television programs.
- a search query of "jaguar” may have the following set of categories associated with it (mammals, sports cars, sports teams.)
- a television program such as "America's Next Top Model” may have the following set of associated categories (fashion, models, clothing design).
- a matching function such as a dot product, would likely find little to no correlation between the two television programs and thus the resulting score would be very low.
- a television program such as “Top Gear” may have the following set of associated categories (automobiles, sports cars, racing cars).
- a dot product of the set of categories for "jaguar” and “Top Gear” would produce more correlation that for "America's Next Top Model” and thus would produce a higher resulting score
- the set of available television programs is ordered in accordance with the generated score.
- the television program recommended to the user of an electronic device is the television program with the highest generated score.
- the query server system 120 may be configured to:
- Figure 1 sends the user/electronic device a recommendation to view the determined television program, in accordance with a determination that at least one television program is available to the user/electronic device and is sufficiently related to the determined categories of interest (808). In some implementations, if the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) determines that none of the television programs available during the specific time window are sufficiently related to the user's determined categories of interest, no recommendation is sent.
- the query server system 120 may be configured to:
- ( Figure 1) receives a response from the user of an electronic device regarding the suggested television program (810).
- This response may indicate the user is already watching the suggested television program, the user has decided to watch the suggested television program or that the user is not interested in watching the suggested television program.
- the query server system 120 evaluates the response received from the user of an electronic device (811). Based on the evaluation, the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) may determine that the response is either favorable or unfavorable to the recommendations. A favorable response would be received if the user chose to view the recommended television program. An unfavorable response would be received if the user indicates that the user is already watching the suggested television program, or is not interested in watching the suggested television program. In accordance with a response that indicates the user is already watching the suggested television program, or is not interested in watching the suggested television program, the query server system 120 ( Figure 1) suppresses future recommendations of the recommended television program (812).
