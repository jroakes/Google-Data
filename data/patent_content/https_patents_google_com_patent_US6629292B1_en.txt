Definitions
- This invention relates to methods of forming graphical images which are intended to be eventually perceptible to the human eye with or without the aid of imaging enhancement means and more particularly to methods of forming images in semiconductor devices which are easy to fabricate and provide a good likeness of the image being portrayed.
- Creating images in semiconductor devices is accomplished by making patterns in existing metallurgy in which the metal and it's contrasting adjacent insulators are shaped, similar to creating images in a stencil or in creating designs for carving pumpkins. That is, since the pattern is formed by the opaque (or clear) segments of a mask in a binary fashion all of the opaque portions of a design must remain attached to each other, otherwise some of the pieces of patterned metallurgy will be lost by falling off of the supporting substrate and causing contamination or reliability problems with the devices.

- Gray scale images can be formed with structures and techniques inherently used in the fabrication of integrated semiconductor devices. For example, images can be formed using assorted techniques to vary the amount of material in a particular location thereby locally changing the amount of light reflected in much the same way images are traditionally printed on paper or other media except that here, instead of ink and paper, the materials commonly used to make wires on a semiconductor device are used.
- the metal currently copper
- the metal is deposited into trenches and via holes etched in an interlevel dielectric layer.
- the copper be formed such that it overfills the trenches and is therefore required to be planarized to render the top surface of the metal and dielectric co-planar.
- ground rules have been established requiring, for example, maximum distances between conductive lines and within conductive lines. The subject invention inherently enables all of such ground rules to be met.
- each image can be said to exist is divided into a number of regularly shaped picture elements (pixels).
- Each pixel can be thought of as an area of reflectivity. Changes in the area of metal—preferably a shiny reflective metal such as aluminum polished to act as a mirror—can be made in extremely small increments (delta) off the frame.
- delta extremely small increments
- Each pixel attached to the frame wire can be constructed in various manners and abutted together to form a complex image.
- FIG. 1 a illustrates a single pixel element an aperture which closes from four sides where the size of the sides can be altered either together or independently.
- a frame 10 is used in each pixel within the pixel frame 12 .
- Gray levels are depicted by region 14 which fills the frame with intensity information.
- FIG. 1 b illustrates a contiguous group of four pixels, each being of a different gray level.
- FIGS. 2 a and 2 b illustrate a two-sided pixel which closes from two opposite sides where the sides can be controlled together or independently.
- FIG. 3 a illustrates our preferred method which represents a pair of one sided pixels which is controlled by moving or modifying the one free edge 14 and 14′′. Pixels are provided in pairs as a set of upper pixel and lower pixels separated by a ‘minimum space’ 16 . This method affords good resolution and is the method preferred for standard semiconductor processes where logos and such are to be implemented.
- FIG. 3 b represents a block of eight pixels.
- each pixel occupies one-half of the minimum frame or line width and one-half of the minimum space between lines when there are two pixels of maximum intensity.
- the embodiment is implemented in contrasting materials such as conductive lines and insulating materials, the lowest intensity image is formed when the conductive lines are of a minimum width and the highest image intensity is achieved when the lines are of maximum width and the insulating material is of minimum width. Since all of the pixels are preferred to be of the same size a half-tone-like image can be created.
- All of the images are composed of a large number of pixels.
- 16 levels of gray are defined. It is preferred to provide pixels such that there a pair of pixels a set of 16 pixel cells for the bottom portion of each frame wire and another set of 16 for the top of the frame wire. Because of the capabilities of typical semiconductor processing available, each pixel cell will be constructed to contain any of the levels comprising the image. In one of the simpler implementations we simply copy the metal representing the image onto all the metal layers being processed.
- the image is composed of the reflective metal view and a gap or background of unreflective material. The gap or dark portion of each pixel is usually filled with polysilicon or other material which will reflect less light than would the semiconductor substrate.
- FIG. 4 a A plan view of a single pixel 18 depicting an intermediate gray level cell is shown in FIG. 4 a .
- FIG. 4 b A cross-sectional view of the same pixel taken along the line b—b of FIG. 4 a is illustrated in FIG. 4 b and shows a semiconductor substrate 20 , N + diffusion region 22 , a polysilicon layer and three levels of metal M 1 , M 2 and M 3 , each one of which is formed from structures found in the technology used to fabricate a typical semiconductor device.
- the pixels of FIG. 4 can be constructed through the use of any number of interactive editing tools, or by other programs, and stored in the manner commonly used to create and store other data from which masks are built for semiconductor processes.
- the polysilicon is used here to provide added contrast.
- the N + diffusion is added in technologies where there are local density requirements for placement and may or may not play a role in forming the images of the instant invention.
- the metal layers placed below that of the top metal M 3 are added both for local density and to help diffuse diffracted light helping to form the visible image, as described in more detail below.
- pixels which contain composites of various levels It is also possible to build pixels which contain composites of various levels.
- the same shape of metal segment will appear darker at the level of metal M 1 than one formed at the level of metal M 3 so it is, for example, possible to bucket pixels such that the darkest third use only M 1 , the middle third use M 1 and M 2 , and the brightest third use M 1 , M 2 and M 3 .
- An example of a four-level image is illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- the basic process necessary to create an image on a semiconductor device begins with an image and, if not already in a digital representation, it can be scanned with a scanner or photographed with a digital camera.
- the image format of the digital image can be any of a number of standard digital graphical formats such as jpg (A Joint Photographic Experts Group standard file format for still image data compression), gif (Graphical Interchange Format, a standard for digitized images compressed with the LZW algorithm, defined in 1987 by CompuServe (CIS)). Or other standard graphical data compression format which are supported by most of today's software programs. Using one of these programs, gimp, or the GNU Image Manipulation Program, a capable and advanced image editor available for free for use with the Linux Operating system, whatever digital image manipulation is desired is completed before encoding it for the semiconductor device.

- the image shown in FIG. 6 is to be translated to a true image at a semiconductor chip level, the image must first be compensated for distortion inherent in the asymmetric scaled pixels.
- FIG. 7 is representative of a physical layout of a portion of an image formed by the subject invention illustrating within the dashed lines a square portion of an image representing 12 pixels in which in the vertical dimension of the page measures two pixels and in the horizontal dimension measures six pixels.
- the original image In order to create a correctly proportioned visually perceptible image, the original image must be expanded laterally or compressed vertically in a ratio of 3:1, since the actual layout of pixels can be implemented on a 3 to 1 ratio.
- the image will be compressed to account for the asymmetric resolution in the vertical dimension to provide an image after scaling as shown in FIG. 8 .
- the scale-modified image is converted into a gray scale image after which it may be desirable to enhance the image's contrast or make use of any number of other image manipulation techniques.
- gray scale image is converted to a format which can be read by a program which translates the common image format into a chip layout design data language such as GDSII or GL/ 1 . This encoding will make use of the pixel cells.
- FIG. 9 is a representation of a group of 16 contiguous pixels, each bearing a gray scale level from 0 to 15.
- This data structure maps directly onto the frame wire structure of the invention.
- this data structure is shown in FIG. 10 .
- Each of these locations is translated into a shape on a level of a given name and in a given location the result of which is illustrated in FIG. 11 .
- merging techniques can be implemented which rename each image, merge data specific to it and reuse the pixel definitions common to all the images.
- the basic technique outlined here is completely compatible with all semiconductor processes known to the inventors.
- the resulting images can be very complex visually and be structured enough to be incorporated as functional wiring on a chip.
- the resolution available with this frame wire image printing technique offers asymmetric resolution.
- FIG. 12 a shows an image in which the image is best placed with the frame wire running horizontally, while FIG. 12 b is best oriented with the frame wire running vertically.
- FIG. 13 represents a simple square example image where the frame wires run horizontally.
- This first image after encoding, has a perimeter measurement of 1416.22 microns and a vertex count of 240.
- the resulting image would look something like FIG. 14 on the wafer:
- the next level of optimization is to subdivide the image and do the optimization outlined above in each subdivision of the image. This subdivision process can be continued until the size of the frame wire within the images drops below the size allowed by the manufacturing process. An image locally optimized might appear as shown in FIG. 17, if only the frame wires are considered.
- Complications at the boundaries of the regions can occur where care must be taken to mesh with the pitches running in another direction. It is necessary to either merge the pixels running in the respective directions or maintain an adequate non-image space.
- the choices made at these boundaries can also be an issue of optimization and one method might be chosen over another based on what is depicted in the image at that location.
- the frame wires can also be run at arbitrary angles across the entire image or portions of it.
- additional optimizations can occur which are, for example, related to color or to the algorithmic optimizations available in software and it is clear that the optimization space gets very large. In the following paragraphs a few of the more interesting optimizations will be described.
- FIG. 18 the centering of the frame wires is labeled as Frame.
- the resist regions after the initial exposure on the left and the chemical bias on the right are labeled as Resist.
- the space which will be occupied by the wires, where the wires are the frame plus the delta in reflection, are labeled as Wire.
- Small adjustments must be made in the shapes to account for the expansion of the resist pattern without introducing error in the amount of reflected light. These adjustments are labeled Adjustment.
- the space between frame wires can be eliminated by using more than one level of wiring.
- overlap denotes the regions where the first wiring level (Layer 1 ) overlaps or slides under the second wiring level (Layer 2 ). This overlap as well as the frame wires will disappear when each level goes through the exposure and chemical resist bias steps outlined above. (The resist labeled Resist here is not shown accurately as it too will overlap with wire regions and resist regions related to the definition of other layers of wiring.)
- both the metal and the insulation between layers be thinned in this overlapping technique so there is minimal difference in the reflectivity of the metal layers, as shown in FIG. 20 .
- pixels can be packed edge to edge to the limits of the alignment of the resist exposure tool being used. Further, with additional levels of wiring smaller and smaller individual pixel size can be used to enhance the ability to adjust the size of the individual pixels or reflective areas on all sides.
- OPC optical proximity correction
- the frame technique has an inherent asymmetric characteristic which is subject to further extension.
- the changes along the frame wire usually increase or decrease in intensity gradually as might be the case with a picture of a human face.
- the steps in this gradual change in intensity can occur at the minimum step size printable with the semiconductor wiring technology being used. It could be tens of nanometers in size and satisfy process dimensional ground rules. Therefore, within the image we can print at a pixel pitch which is less than the minimum feature size of the technology itself.
- the use of minimum step size can cause problems when the step direction is changed. If the image intensity along the frame wire has a peak or valley, the peak or valley itself must be of a feature size greater than or equal to the capabilities of the technology, if not using OPC techniques. In other words, the nubs and notches in the wires need to be “adjusted.” For example, the circled peak in FIG. 25 must be formed of a printable feature which meets the process ground rules. This limitation is a feature of the specific photolithographic tools used and is not a limitation in the invention.
- the notches and nubs are adjusted by an algorithm which iterates repeatedly through a “fix notches then fix nubs” loop until no more fixes are being made or until we find us in an oscillation of counter-acting fixes. When this limit is reached all remaining notches and nubs in error are deleted.
- the pixel pitch along the frame can only be pushed to about 3 ⁇ 4 of the minimum feature size for the wiring level.
- the pitch along the frame wire can be pushed to about 1 ⁇ 5 of the minimum feature size.
- the first approach is to use pixels containing only two reflection areas instead of the N levels of gray normally used.
- the pixel shown in FIG. 26 a instead of the pixel shown in FIG. 26 a , the pixel shown in FIG. 26 b can be used and still resolve an image or character to be printed. Some contrast is lost and images look more like images faintly stamped into the “page” but much less space is used.
- Another option for saving space is to drop the frame wire altogether in black and white images. Where there is white there will be adequate width so long as the pixel is defined so that the delta to white is at least 1 ⁇ 2 the minimum metal width.
- the three letters in FIG. 27 will serve as an example.
- the white represents the reflective metal which will be equivalent to white paper on which to print and the lack of material or reflection will be equivalent to the ink.
- the converted image as formed for printing on the wafer with out any enhancement is shown in FIG. 28 .
- An enlargement of the character B is shown in FIG. 29 .
- Highlighted in a cross hatch pattern are regions in the image which do not follow manufacturing ground rules of processes typically used to build semiconductors. That is, the width of the metal (white) is less than an acceptable dimension.
- FIG. 30 This approximation of the character (FIG. 30) is then used to find all enclosed regions within the character. In other words all regions in the characters one might fill in with a pencil. In the figure these regions are represented the solid lines crossing the open portions of the letter. This region is used to fill in the enclosed regions and in this way fix many errors.
- FIG. 31 shows the image following this process where the original errors remain in cross-hatching and newly introduced errors are shown as dark X's near the center of the letter.
- an envelope is formed which covers the character by an expansion amount of about one-half the wire width plus a space. Then an envelope is cut, which closely follows the outline or convex hull of the character, out of the middle of the larger envelope. This defines a working region which runs like a fat border around the outside of the character. Then the existing paper and a slight modification of the character are removed from the fat border shape. As a final step, portions too thin to be legal or which would cause other manufacturing problems are removed. These border fix up shapes are now merged with the shapes already part of our paper to form the version shown in FIG. 32 .
- the resulting pattern has only a few manufacturing issues to clear up as can be seen in the image of FIG. 32 .
- the remaining error is illustrated as an enlarged region in FIG. 33 . It may that very tiny connections are formed between the shapes and they need to be removed.
- next steps are introduced to further improve the image.
- some of the smaller enclosed regions in the background wires or “paper” which are near the characters are removed.
- step 2 the inside and outside corners of the parts of shapes related directly to the character are smoothed.
- the smoothing can be done with global parameters. That is, all of the corners are uniformly smoothed.
- a hybrid analog and digital encoding technique which takes advantage of the ability to store gray levels very efficiently allows increments of 10 nanometers and smaller, with more specialized tooling, to store higher resolution black and white images.
- the five levels can be thought of as five binary pixels arranged over the pixel as shown in FIG. 40 in the following way.
- the arrangement chosen provides for both density and a reduction in error when the algorithmic enhancement is applied.
- the method reads gray levels and turns them into a fixed number of dots, either black or white, it is important to minimize the impact of any potential miss read of the gray level. For example, if using a traditional binary numbering system where there is a mis-read of the gray level 7 (00111) as the level 8 (01000) the number of pixels colored in error will be four.
- the first enhancement is the need to move the full ON (or white) encoding to the last position to enable the white space compression method as discussed below. This introduces the possibility of a two bit error between gray levels 21 and 22 . It also introduces a potential 4 bit error at the end of the list. The impact of the first two bit error is minimized by positioning the two least significant bits against the frame and adjacent to each other. To minimize the error possible at the end of the list it is preferred to introduce some error margin intentionally in the basic pixel design (this could be done around 20 and 21 too). This modification to the pixel would change the basic pixel structure in the example to the structure shown in FIG. 41 .
- This scheme for dealing with the error margin enhances the appearance of the lower resolution analog image by making any pixel intended to be completely dark, visibly darker than the surrounding pixels which are potentially some level of gray.
- FIG. 42 illustrates a shape sitting on top of a 3 ⁇ 3 matrix of our physical pixels, but which has been scanned at 5 times that resolution.
- the black ( 0 s) and white ( 1 s) at the higher resolution are shown on the right side.
- FIG. 43 a shows how this binary image maps onto our 9 physical pixels provides an image something like FIG. 43 a .
- the 9 pixels are labeled P 1 to P 9 and below each pixel label is shown how the virtual sub-pixels map to the modified binary number system. Finally, in each pixel there is indicated the grey code level which corresponds to the binary number.
- FIG. 43 b shows the actual physical implementation showing the reflective wires which would actually be built on the semiconductor.
- the image encoded as above were looked at visually, the image would appear with a much reduced resolution and accuracy. If the image is acquired by some techniques whereby the gray levels of each pixel can be measured or the dimensions of each pixel can be measured, a computer program can be applied which will convert the low resolution image to the higher resolution image on the right. In effect, both a low resolution and full resolution image have been stored on the semiconductor device taking advantage of what can be done well with typical semiconductor processes, namely the very precise control of the shapes which make up a typical semiconductor.
- more ‘levels' of gray can be encoded in the analog image by varying the shapes even more.
- the way in which changes from one gray level to the next is made can be varied by employing OPC techniques described elsewhere to achieve many more levels of gray and hence more reconstructible image resolution.
- three white lines would be represented with one white or reflective line which is two steps larger than a normal white pixel line.
- This larger than normal size would be seen in our analog image and by computer program expanded into the full resolution image.
- the image can of course be partitioned into subsections and this optimization carried out in each of these subsections. Variations are many, but the central idea is to encode an analog image which is usable, but has a lower resolution. Into this analog image information is encoded which can be used to build a virtual image which has much more resolution.
- the final hybrid variant to be discussed is the mixing of true gray scale images with black and white images.
- the subject technique to store a page of text which contains a grey scale image, it is most efficient to store the text portions as black and white images using some of the techniques for black and white images mentioned herein. And where there are gray scale images, they should be stored as gray scale encoded images using grayscale pixels on a frame.
- the strength of this image technique is grayscale so converting gray scale images to black and white dots, while it will work, is not optimal.
- the numbers and coordinates are self explanatory and in practice would probably be computer read so navigation could be automated.
- the Pointer serves as both an analog hint about the directions to the image and as the origin for the offset in the x and y dimensions.
- Each image on the wafer would contain the following header, shown in FIG. 48 .
- Spread throughout the images on the wafer would be you are here markers which would look like FIG. 49 .
- the intent is to provide both analog manual navigation aids and something which could be automatically read.
- the pixel structure used at a given position is determined by the technique discussed above.
- the technique breaks the images, gray scale or color component, into a grid of numbers. This grid represents the intensity of each pixel and how these values are mapped onto pixel structures.
- a capability unique to this approach is pixel shaping. If hexagonal pixels, as shown in FIG. 50, illustrating for full white ( 15 ), full black ( 0 ), gray ( 10 ) and gray ( 4 ) in a system with 16 levels of gray per pixel, all formed using the frame wire technique.
- each physical pixel can include the equivalent of sub-pixels. These subpixels can more accurately replicate the image to be printed. Thus, the four pixels of FIG. 50 can become the 16 sub-pixels of FIG. 51 .
- sub-pixels can be modified as separate pixels by further shaping resulting in the image shown in FIG. 52 .
- the basic idea is to use resolution beyond the physical pixel resolution, if available, to shape the reflective material so that it more closely follows the image while staying within the constraints of whatever our basic pixel structure requires. And while not shown, the frame wire can be part of this pixel shaping adjustment and pixels can also be merged.
- This example also highlights the difficulty in quoting ultimate resolution numbers for this semiconductor imaging technique. Although there is a raw pixel pitch which is fixed, adjustments to the edges of shapes can be as small as 10 ⁇ 10 nanometers. Often resolution can be built into semiconductor images which is well below the raw pixel size.
- This inverted image is similar to, but not identical to, a photographic negative. It is not a perfect inversion. A large part of this effect can be explained because of the optics of the basic structure of the semiconductor device.
- Improving the quality of the inverted image may be important in low end applications.
- the vast majority of cheap microscopes include a light source, i.e. a dark field, which will produce the inverted image.
- a light source i.e. a dark field
- the top surface in our damascene metal process is polished. It is a good mirror and the light which hits it is cleanly reflected. The light which hits the other surfaces of our metal or other wiring materials not polished will be more dispersive or diffuse when reflecting.
- FIG. 53 shows a cross section of an image which is full white with 16 levels of gray. If one views the surface and follows light rays reflecting according to geometric optics and coming into the image at 45 degrees, the following reflections can be seen at three (FIG. 53 a ), six (FIG. 53 b ) and nine 9 (FIG. 53 c ) reflections.
- FIG. 54 Likewise, if one looks at the part of the image which is full black, as shown in FIG. 54, one would observe the following for three (FIG. 54 a ), six (FIG. 54 b ) and nine (FIG. 54 c ) reflections.
- the bleeding from pixel to pixel can be addressed by changing the process to eliminate the open space between the levels. This could be done either by eliminating the space between the layers of material or by making use of the dual Damascene metal process currently practiced where one would use the interconnect via layer as a barrier as shown in FIG. 55 to completely block cross reflections.
- Various other structures may easily be envisioned which will alter the basic optical structure of the semiconductor devices.
- FIG. 56 showns the use of a continuous via extending from the center of the line portion of each level of metal in a semiconductor device.
- FIG. 57 shows the use of the line portion of each metal level and allows some cross-talk between pixels.
- FIG. 58 shows an embodiment not intended to utilize the actual wiring levels in a semiconductor device and, although depicted on a semiconductor substrate need not be so constructed.
- the thickness of the reflective/absorbing materials may be of constant thickness.
- FIG. 59 shows yet another embodiment in which the T-shaped conductive layers are used.
- FIGS. 60 and 61 demonstrate yet additional variations in embodying the invention.
- FIG. 62 additional examples of variations in implementing the invention are shown.
- a light pocket is formed which controls the reflective characteristics of the region of the image under which the light pocket is formed.
- region “B” the light entering is reflected into the underlying structure.
- Region “C” is another type of light pocket.
- Region “D” shows a type of pocket in which only a portion of the light entering the pocket is permitted to escape into the device.
- Region “E” is another way in which to allow light entering in one pixel to modify the characteristics of an adjacent pixel.
- Regions “F” and “G” show other forms of light pockets.
- the interaction between multiple reflective/absorbing material levels can be used in combination to provide desired optical effects.
- the cross section of the wires resulting from the damascene process preferred in forming the images As shown in FIG. 63, one can see two features which increase contrast when looking directly down upon the image.
- the Damascened wires taper inward slightly from top to bottom. This taper has the effect of causing the noisy, unpolished edges of these wires to always in the shadow of the top surface.
- the second feature is that there is a flare or umbrella on the top of the wire which comes from polishing the top of the wire in the damascene process. This “lip” also assists contrast and increases the positive viewing angle in that it hides or masks the noisy sides of the wire.
- Adding non reflective material or damaging the mirrored surface of the polished metal via ion implantation or other means in the regions representing the frame wire can be used to make the frame wire less prominent.
- Non reflective materials can be used in the channels between mirrors as can mirrors made out of the silicon surface itself which reflect so as to scatter the light which hits it.
- Adding layers of material with a lower index of refraction which will tend to deflect light not perfectly perpendicular to the surface onto the top and bottom edges of the reflective shapes can also be implemented so that reflected light does not return to the surface.
- the interface between insulators can be made with varying indexes of refraction can be roughened or made lumpy so they scatter light which passes through.
- the first is simply to measure the average intensity of the image or of subsections of the image.
- the amount of light which should be reflected from a particular image can be calculated knowing the properties of the materials involved and knowing how the image was constructed. One would compare this calculated intensity to one actually measured. Significant differences would indicate problems or defects in the image on the semiconductor.
- the image window size will be determined by many factors including manufacturing tolerances, measurement accuracy, measurement tolerance and the defect sizes we wish to find.
- FIG. 64 a is a subwindow on a larger image and 0.342 is the expected reflectivity if correctly manufactured.
- two random defects have added material to the image in the subwindow and the reflectivity has increased to 0.359.
- two non-reflective defects have caused material to be removed from the subwindow and the reflectivity drops to 0.333.
- the difference in expected reflectivity for the images in FIG. 64 b and FIG. 64 c indicates a problem exists in this subwindow.
- the reflected intensity from like areas can be compared with each other or with a standard. Again if particular images are defective they are likely to fall outside this standard. The only problem case being that in which defects exist which both add and subtract material so that the overall reflectivity is compensated or balanced. Such an occurrence would be rare, but possible.
- Alignment structures will be needed to align accurately to the image before any of these comparisons can be made. It is preferred that alignment aids, as have been commonly used in semiconductor processing for years, be used.
- FIG. 65 shows a layout including a central array of frame wires supporting an image and includes support circuits of addressable multiplexors or pass gates.
- the pass gates are controlled by decoders which will activate various combinations of frame wires and look for both extra material (shorts) and missing material (opens). Further this method lets one localize the defects in the image.
- a combination of image verification methods can also be used and these methods can be applied to single and multiple level images.
- the images formed by the inventive technique provide a digital representation of an object, once written in a semiconductor device, these images are in analog form. For example, images appear as any photographic image and one only requires a magnification means to visually perceive them. Microscopes are cheep and easy to obtain and are sure to out last the special digital reading formats and readers currently known to be used with digital imaging systems.
- microfilm replacement for archival purposes. While the very highest quality of microfilm has a resolution of about 25,000 dots per inch (dpi), the instant technique can easily achieve more than 50,000 dpi. Thus, an entire 200 mm semiconductor wafer can be filled with microimages much as semiconductor devices are today. A simple or automated system can be used to access individual frames of information. Mass production of such archive media is trivial.
- FIG. 66 is a schematic view demonstrating this embodiment. For best viewing, an opaque layer can be inserted between the images.
- FIG. 67 shows the three primary colors as separate layers within a single region of a device.
- Colored layers can be utilized either as a composite color image or as selectively perceived separate images, as different layers of a color separation.
- the basic frame wire pixel technique used for gray scale images may also be used to create composite color images much as a color television tube generates color images. Because of the lateral compression inherently available in the subject invention, separate pixels for each of red, green and blue can be implemented as the standard background. Dark imaging can then be provided over this background leaving all or portions of the respective colors exposed, as illustrated in FIG. 68 .
- the gray scale feature of the invention allows for a gray scale intensity of color to be provided.
- the inventive technique can be used to create bar code labels which could be read on the chips surface and which would help with product tracking and control.
- Such images incorporate various line widths and spaces which are a problem and further include extensive white space—also a problem. Further, to create the images from polygons directly is problematic.
- the original image the compliment of what is to be displayed—is placed over a light source on a semiconductor.
- Each chip could contain many images. Enough images, for example to provide a plurality of separate indicators in different languages. By selectively manipulating the light source, different images can be displayed, as illustrated in FIG. 70 . By manipulating light sources, animation or variations in an image can be portrayed.
- a wafer might be processed to the upper levels of metallurgy and have the rinal level customized to provide unique identification.
- Additional brightness can be achieved by adding white frames to images.
- Two separate image planes can be created by using two different directional etch steps which alter the top surface of lines as shown in FIG. 71, such that a different image is perceived depending upon the viewing angle.
- image patterned levels need not be limited to the top level. As shown in FIG. 72, a subsurface level is customized, while the remainder of the device metallization is unchanged.
