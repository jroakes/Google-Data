- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a method for conducting search queries, according to an illustrative implementation.
- This document describes technology that may be used to provide a user with a diverse set of search results that are responsive to the user's voice input query.
- the search query techniques described herein (“technology”) can provide one or more of the following advantages.
- One advantage of the technology is that the technology provides the user with search results in an audible format so the user can listen to the results without having to look at a screen on the user's electronic device.
- Another advantage of the technology is that the technology provides the user with search results that include several components, each component containing information responsive to the search query. This allows the user to extract information from the search results in more than one way.
- One of the components of the information provided to the user includes an answer to the search query that is a set of text in a complete sentence form which minimizes the chances that the user will need to take any further action to satisfy the user's inquiry.
- the technology provides the added advantage of providing the user with the ability to acquire more information without running an additional search when the answer does not satisfy the user's need. Additional information is provided to the user in the search results in the form of, for example, a link to a web page where additional information is provided to the user when the user selects the link. This eliminates the need for the user to run a separate search to satisfy the user's inquiry.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a search query environment 100 , according to an illustrative implementation.
- the environment 100 includes a search system 104 for receiving search queries from a variety of users 128 a , 128 b , . . . 128 z (generally 128 ) using a variety of electronic devices 120 a , 120 b , . . . 120 z (generally 120 and also referred to as a client device or client devices).
- the search system 104 can include a server that includes a search engine.
- the users 128 initiate search queries by speaking their query into a microphone 102 of an electronic device 120 .
- the electronic device 120 can be, for example, a mobile electronic device, laptop computer, personal digital assistant, a personal computer system, or other electronic communication device having a voice input interface for receiving voice input(s) 108 from a user.
- the voice input query can be received by the electronic device 120 as an input to one of various applications 110 that can be executed on the electronic device 120 , e.g., a web browser or an e-mail application.
- the spoken query received by the electronic device 120 is converted to a textual representation, and the search system 104 performs a search based on the textual representation.
- the voice input query is transmitted to the search system 104 , using the network 124 , as an audio signal to be converted by the search system 104 to the textual representation.
- an application 110 running on the electronic device 120 converts the voice input query to the textual representation and then transmits the textual representation to the remote search system 104 , using the network 124 , for further processing.
- the network 124 can include one or more local area networks; a wide area network, e.g., the internet; a wireless network, e.g., a cellular network; or a combination of all or some of the above.
- a processor associated with the electronic device 120 or the search system 104 , can use one or more language models to recognize the text in the spoken query.
- the processor can include a speech recognition application that identifies a language spoken by the user from the spoken query and converts the query into text by recognizing the speech in the input.
- the processor compares the spoken words to a database of stored words to identify what are the spoken words.
- the processor selects a best candidate, from a list of multiple possible candidates that one or more language models generate, as the textual representation to be used for subsequent processing.
- the search system 104 After the search system 104 has the textual representation of the search query, the search system 104 searches for and returns relevant search result data that is responsive to the search terms of the textual representation of the spoken query. In this implementation, the search system 104 maintains an index of web pages that are compiled in an off-line mode. In the off-line mode, the search system 104 searches for web pages hosted by one or more web page hosts 116 a , 116 b , . . . 116 x (generally 116 ). The search system 104 creates the index of the web page contents by, for example, using a web crawler. The web crawler finds and retrieves documents (e.g., web pages, onebox results generated from structured data, etc.) on the web.
- documents e.g., web pages, onebox results generated from structured data, etc.
- the web crawler sends a request to, for example, a web page host 116 for a document, downloads the entire document, and then provides the document to an indexer.
- the indexer takes the text of the crawled document, extracts individual terms from the text and sorts those terms into a search index.
- the web crawler and indexer repeat this process for other documents available on the web.
- Each entry in the search index includes a term that is stored in association with a list of documents in which the term appears and the location within the document's text where the term appears.
- the search index thus, permits rapid access to documents that contain terms that match search terms of a user supplied search query.
- Typical indexers create a single search index that contains terms extracted from all documents crawled on the web.
- the index is stored by the search system 104 .
- a separate system or server creates the index and the search system 104 downloads an updated version of the index from that separate system or server on a periodic basis.
- the goal of the search system 104 is to identify high quality, relevant results based on the search query using the search index.
- the search system 104 accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to terms contained in the search index, and retrieving a list of documents associated with each matching term in the search index. Documents that contain the user's search terms are considered hits and are returned to the user as the search results.
- the hits returned by the search system 104 may be ranked relative to each other by the search system 104 based on some measure of the quality and/or relevancy of the hits.
- a basic technique for sorting the search hits relies on the degree to which the search query matches the hits.
- documents that contain every term of the search query or that contain multiple occurrences of the terms in the search query may be deemed more relevant than documents that contain less than every term of the search query or a single occurrence of a term in the search query and, therefore, may be more highly ranked by the search system.
- the search system 104 then generates an electronic document that includes one or more search results.
- Typical formats used for the electronic document include the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format or Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.
- the search system 104 then sends the electronic document to the user's electronic device 120 for execution at the electronic device 120 .
- a web browser or application running on the user's electronic device 120 reads the HTML or XML document and renders the contents of the document into visible or audible web pages.
- HTML is written in the form of HTML elements that include of tags enclosed in angle brackets within the web page content (like the following example, “ ⁇ p>This is a sentence. ⁇ /p>”).
- the start tag for a new paragraph is “ ⁇ p>” and the stop tag is “ ⁇ /p>”.
- Textual and graphical content is included between the start and end tags. In this case, the textual content is “This is a sentence.”
- HTML tags are also available for including audible content in the HTML document to specify information that is provided to a user in response to a query. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page.
- Users that initiate a search query using their voice may not be in a position to experience or otherwise access search result responses in a visual format using their electronic device 120 .
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart 200 of a method for providing a comprehensive set of search results to a user that includes audible components as well as textual components, using the search query environment of FIG. 1 .
- a user initiates ( 204 ) a search query application 110 on the user's electronic device 120 .
- the search query application 110 can be, for example, a voice search function that receives spoken search queries using the microphone 102 of an internet enabled mobile phone device 120 .
- the user then speaks a search query ( 208 ), having one or more search terms, into the microphone 102 of the electronic device 120 .
- the search query application 110 receives the voice input query ( 212 ).
- a speech recognition application 110 running on the electronic device 120 converts ( 216 ) the voice input query into a textual representation, similarly as described previously herein.
- the textual representation of the voice input query is then transmitted ( 220 ) to the search system 104 using the network 124 .
- the voice input query is transmitted to the search system 104 before the voice input query is converted to a textual representation, and a speech recognition application operating on the search system 104 converts the voice input query.
- the search system 104 conducts a search ( 224 ).
- the search system 104 conducts the search using an available search index to obtain at least one relevant search result based on the items in the textual representation of the voice input query.
- a list containing multiple relevant search results is compiled.
- Each search result includes several components.
- the search result includes a link to a web page, a first set of text excerpted from the web page and a second set of text.
- the second set of text has a complete sentence form, and is responsive to the voice input query.
- the link and first set of text does not necessarily provide the user with a complete response to the query.
- the link and first set of text while relevant to the search query, often requires that the user, for example, click on the link to access information that could be a complete response to the initial query.
- the data included in the search result for each of the components is acquired from the contents of the search index.
- the different components of the search result data can be acquired from a single index or multiple indexes.
- the link to the web page and the first set of text excerpted from the web page can be acquired from one index
- the second set of text can be acquired from another index.
- the second set of text included in the search result is expected to be delivered as a complete sentence that is responsive to the query; rather than a result that requires a user to click on a link to acquire the answer to its query. Answers taking the form of a complete sentence, that is a complete answer to the query, are termed “onebox” results.
- the types of information in a onebox result include dictionary definitions, news, stock quotes, weather, or biographical information.
- onebox results are generated in an offline process and stored by the search system 104 in a separate index.
- the onebox result can be acquired from a structured database maintained by the search system 104 , where the result has a complete sentence form that can be acquired and/or generated from the database and is an answer responsive to the user query.
- the search system 104 obtains ( 232 ) a onebox result as the second set of text, and obtains ( 228 ) a web page link and text excerpted from the web page, as the first set of text.
- the first set of text may include a onebox result.
- the search system 104 accesses a single search index to obtain the link to the web page, the first set of text excerpted from the web page, and the second set of text, where each component is accessed in the same index. In some implementations, the search system 104 selects a portion of the first set of text, which the search system 104 recognizes as being a complete response, to be used as the second set of text in the search result. In some implementations, each component of the web page that has text that can be spoken includes HTML markup language that designates what should be used for generating an audible response. There are various ways that the search system 104 can choose which set of text to use as the audible response.
- the text at the top of the web page, or the text located in a designated location can be chosen.
- the second set of text may not be extracted from the results, but rather may be synthesized based on a number of variables (e.g., words from the original search query, contextual data such time and location, etc.).
- the search system 104 then converts ( 236 ) the second set of text into data representing an audible version of the second set of text.
- the audible version of the second set of text can take on one of a variety of forms.
- the audible version of the second set of text is an audio file having one of a variety of available file formats, compressed or uncompressed, that permit the file to be stored on a computer system, e.g., a waveform audio file format (WAV), one of the various moving picture expert formats, such as MPEG, MP3, etc.
- WAV waveform audio file format
- the client device used to play the audio file would include a codec corresponding to the particular format of the audio file. The codec performs the encoding and decoding of the audio data in the audio file.
- the client devices typically have multiple codecs that support playing of audio files of different formats.
- an application or tool on a cloud-based server converts the second set of text into data representing an audible version of the second set of text.
- the application or tool on the cloud-based server converts the second set of text to an audio file.
- Cloud computing includes, generally speaking, a style of computing in which computing resources, e.g., application programs and file storage, are remotely provided over a network, e.g., over the internet. In some implementations, the resources are provided through a web browser.
- the data representing the audible version of the second set of text is a hyperlink to a resource that can play an audio file containing the audible version of the second set of text.
- the resource can be, for example, a web server, a web page cloud server, or any other suitable server or service.
- the audible version of the text is a set of text that is marked to notify an application on the client device to convert the marked text to audio that is to be played for the user.
- the search system 104 then generates ( 240 ) an electronic document, e.g., a HTML format document, which includes the link to the web page, the first set of text excerpted from the web page, and the data representing an audible version of the second set of text which is responsive to the voice input query.
- an electronic document e.g., a HTML format document
- HTML format document which includes the link to the web page, the first set of text excerpted from the web page, and the data representing an audible version of the second set of text which is responsive to the voice input query.
- HTML code corresponding to data representing an audio file The following is an example of a portion of HTML code corresponding to data representing an audio file:
- HTML code corresponding to data representing an audible version of the second set of text, where the data is text that a browser will convert to audio, and the HTML code includes a predefined HTML attribute to accomplish that conversion:
- HTML code corresponding to data representing a link to the web page, first set of text excerpted from the web page, and data representing the audible version of the second set of text, where the second set of text has a complete sentence form, and is responsive to the voice input query:
- the search system 104 then sends the electronic document ( 244 ) to the client device of the user for execution.
- the client device executes the electronic document and displays, on the device display, the link to the web page, the first set of text, the second set of text, and the client device also plays the audio file.
- the client device does not automatically play the audio file, but, rather, the client device displays an icon or piece of text corresponding to the data representing the audible version of the second set of text.
- the user can press a button or otherwise input a command to the electronic device, e.g., by clicking on the icon or text, to cause the device to play the audio.
- FIG. 3 is an example screen shot 300 of the electronic device 120 a of FIG. 1 providing information to a user.
- the screen shot depicts a search result provided to a user in response to the voice input query [“height of empire state building”].
- the electronic document sent by the search system 104 to the client electronic device 120 a was executed by the electronic device 120 a resulting in the electronic device 120 a displaying a link to a website 304 and a first set of text 308 excerpted from the website.
- the audio file included a second set of text having a complete sentence form [“The Empire State Building is 381 meters tall”] that is responsive to the voice input query.
- the electronic device 120 a automatically played the audio file 312 when audio file 312 was executed by the client device.
- a speaker 316 located on the electronic device 120 a is used to play the audio file. Because the result provided to the user included an audible version of text and the link 304 , the user is able to quickly and efficiently access additional information by, for example, tapping on the link 304 with the user's finger if the audible version proved inadequate or if the user wants to access additional information.

Abstract
A device determines at least one search result that is responsive to a textual representation of a voice query. The at least one search result includes a reference to a first document related to the voice query, a first set of text from a content of the first document, and a second set of text that is responsive to the voice query. The second set of text is in a complete sentence form. The device converts the second set of text into information corresponding to an audible version of the second set of text, and generates a second document that includes the reference to the first document, the first set of text, the second set of text, and the information corresponding to the audible version of the second set of text. The device provides the second document to a client device for presentation on a display.

- This document describes technology that may be used to provide a user with a diverse set of search results that are responsive to the user's voice input query. The search query techniques described herein (“technology”) can provide one or more of the following advantages. One advantage of the technology is that the technology provides the user with search results in an audible format so the user can listen to the results without having to look at a screen on the user's electronic device. Another advantage of the technology is that the technology provides the user with search results that include several components, each component containing information responsive to the search query. This allows the user to extract information from the search results in more than one way. One of the components of the information provided to the user includes an answer to the search query that is a set of text in a complete sentence form which minimizes the chances that the user will need to take any further action to satisfy the user's inquiry. The technology provides the added advantage of providing the user with the ability to acquire more information without running an additional search when the answer does not satisfy the user's need. Additional information is provided to the user in the search results in the form of, for example, a link to a web page where additional information is provided to the user when the user selects the link. This eliminates the need for the user to run a separate search to satisfy the user's inquiry.

FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of asearch query environment 100, according to an illustrative implementation. Theenvironment 100 includes asearch system 104 for receiving search queries from a variety ofusers electronic devices search system 104 can include a server that includes a search engine. The users 128 initiate search queries by speaking their query into amicrophone 102 of an electronic device 120. The electronic device 120 can be, for example, a mobile electronic device, laptop computer, personal digital assistant, a personal computer system, or other electronic communication device having a voice input interface for receiving voice input(s) 108 from a user. - The voice input query can be received by the electronic device 120 as an input to one of
various applications 110 that can be executed on the electronic device 120, e.g., a web browser or an e-mail application. The spoken query received by the electronic device 120 is converted to a textual representation, and thesearch system 104 performs a search based on the textual representation. In some implementations the voice input query is transmitted to thesearch system 104, using thenetwork 124, as an audio signal to be converted by thesearch system 104 to the textual representation. In some implementations, anapplication 110 running on the electronic device 120 converts the voice input query to the textual representation and then transmits the textual representation to theremote search system 104, using thenetwork 124, for further processing. Thenetwork 124 can include one or more local area networks; a wide area network, e.g., the internet; a wireless network, e.g., a cellular network; or a combination of all or some of the above. - A processor, associated with the electronic device 120 or the
search system 104, can use one or more language models to recognize the text in the spoken query. The processor can include a speech recognition application that identifies a language spoken by the user from the spoken query and converts the query into text by recognizing the speech in the input. In some implementations, the processor compares the spoken words to a database of stored words to identify what are the spoken words. In some implementations, the processor selects a best candidate, from a list of multiple possible candidates that one or more language models generate, as the textual representation to be used for subsequent processing. - After the
search system 104 has the textual representation of the search query, thesearch system 104 searches for and returns relevant search result data that is responsive to the search terms of the textual representation of the spoken query. In this implementation, thesearch system 104 maintains an index of web pages that are compiled in an off-line mode. In the off-line mode, thesearch system 104 searches for web pages hosted by one or more web page hosts 116 a, 116 b, . . . 116 x (generally 116). Thesearch system 104 creates the index of the web page contents by, for example, using a web crawler. The web crawler finds and retrieves documents (e.g., web pages, onebox results generated from structured data, etc.) on the web. To retrieve a document from the web, the web crawler sends a request to, for example, a web page host 116 for a document, downloads the entire document, and then provides the document to an indexer. The indexer takes the text of the crawled document, extracts individual terms from the text and sorts those terms into a search index. The web crawler and indexer repeat this process for other documents available on the web. Each entry in the search index includes a term that is stored in association with a list of documents in which the term appears and the location within the document's text where the term appears. The search index, thus, permits rapid access to documents that contain terms that match search terms of a user supplied search query. Typical indexers create a single search index that contains terms extracted from all documents crawled on the web. The index is stored by thesearch system 104. In some implementations, a separate system or server creates the index and thesearch system 104 downloads an updated version of the index from that separate system or server on a periodic basis. - The goal of the
search system 104 is to identify high quality, relevant results based on the search query using the search index. Typically, thesearch system 104 accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to terms contained in the search index, and retrieving a list of documents associated with each matching term in the search index. Documents that contain the user's search terms are considered hits and are returned to the user as the search results. The hits returned by thesearch system 104 may be ranked relative to each other by thesearch system 104 based on some measure of the quality and/or relevancy of the hits. A basic technique for sorting the search hits relies on the degree to which the search query matches the hits. For example, documents that contain every term of the search query or that contain multiple occurrences of the terms in the search query may be deemed more relevant than documents that contain less than every term of the search query or a single occurrence of a term in the search query and, therefore, may be more highly ranked by the search system. - The
search system 104 then generates an electronic document that includes one or more search results. Typical formats used for the electronic document include the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format or Extensible Markup Language (XML) format. Thesearch system 104 then sends the electronic document to the user's electronic device 120 for execution at the electronic device 120. A web browser or application running on the user's electronic device 120 reads the HTML or XML document and renders the contents of the document into visible or audible web pages. For example, HTML is written in the form of HTML elements that include of tags enclosed in angle brackets within the web page content (like the following example, “<p>This is a sentence.</p>”). The start tag for a new paragraph is “<p>” and the stop tag is “</p>”. Textual and graphical content is included between the start and end tags. In this case, the textual content is “This is a sentence.” HTML tags are also available for including audible content in the HTML document to specify information that is provided to a user in response to a query. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page. - Users that initiate a search query using their voice may not be in a position to experience or otherwise access search result responses in a visual format using their electronic device 120. For example, it would be difficult and dangerous for a user to look at a display screen on the electronic device 120 while driving a vehicle. Therefore, it is desirable for the search results to include an audible component that does not require the user to look at a screen. However, users also often want to receive a more extensive set of results in response to a search query should the audible component not be sufficient for the users' purposes.
-
FIG. 2 is aflowchart 200 of a method for providing a comprehensive set of search results to a user that includes audible components as well as textual components, using the search query environment ofFIG. 1 . A user initiates (204) asearch query application 110 on the user's electronic device 120. Thesearch query application 110 can be, for example, a voice search function that receives spoken search queries using themicrophone 102 of an internet enabled mobile phone device 120. The user then speaks a search query (208), having one or more search terms, into themicrophone 102 of the electronic device 120. Thesearch query application 110 receives the voice input query (212). Aspeech recognition application 110 running on the electronic device 120 converts (216) the voice input query into a textual representation, similarly as described previously herein. The textual representation of the voice input query is then transmitted (220) to thesearch system 104 using thenetwork 124. In an alternative implementation, the voice input query is transmitted to thesearch system 104 before the voice input query is converted to a textual representation, and a speech recognition application operating on thesearch system 104 converts the voice input query. - When the
search system 104 has the textual representation of the query, thesearch system 104 conducts a search (224). Thesearch system 104 conducts the search using an available search index to obtain at least one relevant search result based on the items in the textual representation of the voice input query. In some implementations, a list containing multiple relevant search results is compiled. Each search result includes several components. In some implementations, the search result includes a link to a web page, a first set of text excerpted from the web page and a second set of text. The second set of text has a complete sentence form, and is responsive to the voice input query. The link and first set of text does not necessarily provide the user with a complete response to the query. The link and first set of text, while relevant to the search query, often requires that the user, for example, click on the link to access information that could be a complete response to the initial query. - The data included in the search result for each of the components is acquired from the contents of the search index. The different components of the search result data can be acquired from a single index or multiple indexes. For example, the link to the web page and the first set of text excerpted from the web page can be acquired from one index, and the second set of text can be acquired from another index. In some implementations, the second set of text included in the search result is expected to be delivered as a complete sentence that is responsive to the query; rather than a result that requires a user to click on a link to acquire the answer to its query. Answers taking the form of a complete sentence, that is a complete answer to the query, are termed “onebox” results. In some implementations, the types of information in a onebox result include dictionary definitions, news, stock quotes, weather, or biographical information. In some implementations, onebox results are generated in an offline process and stored by the
search system 104 in a separate index. The onebox result can be acquired from a structured database maintained by thesearch system 104, where the result has a complete sentence form that can be acquired and/or generated from the database and is an answer responsive to the user query. In this implementation, thesearch system 104 obtains (232) a onebox result as the second set of text, and obtains (228) a web page link and text excerpted from the web page, as the first set of text. In some implementations, the first set of text may include a onebox result. - In some implementations, the
search system 104 accesses a single search index to obtain the link to the web page, the first set of text excerpted from the web page, and the second set of text, where each component is accessed in the same index. In some implementations, thesearch system 104 selects a portion of the first set of text, which thesearch system 104 recognizes as being a complete response, to be used as the second set of text in the search result. In some implementations, each component of the web page that has text that can be spoken includes HTML markup language that designates what should be used for generating an audible response. There are various ways that thesearch system 104 can choose which set of text to use as the audible response. For example, the text at the top of the web page, or the text located in a designated location can be chosen. In some implementations, the second set of text may not be extracted from the results, but rather may be synthesized based on a number of variables (e.g., words from the original search query, contextual data such time and location, etc.). - The
search system 104 then converts (236) the second set of text into data representing an audible version of the second set of text. The audible version of the second set of text can take on one of a variety of forms. In some implementations, the audible version of the second set of text is an audio file having one of a variety of available file formats, compressed or uncompressed, that permit the file to be stored on a computer system, e.g., a waveform audio file format (WAV), one of the various moving picture expert formats, such as MPEG, MP3, etc. The client device used to play the audio file would include a codec corresponding to the particular format of the audio file. The codec performs the encoding and decoding of the audio data in the audio file. The client devices typically have multiple codecs that support playing of audio files of different formats. In some implementations, an application or tool on a cloud-based server converts the second set of text into data representing an audible version of the second set of text. In some implementations, the application or tool on the cloud-based server converts the second set of text to an audio file. Cloud computing includes, generally speaking, a style of computing in which computing resources, e.g., application programs and file storage, are remotely provided over a network, e.g., over the internet. In some implementations, the resources are provided through a web browser. - In some implementations, the data representing the audible version of the second set of text is a hyperlink to a resource that can play an audio file containing the audible version of the second set of text. The resource can be, for example, a web server, a web page cloud server, or any other suitable server or service. In some implementations, the audible version of the text is a set of text that is marked to notify an application on the client device to convert the marked text to audio that is to be played for the user.
- The
search system 104 then generates (240) an electronic document, e.g., a HTML format document, which includes the link to the web page, the first set of text excerpted from the web page, and the data representing an audible version of the second set of text which is responsive to the voice input query. The following is an example of a portion of HTML code corresponding to data representing a hyperlink: -
- <audio src=“http://some.server.that.plays.audio/?text=the+text+to+speak” . . . >
where the ellipsis “ . . . ” after the audio tag (“<audio”) is meant to include other attributes that an audio tag may have. For example, audio tags may have the “autoplay” attribute, which instructs a browser to execute and play the audio as soon as the page is loaded by a user's electronic device, as shown by the following: - <audio src=“http://some.server.that.plays.audio/?text=the+text+to+speak” autoplay>
- <audio src=“http://some.server.that.plays.audio/?text=the+text+to+speak” . . . >
- The following is an example of a portion of HTML code corresponding to data representing an audio file:
-
- <audiosrc=“data:audio/mpeg;base64,//NIxAAdMUYOAHjGcYaQFwKMWOR5EY0MUEE WgMDA3r4cWEJ9EDi . . . ” autoplay>
where the ellipsis means the continuation of the encoded audio file, which can be encoded using base64-encoding.
- <audiosrc=“data:audio/mpeg;base64,//NIxAAdMUYOAHjGcYaQFwKMWOR5EY0MUEE WgMDA3r4cWEJ9EDi . . . ” autoplay>
- The following is an example of a portion of HTML code corresponding to data representing an audible version of the second set of text, where the data is text that a browser will convert to audio, and the HTML code includes a predefined HTML attribute to accomplish that conversion:
-
- <span PreDefAtt PreDefAtt-Txt=“the text to speak”> . . . </span>
where “PreDefAtt” and “PreDefAtt-Txt” are the predefined attributes and the browser of the user's electronic device is configured to recognize that the contents of attribute PreDefAtt-Txt are to be converted to audio, and then played. The attributes can be predefined by a system administrator and used to mark text in the HTML document that is to be converted to audio. The client device would be configured to recognize the predefined HTML tags. In some implementations, predefined attributes can be created such that when the electronic document is sent to the user's client device, the electronic document includes the second set of text within the body of the first set of text. The second set of text is tagged with the predefined attributes and the browser recognizes the attributes causing the browser to convert the second set of text to audio and play it. In some implementations, thesearch system 104 adds the predefined attributes, e.g., “PreDefAtt” and “PreDefAtt-Txt”, to the second set of text to convert the complete response of the second set of text to an audible version.
- <span PreDefAtt PreDefAtt-Txt=“the text to speak”> . . . </span>
- The following is an example of a portion of HTML code corresponding to data representing a link to the web page, first set of text excerpted from the web page, and data representing the audible version of the second set of text, where the second set of text has a complete sentence form, and is responsive to the voice input query:
-
- <span PreDefAtt PreDefAtt-Txt=“The empire state building is 381 meters tall”><ahref=“http://en.encyle/home/empire_state_building”>Encyclopedia—Empire State Building</a>—The Empire State Building is located in New York City . . . </span>
where “The Empire State Building is located in New York City . . . ” is the first set of text, “http://en.encyle/home/empire_state_building” is the link to the web page, and “The empire state building is 381 meters tall” is the data representing the audible version of the second set of text.
- <span PreDefAtt PreDefAtt-Txt=“The empire state building is 381 meters tall”><ahref=“http://en.encyle/home/empire_state_building”>Encyclopedia—Empire State Building</a>—The Empire State Building is located in New York City . . . </span>
- The
search system 104 then sends the electronic document (244) to the client device of the user for execution. In some implementations, the client device executes the electronic document and displays, on the device display, the link to the web page, the first set of text, the second set of text, and the client device also plays the audio file. In some implementations, the client device does not automatically play the audio file, but, rather, the client device displays an icon or piece of text corresponding to the data representing the audible version of the second set of text. The user can press a button or otherwise input a command to the electronic device, e.g., by clicking on the icon or text, to cause the device to play the audio. -
FIG. 3 is an example screen shot 300 of theelectronic device 120 a ofFIG. 1 providing information to a user. The screen shot depicts a search result provided to a user in response to the voice input query [“height of empire state building”]. The electronic document sent by thesearch system 104 to the clientelectronic device 120 a was executed by theelectronic device 120 a resulting in theelectronic device 120 a displaying a link to awebsite 304 and a first set oftext 308 excerpted from the website. The audio file included a second set of text having a complete sentence form [“The Empire State Building is 381 meters tall”] that is responsive to the voice input query. Theelectronic device 120 a automatically played theaudio file 312 whenaudio file 312 was executed by the client device. Aspeaker 316 located on theelectronic device 120 a is used to play the audio file. Because the result provided to the user included an audible version of text and thelink 304, the user is able to quickly and efficiently access additional information by, for example, tapping on thelink 304 with the user's finger if the audible version proved inadequate or if the user wants to access additional information. -

FIG. 6 is aflowchart 600 of a method for providing search results to a user that includes audible components as well as textual components, using the search query environment ofFIG. 1 . A user initiates (604) asearch query application 110 on the user's electronic device 120. Thesearch query application 110 can be, for example, a voice search function that receives spoken search queries using themicrophone 102 of an internet enabled mobile phone device 120. The user then speaks a search query (608), having one or more search terms, into themicrophone 102 of the electronic device 120. Thesearch query application 110 receives the voice input query (612). Aspeech recognition application 110 running on the electronic device 120 converts (616) the voice input query into a textual representation, similarly as described previously herein. The textual representation of the voice input query is then transmitted (620) to thesearch system 104 using thenetwork 124. - The electronic device 120 receives an electronic document (650) from the
search system 104. The electronic document includes one or more search results that are responsive to the voice input query. The electronic document can be, for example, a HTML format document, which includes the link to a web page for a search result, a first set of text excerpted from the web page, and data representing an audible version of a second set of text. The second set of text has a complete sentence form, and is responsive to the voice input query. The client device executes the electronic document (654). In some implementations, when the electronic document is executed, the client device displays the link to the web page (658), displays the first set of text (662), displays the second set of text (666), and/or plays an audible version of the second set of text (670). In some implementations, the client device does not automatically play the audio file, but, rather, the client device displays an icon or piece of text corresponding to the data representing the audible version of the second set of text. The user presses a button or otherwise inputs a command to the electronic device, e.g., by clicking on the icon or text, to cause the device to play the audio. -
FIG. 7 is aflowchart 700 of a method for providing search results to a user that includes audible components as well as textual components, using the search query environment ofFIG. 1 . Thesearch system 104 receives a textual representation of a voice input query (720). In an alternative implementation, the voice input query is transmitted to thesearch system 104 before the voice input query is converted to a textual representation, and a speech recognition application operating on thesearch system 104 converts the voice input query to a textual representation of the voice input query. - When the
search system 104 has the textual representation of the query, thesearch system 104 conducts a search (724). Thesearch system 104 conducts the search using, for example, an available search index to obtain at least one relevant search result based on the items in the textual representation of the voice input query. Each search result includes several components. In some implementations, the search result includes a link to a web page, a first set of text excerpted from the web page and a second set of text. The second set of text has a complete sentence form, and is responsive to the voice input query. The link and first set of text does not necessarily provide the user with a complete response to the query. The link and first set of text, while relevant to the search query, often requires that the user, for example, click on the link to access information that could be a complete response to the initial query. In some implementations, the search system obtains (732) a onebox result as the second set of text, and obtains (728) a web page link and text excerpted from the web page, as the first set of text. - The
search system 104 then converts (736) the second set of text into data representing an audible version of the second set of text. The audible version of the second set of text can take on one of a variety of forms. In some implementations, the audible version of the second set of text is an audio file. Thesearch system 104 then generates (740) an electronic document, e.g., a HTML format document, which includes the link to the web page, the first set of text excerpted from the web page, and the data representing an audible version of the second set of text which is responsive to the voice input query. The search system then sends (744) the electronic document to the client device for audible presentation of the audible version of the second set of text. - Method steps can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions of the disclosure by operating on input data and generating output. Method steps can also be performed by, and an apparatus can be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry.
