Definitions
- This specification relates to content summarization and, according to one particular implementation, relates to generating information about a term.
- information about a term can be extracted from various resources, and semantic relations between the term and the information about the term can be automatically determined through automated analysis of the resources.
- a structured template can be generated based on semantic relations, which provides a summary of descriptions about the term.
- Specific information in the template can be modified based on one or more characteristics of a user that queries for information about the term. When a user requests information about the term, the specific information in the template is presented to the user.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification includes a process for receiving a request for information about a term from a user; obtaining, at one or more processors, one or more characteristics of the user; obtaining, at the one or more processors, a template including one or more attributes associated with the term; generating, at the one or more processors and based on the one or more characteristics of the user, a response, the response including a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the template; and providing for output, data representing the response.
- one or more documents that include the term may be identified from a collection of documents.
- a respective description that has a semantic relation to the term may be identified for each of the one or more documents.
- a respective attribute for each respective description may be determined.
- a template from among a plurality of templates associated with the term may be selected based on the one or more characteristics of the user.
- a first description for a particular attribute of the one or more attributes may be obtained.
- a second description using the first description may be generated based on the one or more characteristics of the user.
- the response may be generated, where the response may include the second description for the particular attribute.
- one or more first words of the first description may be substituted by one or more second words.
- An attribute may be associated with attribute metadata.
- a description may be associated with description metadata.
- one or more attributes may be added to the template based on (i) attribute metadata of the one or more attributes and (ii) the one or more characteristics of the user.
- the one or more attributes may be added to the template in response to determining that the attribute metadata of the one or more attributes match the at least one characteristic.
- a particular attribute of the one or more attributes may be associated with a plurality of descriptions.
- a description may be selected from the plurality of descriptions for the particular attribute based on description metadata of the plurality of descriptions and the one or more characteristics of the user.
- the process may include receiving, from a second user, a second request for information about the term; obtaining one or more characteristics of the second user; obtaining a second template including one or more attributes associated with the term; generating, based on the one or more characteristics of the second user, a second response, the second response including a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the second template; and providing for output, data representing the second response.
- the second template for the second user may be different from the template for the user.
- Information about a term can be automatically generated based on semantic relations between the term and information about the term.
- a template for generating the information can be highly customizable based on a selection of the desirable semantic relations.
- Information in the template can be modified based on characteristics of a user, which may provide a more relevant and personalized response to the user.
- the template can be easily applied to other languages because semantic relations between the term and information about the term do not change across different languages.
- Information about a term that does not have a dictionary meaning can be derived based on semantic relations with other known terms.
- the present specification describes techniques of generating customized and/or personalized descriptions of terms based on certain characteristics of a user submitting a query. It is common for users to have different levels of reading proficiency and different interests. For example, if a user is a child, it might be desirable to simplify concepts and vocabulary. If a user is a non-native speaker, it might be possible to communicate complicated concepts but still use a simplified vocabulary. If a user is a botanist submitting a query about plants, the response can focus more on plant-aspects of the concept, where applicable. These are just a few examples of how responses can be customized based on user background and interest.
- FIG. 1 A is a block diagram that illustrates an example system 100 for generating a dynamic summary.
- a user may make a request, e.g., a voice or text query, to obtain a summary of descriptions about a term that interests the user. Based on characteristics of the user, a response that includes a dynamically generated summary of descriptions about the term is provided to the user.
- a term may be one or more words, phrases, names, signs, or any other forms of data where semantic relations may be established between the term and one or more other terms.
- the system 100 includes a user device 106, a network 102, resources 105, a search system 110, a resource index store 112, a search history store 119, a semantics data store 136, and a profile data store 138.
- the user device 106 can be, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, a tablet computer, a wearable computer, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a music player, an e-book reader, a navigation system, a multimodal device such as a wearable computing device, a hybrid gesture recognition/speech recognition system, an automobile information system, a generic home entertainment system, and other appropriate computing device that can send and receive data over the network 102.
- the functions performed by the user system 106 can be performed by individual computer systems or can be distributed across multiple computer systems.
- the user device 106 may include a user application, e.g., a browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
- the browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, audio, music and other information typically included in a resource that is accessible over the network 102.
- the network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects resources 105, the user device 106, and the search system 110.
- the system 100 may include many thousands of resources 105 and user devices 106.
- the search system 110 may also connect with one or more of the resource index store 112, the search history store 119, the semantics data store 136, and the profile data store 138 using the network 102.
- Resources 105 may be any data accessible over the network 102.
- the resources 105 may be HTML pages, electronic documents, images files, video files, audio files, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- the resources 105 may include embedded information, e.g., meta information and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions, e.g., client-side scripts.
- a resource 105 may have a resource address, e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL).
- URL uniform resource locator
- the search system 110 includes a semantics processing engine 128 and a summary engine 130.
- the search system 110 receives a search request 109 from the user device 106, and provides a response 111 that includes relevant information responsive to the request 109.
- the request 109 may include a request for a summary of descriptions about a term
- the relevant information in the response 111 may include a dynamically generated summary for the term.
- the semantics processing engine 128 processes the resources 105 to determine semantic relations for terms.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine a semantic relation between a first term and a second term. For example, the semantics processing engine 128 may determine whether the first term is any one of a homonym, a synonym, an antonym, a hypernym, a hyponym, a meronym, a metonym, a holonym, or a paronym of the second term.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine a semantic relation between a term and a category.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine whether the term is a color, a species, a number, a place, an action, or any other categories.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may store the semantic relations of a term in the semantics data store 136.
- Figure 1 D provides more detailed descriptions for the determinations of semantic relations for terms.
- the summary engine 130 generates a summary of descriptions about a term for a user making the request 109.
- Figures 1 B and 1C provide more detailed descriptions on the generation of the summary.
- the summary engine 130 includes a template engine 132 and a content engine 134.
- the template engine 132 determines a template for generating the summary.
- a template includes one or more attributes associated with the term.
- An example of an attribute may be a semantic relation between the term and a description of the attribute.
- the template engine 132 may access a template from the template store 140 based on the term. In some implementations, the template engine 132 may access and/or modify a template from the template store 140 based on the search history of the user. In some implementations, the template engine 132 may access and/or modify a template based on the characteristics of the user. In some implementations, the template engine 132 may generate a template based on semantic relations associated with the term. In some implementations, the template engine 132 may store a template in the template store 140.
- the content engine 134 generates content to be included in the template. For example, the content engine 134 may generate a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the template. In some implementations, the content engine 134 may access content from the semantics data store 136. For example, an attribute in the template provided by the template engine 132 may specify a semantic relation between the term and a description stored in the semantics data store 136. The content engine 134 may access the description based on the specified semantic relation.
- the content engine 134 may revise content associated with the term based on a characteristic of the user. For example, if the user is a child, the content engine 134 may revise a description to include easier explanations that represent the description.
- the search history store 119 stores data from and related to previous search requests associated with users.
- the search history store 119 includes the query logs 116 and the selection logs 118.
- the search query logs 116 store search requests 109 submitted from user devices 106.
- the selection logs 118 store data referencing actions taken responsive to search results provided by the search system 110.
- the search system 110 may use the selection logs 118 and query logs 116 to determine the respective sequences of requests 109 submitted by the user devices 106, and the actions taken in response to the requests 109.
- the search system 110 may identify the resources by crawling and indexing the resources 105.
- the index data may be stored in a resource index 112.
- the search system 110 may use the resource index 112 to identify resources 105 that are responsive to the search request.
- the semantics data store 136 stores data representing attributes and descriptions associated with a term.
- an attribute may be a semantic relation between a term and a related description.
- an attribute for a term “X” may be "X is a type of Y,” indicating that the term “X” is a hyponym of a description "Y.”
- another attribute for the term “X” may be "X is Z,” indicating that the term “X” is a synonym of a description "Z.”
- another attribute for the term “X” may be "scholar articles about X can be found in K,” indicating that the term "X” is in a category “scholar articles.”
- the semantics data store 136 may store attribute metadata that are associated with an attribute. For example, for the attribute "X is a type of Y,” a corresponding attribute metadata “Semantics” may include a value “Hyponym.” As another example, for the attribute “scholar articles about X can be found in K,” a corresponding attribute metadata “Education Level” may include a value of "University.”
- the semantics data store 136 may store description metadata that are associated with a description. For example, for the description "fish” in the attribute “shark is a type of fish,” a corresponding description metadata “age group” may include a value “all.” As another example, for the description “Journal of Marine Biology” in the attribute “scholar articles about sharks can be found in the Journal of Marine Biology,” a corresponding attribute metadata "age group” may include a value of "eighteen and above.”
- the profile data store 138 stores data representing one or more characteristics of users operating user devices 106. Examples of characteristics may include an age or an age group of the user, an education level of the user, an interest of the user, a gender of the user, an activity history of the user, or any other characteristics of the user. In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information, or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and stored in the profile data store 138.
- the template store 140 stores templates for generating a summary.
- a template may be manually generated and then stored to allow access by the template engine 132.
- a template may be automatically generated by the template engine 132 or another engine.
- a template may be associated with a particular term. For example, a specific template may be created for the term "shark.”
- a template may be associated with terms belonging to a group. For example, a specific template may be created for the group "marine animals” that can be used for the terms “shark,” “fish,” “turtle,” or any other terms that satisfy the definition of this group.
- a template may be associated with a user characteristic. For example, a specific template may be created for the age group "kids" that can be used when the requester's age satisfies the definition of this age group.
- FIG. 1 B illustrates an example system 100 for generating a dynamic summary for a user of a user device 106a, including an example flow of data shown in stages (A) to (E). Stages (A) to (E) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. In some implementations, one or more of the stages (A) to (E) may occur offline, where the search system 110 may perform computations when the user device 106a is not connected to the network 102.
- a first user operating a user device 106a submits a request 109a "I would like some descriptions about sharks" to the search system 110.
- the search system 110 may parse the request to determine that the first user is interested in a summary of descriptions about the term "shark” before sending the term to the summary engine 130.
- the template engine 132 obtains a template for the first user.
- the template store 140 stores a specific template for the term "shark” that has been previously generated, the template engine 132 may obtain the specific template.
- the template engine 132 may obtain a generic template that is associated with any term.
- the template engine 132 obtains a template for "marine animals” that includes attributes "X are a group of Y” and "X have Z,” where X is the term, and Y and Z are the descriptions stored in the semantics data store 136.
- the template engine 132 may identify one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the characteristics of the first user may be transmitted by the user device 106 in the request 109a. As another example, the template engine 132 may obtain the characteristics of the first user from the profile data store 138. In this example, the template engine 132 identifies that the occupation of the first user is a marine biologist.
- the template engine 132 may add, substitute, or remove one or more attributes in the template based on the characteristics of the user.
- the template engine 132 identifies that the occupation of the first user is a marine biologist, and adds an attribute "scholar articles about X can be found in K" because the education background of the first user satisfies the attribute metadata "Education Level.”
- stage (C) the template engine 132 transmits the generated template to the content engine 134.
- the content engine 134 identifies a respective description for each of the attributes in the template.
- the content engine 134 identifies a description for an attribute from the semantics data store 136. For example, for an attribute "X are a group of Y,” the semantic distance between X and Y may be specified by the corresponding semantic relation. The content engine 134 may obtain the description Y for the attribute "shark is Y" based on the specified semantic distance.
- the content engine 134 identifies the descriptions that correspond to the attributes in the template: "Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton," “Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head,” and “Scholar articles on sharks can be found in Journal of Marine Biology.”
- the content engine 134 may modify one or more of the descriptions based on the description metadata of the descriptions and the characteristics of the user. Here, the content engine 134 determines not to modify the descriptions because the education level of the first user satisfies the values in the description metadata. In some implementations, the content engine 134 aggregates these descriptions and generate a summary for the term "shark.”
- the content engine 134 transmits data including the dynamically generated summary 111 a of the term "shark" to the user device 106a.
- the data may further include data representing one or more resources 105 that are responsive to the request, such as titles, snippets of text extracted from the resources, and resource locators for the resources.
- FIG. 1C illustrates an example system 100 for generating a dynamic summary for another user of a user device 106b, including an example flow of data shown in stages (F) to (J). Stages (F) to (J) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. In some implementations, one or more of the stages (F) to (J) may occur offline, where the search system 110 may perform computations when the user device 106b is not connected to the network 102.
- a second user operating a user device 106b submits a request 109b "What are sharks?" to the search system 110.
- the search system 110 may parse the request to determine that the second user is interested in a summary of descriptions about the term "shark" before sending the term to the summary engine 130.
- the template engine 132 obtains a template for the second user.
- the template engine 132 obtains a template for "marine animals” that includes attributes "X are a group of Y" and "X have Z,” where X is the term, and Y and Z are the descriptions stored in the semantics data store 136.
- the template engine 132 then identifies one or more characteristics of the second user, where the age group of the second user is a child.
- the template engine 132 may add, substitute, or remove one or more attributes in the template based on the characteristics of the user.
- the template engine 132 identifies that the second user may be a child, and adds an attribute "The color of X is K" because the age group of the second user satisfies the attribute metadata "age group.”
- stage (H) the template engine 132 transmits the generated template to the content engine 134.
- the content engine 134 identifies a respective description for each of the attributes in the template.
- the content engine 134 identifies there descriptions that correspond to the attributes in the template: "Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton," “Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head,” and "The color of sharks is gray.”
- the content engine 134 may modify one or more of the descriptions based on the description metadata of the descriptions and the characteristics of the user.
- the content engine 134 determines to revise the description "sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton" because the age group of the second user does not satisfy a value in the description metadata.
- the content engine 134 modifies the description to "Sharks are a group of fish whose bodies are largely made of cartilage.”
- the content engine 134 determines to revise the description "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head” because the age group of the second user does not satisfy a value in the description metadata.
- the content engine 134 modifies the descriptions to "Sharks have five to seven openings on the sides of the head.” The content engine 134 determines not to revise the description "The color of sharks is gray” because the age group of the second user satisfies a value in the description metadata. The content engine 134 then aggregates these revised descriptions and generates a summary for the term "shark" for the second user.
- the content engine 134 transmits data including the dynamically generated summary of the term "shark" to the user device 106b.
- the data may further include data representing one or more resources 105 that are responsive to the request, such as titles, snippets of text extracted from the resources, and resource locators for the resources.
- FIG. 1 D illustrates an example system 100 for determining semantic relations. Note that the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to the example given here, as there may be other suitable systems and methods for determining semantic relations which can be applied to the application of this disclosure.
- the search system 110 may crawl and index the resources 105a-n.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine semantic relations for words in the resources 105a-n.
- a resource 105a may include a phrase "a king is a male.”
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine the semantic relation between the words "king" and "male” by mapping each word to corresponding vectors 141 and 142 in a semantics vector space 139.
- the semantics vector space 139 may be an n -dimensional vector space, where n may be any positive integer.
- the semantics processing engine 128, or another engine may calculate a cosine distance between the vectors 141 and 142.
- the cosine distance between the vectors 141 and 142 may be used to establish the semantic relation between the words "king" and "male.”
- the semantics processing engine 128 may designate this cosine distance as the cosine distance corresponding to an attribute "hyponym" ("X is Y.") for a term X.
- a different resource 105b may include a phrase "a queen is a female.”
- the semantics processing engine 128 may map the terms "queen” and "female” to vectors 143 and 144 in the semantics vector space 139.

- a resource 105d may include a phrase "a gray elephant is in the mammal family.”
- the semantics processing engine 128 may map the terms "elephant” and “gray” to vectors 147 and 148 in the semantics vector space 139.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine that a cosine distance between the vectors 147 and 148 is equal to the cosine distance between the vectors 145 and 146. In response to determining that the cosine distance between the vectors 147 and 148 is equal to the cosine distance between the vectors 145 and 146, the semantics processing engine 128 may determine that the term "gray" is a color of the term "elephant.”
- the semantics processing engine 128 may also map the term "mammal" to a vector 149 in the semantics vector space 139.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine that a cosine distance between the vectors 147 and 149, and designate this cosine distance as corresponding to an attribute "family.”
- the semantics processing engine 128 may assign one or more values to attribute metadata of an attribute. In some implementations, the semantics processing engine 128 may assign one or more values to description metadata of a description. In some implementations, the semantics processing engine 128 may store the attribute metadata, the description metadata, and the data corresponding to the vectors in the semantics vector space 139 in the semantics data store 136.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram that illustrates an example process 200 for generating a dynamic summary.
- the process 200 may be performed by a system, such as the search system 120 described above or by other systems, including combinations of multiple computing systems.
- the system receives a request for information about a term from a user (202). For example, a first user operating a user device 106a may submit a request 109a "I would like some descriptions about sharks" to the search system 110.

- the template engine 132 may obtain a template for "marine animals" that includes attributes "X are a group of Y" and "X have Z,” where X is the term, and Y and Z are the descriptions stored in the semantics data store 136.
- the system may identify, from a collection of documents, one or more documents that include the term.
- the term “shark” may be included in a resource 105.
- the system may identify, for each of the one or more documents, a respective description that has a semantic relation to the term.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may identify that the resource 105 includes a phrase "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head," and may determine that the phrase "five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head” is a description.
- the system may determine a respective attribute for each respective description.
- the semantics processing engine 128 may determine that "X have Z" is an attribute associated with the term “shark” and the description "five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head.”
- the system may select a template from among a plurality of templates associated with the term based on the one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the template engine 132 may obtain a template for the first user in response determining that the first user is a marine biologist.
- an attribute is associated with attribute metadata
- a description is associated with description metadata.
- an associated attribute metadata may be "hyponym.”
- an associated description metadata may be "high school education.”
- the system may add one or more attributes to the template based on (i) attribute metadata of the one or more attributes and (ii) the one or more characteristics of the user. In some implementations, the system may add the one or more attributes to the template in response to determining that the attribute metadata of the one or more attributes match the at least one characteristic. For example, the template engine 132 may identify that the occupation of the first user is a marine biologist, and may add an attribute "scholar articles about X can be found in K" to the template because the education background of the first user satisfies the attribute metadata "Education Level.”

characteristics of the user; obtaining, at the one or more processors, a template including a plurality of attributes associated with the term; generating, at the one or more processors and based on the one or more characteristics of the user, a response, the response including a respective description for each attribute of the plurality of attributes in the template; and providing for output, data representing the response.
Description
- This specification relates to content summarization and, according to one particular implementation, relates to generating information about a term.
- Although online dictionaries exist, manual curation of these dictionaries is painstaking, and makes updates costly and infrequent.
- According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification, information about a term can be extracted from various resources, and semantic relations between the term and the information about the term can be automatically determined through automated analysis of the resources. A structured template can be generated based on semantic relations, which provides a summary of descriptions about the term. Specific information in the template can be modified based on one or more characteristics of a user that queries for information about the term. When a user requests information about the term, the specific information in the template is presented to the user.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification includes a process for receiving a request for information about a term from a user; obtaining, at one or more processors, one or more characteristics of the user; obtaining, at the one or more processors, a template including one or more attributes associated with the term; generating, at the one or more processors and based on the one or more characteristics of the user, a response, the response including a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the template; and providing for output, data representing the response.
- These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For example, to obtain the template including the one or more attributes associated with the term, one or more documents that include the term may be identified from a collection of documents. A respective description that has a semantic relation to the term may be identified for each of the one or more documents. A respective attribute for each respective description may be determined.
- To obtain the template including the one or more attributes associated with the term, a template from among a plurality of templates associated with the term may be selected based on the one or more characteristics of the user.
- To generate the response, a first description for a particular attribute of the one or more attributes may be obtained. A second description using the first description may be generated based on the one or more characteristics of the user. The response may be generated, where the response may include the second description for the particular attribute. To generate the second description using the first description, one or more first words of the first description may be substituted by one or more second words.
- An attribute may be associated with attribute metadata. A description may be associated with description metadata. To obtain the template, one or more attributes may be added to the template based on (i) attribute metadata of the one or more attributes and (ii) the one or more characteristics of the user. To add the one or more attributes to the template, the one or more attributes may be added to the template in response to determining that the attribute metadata of the one or more attributes match the at least one characteristic.
- A particular attribute of the one or more attributes may be associated with a plurality of descriptions. To generate the response, a description may be selected from the plurality of descriptions for the particular attribute based on description metadata of the plurality of descriptions and the one or more characteristics of the user.
- The process may include receiving, from a second user, a second request for information about the term; obtaining one or more characteristics of the second user; obtaining a second template including one or more attributes associated with the term; generating, based on the one or more characteristics of the second user, a second response, the second response including a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the second template; and providing for output, data representing the second response. The second template for the second user may be different from the template for the user.
- Advantageous implementations may include one or more of the following features. Information about a term can be automatically generated based on semantic relations between the term and information about the term. A template for generating the information can be highly customizable based on a selection of the desirable semantic relations. Information in the template can be modified based on characteristics of a user, which may provide a more relevant and personalized response to the user. The template can be easily applied to other languages because semantic relations between the term and information about the term do not change across different languages. Information about a term that does not have a dictionary meaning can be derived based on semantic relations with other known terms.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Current online dictionaries are one-size-fits-all endeavors. These dictionaries typically do not know what prior knowledge a user has, and while there are manually curated dictionaries for different audiences, e.g., children's dictionaries, college dictionaries, scientific dictionaries, such dictionaries typically are not personalized for a particular user.
- To address this deficiency, the present specification describes techniques of generating customized and/or personalized descriptions of terms based on certain characteristics of a user submitting a query. It is common for users to have different levels of reading proficiency and different interests. For example, if a user is a child, it might be desirable to simplify concepts and vocabulary. If a user is a non-native speaker, it might be possible to communicate complicated concepts but still use a simplified vocabulary. If a user is a botanist submitting a query about plants, the response can focus more on plant-aspects of the concept, where applicable. These are just a few examples of how responses can be customized based on user background and interest.

FIG. 1 A is a block diagram that illustrates anexample system 100 for generating a dynamic summary. Briefly, a user may make a request, e.g., a voice or text query, to obtain a summary of descriptions about a term that interests the user. Based on characteristics of the user, a response that includes a dynamically generated summary of descriptions about the term is provided to the user. A term may be one or more words, phrases, names, signs, or any other forms of data where semantic relations may be established between the term and one or more other terms. Thesystem 100 includes auser device 106, anetwork 102,resources 105, asearch system 110, aresource index store 112, asearch history store 119, asemantics data store 136, and a profile data store 138. - The
user device 106 can be, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, a tablet computer, a wearable computer, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a music player, an e-book reader, a navigation system, a multimodal device such as a wearable computing device, a hybrid gesture recognition/speech recognition system, an automobile information system, a generic home entertainment system, and other appropriate computing device that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. The functions performed by theuser system 106 can be performed by individual computer systems or can be distributed across multiple computer systems. Theuser device 106 may include a user application, e.g., a browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, audio, music and other information typically included in a resource that is accessible over thenetwork 102. - The
network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectsresources 105, theuser device 106, and thesearch system 110. Thesystem 100 may include many thousands ofresources 105 anduser devices 106. Although not shown inFIG. 1 A , thesearch system 110 may also connect with one or more of theresource index store 112, thesearch history store 119, thesemantics data store 136, and the profile data store 138 using thenetwork 102. -
Resources 105 may be any data accessible over thenetwork 102. For example, theresources 105 may be HTML pages, electronic documents, images files, video files, audio files, and feed sources, to name just a few. In some implementations, theresources 105 may include embedded information, e.g., meta information and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions, e.g., client-side scripts. In some implementations, aresource 105 may have a resource address, e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL). - The
search system 110 includes asemantics processing engine 128 and asummary engine 130. In general, thesearch system 110 receives asearch request 109 from theuser device 106, and provides aresponse 111 that includes relevant information responsive to therequest 109. In some implementations, therequest 109 may include a request for a summary of descriptions about a term, and the relevant information in theresponse 111 may include a dynamically generated summary for the term. - In general, the
semantics processing engine 128 processes theresources 105 to determine semantic relations for terms. In some implementations, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine a semantic relation between a first term and a second term. For example, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine whether the first term is any one of a homonym, a synonym, an antonym, a hypernym, a hyponym, a meronym, a metonym, a holonym, or a paronym of the second term. In some implementations, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine a semantic relation between a term and a category. For example, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine whether the term is a color, a species, a number, a place, an action, or any other categories. In some implementations, thesemantics processing engine 128 may store the semantic relations of a term in thesemantics data store 136.Figure 1 D provides more detailed descriptions for the determinations of semantic relations for terms. - In general, the
summary engine 130 generates a summary of descriptions about a term for a user making therequest 109.Figures 1 B and1C provide more detailed descriptions on the generation of the summary. Thesummary engine 130 includes atemplate engine 132 and acontent engine 134. Thetemplate engine 132 determines a template for generating the summary. A template includes one or more attributes associated with the term. An example of an attribute may be a semantic relation between the term and a description of the attribute. - In some implementations, the
template engine 132 may access a template from thetemplate store 140 based on the term. In some implementations, thetemplate engine 132 may access and/or modify a template from thetemplate store 140 based on the search history of the user. In some implementations, thetemplate engine 132 may access and/or modify a template based on the characteristics of the user. In some implementations, thetemplate engine 132 may generate a template based on semantic relations associated with the term. In some implementations, thetemplate engine 132 may store a template in thetemplate store 140. - The
content engine 134 generates content to be included in the template. For example, thecontent engine 134 may generate a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the template. In some implementations, thecontent engine 134 may access content from thesemantics data store 136. For example, an attribute in the template provided by thetemplate engine 132 may specify a semantic relation between the term and a description stored in thesemantics data store 136. Thecontent engine 134 may access the description based on the specified semantic relation. - In some implementations, the
content engine 134 may revise content associated with the term based on a characteristic of the user. For example, if the user is a child, thecontent engine 134 may revise a description to include easier explanations that represent the description. - In general, the
search history store 119 stores data from and related to previous search requests associated with users. Thesearch history store 119 includes the query logs 116 and the selection logs 118. The search query logs 116 store search requests 109 submitted fromuser devices 106. The selection logs 118 store data referencing actions taken responsive to search results provided by thesearch system 110. In some implementations, thesearch system 110 may use the selection logs 118 and querylogs 116 to determine the respective sequences ofrequests 109 submitted by theuser devices 106, and the actions taken in response to therequests 109. - In some implementations, to facilitate searching of the
resources 105, thesearch system 110 may identify the resources by crawling and indexing theresources 105. The index data may be stored in aresource index 112. In response to a search request received from theuser device 106, thesearch system 110 may use theresource index 112 to identifyresources 105 that are responsive to the search request. - In general, the
semantics data store 136 stores data representing attributes and descriptions associated with a term. In some implementations, an attribute may be a semantic relation between a term and a related description. For example, an attribute for a term "X" may be "X is a type of Y," indicating that the term "X" is a hyponym of a description "Y." As another example, another attribute for the term "X" may be "X is Z," indicating that the term "X" is a synonym of a description "Z." As another example, another attribute for the term "X" may be "scholar articles about X can be found in K," indicating that the term "X" is in a category "scholar articles." - In some implementations, the
semantics data store 136 may store attribute metadata that are associated with an attribute. For example, for the attribute "X is a type of Y," a corresponding attribute metadata "Semantics" may include a value "Hyponym." As another example, for the attribute "scholar articles about X can be found in K," a corresponding attribute metadata "Education Level" may include a value of "University." - In some implementations, the
semantics data store 136 may store description metadata that are associated with a description. For example, for the description "fish" in the attribute "shark is a type of fish," a corresponding description metadata "age group" may include a value "all." As another example, for the description "Journal of Marine Biology" in the attribute "scholar articles about sharks can be found in the Journal of Marine Biology," a corresponding attribute metadata "age group" may include a value of "eighteen and above." - In general, the profile data store 138 stores data representing one or more characteristics of users operating
user devices 106. Examples of characteristics may include an age or an age group of the user, an education level of the user, an interest of the user, a gender of the user, an activity history of the user, or any other characteristics of the user. In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information, or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and stored in the profile data store 138. - In general, the
template store 140 stores templates for generating a summary. In some implementations, a template may be manually generated and then stored to allow access by thetemplate engine 132. In some implementations, a template may be automatically generated by thetemplate engine 132 or another engine. In some implementations, a template may be associated with a particular term. For example, a specific template may be created for the term "shark." In some implementations, a template may be associated with terms belonging to a group. For example, a specific template may be created for the group "marine animals" that can be used for the terms "shark," "fish," "turtle," or any other terms that satisfy the definition of this group. In some implementations, a template may be associated with a user characteristic. For example, a specific template may be created for the age group "kids" that can be used when the requester's age satisfies the definition of this age group. -
FIG. 1 B illustrates anexample system 100 for generating a dynamic summary for a user of auser device 106a, including an example flow of data shown in stages (A) to (E). Stages (A) to (E) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. In some implementations, one or more of the stages (A) to (E) may occur offline, where thesearch system 110 may perform computations when theuser device 106a is not connected to thenetwork 102. - During stage (A), a first user operating a
user device 106a submits arequest 109a "I would like some descriptions about sharks" to thesearch system 110. In some implementations, thesearch system 110 may parse the request to determine that the first user is interested in a summary of descriptions about the term "shark" before sending the term to thesummary engine 130. - During stage (B), the
template engine 132 obtains a template for the first user. In some implementations, if thetemplate store 140 stores a specific template for the term "shark" that has been previously generated, thetemplate engine 132 may obtain the specific template. In some other implementations, if thetemplate store 140 does not store a specific template for the term "shark", thetemplate engine 132 may obtain a generic template that is associated with any term. Here, thetemplate engine 132 obtains a template for "marine animals" that includes attributes "X are a group of Y" and "X have Z," where X is the term, and Y and Z are the descriptions stored in thesemantics data store 136. - In some implementations, the
template engine 132 may identify one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the characteristics of the first user may be transmitted by theuser device 106 in therequest 109a. As another example, thetemplate engine 132 may obtain the characteristics of the first user from the profile data store 138. In this example, thetemplate engine 132 identifies that the occupation of the first user is a marine biologist. - In some implementations, the
template engine 132 may add, substitute, or remove one or more attributes in the template based on the characteristics of the user. Here, thetemplate engine 132 identifies that the occupation of the first user is a marine biologist, and adds an attribute "scholar articles about X can be found in K" because the education background of the first user satisfies the attribute metadata "Education Level." - During stage (C), the
template engine 132 transmits the generated template to thecontent engine 134. - During stage (D), the
content engine 134 identifies a respective description for each of the attributes in the template. In some implementations, thecontent engine 134 identifies a description for an attribute from thesemantics data store 136. For example, for an attribute "X are a group of Y," the semantic distance between X and Y may be specified by the corresponding semantic relation. Thecontent engine 134 may obtain the description Y for the attribute "shark is Y" based on the specified semantic distance. Here, thecontent engine 134 identifies the descriptions that correspond to the attributes in the template: "Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton," "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head," and "Scholar articles on sharks can be found in Journal of Marine Biology." - In some implementations, the
content engine 134 may modify one or more of the descriptions based on the description metadata of the descriptions and the characteristics of the user. Here, thecontent engine 134 determines not to modify the descriptions because the education level of the first user satisfies the values in the description metadata. In some implementations, thecontent engine 134 aggregates these descriptions and generate a summary for the term "shark." - During stage (E), the
content engine 134 transmits data including the dynamically generatedsummary 111 a of the term "shark" to theuser device 106a. In some implementations, the data may further include data representing one ormore resources 105 that are responsive to the request, such as titles, snippets of text extracted from the resources, and resource locators for the resources. -
FIG. 1C illustrates anexample system 100 for generating a dynamic summary for another user of auser device 106b, including an example flow of data shown in stages (F) to (J). Stages (F) to (J) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. In some implementations, one or more of the stages (F) to (J) may occur offline, where thesearch system 110 may perform computations when theuser device 106b is not connected to thenetwork 102. - During stage (F), a second user operating a
user device 106b submits arequest 109b "What are sharks?" to thesearch system 110. In some implementations, thesearch system 110 may parse the request to determine that the second user is interested in a summary of descriptions about the term "shark" before sending the term to thesummary engine 130. - During stage (G), the
template engine 132 obtains a template for the second user. Here, thetemplate engine 132 obtains a template for "marine animals" that includes attributes "X are a group of Y" and "X have Z," where X is the term, and Y and Z are the descriptions stored in thesemantics data store 136. - In this example, the
template engine 132 then identifies one or more characteristics of the second user, where the age group of the second user is a child. In some implementations, thetemplate engine 132 may add, substitute, or remove one or more attributes in the template based on the characteristics of the user. Here, thetemplate engine 132 identifies that the second user may be a child, and adds an attribute "The color of X is K" because the age group of the second user satisfies the attribute metadata "age group." - During stage (H), the
template engine 132 transmits the generated template to thecontent engine 134. - During stage (I), the
content engine 134 identifies a respective description for each of the attributes in the template. Here, thecontent engine 134 identifies there descriptions that correspond to the attributes in the template: "Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton," "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head," and "The color of sharks is gray." - In some implementations, the
content engine 134 may modify one or more of the descriptions based on the description metadata of the descriptions and the characteristics of the user. Here, thecontent engine 134 determines to revise the description "sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton" because the age group of the second user does not satisfy a value in the description metadata. Thecontent engine 134 modifies the description to "Sharks are a group of fish whose bodies are largely made of cartilage." Similarly, thecontent engine 134 determines to revise the description "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head" because the age group of the second user does not satisfy a value in the description metadata. Thecontent engine 134 modifies the descriptions to "Sharks have five to seven openings on the sides of the head." Thecontent engine 134 determines not to revise the description "The color of sharks is gray" because the age group of the second user satisfies a value in the description metadata. Thecontent engine 134 then aggregates these revised descriptions and generates a summary for the term "shark" for the second user. - During stage (J), the
content engine 134 transmits data including the dynamically generated summary of the term "shark" to theuser device 106b. In some implementations, the data may further include data representing one ormore resources 105 that are responsive to the request, such as titles, snippets of text extracted from the resources, and resource locators for the resources. -
FIG. 1 D illustrates anexample system 100 for determining semantic relations. Note that the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to the example given here, as there may be other suitable systems and methods for determining semantic relations which can be applied to the application of this disclosure. - In some implementations, the
search system 110 may crawl and index theresources 105a-n. During crawling, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine semantic relations for words in theresources 105a-n. For example, aresource 105a may include a phrase "a king is a male." Thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine the semantic relation between the words "king" and "male" by mapping each word to correspondingvectors 141 and 142 in asemantics vector space 139. Thesemantics vector space 139 may be an n-dimensional vector space, where n may be any positive integer. In some implementations, thesemantics processing engine 128, or another engine, may calculate a cosine distance between thevectors 141 and 142. The cosine distance between thevectors 141 and 142 may be used to establish the semantic relation between the words "king" and "male." - In some implementations, the
semantics processing engine 128 may designate this cosine distance as the cosine distance corresponding to an attribute "hyponym" ("X is Y.") for a term X. A different resource 105b may include a phrase "a queen is a female." Thesemantics processing engine 128 may map the terms "queen" and "female" tovectors 143 and 144 in thesemantics vector space 139. Thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that a cosine distance between thevectors 143 and 144 is equal to the cosine distance between thevectors 141 and 142. In response to determining that the cosine distance between thevectors 143 and 144 is equal to the cosine distance between thevectors 141 and 142, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that the term "queen" is a hyponym of the term "female." - As another example, a resource 105c may include a phrase "the color of a unicorn is white." The
semantics processing engine 128 may map the terms "unicorn" and "white" tovectors semantics vector space 139. Thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that a cosine distance between thevectors semantics processing engine 128 may map the terms "elephant" and "gray" tovectors semantics vector space 139. Thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that a cosine distance between thevectors vectors vectors vectors semantics processing engine 128 may determine that the term "gray" is a color of the term "elephant." - The
semantics processing engine 128 may also map the term "mammal" to avector 149 in thesemantics vector space 139. Thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that a cosine distance between thevectors - In some implementations, the
semantics processing engine 128 may assign one or more values to attribute metadata of an attribute. In some implementations, thesemantics processing engine 128 may assign one or more values to description metadata of a description. In some implementations, thesemantics processing engine 128 may store the attribute metadata, the description metadata, and the data corresponding to the vectors in thesemantics vector space 139 in thesemantics data store 136. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram that illustrates anexample process 200 for generating a dynamic summary. Theprocess 200 may be performed by a system, such as the search system 120 described above or by other systems, including combinations of multiple computing systems. - The system receives a request for information about a term from a user (202). For example, a first user operating a
user device 106a may submit arequest 109a "I would like some descriptions about sharks" to thesearch system 110. - The system obtains one or more characteristics of the user (204). For example, the characteristics of the first user may be transmitted by the
user device 106 in therequest 109a. As another example, thetemplate engine 132 may obtain the characteristics of the first user from the profile data store 138. - The system obtains a template associated with the term (206). For example, the
template engine 132 may obtain a template for "marine animals" that includes attributes "X are a group of Y" and "X have Z," where X is the term, and Y and Z are the descriptions stored in thesemantics data store 136. - In some implementations, the system may identify, from a collection of documents, one or more documents that include the term. For example, the term "shark" may be included in a
resource 105. The system may identify, for each of the one or more documents, a respective description that has a semantic relation to the term. For example, thesemantics processing engine 128 may identify that theresource 105 includes a phrase "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head," and may determine that the phrase "five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head" is a description. The system may determine a respective attribute for each respective description. For example, thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that "X have Z" is an attribute associated with the term "shark" and the description "five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head." - In some implementations, the system may select a template from among a plurality of templates associated with the term based on the one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the
template engine 132 may obtain a template for the first user in response determining that the first user is a marine biologist. - In some implementations, an attribute is associated with attribute metadata, and a description is associated with description metadata. For example, For example, for an attribute "X is a type of Y," an associated attribute metadata may be "hyponym." As another example, for the description "a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton" an associated description metadata may be "high school education."
- In some implementations, the system may add one or more attributes to the template based on (i) attribute metadata of the one or more attributes and (ii) the one or more characteristics of the user. In some implementations, the system may add the one or more attributes to the template in response to determining that the attribute metadata of the one or more attributes match the at least one characteristic. For example, the
template engine 132 may identify that the occupation of the first user is a marine biologist, and may add an attribute "scholar articles about X can be found in K" to the template because the education background of the first user satisfies the attribute metadata "Education Level." - The system generates a response (208). For example, the
content engine 134 may aggregate descriptions and generate a summary for the term "shark" for the first user. - In some implementations, the system may obtain a first description for a particular attribute of the one or more attributes. For example, the
content engine 134 may obtain the description "Sharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head." The system may generate a second description using the first description based on the one or more characteristics of the user. In some implementations, the system may substitute one or more first words of the first description by one or more second words. For example, thecontent engine 134 may modify the description to "Sharks have five to seven openings on the sides of the head." The system may generate the response, where the response includes the second description for the particular attribute. For example, thecontent engine 134 may aggregate the revised descriptions and generate a summary for the term "shark" for the second user. - In some implementations, a particular attribute of the one or more attributes may be associated with a plurality of descriptions. For example, the attribute "shark is Y" may include descriptions such as "fast," "aggressive," etc. The system may selecting a description from the plurality of descriptions for the particular attribute based on description metadata of the plurality of descriptions and the one or more characteristics of the user. For example, the
content engine 134 may select the description that satisfies the age group of the second user. - The system provides data representing the response (210). For example, the
content engine 134 transmits data including the dynamically generated summary of the term "shark" to theuser device 106. - In some implementations, the system may receive from a second user, a second request for information about the term. For example, a second user operating a
user device 106b may submit arequest 109b "What are sharks?" to thesearch system 110. The system may obtain one or more characteristics of the second user. For example, thesummary engine 130 may identify that the second user is a child. The system may obtain a second template including one or more attributes associated with the term. For example, thetemplate engine 132 may identify that the second user may be a child, and add an attribute "The color of X is K" because the age group of the second user satisfies the attribute metadata "age group." The system may generate, based on the one or more characteristics of the second user, a second response, the second response including a respective description for each attribute of the one or more attributes in the second template. For example, thecontent engine 134 may aggregate the revised descriptions and generate a summary for the term "shark" for the second user. The system may provide for output, data representing the second response. For example, thecontent engine 134 may transmit data including the dynamically generated summary of the term "shark" to theuser device 106b. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram that illustrates anexample process 300 for determining semantic relations. Theprocess 300 may be performed by a system, such as the search system 120 described above or by other systems, including combinations of multiple computing systems. - The system obtains resources (302). For example, the
semantics processing engine 128 may crawl theresources 105. - The system identifies description associated with a term (304). For example, a
resource 105a may include a phrase "a king is a male." Thesemantics processing engine 128 may determine that the description "male" is associated with the term "king." - The system determines one or more attributes for the term (306). For example, the
semantics processing engine 128 may determines an attribute "hyponym" for the term "king" from the phrase "a king is a male." - The system determines metadata for the term (308). For example, the
semantics processing engine 128 may designate a value "hyponym" as attribute metadata to the "king." - The system stores semantic relations (310). For example, the
semantics processing engine 128 may store the attribute metadata, the description metadata, and the data corresponding to the vectors in thesemantics vector space 139 in thesemantics data store 136. -
FIG. 4 is a diagram that illustrates anexample process 400 for internationalizing a summary template. Theprocess 400 may be performed by a system, such as the search system 120 described above or by other systems, including combinations of multiple computing systems. - The system obtains a template in a first language (402). For example, the
template engine 132 may access a template in a first language from thetemplate store 140. - The system modifies the template for a second language (404). In general, since semantic relations are independent of languages, the system may revise the template in the first language to fit the linguistic rules of the second language.
- The system generates translated descriptions (406). For example, the
content engine 134 may access thesemantic data store 136 to obtain a description in the first language that correspond to an attribute in the template. Thecontent engine 134 or another engine may translate the description in the first language into the second language. - A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For example, various forms of the flows shown above may be used, with steps re-ordered, added, or removed.
