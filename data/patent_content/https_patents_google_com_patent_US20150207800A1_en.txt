- the web application also may be associated with a background element that is an invisible element in the browser application that includes instructions related to one or more visible elements of the web application in the browser application. Upon the triggering of an event such as, for example, launching the browser application or opening the web application, the background element may execute the instructions on its page to perform functions related to the one or more visible elements of the installable web application.
- the screenshot 1100 illustrates an example of an illustration of a browser application 1102 .
- the browser application 1102 may be the Google Chrome browser application.
- a user interface 1106 may generate and display the web applications 1108 that are installed in the browser application 1102 .
- a user may have previously navigated the browser application 1102 to a web store, where the web store is a location on the Internet accessible by the browser application where a user can download applications, such as, web applications and extension applications that are integrated and downloadable as part of the browser application.
- the Google Chrome web store is a location on the Internet where users can download such applications and extensions.
- These installable web applications may be a normal website with some extra metadata.
- the installable web application and installable web extension applications may be built as a normal web application that uses standard web technologies for both server-side and client-side code.
- the installable web applications and extensions may include extra metadata that is associated with the application, which affects the web application's interaction with the browser application.
- the user interface 1106 displays icons for the web applications 1108 that have been installed in the browser application 1102 .
- a selection of one of the icons for example, by a double-click of an input device or a by a touch on a touch screen interface, causes the installed application to launch, including opening a new tab in the browser application 1102 and directing the new tab to a website associated with the launched application.
- a selection of the icon 1109 may cause the browser application 1102 to open a new tab and to go to the Internet website for the web store, where a user may browse and install other web applications and extension applications.
- the user interface 1106 may display the installed applications in other ways.
- the installed applications may be listed by name in a text listing.
- the installed applications may be grouped or organized in some manner using folders or other hierarchical-type interfaces. Multiple installed applications may extend onto multiple other pages, which may be considered part of the same user interface 1106 that just has extended onto other pages.
- the user may interact with the installed applications 1108 such as, for instance, launching an installed application by selection of its icon. Also, from this single user interface 1106 , the user may manage one or more of the functions associated with an installed application.
- FIG. 2 an example of a screenshot 2200 of the browser application 1102 is illustrated.
- one of the installed applications 1108 has been selected to manage functions and features associated with the installed application.
- a tool icon 2202 may be selected and a management window 2204 is generated and displayed.
- a user may right-click on the icon using an input device (e.g., a mouse) to generate and display the management window 2204 .
- an input device e.g., a mouse
- the management window 2204 is part of the user interface 1106 that enables control of functions and features related to the installed applications. From the management window 2204 , the user may control a launch mode for the web application. For instance, several launch mode options are provided including to open as a regular tab, open as a pinned tab, open as a window or open full screen. A selection of one of these launch modes controls how the application launches each time it is selected to launch. Other types of launch modes may be provided.
- another launch mode may include a panel mode. By selecting the panel mode, the application may be launched in a small pop-up panel.
- other features related to the launch mode or related to the appearance and/or behavior of other features may be controlled by the user through the user interface 1106 .
- the behavior and/or appearance of the tab may be controlled as it relates to the launch of a specific application including features such as a larger icon, different tab placement, and different grouping behavior.
- the behavior and/or appearance of the window may be controlled as it relates to the launch of a specific application including removing the browser chrome and treating the application like a top-level application rather than a sub-window of the browser application.
- a launch mode may include launching the application as an invisible background service.
- the launch modes may operate in a manner that is independent of any installed operating system.
- the browser application 1102 may be configured to operate with different types of operating systems and functionality of applications installed in the browser application 1102 and may perform in a manner independent of the operating system.
- the management window 2204 also enables a user to uninstall 2206 an installed application. If a user selects uninstall 2206 , then the installed application will be uninstalled from the browser application 1102 . To reinstall an uninstalled application, the user may navigate to the web store and select the application to be installed again in the browser application. In other implementations, the user may navigate to other application hosting providers or directly to a website for the application itself to download and install the application.
- the management window 2204 also enables a user to create a new operating system-specific application specific shortcut 2208 (e.g., on the Windows desktop or the OS X dock) for the installed application. If the user selects shortcut 2208 , then a new shortcut is generated.
- a new operating system-specific application specific shortcut 2208 e.g., on the Windows desktop or the OS X dock
- an example of a screen shot 3300 illustrates the browser application 1102 .
- the user's selection of shortcut (shortcut 2208 of FIG. 2 ) generates and displays a shortcut window 3302 in the single user interface 1106 in the browser application 1102 .
- the shortcut window 3302 provides a point of enabling integration with the installed operating system by allowing options to create a shortcut in one or more locations controlled by the operating system. Shortcuts may be created on the desktop, in the start menu and/or in the quick launch bar.
- a selection of one or more of the check boxes causes a shortcut to be installed in the selected location.
- a selection of the shortcut from one of these locations launches the installed application and browser application, if the browser application is not already running.
- the user interface 1106 in the browser application 1102 may provide an interface for the user to manage permissions associated with an installed application.
- FIG. 4 an example of a screenshot 4400 illustrates the browser application 1102 with a permissions window 4402 .
- the permissions window 4402 may be opened using the user interface 1106 and selecting one of the installed applications 1108 , as discussed above.
- the permissions window 4402 provides an interface within the single user interface 1102 to enable the user to control and manage the permissions associated with an installed application.
- the permissions may be a declaration of the access that is desired by the web application or extension application to device-side information, client-related information and/or server-side information associated with the client or device.
- One or more permissions may be declared and granted by the user as part of the installation process for the application. In this manner, developers of web applications and extension applications declare the desired permissions and associate the declared permissions as part of the application. This informs the user as to the access that is potentially being requested to specific information during the lifetime of the application while in use in the browser application.
- the permissions window 4402 allows the user to control the declared permissions associated with an installed application. Turning off one or more of the declared permissions may reduce and limit the performance of the installed application.
- the permissions window 4402 allows the user to control opt-in permissions and the declared permissions. Opt-in permissions may be made optional to the user whereby opting in by the user grants the application one or more other permissions. In other example implementations, the permissions window 4402 allows the user to control only opt-in permissions and not any declared permissions.
- an interface for permissions related to multiple installed applications may allow a user to control a specific permission or permission type for all of the installed applications. In this manner, for instance, the user may control a geolocation permission or a background permission in a more global or universal manner across multiple installed applications.
- Other features including the launch mode, uninstallation feature and shortcuts may be controlled in a similar universal manner across multiple installed applications.
- an interface may enable the user to designate multiple or all of the installed application to launch in full screen launch mode.
- the user interface 1106 also may provide a search interface to search for and launch an installed application.
- a screen shot 5500 illustrates the browser application 1102 and a search window 5502 .
- the search window 5502 may be referred to as an omnibox search window because it searches for information from multiple, different providers using a single search interface.
- the search window 5502 may enable a user to enter a query or a partial query and results may be retrieved from multiple sources including, for instance, a search provider, a browser history, a desktop provider and installed application in the browser application.
- the search query or partial search query may begin to provide results as soon as the first character is entered in the search window 5502 .
- the characters entered into the search window 5502 may be compared against the title of the installed application using a string match comparison.
- a user has entered the character “n” 5504 in the search window 5502 .
- a search result window 5506 displays a list of results.
- the search result window 5506 includes an installed application 5508 in the list of results.
- a selection of the installed application 5508 from the search result window 5506 may cause the application to launch.
- an example of a screen shot 6600 illustrates the browser application 1102 and a review window 6602 .
- a user can rate and write a review for an installed application 1108 using the review window 6602 .
- the review window 6602 may be opened using the user interface 1106 and selecting one of the installed applications 1108 , as discussed above. In this manner, the user can rate and review installed applications from this user interface instead of just at the web store website.

- the management module 7534 may store the first identity information into memory (e.g., memory 7532 , 904 , and/or 964 ) so that this information may be retrieved later to generate the first access point 1206 and/or access the web application under the first profile.
- the first identity information may be stored such that it is shared with other different web applications, which may be useful, for example, if the first user used the same information (e.g., login data, password data, cookie data, etc.) for the different web applications.

- the management module 7534 may provide access to the web application either by using a previously opened window or a new window to display the web application under the first profile. For example, the management module 7534 may determine if a previous window configured to display the web application under the first profile is open, and may render this window active if it is open. As shown in FIG. 11A , window 1110 , which contains contents of the web application under the first profile, is already open. Thus, if the user selects the first access point 1206 , the management module 7534 may make this window active (e.g., by making the contents of the web application contained therein visible to the user). By using the previously opened window to display the web application under the first profile, multiple windows displaying the same web application under the first profile can be avoided.
- the management module 7534 may automatically attempt to access the web application (e.g., automatically logging in to the web application under the first profile).

It will be apparent, however, to one ordinarily skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the subject technology.
- In some aspects, this document relates to systems and techniques for a user interface surface integrated as part of a browser application for interacting with and managing applications installed in the browser application. The user interface provides an interactive interface to organize and launch the installed applications. The user interface also provides an interactive interface to manage functionality of the installed applications including, for example, launch modes, permissions, integration with the operating system, rating and reviewing an installed application and uninstalling an installed application. The user interface also provides a search interface to find and launch installed applications using a search query. In this manner, a single user interface integrated in the browser application provides multiple control and management features related to the applications installed in the browser application.
- Throughout this document, the terms browser and browser application may be used interchangeably to mean the same thing. In some aspects, the terms web application and web app may be used interchangeably to refer to an application, including metadata, that is installed in a browser application. In some aspects, the terms web application and web app may be used interchangeably to refer to a website and/or application to which access is provided over a network (e.g., the Internet) under a specific profile (e.g., a website that provides email service to a user under a specific profile). The terms extension application, web extension, web extension application, extension app and extension may be used interchangeably to refer to a bundle of files that are installed in the browser application to add functionality to the browser application. In some aspects, the term application, when used by itself without modifiers, may be used to refer to, but is not limited to, a web application and/or an extension application that is installed or is to be installed in the browser application.
- An extension application may be a zipped bundle of files that adds functionality to the browser application. Extension applications may be web pages and may use all of the application programming interfaces (APIs) that the browser application provides to web pages. The extension application may include hypertext mark-up language (HTML), cascading style sheets (eSS), JavaScript, images, and other types of files and web-related computer languages and code.
- In one example implementation, an extension application may use a background element, which is an invisible element that may include the main logic or instructions related to the extension application. In this manner, the background element may function as a central hub for the functionality of the extension application. The background element may be associated with one or more visible elements of the extension application. Upon the launch or a triggering event such as, for example, logging into a computer or logging into the browser application or launching the extension application, the background element launches and begins executing the instructions contained within the background element. In this manner, the extension application provides quick and fast access to content due to the fact that the background element is operating even when the visible elements of the extension are not being displayed. Upon invocation of a visible element of the extension, the background element provides content and information that has been collected in the background.
- In another example, an installed application may be an installed web application. A web application may be a normal website that includes extra metadata that is installed as part of the browser application. Installable web apps may use standard web technologies for server-side and client-side code. The extra metadata associated with the installable web application affects the web application's interaction with the browser application. The web application also may be associated with a background element that is an invisible element in the browser application that includes instructions related to one or more visible elements of the web application in the browser application. Upon the triggering of an event such as, for example, launching the browser application or opening the web application, the background element may execute the instructions on its page to perform functions related to the one or more visible elements of the installable web application.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , an example of ascreenshot 1100 is illustrated. Thescreenshot 1100 illustrates an example of an illustration of abrowser application 1102. For example, in one implementation, thebrowser application 1102 may be the Google Chrome browser application. When a user selects to open anew tab 1104 in thebrowser application 1102, auser interface 1106 may generate and display theweb applications 1108 that are installed in thebrowser application 1102. - For example, a user may have previously navigated the
browser application 1102 to a web store, where the web store is a location on the Internet accessible by the browser application where a user can download applications, such as, web applications and extension applications that are integrated and downloadable as part of the browser application. For instance, the Google Chrome web store is a location on the Internet where users can download such applications and extensions. These installable web applications may be a normal website with some extra metadata. The installable web application and installable web extension applications may be built as a normal web application that uses standard web technologies for both server-side and client-side code. In addition to the normal web application, the installable web applications and extensions may include extra metadata that is associated with the application, which affects the web application's interaction with the browser application. - In this example, the
user interface 1106 displays icons for theweb applications 1108 that have been installed in thebrowser application 1102. A selection of one of the icons, for example, by a double-click of an input device or a by a touch on a touch screen interface, causes the installed application to launch, including opening a new tab in thebrowser application 1102 and directing the new tab to a website associated with the launched application. A selection of theicon 1109 may cause thebrowser application 1102 to open a new tab and to go to the Internet website for the web store, where a user may browse and install other web applications and extension applications. - In other example implementations, the
user interface 1106 may display the installed applications in other ways. For example, the installed applications may be listed by name in a text listing. The installed applications may be grouped or organized in some manner using folders or other hierarchical-type interfaces. Multiple installed applications may extend onto multiple other pages, which may be considered part of thesame user interface 1106 that just has extended onto other pages. - From this
single user interface 1106, the user may interact with the installedapplications 1108 such as, for instance, launching an installed application by selection of its icon. Also, from thissingle user interface 1106, the user may manage one or more of the functions associated with an installed application. - Referring to
FIG. 2 , an example of ascreenshot 2200 of thebrowser application 1102 is illustrated. In this example, one of the installedapplications 1108 has been selected to manage functions and features associated with the installed application. In one example, atool icon 2202 may be selected and amanagement window 2204 is generated and displayed. In another example, a user may right-click on the icon using an input device (e.g., a mouse) to generate and display themanagement window 2204. - The
management window 2204 is part of theuser interface 1106 that enables control of functions and features related to the installed applications. From themanagement window 2204, the user may control a launch mode for the web application. For instance, several launch mode options are provided including to open as a regular tab, open as a pinned tab, open as a window or open full screen. A selection of one of these launch modes controls how the application launches each time it is selected to launch. Other types of launch modes may be provided. - In another example implementation, another launch mode may include a panel mode. By selecting the panel mode, the application may be launched in a small pop-up panel. In other example implementations, other features related to the launch mode or related to the appearance and/or behavior of other features may be controlled by the user through the
user interface 1106. For example, the behavior and/or appearance of the tab may be controlled as it relates to the launch of a specific application including features such as a larger icon, different tab placement, and different grouping behavior. The behavior and/or appearance of the window may be controlled as it relates to the launch of a specific application including removing the browser chrome and treating the application like a top-level application rather than a sub-window of the browser application. In other implementations, a launch mode may include launching the application as an invisible background service. - The launch modes may operate in a manner that is independent of any installed operating system. The
browser application 1102 may be configured to operate with different types of operating systems and functionality of applications installed in thebrowser application 1102 and may perform in a manner independent of the operating system. - The
management window 2204 also enables a user to uninstall 2206 an installed application. If a user selectsuninstall 2206, then the installed application will be uninstalled from thebrowser application 1102. To reinstall an uninstalled application, the user may navigate to the web store and select the application to be installed again in the browser application. In other implementations, the user may navigate to other application hosting providers or directly to a website for the application itself to download and install the application. - The
management window 2204 also enables a user to create a new operating system-specific application specific shortcut 2208 (e.g., on the Windows desktop or the OS X dock) for the installed application. If the user selectsshortcut 2208, then a new shortcut is generated. - Referring to
FIG. 3 , an example of ascreen shot 3300 illustrates thebrowser application 1102. In this example, the user's selection of shortcut (shortcut 2208 ofFIG. 2 ) generates and displays ashortcut window 3302 in thesingle user interface 1106 in thebrowser application 1102. Theshortcut window 3302 provides a point of enabling integration with the installed operating system by allowing options to create a shortcut in one or more locations controlled by the operating system. Shortcuts may be created on the desktop, in the start menu and/or in the quick launch bar. A selection of one or more of the check boxes causes a shortcut to be installed in the selected location. A selection of the shortcut from one of these locations launches the installed application and browser application, if the browser application is not already running. - In another example implementation, the
user interface 1106 in thebrowser application 1102 may provide an interface for the user to manage permissions associated with an installed application. Referring toFIG. 4 , an example of ascreenshot 4400 illustrates thebrowser application 1102 with apermissions window 4402. Thepermissions window 4402 may be opened using theuser interface 1106 and selecting one of the installedapplications 1108, as discussed above. Thepermissions window 4402 provides an interface within thesingle user interface 1102 to enable the user to control and manage the permissions associated with an installed application. - The permissions may be a declaration of the access that is desired by the web application or extension application to device-side information, client-related information and/or server-side information associated with the client or device. One or more permissions may be declared and granted by the user as part of the installation process for the application. In this manner, developers of web applications and extension applications declare the desired permissions and associate the declared permissions as part of the application. This informs the user as to the access that is potentially being requested to specific information during the lifetime of the application while in use in the browser application.
- The
permissions window 4402 allows the user to control the declared permissions associated with an installed application. Turning off one or more of the declared permissions may reduce and limit the performance of the installed application. - In another example implementation, the
permissions window 4402 allows the user to control opt-in permissions and the declared permissions. Opt-in permissions may be made optional to the user whereby opting in by the user grants the application one or more other permissions. In other example implementations, thepermissions window 4402 allows the user to control only opt-in permissions and not any declared permissions. - While the examples discussed above illustrate and describe the control and management of installed applications on an individual application basis, other example implementations may provide an interface through the
single user interface 1106 of thebrowser application 1102 to enable control of one or more features across multiple installed applications. For example, an interface for permissions related to multiple installed applications may allow a user to control a specific permission or permission type for all of the installed applications. In this manner, for instance, the user may control a geolocation permission or a background permission in a more global or universal manner across multiple installed applications. Other features including the launch mode, uninstallation feature and shortcuts may be controlled in a similar universal manner across multiple installed applications. For instance, an interface may enable the user to designate multiple or all of the installed application to launch in full screen launch mode. - The
user interface 1106 also may provide a search interface to search for and launch an installed application. Referring toFIG. 5 , an example of ascreen shot 5500 illustrates thebrowser application 1102 and asearch window 5502. In one example implementation, thesearch window 5502 may be referred to as an omnibox search window because it searches for information from multiple, different providers using a single search interface. For example, thesearch window 5502 may enable a user to enter a query or a partial query and results may be retrieved from multiple sources including, for instance, a search provider, a browser history, a desktop provider and installed application in the browser application. The search query or partial search query may begin to provide results as soon as the first character is entered in thesearch window 5502. - For the installed applications, the characters entered into the
search window 5502 may be compared against the title of the installed application using a string match comparison. InFIG. 5 , a user has entered the character “n” 5504 in thesearch window 5502. A search result window 5506 displays a list of results. The search result window 5506 includes an installedapplication 5508 in the list of results. A selection of the installedapplication 5508 from the search result window 5506 may cause the application to launch. - Referring to
FIG. 6 , an example of ascreen shot 6600 illustrates thebrowser application 1102 and areview window 6602. From thesingle user interface 1106 in thebrowser application 1102, a user can rate and write a review for an installedapplication 1108 using thereview window 6602. Thereview window 6602 may be opened using theuser interface 1106 and selecting one of the installedapplications 1108, as discussed above. In this manner, the user can rate and review installed applications from this user interface instead of just at the web store website. -
FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example embodiment of asystem 7500 in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In various implementations, thesystem 7500 may include a client computer or other computing device (e.g., smart-phone, tablet computer, laptop, etc.) 7502 that executes anoperating system 7506, and anapplication 7521 orwindow 7520. In one embodiment, the computer may include or be connected to a graphical display 7504 (e.g., a monitor, touch-screen, etc.) and receive input, at least in part, from a user 7590 interacting with thedevice 7502. - In one example implementation, the
device 7502 may be running or causing theoperating system 7506 to execute theapplication 7521 or thewindow 7520. For purposes of illustration, theapplication 7521 may be a browser application that includes at least onewindow 7520. In various implementations, thiswindow 7520 may include multiple panes ortabs device 7502 may receive online content from one or more remote server computing devices (not shown) that may be connected to theclient device 7502 though anetwork 7508 such as, for example, the Internet. The online content can be processed and displayed on thegraphical display 7504 on atab browser application 7521. In one example implementation, thewindow 7520 may include a user interface (e.g.,user interface 1106 fromFIG. 1 ) to interact with the installed applications. - The user 7590 may navigate to a web store on the Internet and download one or
more web applications 7524 and/orextension applications 7526 to install in thebrowser application 7521. Prior to the installation of aweb application 7524 or anextension application 7526, thebrowser application 7521 presents a notification that includes a request to confirm the installation of the application and that includes a listing of any permissions that are declared by the application. Upon receiving confirmation of the installation, the application is installed and the permissions are granted. - A
memory 7532, or other non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, may store instructions and code that are executed by at least oneprocessor 7530. The instructions may include any instructions or code related to thebrowser application 7521 and the process of installing applications in the browser application, including the notification and granting of permissions associated with the applications. Theprocessor 7530 may execute any code or instructions provided on any background element associated with a web application and/or an extension application. - The browser application also may include a
management module 7534. In one example implementation, themanagement module 7534 is associated with and part of the code associated with thebrowser application 7521. In other example implementations, themanagement module 7534 may be a separate component that interacts with thebrowser application 7521. - The
management module 7534 may be configured to cause the at least oneprocessor 7530 to generate and display a management window (e.g.,management window 2204 ofFIG. 2 ) to enable a user to interact with and control one or more of the features of an installed application. Themanagement module 7534 enables a user to manage the features of an installed application including the launch mode, the uninstall feature, the permissions feature, the rating and review feature and the shortcut feature. - In one example implementation, the
management module 7534 interacts with theoperating system 7506 to install a shortcut for the installed application in a location controlled by theoperating system 7506. The locations may include the desktop, the start menu and/or the quick launch bar. - The browser application also may include a
search module 7536. Thesearch module 7536 may be configured to provide a search window (e.g.,search window 5502 ofFIG. 5 ) to enable a user to enter a search string and to display results in a search results window (e.g., search results window 5506 ofFIG. 5 ). Thesearch module 7536 may be configured to interface with multiple providers, where the providers may include an Internet search provider, a browser history module and the list of installed applications in the browser application. - Referring to
FIG. 8 , an example of aprocess 8400 illustrates techniques related to the system ofFIG. 7 .Process 8400 includes providing a user interface in a browser application (8410). For example, auser interface 1106 may be provided in thebrowser application 1102, as discussed in detail above. One or more applications installed in the browser application may be displayed on the user interface (8420). For example, theweb application 1108 is displayed on theuser interface 1106 in thebrowser application 1102. -
Process 8400 includes enabling interaction with the installed applications through the user interface in the browser application (8430). For example, theuser interface 1106 provides an interaction area in thebrowser application 1102 to interact with the installedapplications 1108. In this manner, an installed application may be launched from theuser interface 1106 in thebrowser application 1102. - As discussed above in detail, the
user interface 1106 enables control of one or more features of the installed applications in the browser application. For example, through theuser interface 1106, a user may control the launch mode for each installed application and declared permissions for each installed application. Also, a user may use the user interface to uninstall one of the installed applications and to create one or more shortcuts for each of the installed applications. -
FIG. 9 shows an example of ageneric computer device 900 and a genericmobile computer device 950, which may be used with the techniques described herein.Computing device 900 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 950 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smart phones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the subject technology described and/or claimed in this document. -

Each of thecomponents processor 902 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 900, including instructions stored in thememory 904 or on thestorage device 906 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 916 coupled tohigh speed interface 908. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 900 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 904 stores information within thecomputing device 900. In one implementation, thememory 904 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 904 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 904 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk. - The
storage device 906 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 900. In one implementation, thestorage device 906 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described herein. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 904, thestorage device 906, or memory onprocessor 902. - The
high speed controller 908 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 900, while thelow speed controller 912 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 908 is coupled tomemory 904, display 916 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 910, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 912 is coupled tostorage device 906 and low-speed expansion port 914. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The
computing device 900 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as astandard server 920, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 924. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 922. Alternatively, components fromcomputing device 900 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 950. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device multiple computing devices -
Computing device 950 includes aprocessor 952,memory 964, an input/output device such as adisplay 954, acommunication interface 966, and atransceiver 968, among other components. Thedevice 950 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a micro drive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 952 can execute instructions within thecomputing device 950, including instructions stored in thememory 964. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 950, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 950, and wireless communication bydevice 950. -
Processor 952 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 958 anddisplay interface 956 coupled to adisplay 954. Thedisplay 954 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 956 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 954 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 958 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 952. In addition, anexternal interface 962 may be provide in communication withprocessor 952, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 950 with other devices.External interface 962 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used. - The
memory 964 stores information within thecomputing device 950. Thememory 964 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 974 may also be provided and connected todevice 950 throughexpansion interface 972, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 974 may provide extra storage space fordevice 950, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 950. Specifically,expansion memory 974 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 974 may be provide as a security module fordevice 950, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 950. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 964,expansion memory 974, or memory onprocessor 952, that may be received, for example, overtransceiver 968 orexternal interface 962. -
Device 950 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 966, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 966 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 968. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 970 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 950, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 950. -
Device 950 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 960, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 960 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 950. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating ondevice 950. - The
computing device 950 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 980. It may also be implemented as part of asmart phone 982, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device. - According to various aspects of the subject technology, systems and methods are provided for enabling access to web applications. A web application may allow a user to create a profile to log in to the web application in order to use the web application under that specific profile. For example, the web application may comprise a website providing email service, which may allow a user to create a specific email address to send emails from or receive emails at the specific email address. An access point, such as a bookmark, can be used to direct the user to the web application. However, the bookmark typically only directs the user to the web application, and fails to provide the user access to the web application under the user's specific profile (e.g., the specific email address associated with the user).
- According to various aspects of the subject technology, an access point can be generated to provide a user access to the web application under a specific profile. For example, the access point may comprise at least one of an icon, a shortcut, a bookmark, and some other suitable link that may be placed within an operating system and/or a browser application. When the user performs an action on the access point, such as by clicking on the access point, the user is able to access the web application automatically as though the user were logged in to the web application under the specific profile. This provides the user with quick access to the web application.
- In some aspects, it may be desirable for a user to have multiple profiles associated with a web application. For example, a user may have a first profile for an email website that is associated with personal use. The user may also have a second profile for the same email website that is associated with work use. According to certain aspects, multiple access points may be generated to access the same web application, wherein each of the multiple access points is associated with a different profile of the user. In some aspects, these multiple access points may allow a user to access the same web application under different profiles at the same time.

FIG. 10 illustrates an example of amethod 1000 for enabling access to a web application, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. Themethod 1000, for example, may be used to generate access points that enable a user to access the web application under a specific profile. In some aspects, themethod 1000 may be implemented by thesystem 7500 inFIG. 7 . However, themethod 1000 may be implemented by other suitable systems having different configurations fromsystem 7500. -
FIG. 11A illustrates an example of abrowser application 1102 of anoperating system 1204 that may be used to access the web application, in accordance with various aspects of subject technology. As shown inFIG. 11A , awindow 1110, which in this example is a tab of thebrowser application 1102, may be used to display the web application under a first profile. The first profile may be associated with first identity information of a first user. This first identity information may comprise at least one of first login data, first password data, first cookie data, and other suitable information for identifying the first profile of the first user and/or for helping the first user log in to the web application under the first profile. Themethod 1000, for example, may be used to generate afirst access point 1206 that can provide access to the web application under the first profile. - According to certain aspects, the
management module 7534 may use the first profile for generating thefirst access point 1206. Referring toFIGS. 7 , 10, and 11A, according to step S 1002, themanagement module 7534 may determine the first profile to be used for accessing the web application. For example, themanagement module 7534 may determine if the first user is currently logged in to the web application under the first profile (e.g.,window 1110 is currently open and is configured to display the web application under the first profile). If so, themanagement module 7534 may be able to identify the currently logged in profile as the first profile to be used for generating thefirst access point 1206. In some aspects, themanagement module 7534 may identify the first profile as the profile to be used for generating thefirst access point 1206 based on how frequently the first profile is used to access the web application. For example, if the first profile is frequently used to access the web application, themanagement module 7534 may determine the first profile as the profile to be used for generating thefirst access point 1206. - In some aspects, the
management module 7534 may identify the first profile based on user input. For example, themanagement module 7534 may receive the first identity information from the first user using various means, such as by having the first user enter the first identity information to access the web application. The first identity information may be used to generate thefirst access point 1206 and/or access the web application under the first profile. For example, thefirst access point 1206 may refer to the first identity information as well as the location of the web application (e.g., uniform resource locator of the web application). Thus, if the first user performs an action on the first access point 1206 (e.g., clicking on the first access point 1206), the first user may not only be directed to the web application (using the location of the web application referenced by the first access point 1206), but may also be logged in to the web application under the first profile (using the first identity information referenced by the first access point 1206). - In some aspects, the
management module 7534 may store the first identity information into memory (e.g.,memory first access point 1206 and/or access the web application under the first profile. In some aspects, the first identity information may be stored such that it is shared with other different web applications, which may be useful, for example, if the first user used the same information (e.g., login data, password data, cookie data, etc.) for the different web applications. Thus, access points corresponding to the other different web applications may be generated, and these access points may refer to the same first identity information. In some aspects, the first identity information may be stored in isolation for the first access point 1206 (e.g., an independent storage location for the first access point 1206). Thus, compared to other access points, only thefirst access point 1206 may have access to the first identity information. - According to step S 1004, the
management module 7534 may generate thefirst access point 1206 based on the first profile (e.g., determined from step S 1002). For example, thefirst access point 1206 may comprise at least one of an icon, a shortcut, a bookmark, and some other suitable link that provides access to the web application under the first profile. - According to step
S 1006, themanagement module 7534 may enable automatic access to the web application under the first profile via thefirst access point 1206. For example, themanagement module 7534 may provide for display thefirst access point 1206. As shown inFIG. 11A , thefirst access point 1206 is displayed in awindow 1114, which is a new tab of thebrowser application 1102. Themanagement module 7534 may enable user interaction with thefirst access point 1206. For example, the first user may click on thefirst access point 1206 or perform some other suitable action on thefirst access point 1206. Based on this user interaction, themanagement module 7534 may provide access to the web application under the first profile. For example, themanagement module 7534 may provide access to the web application under the first profile in response to the first user clicking on the first access point 1206 (or performing some other suitable action on the first access point 1206). - In some aspects, the
management module 7534 may provide access to the web application either by using a previously opened window or a new window to display the web application under the first profile. For example, themanagement module 7534 may determine if a previous window configured to display the web application under the first profile is open, and may render this window active if it is open. As shown inFIG. 11A ,window 1110, which contains contents of the web application under the first profile, is already open. Thus, if the user selects thefirst access point 1206, themanagement module 7534 may make this window active (e.g., by making the contents of the web application contained therein visible to the user). By using the previously opened window to display the web application under the first profile, multiple windows displaying the same web application under the first profile can be avoided. - In some aspects, if the previous window is not open, then the
management module 7534 may automatically attempt to access the web application (e.g., automatically logging in to the web application under the first profile). For example, themanagement module 7534 may provide the first identity information (referenced by the first access point 1206) to the web application (at the location referenced by the first access point 1206) in order to log the first user in to the web application. In response to this action, themanagement module 7534 may receive authorization to access the web application under the first profile. Themanagement module 7534 may then use a new window (e.g., window 1114) to display the web application under the first profile if the authorization is received. - As discussed above, multiple access points may be generated to access the same web application, wherein each of the multiple access points is associated with a different profile. According to step S 1008, the
management module 7534 may determine a second profile to be used for accessing the web application. The second profile may be different from the first profile, and may be used to generate asecond access point 1208 that provides access to the web application under the second profile. The second profile may be associated with second identity information of a second user. The second identity information may comprise at least one of second login data, second password data, second cookie data, and other suitable information for identifying the second profile of the second user and/or for helping the second user log in to the web application under the second profile. - In some aspects, the second user may be different from the first user. For example, the first user and the second user may share the use of the
operating system 1204 and/orbrowser application 1102. Thus, thefirst access point 1206 may be used by the first user to access the web application under the first profile, while thesecond access point 1208 may be used by the second user to access the web application under the second profile. - In some aspects, the second user may be the same user as the first user, except that the second profile is different from the first profile. For example, as discussed above, a user may have a first profile for an email website that is associated with personal use. The same user may also have a second profile for the same email website that is associated with work use. Thus, according to certain aspects, the first user and the second user may be considered the same user, but with different profiles.
- The second profile may be used to generate the
second access point 1208. According to certain aspects, themanagement module 7534 may identify the second profile as the profile to be used for generating thesecond access point 1208 based on how frequently the second profile is used to access the web application. For example, if the second profile is not as frequently used as the first profile to access the web application, themanagement module 7534 may determine the second profile as the profile to be used for generating thesecond access point 1208. - In some aspects, the
management module 7534 may identify the second profile based on user input. For example, themanagement module 7534 may receive the second identity information from the second user using various means, such as by having the second user enter the second identity information to access the web application. The second identity information may be used to generate thesecond access point 1208 and/or access the web application under the second profile. For example, thesecond access point 1208 may refer to the second identity information as well as the location of the web application (e.g., uniform resource locator of the web application). Thus, if the second user performs an action on the second access point 1208 (e.g., clicking on the second access point 1208), the second user may not only be directed to the web application (using the location of the web application referenced by the second access point 1208), but may also be logged in to the web application under the second profile (using the second identity information referenced by the second access point 1208). - In some aspects, the
management module 7534 may store the second identity information into memory (e.g.,memory second access point 1208 and/or access the web application under the second profile. In some aspects, the second identity information may be stored such that it is shared with other different web applications, which may be useful, for example, if the second user used the same information (e.g., login data, password data, cookie data, etc.) for the different web applications. Thus, access points corresponding to the other different web applications may be generated, and these access points may refer to the same second identity information. In some aspects, the second identity information may be stored in isolation for the second access point 1208 (e.g., an independent storage location for the second access point 1208). Thus, compared to other access points, only thesecond access point 1208 may have access to the second identity information. In some aspects, the second identity information may be stored separately from the first identity information so that accessing the web application under the second profile (using the second access point 1208) may be separate from accessing the web application under the first profile (using the first access point 1206). - According to step S 1010, the
management module 7534 may generate thesecond access point 1208 based on the second profile. For example, thesecond access point 1208 may comprise at least one of an icon, a shortcut, a bookmark, and some other suitable link that provides access to the web application under the second profile. In some aspects, a user interface (e.g., user interface 1106) is provided that allows the second user to generate thesecond access point 1208. For example, the user interface may allow the second user to right-click on thefirst access point 1206 using an input device (e.g., a mouse) to generate and display a management window (similar tomanagement window 2204 inFIG. 2 ). This management window may enable control of functions and features related to the generation of thesecond access point 1208. For example, from this management window, the second user may select an option to generate thesecond access point 1208. Upon selecting this option, themanagement module 7534 may generate thesecond access point 1208 using the stored second identity information. If the second identity information was not previously stored, then the second user may be prompted to enter the second identity information. In some aspects, the management window may provide other options for the second user, such as selecting a specific appearance of thesecond access point 1208. - In some aspects, the
second access point 1208 may be visually different from thefirst access point 1206. For example, thesecond access point 1208 may have a color, shape, shading, badge overlay, or other visual feature that is different from thefirst access point 1206. This difference may allow a user to distinguish thefirst access point 1206 from thesecond access point 1208. - According to step S 1012, the
management module 7534 may enable automatic access to the web application under the second profile via thesecond access point 1208. For example, themanagement module 7534 may provide for display thesecond access point 1208. As shown inFIG. 11A , thesecond access point 1208 is displayed inwindow 1114. Themanagement module 7534 may enable user interaction with thesecond access point 1208. For example, the second user may click on thesecond access point 1208 or perform some other suitable action on thesecond access point 1208. Based on this user interaction, themanagement module 7534 may provide access to the web application under the second profile in response to the second user clicking on the second access point 1208 (or performing some other suitable action on the second access point 1208). - In some aspects, the
management module 7534 may provide access to the web application either by using a previously opened window or a new window to display the web application under the second profile. For example, themanagement module 7534 may determine if a previous window configured to display the web application under the second profile is open, and may render this window active if it is open. As shown inFIG. 11A ,window 1112, which is a tab that contains contents of the web application under the second profile, is already open. Thus, if the user selects thesecond access point 1208, themanagement module 7534 may make this window active (e.g., by making the contents of the web application contained therein visible to the user). By using the previously opened window to display the web application under the second profile, multiple windows displaying the same web application under the second profile can be avoided. - In some aspects, if the previous window is not open, then the
management module 7534 may automatically attempt to access the web application (e.g., automatically logging in to the web application under the second profile). For example, themanagement module 7534 may provide the second identity information (referenced by the second access point 1208) to the web application (at the location referenced by the second access point 1208) in order to log the second user in to the web application. In response to this action, themanagement module 7534 may receive authorization to access the web application under the second profile. Themanagement module 7534 may then use a new window (e.g., window 1114) to display the web application under the second profile if the authorization is received. According to certain aspects, the automatic access to the web application under the first profile and the automatic access to the web application under the second profile may be enabled at the same time, thereby allowing a user to simultaneously access the same web application using different profiles. - Although the
first access point 1206 and thesecond access point 1208 are shown as being a part ofbrowser application 1102 inFIG. 11A , thefirst access point 1206 and thesecond access point 1208 may also generally be part of theoperating system 1204. For example,FIG. 11B illustrates an example of thefirst access point 1206 and thesecond access point 1208 as generally part of theoperating system 1204, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. As shown inFIG. 11B , thefirst access point 1206 and thesecond access point 1208 are displayed in a desktop area of theoperating system 1204. In particular, thefirst access point 1206 and thesecond access point 1208 are displayed as part of ataskbar 1116 of theoperating system 1204. However, thefirst access point 1206 and thesecond access point 1208 may be displayed at any suitable part of the operating system 1204 (e.g., the start menu and/or the quick launch bar) as long as a user may be able to select these access points to access the web application under a corresponding profile. In some aspects, once the user performs an action on either thefirst access point 1206 or thesecond access point 1208,browser application 1102 may be opened in order provide the user access to the web application under the first profile or the second profile depending on which access point was selected by the user. Although only two access points are described, aspects of the subject technology may include generating and/or using more than two access points for accessing the web application, wherein a different profile is associated with each of the access points. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.
