Definitions
- the present invention relates to mobile telecommunications and, more particularly, to a tracking device that conserves power using a sleep mode when proximate to an anchor beacon.
- the ability to use electronic tracking and/or location determination devices is becoming a popular means to automatically determine the location of designated objects. For example, it is becoming a standard feature for mobile telephones to be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) components, which permit precise location determinations for emergency 911 calls. This feature also allows associated functions to be added to a mobile device, such as a GPS navigational capability. This type of electronic tracking is also often used in shipping systems to track packages and in the automotive industry to provide anti-theft and protection services.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- a mobile telephone that includes GPS components and a geo fencing feature can be configured by a family member, such as a parent, to establish permitted zones for school, work, friends' houses, malls, and the like, for the carrier of the mobile telephone.
- Notifications can be automatically sent to the parent's mobile telephone when a monitored family member, such as a child, enters or leaves any of the established zones.
- Notifications can also be issued when a mobile telephone travels over an established speed, which presumably indicates a child or teen is traveling in a vehicle at excessive speeds.
- Power consumption is a key problem for existing electronic tracking systems. These systems require an extensive amount of power resources in order to provide communications over a Wide Area Network (WAN) and to continuously determine an object's location. For some devices that have access to a substantial power source, such as a mobile telephone, the issue of power consumption is more of an annoyance and detriment than a show-stopping occurrence. In other potential implementations, however, excessive power consumption can result in bulky devices that are too large to serve their intended purpose in an efficient manner.
- WAN Wide Area Network
- pet tracking devices are generally not available, since such a device needs to be small enough for a pet to carry (e.g., within a pet collar) yet include enough power reserves to have a reasonable maintenance schedule (e.g., replacing/recharging the battery on a monthly basis).
- the present invention discloses a solution for conserving power resources of a tracking device by placing the device in an active state only when the device is within a designated range of an anchor beacon.
- the tracking device can be placed in a sleep mode, utilizing a Personal Area Network (PAN) transceiver drawing a nominal amount of power.
- PAN Personal Area Network
- a WAN transceiver can be activated along with a location determination component.
- the location of the tracking device can be conveyed to a tracking server.
- the tracking server can generate a notice when the tracking device is outside of the designated range, which can be conveyed to a previously designated computing device.
- the tracking server can optionally determine if the tracking device is proximate to a mobile device that has been previously defined as safe when determining whether a notice should be generated; proximity to the safe mobile device representing a safe region.
- a pet being tracked with the tracking device can be safe when proximate to an owner's mobile telephone (e.g., a safe device), which can indicate that the pet is outside the designated range of the anchor beacon because the owner is walking the pet. In one example, this can be an allowed occurrence and no notice will be generated and sent to the notification device.
- the designated range can be established based upon a quality of a signal that a tracking device receives.
- the quality of a signal can be determined by any of many means known to those in the art. Examples include received signal strength, packet error rates, bit error rates, etc.
- Different signal quality thresholds can be established that, are specific to a tracking device and used to adjust a region of permitted mobility on a device by device basis.
- different tracking devices receiving signals from a common anchor beacon can each have a device specific designated range. Any device leaving an associated designated range can cause the leaving device to wake from a sleep mode and to convey location identification information to the tracking server.
- one aspect of the present invention can include a method for tracking objects in a way that conserves power resources.
- the method can establish a designated range based upon a broadcast signal generated by an anchor beacon.
- the tracking device can be placed in a mode of low power consumption.
- the tracking device can be placed in a mode for active tracking.
- the level of power consumption can be achieved by only enabling a WAN transceiver in the active tracking mode.
- Another aspect of the present invention can include a method to track a designated object.
- the method can automatically sense when a tracking device is within a designated range of an anchor beacon.
- the power state of the tracking device can be changed by activating a WAN transceiver and a location detector. After the change in power state, the location of the tracking device can be determined by the location detector.
- a notification, including the determined device location, can be wirelessly conveyed to a predetermined computing device.
- Still another aspect of the present invention can include a power conserving tracking system that includes at least one anchor beacon and a tracking device.
- the tracking device can include a sensor for detecting the anchor beacon signal, a location detector, a WAN transceiver, and a power source with multiple power modes.
- the power source can be automatically placed in a low power mode.
- the tracking device can be automatically placed in an active power mode when the tracking device moves outside of the designated range.
- the WAN transceiver and location detector can be activated to repeatedly determine the location of the tracking device and to convey the location to a computing device.
- Another aspect of this invention is for one or more mobile communication devices to selectively receive notifications based upon whether a tracked object (e.g., PET) is within a designated range of one or more anchor beacons and/or whether a tracked object is proximate to one or more safe mobile devices, in a first instance, the object tacking device can send a notification to a tracking server when it is no longer in the designated range of an anchor beacon. The tracking server can then determine if the object tracking device is collocated or proximately located with one or more of the sate mobile devices. When the object tracking device is outside the designated range and not collocated with a safe device, a notification can be automatically conveyed to an object caretaker's device.
- a tracked object e.g., PET
- the object tacking device can send a notification to a tracking server when it is no longer in the designated range of an anchor beacon.
- the tracking server can then determine if the object tracking device is collocated or proximately located with one or more of the
- an object tracking device to send a notice to a tracking server when it is no longer in a designated range of an anchor beacon, which can be a fixed and/or a movable (e.g., a user's mobile device can function as a safe mobile device or an anchor beacon in one embodiment) beacon.
- a mobile device functioning as an anchor beacon may or may not include local geo fencing capabilities.
- the tracking server can compensate by repetitively determining a location of the mobile device in relationship to the object tracking device.
- the tracking server can determine if the object tracking device is still within a geo fence and can provide control commands to the tracking device. Further, a notification can be sent to one or more mobile communication devices based upon a location of the object tracking device in relation to the geo fence. For example, when an object tracking device is within the geo fence, the tracking server will not notify one or more mobile communication users, but may choose to alter a tracking device location measurement interval by sending an Over The Air (OTA) command.
- OTA command is one that is wirelessly conveyed via a wireless communication network.
- a notification to one or more mobile communication devices can be automatically sent when the object tracking device is no longer inside the geo fence. Further, the object tracking device's location measurement interval can be decreased to give more frequent location updates through an OTA command sent to the object tracking device.
- various aspects of the invention can be implemented as a program for controlling computing equipment to implement the functions described herein, or a program for enabling computing equipment to perform processes corresponding to the steps disclosed herein.
- This program may be provided by storing the program in a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a semiconductor memory, or any other recording medium.
- the program can also be provided as a digitally encoded signal conveyed via a carrier wave.
- the described program can be a single program or can be implemented as multiple subprograms, each of which interact within a single computing device or interact in a distributed fashion across a network space.
- FIG. 1 is a set of diagrams that illustrate how a proximity of a tracking device to defined safe devices automatically adjusts the power mode of the tracking device in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 2 is a graphical representation illustrating the basic interactions between components automatically adjusting the settings of a tracking device in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a system that conserves the power of a tracking device in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- FIG. 1 is a set of diagrams 100 , 120 , and 140 that illustrate how a proximity of a tracking device to defined safe devices automatically adjusts the settings of the tracking device in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- Safe devices can include stationary and/or moving anchor beacons as well as specific mobile devices designated by a user.
- Diagram 100 begins with example area 101 that defines the initial positions and settings of its components.
- Example area 101 can include a safe region 102 that can be created by an anchor beacon 105 .
- the size of the safe region 102 can be governed by the beacon range 106 and quality of a broadcast signal received by a tracking device. It should be appreciated that the size of the safe region 102 can vary in shape and size depending upon the number of anchor beacons 105 that are used to define the safe region 102 , the type of broadcast signal output by the anchor beacon 105 , and the presence of objects that block the anchor beacon's 105 signal within the safe region 102 .
- a user can adjust a power setting of the anchor beacon 105 to adjust the range 106 and size of safe region 102 as well as one or more antenna orientations.
- a user can establish a signal quality threshold that defines a designated range of permitted movement for the tracking device. Changing this threshold can change a permitted range from the anchor beacon.
- the tracking device is set at a designated range, which is used to define the safe region 102 .
- An owner 103 and their pet 110 can be located within the safe region 102 .
- Owner 103 can possess a mobile device 104 .
- the pet 110 can wear a tracking collar 112 that contains a power conserving tracking device. While the pet 110 is within the safe region 102 , the tracking collar 112 can operate under the shown tracking settings 113 .
- These tracking settings 113 illustrate that the tracking collar 112 can function in a low power mode when near an anchor beacon 105 and that owner notifications are unnecessary in this situation.
- This new set of tracking settings 114 can include a change in the power mode of the tracking collar 112 due to the activation of its wide area communications component, such as a WAN transceiver. Additionally, the new tracking settings can trigger the generation of a notification that can be sent to one or more designated devices. In this example, the owner 103 can receive the notification stating that the object has left the safe region 102 on their mobile device 104 .
- the owner 103 can be walking their pet 110 outside of the safe region 102 .
- the owner 103 can be in possession of their mobile device 104 while on the walk and this mobile device 104 can be designated as a safe device.
- Designation of the mobile device 104 as a safe device can result in it having associated tracking settings 125 .
- the tracking settings 125 can indicate that an active tracking mode and wide area communications have been activated for the tracking device (collar 112 ), and that notifications are unnecessary. This is similar to the change in settings illustrated in diagram 100 , where the tracking collar 112 can no longer remain in the low power mode.
- a tracking server 130 can receive location signals 127 and 128 from the mobile device 104 and tracking collar 112 , respectively. With the locational information contained within the location signals 127 and 128 , the tracking server 130 can determine the proximity of the tracking device (collar 112 ) to a safe device (mobile device 104 ) and the anchor beacon 105 . The tracking server 130 can then use these determined distances to check against a user-defined tracking profile 135 .
- the tracking profile 135 can contain preset conditions and corresponding allowed safe distances. Since the tracking device (collar 112 ) meets the condition for the safe device (mobile device 104 ) and both devices are within the distance allowed from the anchor beacon 105 , the tracking server 130 can determine that the pet 110 is intentionally outside of the safe region 102 and that this is not a cause for alarm. Other settings can be established in profile 135 for different devices having different owners. For example, a device 199 can be a mobile telephone carried by a child who is permitted to walk the pet 110 up to two miles from the yard so long as the child stays within forty feet of the pet 110 .
- a different person associated with device 195 can be permitted to travel with the pet 110 up to ten miles from the yard so long as the pet 110 stays within twenty feet of device 395 . It can be appreciated that a range of values for the “allowed safe distance” can include zero to infinity and all values in between.
- a special safe power mode can be employed that selectively turns on a WAN transceiver and detection component at a long iteration, such as once every fifteen minutes. This means a location of the pet 110 is conveyed to the tracking server 130 at fifteen minute intervals. If the pet 110 strays too far from the safe device, the tracking collar 112 can be adjusted to an active tracking mode, having a shorter iteration between location transmissions than the safe power mode. For example, the WAN transceiver and detection component can be activated once every five minutes in the active tracking mode, causing a location of the pet 110 to be sent to the server 130 every five minutes. In one configuration, distance transmission iterations can be dynamically shortened to conserve power when the power remaining in the tracking collar 112 is low.
- Diagram 140 illustrates a situation similar to diagram 120 where the pet 110 is outside of the sale region 102 with its owner 103 who is carrying a mobile device 145 .
- proximity between an owner 103 and a pet 110 can be based upon a personal area network 150 range.
- both the mobile device 145 and the tracking collar 112 can be BLUETOOTH enabled devices, which are automatically aware of one another when within BLUETOOTH range. Broadcasts from the collar 112 to a tracking server 155 can occur only when the collar 112 is outside of the safe region 102 and outside of the BLUETOOTH range of device 145 .
- the BLUETOOTH range is indicated by the dashed line labeled personal area network (PAN) 150 .
- diagram 140 shows a configuration that permits the collar 112 to selectively remain in low power mode, even when outside of the safe region 102 .
- Communications that authorize the mobile device 145 as a safe device can occur between device 145 and a remotely located device 155 , which can be a server hosting the tracking profile 160 .
- the device 155 can send an authorization key to device 145 , which is conveyed to the collar 112 via the PAN 150 .
- the authorization key can automatically time-out, which allows the computing device 155 to account for profile parameters, such as distance from safe region 102 .
- the authorization key can expire every half hour, requiring a new updated key be requested 152 .
- a new key can be conveyed within a response 154 , when the mobile device 145 is located an allowed distance from region 102 . When outside of this distance, no key will be sent in response 154 which causes collar 112 to shift from a low-power mode to an active tracking mode, which in turn results in a notice (not shown) being sent.
- FIG. 2 is a graphical representation 200 illustrating the basic interactions between components automatically adjusting the settings of a tracking device in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. These interactions can occur between the following components: anchor beacon 201 , tracking device 202 , WAN server 203 , and safe device 204 .
- Interaction can begin when the tracking device 202 receives signal 205 from the anchor beacon 201 . Since the tracking device 202 can receive the signal 205 broadcast 207 from the anchor beacon 201 , it can be determined that, the tracking device 202 is within the designed range defined by the signal broadcast from the anchor beacon 201 . Therefore, the tracking device 202 can be placed in a low power mode 208 .
- a signal quality threshold can be used to define the designated range, which can be specific to the tracking device 202 . That is, a different tracking device (not shown) having a different signal quality threshold will be permitted to be a different designated range from the beacon 201 . Since the anchor beacon 201 defines the designated range, it can be set in a state of constant broadcast 207 .
- the tracking device 202 can not receive the signal from the anchor beacon 201 or if the quality of the signal is less than a signal quality threshold associated with the device 202 , denoted by the broken no signal arrow 210 , then it can be determined that the tracking device 201 has left the designated range defined by the anchor beacon 201 . At this point, the tracking device 202 can be automatically taken out of the low power mode 208 through the execution of a wake up process 212 .
- the wake up process 212 can activate the WAN transceiver 213 and location detector 214 . Activation of these components can increase the power consumption of tracking device 202 .
- the location detector 214 can then determine the location of the tracking device 202 and send its location 215 to the WAN server 203 . Upon receipt of this information, the WAN server 203 can access the tracking profile 220 associated with the tracking device 202 . The contents of the tracking profile 220 can resemble the information illustrated in the tracking profile 135 of FIG. 1 .
- the WAN server 203 can attempt, to determine the proximity of the tracking device 202 to a safe device 204 , it should be appreciated that this step should be performed for each safe device 204 defined within the tracking profile 220 .
- the WAN server 203 can query the location 222 of the safe device 204 .
- the safe device 204 can respond to this query with its locational information 223 .
- Step 224 shows that the safe device is proximate, which results in a power saving tracking command 226 being sent to the tracking device 202 .
- This command 226 causes device 202 to enter a safe tracking mode 228 .
- location information can be conveyed over a WAN at a long interval.
- the tracking device 202 can determine that no beacon signal 232 is broadcasting a signal having a quality greater than an established signal quality threshold. This causes a location 234 of the device 202 to be conveyed to WAN server 203 .
- the server can again query the profile 236 for safe devices.
- Device 204 can be queried 238 for a location, which is provided in response 240 .
- the WAN server 203 can determine 242 that the safe device 204 is now no longer proximate to the tracking device 202 .
- a notice 244 is to be sent to safe device 204 .
- the WAN server 203 can send the notice 244 to any receptive device designated by a user and that sending the notice 244 to the safe device 204 is merely an illustration of a possible configuration.
- a power active tracking command 246 is to be issued from the server 203 to the tracking device 202 .
- This command 246 can cause device 202 to be adjusted from safe tracking mode to an active tracking mode 248 .
- the active tracking mode 248 can have a shorter interval for conveying current location information to server 203 .
- the tracking device 202 can check for a signal 250 from an anchor beacon 201 , which is present and which has a quality greater than the established signal quality threshold. This means that the device 202 is now in a safe region. A notice 252 to this effect can be sent to the WAN server 203 , which can send a similar notice 254 to the sale device 204 , so the owner or guardian is no longer concerned about the object associated with the tracking device 202 .
- the tracking device 202 can shift back from the active tracking mode to the low power mode 256 .
- FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a system 300 that conserves the power of a tracking device in accordance with an embodiment of the inventive arrangements disclosed herein.
- System 300 can include a tracking device 315 that can be placed within an optional docking station 310 connected to a computing device 305 .

- the tracking device 315 can include additional components such as a PAN transceiver 316 , a WAN transceiver 317 , a GPS component 318 , a processor 319 , a power source 320 , and a data store 325 . It should be appreciated that the processor 319 and data store 325 are required to conduct the automated adjustment of power and communication components.
- the data store 325 can store device specific information, such as a signal quality threshold that is used to define a designated range that the device is allowed to be from an anchor beacon 340 .
- the PAN transceiver 316 can receive signals broadcast from the anchor beacon 340 over PAN 330 .
- the PAN transceiver 316 can also communicate with one or more safe mobile devices over PAN 331 .
- different PAN transceivers 316 can be required for PAN 330 and 331 .

- a user can access the administration interface 351 via computing device 305 . For example, a user could access the interlace over the Internet from a mobile telephone.
- the power source 320 of the tracking device 315 can include power modes 322 . As shown in this example, the power source 320 supports three power modes 322 .
- the low power mode can be analogous to a sleep mode and can be invoked when the tracking device 315 is within the safe region.
- the tracking mode can be analogous to a full power mode and can be invoked when the tracking device 315 is outside of the safe region and not proximate to a safe device; the system 300 is actively trying to locate the object. Should the tracking device be proximate to a safe mobile device 345 , the safe tracking mode can be invoked, which consumes less power than the active tracking mode.
