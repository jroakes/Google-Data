- the map database 126 may also store street level images 200.
- street level image 200 is an image of geographic objects that was captured by a camera at an angle generally parallel to the ground, or where the camera is positioned at or near ground level. Both the geographic objects in the image and the camera have a geographic location relative to one another.
- street level image 200 may represent various geographic objects such as buildings 202 and 204, sidewalks 206 and street 208. It will be understood that while street level image 200 only shows a few objects for ease of explanation, a typical street level image will contain as many objects associable with geographic locations (street lights, mountains, trees, sculptures bodies of water, vehicles, people, etc.) in as much detail as may be captured by an imaging device such as a digital camera.
- FIG. 1 An example of a street level image is an image of geographic objects that was captured by a camera at an angle generally parallel to the ground, or where the camera is positioned at or near ground level. Both the geographic objects in the image and the camera have a geographic location relative to one another.
- street level image 200 may represent various geographic objects such as buildings 202 and 204,
- the objects in the street level images may be captured in a variety of different ways.
- the street level image may be captured by a camera mounted on top of a vehicle, from a camera angle pointing roughly parallel to the ground and from a camera position at or below the legal limit for vehicle heights (e.g., 7-14 feet) .
- Vehicle heights e.g. 7-14 feet
- Panoramic street-level images may be created by stitching together a plurality of photographs taken from different camera angles .
- the camera may be any device capable of capturing optical images of objects including film cameras, digital still cameras, analog video cameras and image sensors (by way of example, CCD, CMOS or other) .
- street level images 200 are typically associated with information indicating the orientation of the image.
- the orientation may simply be the camera angle such as an angle that is 30° east of true north and rises 2° from ground level.
- the street level images are panoramic images, such as 360° panoramas centered at the geographic location associated with the image, the orientation may indicate the portion of the image that corresponds with looking due north from the camera position at an angle directly parallel to the ground.
- Street level images may also be stored in the form of videos, such as by displaying MPEG videos captured by an analog video camera or displaying, in succession, time- sequenced photographs that were captured by a digital still camera .
- the geographic locations of the surfaces facing the camera that captured the images are stored as polygons.
- surface 220 of building 204 may be defined as a polygon 222 having four vertices, each vertex being associated with a different geographic position. As shown in FIG.
- the object position data vertices may be stored in terms of their latitude, longitude and altitude positions, such as a coordinate of the form (Lat2°, Lon2°, Alt2 meters) .
- the surface 220 of building 204 may be stored as object position data 224, which may be maintained as a collection of geographic positions (Lat2, Lon2, Alt2), (Lat3, Lon3, Alt3), (Lat4, Lon4, Alt4) and (Lat5, Lon5, Alt5).
- the polygon 222 defines the geographic locations of a plurality of points, namely, the points within the bounds of the polygon.
- Surfaces 220 of other objects may be similarly stored as surface data 226 (see FIG. 1), as well as the position and orientation of the camera that captured the image .
- the object position data may also be used. For example, a separate value may be stored for each pixel of the street level image where the value represents the geographic position of the surface that is illustrated at that pixel.
- the pixel at row ya and column xa (hereafter, " (xa, ya)") of the street level image may represent a portion of the surface of building 202 at that pixel.
- One of the values associated with the pixel may be the color and brightness of that portion of the surface as captured by the camera.
- the other value associated with the pixel may be the geographic position of that portion of the surface. Pixels that are not associated with a surface may be associated with a null or default surface value.
- the object position data may define the geographic position of a plurality of points.
- the object position data may store the distances from the objects to the camera at each pixel of the image .
- Such image and object position data may be stored in the map/image database 126 shown in FIG. 1.
- the database may be maintained as part of the server 102 or web server 122 or 124.
- the database may be configured for remote access by one or more servers or client devices.
- this imaging information including the street level images and surface data, may be retrieved upon request to augment or replace an image taken in real time by a user.
- the values of the object position data may be relative to any geographic reference system and in any scale.
- a first type of information when a first type of information is used to store the object position data (such as storing the latitude, longitude and altitude of the camera and surface), information of another type may be generated from it (such as calculating the distance between the camera and a surface) .
- information of another type may be generated from it (such as calculating the distance between the camera and a surface) .
- the object position data stores surfaces as a cloud of discrete coordinates
- the geographic position of points in between the stored coordinates may be extrapolated from the nearest, neighboring coordinate (s ).
- Certain formats permit the surface information to be stored independently of the street level images taken by the camera.
- object position data stored as described in FIG. 5C may be stored without reference to the street level image or camera position. If the object position data for a street level image is required, such object position data may be retrieved by querying those surfaces that are proximate to the street level image's camera position and in front of other surfaces .
- a variety of systems and methods may be used to collect the surface information. By way of example only, a laser range finder may be used.
- stereoscopic systems employing two cameras, spaced slightly apart yet looking at the same scene, may be used as well; by analyzing the slight differences between the images seen by each camera, it is possible to estimate the distance at each point in the images.
- the information may be compiled by using a single video camera, travelling at a particular velocity, to capture the street level imagery as the scenery passes by. The video may not only be used as the street level image, but subsequent frames may be compared to extract the different distances between the objects and the camera (e.g., mountains in the distance will stay in the frame much longer than a fire hydrant passing by along the street) .
- Client devices 112 and 114 see FIGS.
- client device 114 may include a GPS receiver to determine the device's latitude, longitude and altitude position.
- the component may also comprise software for determining the position of the device based on other signals received at the client device 114, such as signals received at a cell phone's antenna from one or more cell phone towers if the client device is a cell phone.
- It may also include an accelerometer or gyroscope to determine the direction in which the device is oriented.
- the device may determine its pitch, yaw or roll (or changes thereto) relative to the direction of gravity and a plane perpendicular thereto.
- the client device 114 may be a PDA/phone having a touch-screen display 300, general-purpose button 302, speaker 304, and microphone 306 on the front.
- the left side includes volume button (s) 308.
- the top side includes a cell-phone antenna 310 and GPS receiver 312.
- the back includes a camera 314.
- the camera may be oriented in a particular direction (hereafter, "camera angle") .
- a zooming button or other actuator 318 may be used to zoom in and out of an image on the display.
- the camera angle may be expressed in three- dimensions as shown by the compass rose in FIG. 7 and schematically in FIGS. 8 and 9. It shall be assumed for ease of understanding and not limitation that the camera angle is fixed relative to the orientation of the device.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a potential pitch of the device (as seen looking towards the left side of the device) relative to the ground, e.g., relative to the plane perpendicular to the direction of gravity.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a potential latitude/longitude angle of the device (as seen looking down towards the top side of the device), e.g., the camera direction in which the camera points relative to the latitude and longitude.
- the pitch and latitude/longitude angle define a camera angle in three-dimensions. These angles may be outputted as numerical values by the accelerometer 316 (see FIG. 1), used by the device's processor, and stored in the memory of the device.
- a user may position the client device 114 with the camera 314 facing an object of interest.
- the user may stand in front of an object of interest 400, such as a building or monument, and orient the camera 314 in a direction 402 that points toward a spot 404 on the point of interest.
- the camera 314 of the client device 114 may be used to help the user orient the device 114 to the desired position on the object of interest 400.
- the phone's processor may periodically update the display 300 so that it continuously shows the image currently captured by the camera 314.
- the display 300 may also display a target, bull's-eye or some other indicator 406 to indicate the exact or approximate position of the object at which the device 114 is pointed.
- FIGS. 12A-D illustrate one example in which the camera of client device 114 is oriented towards an object of interest 400, namely the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France.
- the image 402 taken by the camera is presented on the display 300.
- FIG. 12B illustrates a second image 404 which zooms in on the object of interest 400.
- This zoomed image 404 may be formed by optical zooming, digital zooming, or a combination of optical and digital zooming. Due to the zooming, certain features may be blocky or pixilated.
- the image 406 may comprise a street level image 200 (see FIG. 3) that has been stored in map/image database 126 (see FIG. 1).
- Location information associated with the client device 114 and camera 314 may be used to retrieve the image 406 from the map/image database 126.
- the latitude, longitude, pitch and angle of the client device and camera which may be determined by the GPS receiver 312 and accelerometer 316, may be used along with an estimation of the distance to the object of interest.
- This information may be transmitted, e.g., via a wireless link, across the network 120 to the server 102 or web servers 122 or 124. Then the server, such as server 102, may search the database 126 or other image database to find the closest matching image (s) based upon the received information and any applicable geo-tagged information in the database. At this point, one or more of the closest corresponding images may be sent to the client device 114 for presentation on the display 300.
- the initial image 402 or the zoomed image 404 may be replaced by a particular one of the corresponding images from the database. And as shown in FIG. 12D, the user may zoom in on a portion of the image 404 to obtain image 408. This may be done, for instance, by using the actuator 318 on the client device 114 (see FIG. 6) .
- the user may start with an initial image 402 captured by the camera 314 on the client device 114, zoom in to obtain image 404, and then obtain enhanced imagery in the form of images 406 and/or 408 based on geo-coded images in a remote database.
- the user may effectively infinitely zoom in on an object of interest. This avoids having to carry telephoto lenses or other cumbersome and expensive equipment.
- the geo-coded imagery stored in the database and the images captured by the camera 314 on the client device 114 may be date and/or timestamped.
- the server may also refine the search based on time information. For instance, if the user captures the image 402 at a certain time of day (e.g., dawn) at a certain time of year (e.g., fall), then the server may rank images of the same location and orientation based upon how closely they match this time information. And in another alternative, the server may rank the images based on resolution quality. In this case, a greater resolution image may be ranked higher than a lower resolution image. [0060] FIG.
- FIG. 13 provides a flow diagram 500 for one process employed by a client device to capture an initial image and substitute that image with a geo-coded image from a database.
- the client device's camera is oriented toward an object of interest.
- an image of the object of interest is captured.
- geolocation information about the image and/or client device is determined as set forth above. Such information may be stored in the memory of the user device. Additional applicable image information, such as image orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape view, resolution, whether a flash was used, etc.) may also be recorded and associated with the captured image) .
- the user may choose to zoom in on a portion of the captured image.
- the zoomed-in portion of the image may be associated with a surface of the object of interest.
- image-related information is transmitted to an entity such as a remote server, and in block 510 one or more geo-coded images corresponding to the captured image and/or the zoomed-in portion of the image are received.
- one or more selected geo-coded images are presented on the display of the client device as shown in block 512.
- the selection and presentation of the geo-coded image (s) may be performed based on any of the criteria set forth above.
- a portion of a given geo-coded image may be zoomed in on.
- the user may transmit image related position information to the server or other entity for such received image (s) and obtain additional geo-coded images from the in return.
- This provides an "infinite zooming" effect by allowing the user to obtain additional imagery for the object of interest.
- the user may request different levels of zoomed-in imagery from the server, or images from different vantage points.
- the zoomed-in geo-coded image presents a particular frieze on the Arc de Triomphe .
- the user may request a view of a different portion of the Arc de Triomphe which may or may not have been visible from the original image captured by the client device.
- FIG. 14 illustrates one process 520 by which a remote entity provides geo-coded imagery to a client device.
- a remote entity provides geo-coded imagery to a client device.
- the client device transmits image- related information to a server or other remote entity.
- image-related information may include the position and orientation of the client device, as well as information concerning the captured image as set forth above.
- a map/image database is queried to identify street level images and/or surfaces which correlate to the image-related information received from the client device.
- the database may also be updated to include any images provided as part of the image-related information sent by the client device.
- any such images or surfaces which correlate with the received information are flagged or otherwise identified.
- a processor such as processor 104 of FIG. 1 may correlate and rank the imagery based upon at least one of location, orientation, time of day, season, weather condition, image resolution, zooming level, any requests for views from the user and the like. Based on the correlated or ranked imagery, a set of relevant imagery is prepared and sent to the client device, as shown in block 526. Upon receipt by the client device, such information may be stored or cached by the client device and presented on a display to the user as per block 528.
- the present invention enjoys wide industrial applicability including, but not limited to, image processing and communication technology, such as image enhancement using information from remote sources.
