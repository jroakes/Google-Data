Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- a method includes: receiving input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject; identifying one or more hashtags associated with the input; generating a creative for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags, wherein generating includes using at least one hashtag as content in the creative; providing the creative to the content sponsor for approval; and receiving an indication of approval and using the creative in a campaign associated with the content sponsor.
- a computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions.
- the instructions when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject; identify one or more hashtags associated with the input; generate a creative for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags, wherein generating includes using at least one hashtag as content in the creative; provide the creative to the content sponsor for approval; and receive an indication of approval and using the creative in a campaign associated with the content sponsor.
- a system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions.
- the instructions when executed, cause the one or more processors to: receive input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject; identify one or more hashtags associated with the input; generate a creative for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags, wherein generating includes using at least one hashtag as content in the creative; provide the creative to the content sponsor for approval; and receive an indication of approval and using the creative in a campaign associated with the content sponsor.

- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server. For situations in which user-generated content (e.g., content associated with a hashtag) is used, such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , publishers 109 , a content management system 110 , a first social server system 111 , and a second social server system 112 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , and publishers 109 .

- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples.
- the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 allow users to interact with other users within a social framework.
- the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 each provide a social presence for users in the environment 100 .
- the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 can provide a social application 120 and a social application 122 , respectively, to a user device 106 .
- the social application 120 and the social application 122 can allow a user of a user device 106 to share information in a social network.
- the social application 120 and the social application 122 can each be a social networking website that users can use to identify friends and social groups (e.g., circles), send and receive email, post messages and multi-media (e.g. photos, video, audio), track social events, provide updates and soon.
- a user of a user device 106 can use the social application 120 or the social application 122 to post an update for the user in a social context.
- the first social server system 111 or the second social server 112 can, in response to the update, provide the update to one or more subscribers that the user has authorized to receive the update.
- subscribers may be subscribed to an activity stream associated with the user, and may be enabled to view the update in the user's activity stream.
- An activity stream can show recent updates posted by the user 112 .
- the update can be, for example, a comment by the user on content exposed to the user by the social application 120 or the social application 122 , such as a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content.
- the update can be a comment posted by the user on a blog.
- the update can be a designation that the user likes or dislikes certain content. The user can, for example, designate that they like or dislike a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content.
- An update can also be some other type of interaction with a content item in a user's activity stream, such as a designation to share or re-publish the content item.
- An update can include a hashtag.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.

- a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- keywords and/or hashtags associated with a requested resource 105 or a search query 117 for which search results 118 are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource 105 or search query 117 .
- An identifier e.g., cookie
- associated with the user device 106 can be received with the request for content.
- the content management system 110 can select (e.g., from a content items data store 119 ) content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request.
- One or more selected content items can be provided to the user device 106 in association with providing an associated resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the provided content item(s) can be presented on the user device 106 , in one or more respective slots.
- the content management system 110 can, for example, select a content item having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot.
- content items having selection criteria e.g., keywords, hashtags
- resource keywords or hashtags in the search query 117 , or keywords or hashtags included in the search results 118
- the content management system 110 can identify a content item in the content items datastore 119 that is associated with a hashtag or keyword that matches a hashtag or keyword included in a user profile associated with the requesting user device 106 .
- the identified content item can be selected by the content management system 110 and provided to the requesting user device 106 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction.
- content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that the content providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items.
- an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated to content providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item.
- the slot can be allocated to the content provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure).
- a quality score can be determined, for example, based on a quality of match between, for example, a keyword or hashtag associated with a content item and keywords or hashtags associated with a resource that includes the slot associated with the request.
- a quality score can be determined based on a quality of match between a keyword or hashtag associated with a content item and keywords or hashtags included in a user device profile associated with the requesting user device.
- a content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- a content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 113 which define a content campaign.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 113 specified by the content provider 108 .
- the campaign parameters 113 can be stored in a campaign database 114 .
- Campaign parameters 113 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria.
- Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms.
- the selection terms can be used in evaluating when to serve content items in response to received requests for content.
- the selection terms can include, for example, one or more keywords and/or hashtags.
- content providers 108 can vary in their sophistication and ability with regards to generation of creatives. For instance, some content providers 108 may not have much experience with creation of content for creatives and/or with identifying selection criteria for use in a campaign. As another example, landing page content and other content associated with some content providers 108 may change frequently. The content provider 108 may desire to run campaigns based on their changing content, but may not have the resources or the desire to repeatedly create and/or edit campaigns.
- a content provider 108 may desire to run campaigns that are based off of popular hashtags, a content provider brand-oriented hashtag, and/or user-generated content that is associated with a hashtag. The content provider 108 may wish to promote their campaign to users who are creating content associated with a particular hashtag. A content provider 108 may not know which hashtags are the most popular or what content has been associated with hashtags.
- the content management system 110 can provide tools that allow for automatic generation of creatives and campaigns that are associated with hashtags.
- the content management system 110 can provide a user interface which allows the content sponsor 108 to provide an input, such as a keyword, topic, vertical or subject which describes a campaign that the content provider 108 would like to create.
- the content management system 110 can identify one or more hashtags from a hashtagged content repository 124 that match the input.
- hashtags that match the input and that have an associated popularity that is more than a threshold are identified and presented to the content provider for consideration for inclusion in a campaign.
- the hashtagged content repository 124 can include content (e.g., text content, image content, video content) that has been gathered (e.g., by the content management system 110 ) from plural, different content sources that are associated with hashtags.
- the content management system 110 can, for example, gather content from one or both of the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 , store the gathered content in the hashtagged content repository 124 , and, in some implementations, index the stored content by hashtags.
- the content management system 110 can gather only user-generated content to which users have explicitly granted access.
- a content provider 108 may run a brand promotion and may encourage users to post or submit content related to the brand promotion.
- a shoe company can run a campaign centered around a #born2run hashtag and may encourage users to post running photos and other content and tag such content with the #born2run hashtag.
- User posts and submissions can be, for example, used as entry into a sweepstakes or other contest. The users can agree to use of content associated with a particular hashtag as part of submitting a post associated with the hashtag
- the content management system 110 can retrieve content (e.g., images, videos, textual content) in the hashtagged content repository 124 that is associated with one or more identified hashtags.
- the content management system 110 can identify content to be used in a creative from one or more landing pages associated with the content provider 108 .
- the content management system 110 can automatically generate one or more creatives that include one or more of the one or more identified hashtags, the retrieved hashtag-associated content, and/or the identified landing page content.
- the creative(s) can be provided to the content provider 108 for approval, an indication of approval can be received, and the creative(s) can be used in a campaign.
- the creatives can be used in an existing campaign and/or in a newly created campaign.
- the content management system 110 can configure a campaign so that the identified hashtags are used as selection criteria for the campaign.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example system 200 for providing content.
- a user of a first user device 202 posts a message 204 to an activity stream associated with a social network and with the user of the first user device 202 .
- the message 204 is presented on a web page 205 and includes a hashtag 206 and an image 208 .
- the message 204 can be sent to a social network server 210 (e.g., as a social post 212 ).
- the message 204 including the hashtag 206 and the image 208 , can be stored in a repository 214 and distributed to users of the social network that are associated with the user of the user device 202 .
- the hashtag 206 may be associated, for example, with an XYZ Shoes shoe manufacturer (e.g., the hashtag 206 may be promoted by the XYZ Shoes manufacturer in content campaigns and one or more of the content campaigns may encourage customers of XYZ Shoes to create and promote content and tag such content using the hashtag 206 ).
- the hashtag 206 can be used as an index for the social post 212 that is stored in the repository 214 .
- the repository 214 may be indexed and searchable by hashtags.
- the repository 214 can include metadata for each stored content item, such as a number of affinity designations (e.g., “likes”), or number of publications or re-publications of the content item. Other forms of metadata are possible.
- a creative generator server 216 can gather content from the social network (e.g., from the repository 214 and/or the social network server 210 ), and/or from other content sources (e.g., other social networks) that include or present content that is associated with hashtags.
- the creative generator server 216 can identify the hashtag in 206 in the social post 212 and can identify the image 208 as additional content that is related to or in proximity to the hashtag 206 .
- the creative generator server 216 can store the gathered content in a hashtagged content repository 218 and index the stored content by particular hashtags.
- the image 208 can be stored in the hashtagged content repository 218 in association with the #born2run hashtag 206 .
- user-generated content e.g., content associated with a hashtag
- such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use.

- the content sponsor can select a control 226 to request automatic generation of one or more creatives based on one or more hashtags that have been identified based on the input specified using the input control 224 .
- the input entered using the input control 224 can be provided to the creative generator server 216 , as illustrated by a sponsor input 228 .
- the creative generator server 216 can identify one or more hashtags that are associated with the sponsor input 228 .
- the creative generator server 216 can identify one or more hashtags in the hashtagged content repository 218 that match (e.g., partial match, exact match, synonym or other conceptual match) the sponsor input 228 .
- the creative generator server 216 can identify hashtags based on a match and on prevalence and recency of hashtags in the hashtagged content repository 218 .
- the creative generator server 216 can identify highest-rated hashtags in terms of prevalence and relevancy that match the sponsor input 228 .
- the creative generator server 216 can identify the #born2run hashtag as a hashtag that matches the sponsor input 228 and has at least a minimum prevalence and recency.
- the creative generator server 216 can identify hashtags based on compiled prevalence and recency information.
- the prevalence and recency information is compiled before the sponsor input 228 is received (e.g., the creative generator server 216 or another server or system can periodically (e.g., daily) compile the prevalence and recency information).
- the creative generator server 216 compiles prevalence and recency information in real time in response to receiving the sponsor input 228 .
- the creative generator server 216 can generate one or more creatives based on the identified hashtags.
- the creative generator server 216 can generate a creative 230 .
- a creative can, but is not required to include one or more of the identified hashtags as content in the creative.
- the hashtag #born2run 206 is included in the creative 230 .
- the creative generator server 216 can determine content for the creative 230 from multiple sources. For example, content in the hashtagged content repository 218 that is associated with one or more identified hashtags can be used as content in a creative. For example, the creative 230 includes a copy of the image 208 .
- the creative generator server 216 can generate the creative 230 based at least in part on content included in one or more landing pages associated with the content sponsor.
- the creative generator server 216 can identify a landing page (e.g., an address of a landing page) associated with the content sponsor in a landing pages repository 232 .
- a landing page 234 can be identified.
- the creative generator server 216 can identify content in the landing page 234 as content to use in the creative 230 .

- the content sponsor can provide a landing page address (e.g., using the creative generator user interface 220 ).
- the creative generator server 216 can receive additional content from the content sponsor for inclusion in a generated creative. For example, as shown in an approval user interface 236 , the content sponsor can select an edit control 238 to edit an auto-generated creative. In some implementations, the content sponsor provides content (e.g., using the creative generator user interface 220 or another interface) when requesting generation of a creative.
- a landing page associated with the content sponsor can be associated with the creative 230 such that the landing page is presented when the creative 230 is presented to a user and the user selects the creative 230 .
- the creative generator server 216 can associate the landing page 234 with the creative 230 .
- the content sponsor can provide input that indicates a landing page to which the creative 230 is to be associated.
- a generated creative can be (but is not required to be) associated with a landing page from which content was used in generating the creative.
- the creative 230 can be associated with a landing page other than the landing page 234 .
- the content sponsor can approve a generated creative for use in a campaign associated with the content sponsor. For example, the content sponsor can view a copy 240 of the generated creative 230 in the approval user interface 236 .
- the content sponsor can select an approve control 242 to approve the generated creative 230 .
- the content sponsor can edit a generated creative before approval.

Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for generating a creative. A method includes: receiving input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject; identifying one or more hashtags associated with the input; generating a creative for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags, wherein generating includes using at least one hashtag as content in the creative; providing the creative to the content sponsor for approval; and receiving an indication of approval and using the creative in a campaign associated with the content sponsor.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject; identify one or more hashtags associated with the input; generate a creative for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags, wherein generating includes using at least one hashtag as content in the creative; provide the creative to the content sponsor for approval; and receive an indication of approval and using the creative in a campaign associated with the content sponsor.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: receive input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject; identify one or more hashtags associated with the input; generate a creative for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags, wherein generating includes using at least one hashtag as content in the creative; provide the creative to the content sponsor for approval; and receive an indication of approval and using the creative in a campaign associated with the content sponsor.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Posts by users in a social network can be evaluated to extract hashtags. A hashtag can be identified in a post. Additional content that is related to or in proximity to the identified hashtag can be identified. The hashtag and the additional content can be stored in a data structure. Generating the creative can include identifying the one hashtag and additional information related to the one hashtag. A creative can be generated that includes the one hashtag and the additional information associated with the one hashtag. The additional information can be a media item. The media item can be an image. Generating the creative can include receiving additional content from the content sponsor for inclusion along with the at least one hashtag. A list of trending hashtags can be provided based at least in part on the received input. A selection of one hashtag from the list can be received. Generating a creative can include including the selection in the creative. Identifying one or more hashtags associated with the input can include compiling information on prevalence and recency of hashtags in content delivered through a social network. The one or more hashtags can be identified based on the compiled information. The one or more hashtags identified can be the highest rated hashtags.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. A campaign and/or a creative that is based on one or more hashtags and/or on content associated with one or more hashtags can be automatically generated for a content sponsor. A creative that includes a trending hashtag can be automatically generated. An automatically generated creative that includes a hashtag can be viewed by social media users who follow or who are otherwise associated with the hashtag or users that have posted content including the hashtag. Presenting a creative that includes a hashtag to users who have used the hashtag can result in a higher conversion rate and a higher return on investment as compared to presentation of the creative to users without an associated hashtag. Presenting a creative that includes a hashtag next to content that is associated with the hashtag can result in a higher conversion rate and a higher return on investment as compared to presentation of the creative next to content that is not associated with the hashtag.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- A hashtag, as used herein, refers to a word or phrase that is prefixed with a non-alphabetic symbol (such as the # symbol). A hashtag can be used to index content, such as content that includes the hashtag. For example, a hashtag can be used in content that is distributed in social networking sites. Hashtags provide a ready means for grouping content, so as to enable ease of location of content that includes the tagged material.
- Input including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject can be received from a content sponsor, such as using a campaign management user interface. One or more hashtags associated with the input can be identified, such as from a repository of hashtagged-based content. A creative for a campaign (e.g., advertising campaign) can be generated based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags. One or more of the identified hashtags can be used as content in the generated creative. The creative can be provided to the content sponsor for approval. An indication of approval can be received and the creative can be used in the campaign.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server. For situations in which user-generated content (e.g., content associated with a hashtag) is used, such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to a user. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108, publishers 109, acontent management system 110, a firstsocial server system 111, and a secondsocial server system 112. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108, and publishers 109. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Thecontent providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples. - The first
social server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112 allow users to interact with other users within a social framework. The firstsocial server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112 each provide a social presence for users in theenvironment 100. For example, the firstsocial server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112 can provide asocial application 120 and asocial application 122, respectively, to auser device 106. Thesocial application 120 and thesocial application 122 can allow a user of auser device 106 to share information in a social network. For example, thesocial application 120 and thesocial application 122 can each be a social networking website that users can use to identify friends and social groups (e.g., circles), send and receive email, post messages and multi-media (e.g. photos, video, audio), track social events, provide updates and soon. - A user of a
user device 106 can use thesocial application 120 or thesocial application 122 to post an update for the user in a social context. The firstsocial server system 111 or the secondsocial server 112 can, in response to the update, provide the update to one or more subscribers that the user has authorized to receive the update. For example, subscribers may be subscribed to an activity stream associated with the user, and may be enabled to view the update in the user's activity stream. An activity stream can show recent updates posted by theuser 112. - The update can be, for example, a comment by the user on content exposed to the user by the
social application 120 or thesocial application 122, such as a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content. As another example, the update can be a comment posted by the user on a blog. As yet another example, the update can be a designation that the user likes or dislikes certain content. The user can, for example, designate that they like or dislike a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content. An update can also be some other type of interaction with a content item in a user's activity stream, such as a designation to share or re-publish the content item. An update can include a hashtag. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a publisher 109, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 117 to thesearch system 115 over thenetwork 102. In response to asearch query 117, thesearch system 115 can, for example, access the indexedcache 116 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 117. Thesearch system 115 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 115 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 117, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The data representing the
resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 orsearch results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot. In some implementations, the publisher 109 of aresource 105 can specify (e.g., using a publisher account management interface associated with the content management system 110) one or more hashtags to use as selection criteria for determining which content can be shown in a slot on aresource 105 associated with the publisher 109. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results 118. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 orsearch results 118 for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords and/or hashtags associated with a requestedresource 105 or asearch query 117 for which searchresults 118 are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to theresource 105 orsearch query 117. An identifier (e.g., cookie) associated with theuser device 106 can be received with the request for content. - Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, the
content management system 110 can select (e.g., from a content items data store 119) content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request. One or more selected content items can be provided to theuser device 106 in association with providing an associatedresource 105 or search results 118. The provided content item(s) can be presented on theuser device 106, in one or more respective slots. - The
content management system 110 can, for example, select a content item having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot. As another example, content items having selection criteria (e.g., keywords, hashtags) that match resource keywords or hashtags, in thesearch query 117, or keywords or hashtags included in the search results 118 may be selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. As yet another example, thecontent management system 110 can identify a content item in the content items datastore 119 that is associated with a hashtag or keyword that matches a hashtag or keyword included in a user profile associated with the requestinguser device 106. The identified content item can be selected by thecontent management system 110 and provided to the requestinguser device 106. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example,content providers 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that thecontent providers 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items. In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated tocontent providers 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item. For example, when a slot is being allocated in an auction, the slot can be allocated to thecontent provider 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure). A quality score can be determined, for example, based on a quality of match between, for example, a keyword or hashtag associated with a content item and keywords or hashtags associated with a resource that includes the slot associated with the request. As another example, a quality score can be determined based on a quality of match between a keyword or hashtag associated with a content item and keywords or hashtags included in a user device profile associated with the requesting user device. - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - A
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 113 which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 113 specified by thecontent provider 108. Thecampaign parameters 113 can be stored in acampaign database 114.Campaign parameters 113 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms. The selection terms can be used in evaluating when to serve content items in response to received requests for content. The selection terms, can include, for example, one or more keywords and/or hashtags. - Various factors may pose challenges for campaign and creative creation for a
content provider 108. For example,content providers 108 can vary in their sophistication and ability with regards to generation of creatives. For instance, somecontent providers 108 may not have much experience with creation of content for creatives and/or with identifying selection criteria for use in a campaign. As another example, landing page content and other content associated with somecontent providers 108 may change frequently. Thecontent provider 108 may desire to run campaigns based on their changing content, but may not have the resources or the desire to repeatedly create and/or edit campaigns. - A
content provider 108 may desire to run campaigns that are based off of popular hashtags, a content provider brand-oriented hashtag, and/or user-generated content that is associated with a hashtag. Thecontent provider 108 may wish to promote their campaign to users who are creating content associated with a particular hashtag. Acontent provider 108 may not know which hashtags are the most popular or what content has been associated with hashtags. - To aid a
content provider 108 in campaign and creative creation, thecontent management system 110 can provide tools that allow for automatic generation of creatives and campaigns that are associated with hashtags. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide a user interface which allows thecontent sponsor 108 to provide an input, such as a keyword, topic, vertical or subject which describes a campaign that thecontent provider 108 would like to create. Thecontent management system 110 can identify one or more hashtags from ahashtagged content repository 124 that match the input. In some implementations, hashtags that match the input and that have an associated popularity that is more than a threshold are identified and presented to the content provider for consideration for inclusion in a campaign. - The
hashtagged content repository 124 can include content (e.g., text content, image content, video content) that has been gathered (e.g., by the content management system 110) from plural, different content sources that are associated with hashtags. Thecontent management system 110 can, for example, gather content from one or both of the firstsocial server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112, store the gathered content in thehashtagged content repository 124, and, in some implementations, index the stored content by hashtags. - When gathering user-generated content, the
content management system 110 can gather only user-generated content to which users have explicitly granted access. For example, acontent provider 108 may run a brand promotion and may encourage users to post or submit content related to the brand promotion. For example, a shoe company can run a campaign centered around a #born2run hashtag and may encourage users to post running photos and other content and tag such content with the #born2run hashtag. User posts and submissions can be, for example, used as entry into a sweepstakes or other contest. The users can agree to use of content associated with a particular hashtag as part of submitting a post associated with the hashtag - The
content management system 110 can retrieve content (e.g., images, videos, textual content) in thehashtagged content repository 124 that is associated with one or more identified hashtags. Thecontent management system 110 can identify content to be used in a creative from one or more landing pages associated with thecontent provider 108. Thecontent management system 110 can automatically generate one or more creatives that include one or more of the one or more identified hashtags, the retrieved hashtag-associated content, and/or the identified landing page content. The creative(s) can be provided to thecontent provider 108 for approval, an indication of approval can be received, and the creative(s) can be used in a campaign. The creatives can be used in an existing campaign and/or in a newly created campaign. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can configure a campaign so that the identified hashtags are used as selection criteria for the campaign. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample system 200 for providing content. A user of afirst user device 202 posts amessage 204 to an activity stream associated with a social network and with the user of thefirst user device 202. Themessage 204 is presented on aweb page 205 and includes ahashtag 206 and animage 208. Themessage 204 can be sent to a social network server 210 (e.g., as a social post 212). Themessage 204, including thehashtag 206 and theimage 208, can be stored in arepository 214 and distributed to users of the social network that are associated with the user of theuser device 202. Thehashtag 206 may be associated, for example, with an XYZ Shoes shoe manufacturer (e.g., thehashtag 206 may be promoted by the XYZ Shoes manufacturer in content campaigns and one or more of the content campaigns may encourage customers of XYZ Shoes to create and promote content and tag such content using the hashtag 206). In some implementations, thehashtag 206 can be used as an index for thesocial post 212 that is stored in therepository 214. For example, therepository 214 may be indexed and searchable by hashtags. Therepository 214 can include metadata for each stored content item, such as a number of affinity designations (e.g., “likes”), or number of publications or re-publications of the content item. Other forms of metadata are possible. - A creative generator server 216 (or another server or system) can gather content from the social network (e.g., from the
repository 214 and/or the social network server 210), and/or from other content sources (e.g., other social networks) that include or present content that is associated with hashtags. For example, thecreative generator server 216 can identify the hashtag in 206 in thesocial post 212 and can identify theimage 208 as additional content that is related to or in proximity to thehashtag 206. In some implementations, thecreative generator server 216 can store the gathered content in ahashtagged content repository 218 and index the stored content by particular hashtags. For example, theimage 208 can be stored in thehashtagged content repository 218 in association with the#born2run hashtag 206. For situations in which user-generated content (e.g., content associated with a hashtag) is stored, such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use. - A creative
generator user interface 220 can be presented on a content sponsor user device 222. The content sponsor can provide an input of a keyword, topic, vertical, or subject using aninput control 224. For example, the content sponsor has provided an input of “running” using theinput control 224. The content sponsor can select acontrol 226 to request automatic generation of one or more creatives based on one or more hashtags that have been identified based on the input specified using theinput control 224. - For example, after selection of the
control 226, the input entered using theinput control 224 can be provided to thecreative generator server 216, as illustrated by asponsor input 228. Thecreative generator server 216 can identify one or more hashtags that are associated with thesponsor input 228. For example, thecreative generator server 216 can identify one or more hashtags in thehashtagged content repository 218 that match (e.g., partial match, exact match, synonym or other conceptual match) thesponsor input 228. As another example, thecreative generator server 216 can identify hashtags based on a match and on prevalence and recency of hashtags in thehashtagged content repository 218. For instance, thecreative generator server 216 can identify highest-rated hashtags in terms of prevalence and relevancy that match thesponsor input 228. For example, thecreative generator server 216 can identify the #born2run hashtag as a hashtag that matches thesponsor input 228 and has at least a minimum prevalence and recency. - The
creative generator server 216 can identify hashtags based on compiled prevalence and recency information. In some implementations, the prevalence and recency information is compiled before thesponsor input 228 is received (e.g., thecreative generator server 216 or another server or system can periodically (e.g., daily) compile the prevalence and recency information). In some implementations, thecreative generator server 216 compiles prevalence and recency information in real time in response to receiving thesponsor input 228. - The
creative generator server 216 can generate one or more creatives based on the identified hashtags. For example, thecreative generator server 216 can generate a creative 230. A creative can, but is not required to include one or more of the identified hashtags as content in the creative. For example, thehashtag #born2run 206 is included in the creative 230. - The
creative generator server 216 can determine content for the creative 230 from multiple sources. For example, content in thehashtagged content repository 218 that is associated with one or more identified hashtags can be used as content in a creative. For example, the creative 230 includes a copy of theimage 208. - As another example, the
creative generator server 216 can generate the creative 230 based at least in part on content included in one or more landing pages associated with the content sponsor. For example, thecreative generator server 216 can identify a landing page (e.g., an address of a landing page) associated with the content sponsor in alanding pages repository 232. For instance, alanding page 234 can be identified. Thecreative generator server 216 can identify content in thelanding page 234 as content to use in the creative 230. For example, the phrase “Find your place to run” can be determined based on an identified hashtag #FindYourPlaceToRun included in thelanding page 234. Landing page content identified for use in a creative can be a hashtag, content associated with (e.g., in proximity to) a hashtag, or other content (e.g., text, images, other types of content) included in the landing page. In addition to landing pages being identified in thelanding pages repository 232, the content sponsor can provide a landing page address (e.g., using the creative generator user interface 220). - In some implementations, the
creative generator server 216 can receive additional content from the content sponsor for inclusion in a generated creative. For example, as shown in anapproval user interface 236, the content sponsor can select anedit control 238 to edit an auto-generated creative. In some implementations, the content sponsor provides content (e.g., using the creativegenerator user interface 220 or another interface) when requesting generation of a creative. - A landing page associated with the content sponsor can be associated with the creative 230 such that the landing page is presented when the creative 230 is presented to a user and the user selects the creative 230. For example, the
creative generator server 216 can associate thelanding page 234 with the creative 230. As another example, the content sponsor can provide input that indicates a landing page to which the creative 230 is to be associated. A generated creative can be (but is not required to be) associated with a landing page from which content was used in generating the creative. For instance, the creative 230 can be associated with a landing page other than thelanding page 234. - The content sponsor can approve a generated creative for use in a campaign associated with the content sponsor. For example, the content sponsor can view a
copy 240 of the generated creative 230 in theapproval user interface 236. The content sponsor can select an approvecontrol 242 to approve the generated creative 230. As mentioned, the content sponsor can edit a generated creative before approval. In response to selection of the approvecontrol 242, anapproval indication input 244 can be sent to thecreative generator server 216. - The
creative generator server 216 or acontent server 246 can associate the creative 230 with a campaign associated with the content sponsor. For example, the creative 230 can be stored in acampaign repository 248 in association withcampaign parameters 250, such as a campaign identifier, a content sponsor identifier, selection criteria, bid information, and other campaign parameters. Thecreative generator server 216 can, for example, configure the campaign so that one or more of the identified hashtags are used as selection criteria for the campaign. - After the creative 230 is associated with a campaign, the
content server 246 can serve the creative 230 in response to received requests for content. For example, aweb page 260 presented on auser device 262 includes acontent slot 264. Theweb page 260 can be configured to send acontent request 266 for thecontent slot 264 to thecontent server 246. Thecontent server 246 can select the creative 230 in response to thecontent request 266 and provide the creative 230 to the user device 262 (e.g., as illustrated by a provided content item 268) for presentation in the content slot 264 (e.g., as illustrated by a displayed creative 270). - Although the above description sets forth an example of creative generation occurring in response to user input, creatives can be automatically generated based on other conditions. For example, the
creative generator server 216 can periodically identify hashtags, hashtagged content, and/or content in landing pages associated with the content sponsor and automatically generate creatives when new hashtags and/or new landing page content is identified. As another example, thecreative generator server 216 can be notified or can determine that landing page content has changed and in response to such an event can automatically identify hashtags, hashtagged content, and/or new landing page content, and generate creatives based on such identified information. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for generating a creative. Theprocess 300 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . - Input from a content sponsor including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject is received (302). Based on the input, one or more hashtags can be identified (304). The input can be received, for example, using a campaign management user interface. The one or more identified hashtags can be hashtags that are related to the keyword, topic, vertical, subject, or another identified hashtag. The one or more hashtags can be identified, for example, in a repository. The repository can include, for example, compiled information on prevalence (e.g., how many posts include the hashtag) and recency of hashtags in content delivered through a social network. The one or more identified hashtags can be the highest rated hashtags that match the keyword, topic, vertical, or subject.
- A creative is generated for an advertising campaign based at least in part on the identified one or more hashtags (306): The creative can be generated for content campaigns other than advertising campaigns. Generating the creative can include using at least one hashtag as content in the creative. In some implementations, additional content is received from the content sponsor or otherwise identified for inclusion along with the one or more hashtags. In some implementations, the creative is generated based on content included in a landing page associated with the content sponsor. For example, the landing page can be evaluated and prominent content in the landing page can be identified and used when generating the creative.
- The creative is provided to the content sponsor for approval (308). For example, the creative can be presented to the content sponsor in an approval user interface, wherein the approval user interface includes an approval user interface control for approving the generated creative, a rejection user interface control for rejecting the generated creative, and one or more editing user interface controls for editing the generated creative.
- An indication of approval is received (310). For example, user input selecting the approval user interface control can be received. The user input selecting the approval user interface control can be received after the user has edited the generated creative.
- The creative is used in a campaign associated with the content sponsor (312). For example, the creative can be selected by a content management system in response to a request for content received by a user device. The creative can be provided to and presented on the user device, such as in a content slot.
-
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for extracting hashtags. The process 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 . For situations in which user-generated content (e.g., content associated with a hashtag) is stored or used, such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use. - Posts by users in one or more social networks are evaluated to extract hashtags (402). For example, as part of the evaluation, a hashtag is identified in a post (404). The post can, for example, be a post on a blog, a post on a wiki, a post by a first user on an activity stream associated with the first user, a post by the first user on an activity stream associated with a second user that is associated with the first user in the social network, a post by the first user on an activity stream that is associated with an entity (e.g., an entity that the first user has chosen to follow or be otherwise associated with), or some other type of social post.
- As part of the evaluation, additional content that is related to or in proximity to the identified hashtag is identified (406). The additional content can include, for example, text content, including one or more other hashtags and/or non-hashtag text, media items (e.g., image, audio, video), or other content.
- The hashtag and the additional content are stored in a data structure (408). In some implementations, metadata related to the hashtag is stored in the data structure in association with the hashtag. Metadata can include, for example, extraction date and time information, a count of extractions associated with a particular hashtag, and other metadata. The hashtag and the additional content can be indexed by the hashtag. Indexing by the hashtag can allow the hashtag and the additional content to be retrieved when the hashtag is provided as a search query.
- For example, input including one or more of a keyword, a topic, a vertical, or a subject is received from a content sponsor (410). The input can be received, for example, using a campaign management user interface.
- The hashtag and additional information related to the hashtag are identified in the data structure (412). For example, a search can be performed on the data structure using the hashtag as a search query. An entry in the data structure that has the hashtag as an index can be identified. The additional information related to the hashtag can include, for example, text information, one or more media content items, or metadata associated with the hashtag.
- A creative is generated that includes the hashtag and the additional information associated with the hashtag (414). For example, a creative can be generated that includes the hashtag and an image that was stored in association with the hashtag. The creative can be used in a campaign associated with the content sponsor. For example, the creative can be selected by a content management system in response to a request for content received by a user device. The creative can be provided to and presented on the user device, such as in a content slot.

In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 504, thestorage device 506, or memory onprocessor 502. - The
high speed controller 508 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 500, while thelow speed controller 512 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is illustrative only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 508 is coupled tomemory 504, display 516 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 510, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 512 is coupled tostorage device 506 and low-speed expansion port 514. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth®, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The computing device 500 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a
standard server 520, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 524. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 522. Alternatively, components from computing device 500 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 550. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device 500, 550, and an entire system may be made up ofmultiple computing devices 500, 550 communicating with each other. -
Computing device 550 includes aprocessor 552,memory 564, an input/output device such as a display 554, acommunication interface 566, and atransceiver 568, among other components. Thedevice 550 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 552 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 550, including instructions stored in thememory 564. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 550, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 550, and wireless communication bydevice 550. -
Processor 552 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 558 anddisplay interface 556 coupled to a display 554. The display 554 may be, for example, a TFT LCD display or an OLED display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 556 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving the display 554 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 558 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 552. In addition, anexternal interface 562 may be provide in communication withprocessor 552, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 550 with other devices.External interface 562 may provide, for example, for wired communication (e.g., via a docking procedure) or for wireless communication (e.g., via Bluetooth® or other such technologies). - The
memory 564 stores information within thecomputing device 550. In one implementation, thememory 564 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 564 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 564 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 574 may also be provided and connected todevice 550 through expansion interface 572, which may include, for example, a SIMM card interface. Such expansion memory 574 may provide extra storage space fordevice 550, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 550. Specifically, expansion memory 574 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 574 may be provide as a security module fordevice 550, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 550. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include for example, flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 564, expansion memory 574, or memory onprocessor 552. -
