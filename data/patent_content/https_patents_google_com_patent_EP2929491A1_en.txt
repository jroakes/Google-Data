- Figure 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for selecting a ranked payment request, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- Figure 5 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- the example embodiments provide a Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) payment system that can employ a user's social graph and location data for identifying likely potential payors for a group transaction or other debt.
- P2P Peer-to-Peer
- the user will have to install an application, use a particular service, or otherwise engage in the techniques herein.
- the potential payors can locate the payment request and satisfy the request.
- the social graph of a user refers to all of a user's contacts, friends, family, and other members of a user's online network.
- the social graph can be any combination of social networks of the user, contact databases of the user, lists of email correspondents of the user, lists of frequent transaction counterparties of the user, and any other suitable social graph data.
- the social graph not only determines the members of a user's network, but also determines how the members are related and how closely the members are related.
- the payment requester can pay a bill at a merchant for a group of users.
- the requester and the group can dine at a restaurant and receive a bill for payment. Instead of splitting the bill into numerous smaller bills, one person can pay for the group.
- a group of users desire to pay for a birthday gift. Instead of collecting money or trying to gather everyone together to make the purchase, one user can buy the gift for the group. Any other suitable group dept can be incurred and require repayment of the debt to a group member who pays the debt.
- the group member who pays the debt can submit a request for repayment on the P2P payment application operating on the user device of the requester.
- the P2P payment application can transmit the request to the P2P payment system.
- the request can be transmitted via any available technology such as an Internet connection over the network, email, text, or any other suitable communication technology.
- the requester can make the request on a website of the P2P payment system or via any other suitable method.
- the request can be managed by another party other than the P2P payment system.
- Any server system can be employed to host the request and monitor the repayment of the debts.
- a social network system can manage the request.
- a bank, credit card issuer, or other suitable financial institution can manage the request.
- a dedicated group payment server system can manage the request.
- the request can be a summary of the debt owed to the requester or any other suitable format to identify the debt.
- the requester can attach a copy or other representation of the bill or receipt.
- the requester can manually enter the request details.
- the P2P payment application can attach the bill payment transaction details from a P2P transaction or other transaction.
- the requester can assign specific amounts for each payor to submit, such as by assigning receipt line items to individual payors.
- the requester can manually input a different amount for each individual payor. Any other suitable format for the request can be submitted by the requester.
- the requester, the P2P payment application, the P2P payment system, or other suitable party assigns an identifier to the request.
- the identifier may be any code, text, picture, or other suitable identifier that will allow a payor to identify and select the correct request for payment.
- the request can be a descriptive identifier input by the requester, such as the date and location of the incurred debt. For example, the identifier could be "Outback Friday at Lunch" or "10PM at Target.”
- the identifier could be the name or a nickname of the requester, a name of the group, a name of the company the payors have in common, or other name identifier. For example, the identifier could be "Grandma Smith gift" or "Jones Company outing.”
- the identifier can be a randomly generated code.
- the code can be generated by the P2P payment application, the P2P payment system, or other suitable party.
- a random code can allow the request to be anonymous and help protect the identity of the transaction, the requester, and the payors.
- the random code can be any alphanumeric code such as "abcl23" or one or more random words. Any other suitable random code can be employed.
- the requester can inform the payors of the random code verbally, via email, via text, or via any other suitable manner.
- the request can be a visual representation. For example, a picture of the event, an avatar of the requester, a random picture or drawing, or any other visual identifier can be used.
- the P2P payment system can identify potential payors for the request.
- the P2P payment system can identify the potential payors from the location of the requester and the location of the potential payors, from the social graph of the recipient and the potential payors, by manual input of the recipient, from any other suitable methods or combination of methods.
- the P2P payment application can employ the Global Positioning System ("GPS") location technology or other location identifying technology of the user device of the requester to transmit the location of the device, and thus the location of the requester.
- the location can be transmitted to a server located in a P2P payment system.
- the P2P payment application can gather the location data directly from the user device or the P2P payment application can request the location from another location-based application operating on the user device.
- the P2P payment application can determine the location of the user device from a device supplying a Wi-Fi connection.
- the recipient can employ a social network application or other suitable application to manually enter the location of the requester or "check in.” Any other suitable location determination hardware or software can be employed.
- the P2P payment system searches for other mobile devices operating in a predetermined proximity of the requester.
- the P2P payment system can use the same location technologies to locate the potential payor devices that the P2P payment system used to locate the recipient or any other location technology.
- the proximity threshold can be configured by the requester or the P2P payment system.
- the proximity threshold can further be variable based upon factors predetermined by the requester or the P2P payment system.
- the P2P payment system may vary the proximity based on the density of the potential payors identified or the quantity of social network data available from the requester's accounts.
- the P2P payment system can first gather the location data and identity of other users that have accounts on the P2P payment system. Additionally or alternatively, the P2P payment system can be configured to communicate with other location-based programs or applications that can supply location data and user identity to the P2P payment system server.
- the location recorded by a potential payor at the time of the request can be determined at a later time. For example, if the recipient entered the request at a time after leaving the location of the transaction, the P2P payment system can determine the transaction time and location and look for potential payors that were at the location at the time of the transaction.
- the potential payors may have an application that has logged the locations of the payor and the P2P payment system can extract the location at the time of the transaction.
- the potential payor may have "checked in” to the location and thus the P2P payment system can extract the location form the "check in” application. Any other suitable location determining method may be utilized to determine which potential payors may have been at the transaction location.
- the P2P payment system can identify potential payors in the social graph of the recipient. From the social graph data, the P2P payment system searches the identities of the requester's contacts, friends, business associates, family members or any other identities that can be extracted.
- the P2P payment system can gather the identities from any social network data available from the recipient's online activities. Examples of locations available from which the P2P payment system may gather data may include, but not be limited to, social network websites accounts, contact list entries, email contacts, or other programs and applications running on recipient user devices.
- the P2P payment system can rank the identities based on a set of criteria configured to determine the most likely potential payors to the user's transaction.
- One of the criteria used by the P2P payment system to rank the results can be based on the status of the contact on the social network status, such as a "friend" on a social network or a friend of a friend. If a friend is on the ranking list, then the friends of that friend may be included on the list and given a certain priority.
- Other criteria may include, but would not be limited to, frequency of emails or texts with a contact, physical distance from user based on the location data, previous transactions with the recipient, or recent activation of the P2P payment system application on the device.
- the P2P payment system compares the list of proximate user identities with a compilation of social network data from the user. Any combination of the location data, social graph data, or other identification or ranking criteria can be employed to identify potential payors.
- the P2P payment system, the recipient, or another suitable party can establish a threshold for an identified contact to be put on the potential payor list.
- the threshold may be based on the closeness of the social graph relationship, the proximity of the user device of the contact, the number of applications on the social graph in which the contact appears, or any suitable factor or combination of factors.
- the P2P payment system can compare the list of identified contacts to the threshold and determine which contacts to include on the potential payors list.
- the recipient can manually input the potential payors to be included in the list.
- the recipient can input the name or other identify of every potential payor.
- the recipient can request that every social network contact is identified as a potential payor.
- the recipient can request that every contact associated with the employer of the recipient is identified as a potential payor.
- the recipient can request that only contacts with which the recipient has had a previous P2P transaction are identified as potential payors. Any other suitable input from the recipient can assist in determining the potential payors.
- the P2P payment system after generating a ranked list of potential payors, can transmit the list to the P2P payment application on the user device of the recipient. The recipient can edit the names and accounts on the list of potential payors on a user interface.
- the P2P payment system can issue the payment request to the potential payors.
- the identification of the request can be listed on the account of the potential payor.
- the request can be emailed to the potential payor, texted to the potential payor, transmitted to a P2P payment application operating on the user device of the potential payor via an Internet connection, or in any suitable manner transmitted to the potential payor.
- a list of requests can be displayed on a website of the P2P payment system.
- the P2P payment system can provide the list of payment requests to all payors who access the P2P payment system. That is, the identifiers are available to every payor for selection. The payor can search the list of all payment requests and select the appropriate request.
- the payor can open the P2P payment application to view the requests for payment. Additionally or alternatively, the payor can access the account of the payor on the website of the P2P payment system or via any other suitable application or website. The payor can access a page or option that displays a ranked list of payment requests associated with the payor. For example, the payor can actuate a real or virtual button, open a link to a website, speak a voice command or in any suitable manner request the list of requests. The payor can view the list of requests in any format available to the user interface being utilized.
- the P2P payment system identifies payment requests that are previously associated with the payor. For example, the P2P payment system can identify payment requests that identified the name of the payor or the account of the payor. In another example, the P2P payment system can identify payment requests that were associated with the payor account at the time of the request. The payor may have been associated with a payment request in any other suitable manner.
- the P2P payment system accesses the location of the payor device at the time that the payor accesses the payment application or views a list of requests.
- the P2P payment system additionally or alternatively, accesses the location history of the payor.
- the location can be obtained from any hardware, software, or combination of hardware and software that can provide a location of the device.
- the global positioning system technology of the device can be used.
- the location can be determined from one or more Wi-Fi systems that communicate with the payor device.
- the location can be determined from a check in on a social network system or other location logging application or website. Any suitable location identifying technology can be employed.
- the P2P payment system accesses and searches the social graph of the payor.
- the social graph of a user refers to all of a user's contacts, friends, family, and other members of a user's online network.
- the social graph can be any combination of social networks of the payor, contact databases of the payor, lists of email correspondents of the payor, lists of frequent transaction counter-parties of the payor, and any other suitable social graph data.
- the search of the social graph not only determines the members of a network of the payor, but also determines how the members are related and how closely the members are related.
- the P2P payment system accesses and searches the transaction history of the payor.
- the transaction history can include some or all of the P2P transactions of the payor or any other suitable transactions accessible by the P2P payment system.
- the history may include the identities or accounts of transaction counter-parties or any suitable identifying characteristic.
- the P2P payment system displays a ranked list of payment requests for the payor.
- the P2P payment system can use the location history of the payor, the social graph information of the payor, and the transaction history of the payor to rank the payment requests.
- the payor can indicate a desire to have the P2P payment system use the data for the purposes of ranking the payment requests. The user can indicate this desire by installing the P2P payment application, providing authorization for the ranking, or otherwise engaging in the techniques herein.
- the P2P payment system can rank the requests by determining the relatedness of the generator of the requester to the payor, the transaction history of the requester and the payor, the relatedness of the location history of the payor and the location at which the payment request was generated, or any other suitable ranking criteria.
- the P2P payment system can compare the location history of the payor to the location of the payment request. For example, the P2P payment system can identify the location of the requester device at the time of the request and determine if the payor was near the identified location at or near the time the request was entered. Based on a determination that the payor was near the identified location at or near the time the request was entered, the P2P payment system can promote the request on the list of payment requests to be presented to the payor.
- the P2P payment system can identify a merchant associated with a receipt included with the payment request.
- the P2P payment system can determine if the payor device was at the merchant at the time of the request or at any other time. Based on a determination that the payor was near the identified location, the P2P payment system can promote the request on the list of payment requests to be presented to the payor.
- the P2P payment system can determine if the requester associated with a request is related to the payor on the social graph of the payor. From the social graph data, the P2P payment system searches the identities of associates of the requester such as contacts, friends, business associates, family members or any other identities that can be extracted.
- the P2P payment system may gather the account identities from any social network data available from the recipient's online activities. Examples of locations available from which the P2P payment system may gather data may include, but not be limited to, social network websites accounts, contact list entries, email contacts, or other programs and applications running on recipient user devices.
- the P2P payment system can use the relatedness of the requestors to the payor to rank the requests.
- One of the criteria used by the P2P payment system to determine the relatedness can be based on the status of the contact on the social network status, such as a "friend" on a social network or a friend of a friend.
- Other criteria may include, but would not be limited to, frequency of emails or texts with a contact, physical distance from user based on the location data, previous transactions with the recipient, or recent activation of the P2P payment system application on the device. Based on the relatedness of a requestor, a request may be promoted or demoted on the ranking of requests.
- the payor can search for a request with a specific identifier.
- the identifier may be any code, text, picture, or other suitable identifier that will allow the payor to identify and select the correct request for payment.
- the request can be a descriptive identifier input by the requester, such as the date and location of the incurred debt.
- the identifier could be "Outback Friday at Lunch" or "10PM at Target.”
- the identifier could be the name or a nickname of the requester, a name of the group, a name of the company the payors have in common, or other name identifier.
- the identifier could be "Grandma Smith gift" or "Jones Company outing.”
- the identifier can be a randomly generated code.
- the code can be generated by the P2P payment application, the P2P payment system, or other suitable party.
- a random code can allow the request to be anonymous and help protect the identity of the transaction, the requester, and the payors.
- the random code can be any alphanumeric code such as "abcl23" or one or more random words. Any other suitable random code can be employed.
- the requester can inform the payors of the random code (or any other identifier) verbally, via email, via text, or via any other suitable manner.
- the payor searches for a payment request, and the request identifier matches the search keywords, then the payment request can be promoted on the request ranking list.
- the identifier can be a visual representation.
- a picture of the event, an avatar of the requester, a randomly generated picture or drawing, or any other visual identifier can be used.
- the display can be presented to the payor on the P2P payment application, on the website of the P2P payment system, or on any other suitable user interface.
- the display can present the top ranked requests, such as the top 5 or top 10 ranked requests.
- the display can present all of the requests that are associated with the payor.
- the display can present a ranked list of all requests in the system. Any other suitable display of the ranked list of requests can be employed and presented to the user.
- the payor can select the request that the payor would like to pay. With the user interface on a P2P payment application, the payor can pay the amount that is requested or the payor can enter an alternate amount to pay. If the request is on the P2P payment system then the P2P payment system can fill in the data to conduct the transaction with the information of the recipient, the payor, and the transaction details. Alternatively, the payor can manually enter the information or select information from a list on the user interface.
- the payor can alternatively pay the recipient in another manner, such as cash or a check, and update the request on the P2P payment system. That is, the payor can utilize the user interface on the P2P payment application or a website of the P2P payment system and manually enter an amount paid to the recipient.
- the P2P payment system can update the request with the entered information. Alternatively, the P2P payment system may require a confirmation of the payment from the recipient before the request is updated.
