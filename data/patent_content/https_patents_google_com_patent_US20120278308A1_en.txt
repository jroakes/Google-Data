- a conventional search service can provide search query suggestions for the input search query.
- a user can select a search query suggestion for use as a search query, e.g., an alternative to the input search query.
- the quality of the search query suggestions can depend on the amount, precision, accuracy, and relevancy of data that is used to generate the search query suggestions.
- This specification describes technologies relating to generation of search query suggestions, e.g., search query suggestions directed to a particular website.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a first set of suggestion data defining custom suggestions for a first website, the first set of suggestion data including one or more first n-grams and one or more second n-grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a first n-gram; generating a suggestion resource, including: indexing the one or more first n-grams; and associating each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective first n-gram; storing the suggestion resource in a computer-readable memory; and providing a search query suggestion tool to the first website, the suggestion tool being configured to generate a search query input field for webpages on the first website, receive a query input entered in the search query input field, and request that one or more query suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the method further includes receiving a first request for one or more input suggestions from the search query input tool provided to the first website; generating the one or more query suggestions based on a first n-gram identified as being represented by the query input and one or more second n-grams associated with the identified first n-gram; and providing the one or more query suggestions in response to the first request.
- the one or more query suggestions are generated as characters are entered in the search query input field and before a complete query is submitted for a search.
- the method further includes receiving a second set of suggestion data defining custom suggestions for a second website, the second set of suggestion data including one or more third n-grams and one or more fourth n-grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a third n-gram; partitioning the suggestion resource into first and second portions, the first portion being the data generated from the indexing the one or more first n-grams and the associating each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams, the second portion being data generated from: indexing the one or more third n-grams; associating each of the one or more third n-grams with the one or more fourth n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective third n-gram; and storing the second portion in the computer-readable memory; and providing a search query suggestion tool to the second website, the suggestion tool being configured to generate a search query input field for webpages on the second website, receive a query input entered in the search query input field, and request that one or more query
- the method further includes receiving a first request for one or more input suggestions from the suggestion tool provided to the first website; generating the one or more query suggestions based on a first n-gram identified as being represented by the query input and one or more second n-grams associated with the identified first n-gram; providing the one or more query suggestions in response to the first request; receiving a second request for one or more input suggestions from the suggestion tool provided to the second website; generating the one or more query suggestions based on a third n-gram identified as being represented by the query input and one or more fourth n-grams associated with the identified third n-gram; and providing the one or more query suggestions in response to the second request.

- the suggestion tool is plug-in software for each of the pages of the website.
- the suggestion data includes associations between first n-grams and second n-grams, each association indicating that a second n-gram is a selectable alternative of an associated first n-gram.
- the input suggestions are query expansions.
- Providing custom suggestions reduces how much user interaction is required to obtain suggestions for an input search query and perform searches using one or more of the suggestions.
- providing custom suggestions can increase the precision, accuracy, and coverage of searches by refining a query before the query is submitted and capturing suggestions that are directed to, e.g., particularly relevant to, a particular website or webpage.

- FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing an example process for generating input suggestions.
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating an example of a flow of data in some implementations of a system that generates a suggestion resource 100 .
- a webmaster 102 provides a first set of suggestion data to a first client 103 .
- the first client 103 sends to a suggestion server 104 the first set of suggestion data.
- the suggestion data includes one or more first n-grams and one or more second n-grams.
- An n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive tokens, e.g., characters or words.
- An n-gram has an order, which is a number of tokens in the n-gram. For example, a 1-gram (or unigram) includes one token; a 2-gram (or bi-gram) includes two tokens. Examples of a 2-gram include “at”, which includes two characters, and “all terrain”, which includes 2 words.
- the second n-grams can be referred to as custom suggestions because they are input suggestions that are defined by webmaster 102 for a particular website.
- the input suggestions can be expansions, completions, or any other n-gram specified by webmaster 102 .
- Suggestion server 104 receives the suggestion data and automatically generates a suggestion resource 100 from the suggestion data.
- Suggestion resource 100 is a searchable data structure that stores the first n-grams, second n-grams, and associations between the first n-grams and second n-grams. The associations identify that a particular second n-gram is a selectable alternative, e.g., a custom suggestion, for an associated first n-gram.
- suggestion server 104 generates a suggestion tool for suggestion resource 100 , and provides the suggestion tool to first client 103 for webmaster 102 , or alternatively to a website 105 that webmaster 102 maintains.
- the suggestion tool e.g., a search query suggestion tool, is configured to modify existing search query input fields or generate a search query input field for webpages on the website.
- the suggestion tool is further configured to receive query input entered in the search query input field and request that one or more custom suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input.
- FIG. 1B is a block diagram illustrating an example of a flow of data in some implementations of a system that generates input suggestions.
- a user 106 on a client device e.g., second client 107 , enters query input, e.g., textual input, in a search query input field of a webpage.
- query input e.g., textual input
- second client 107 sends the query input to suggestion server 104
- suggestion server 104 identifies input suggestions using suggestion resource 100 , as described in further detail below.
- Suggestion server 104 can provide input suggestions to second client 107 for display to user 106 in real time, i.e., as user 106 is typing characters in the search engine query input field.
- the search query input field is provided by the suggestion tool.
- suggestion server 104 can present a first collection of input suggestions associated with a first character typed by user 106 , and present a second collection of input suggestions associated with a sequence of the first character and a second character in response to user 106 typing the second character in the sequence.
- the first set of suggestion data defines a complete set of custom suggestions for the website.
- the first set of suggestion data includes all the suggestions defined by webmaster 102 for the website.
- suggestion server 104 can receive more than one set of suggestion data. Each set of suggestion data is provided for a different website and used to generate a different partition or portion of suggestion resource 100 .
- the suggestion tool also provides to suggestion server 104 an identifier in addition to the query.
- the identifier can be a unique identifier that indicates the source of the request for input suggestions, e.g., the website or webpage in which the query input was entered by user 106 .
- the identifier is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- URI Uniform Resource Identifier
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- the suggestions are a group of second n-grams that are not further organized in a particular hierarchy or classification.
- webmaster 102 can provide suggestion data that includes a first n-gram “food”.
- the suggestion data can further include second n-grams, i.e., custom suggestions for the first n-gram “food”, including “salad”, “vegetable soup”, “fajita”, and “meatloaf”.
- the second n-grams are organized into hierarchies or classifications, e.g., properties.
- the second n-grams can be associated with properties that are related to the first n-gram.
- properties of the first n-gram can, for example, include (1) course and (2) cuisine.
- the custom suggestions “salad” and “vegetable soup” could be associated with the property “appetizer”.
- the custom suggestions “fajita” and “meatloaf” could be associated with the property “entrée”.
- “fajita” could be associated with the property “Mexican” and “meatloaf” could be associated with the property “American”.
- the second n-grams can be selected as custom suggestions for a particular webpage based on the properties.
- webmaster 102 can specify one or more properties from which associated custom suggestions are returned as selectable alternatives.
- webmaster 102 can be responsible for maintaining a website for different ethnic cultures.
- the website can include a webpage about Mexican culture and a different webpage about American culture.
- Webmaster 102 can select the property “Mexican” for the webpage about Mexican culture and the property “American” for the webpage about American culture. Accordingly, if a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about Mexican culture, the custom suggestion “fajita” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “food”. If a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about American culture, the custom suggestion “meatloaf” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “food”.
- the custom suggestion “soccer” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “football”. If a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about American culture, the custom suggestion “National Football League” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “football”.
- webmaster 102 can be responsible for maintaining a website for alumni of a school.
- the custom suggestions can be classified according to properties including home address, email address, and telephone number.
- Second n-grams associated with the properties home address, email address, and telephone number would be particular home addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers, respectively, of alumni members.
- Different groups of custom suggestions can be returned depending on the one or more properties specified for a particular webpage on the website for alumni of a school. For example, if webmaster 102 specified the properties email address and telephone number for a webpage, and a user entered “Da” in a search query input field on the webpage, then email addresses and telephone numbers for “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis” can be returned as custom suggestions.
- FIG. 1C is a block diagram of an example suggestion server, e.g., suggestion server 104 .
- the suggestion server includes a data processing submodule 122 , a suggestion submodule 124 , a search submodule 126 , and a tool generation submodule 128 .
- Data processing submodule 122 parses data received by the suggestion server.
- webmasters provide formatted suggestion data.
- Example formats of the suggestion data include Extensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), line-by-line, and protocol buffers.
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- JSON JavaScript Object Notation
- a protocol buffer is a language and platform neutral, extensible technique for serializing structured data, e.g., by encoding structured data according to Google's data interchange format, Protocol Buffers.
- Data processing submodule 122 parses the formatted suggestion data to identify the first n-grams and the second n-grams that are associated with each first n-gram and that represent a selectable alternative to an associated first n-gram. Data processing submodule 122 can send the processed suggestion data to suggestion submodule 124 , and suggestion submodule 124 can generate a suggestion resource, as described in further detail below with respect to FIG. 2 .
- Tool generation submodule 128 can generate a suggestion tool.
- the suggestion tool is plug-in software, e.g., a JavaScript application programming interface (API), that can be installed on a website.
- API JavaScript application programming interface
- the suggestion tool can provide a search query input field that receives a query input and requests one or more query suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input.
- Data processing submodule 122 can also process requests from suggestion tools.
- Data processing submodule 122 processes a query input to provide the query input in real time or “near” real time, e.g., after a predetermined period of after no further input is received, to search submodule 126 .
- a request from a suggestion tool includes a unique identifier (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the webpage or website from which the request was sent)
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- search submodule 126 uses the identifier to identify a partition of a suggestion resource that should be searched, e.g., according to a row key generated based on the identifier.
- Search submodule 126 and suggestion submodule 124 can use conventional autocomplete techniques, e.g., prefix matching, midfix matching, suffix matching, highlight matching, and locale feature matching, to identify n-grams that the query input may represent.
- selectable alternatives are identified only from custom suggestions specified by a webmaster for a particular website, e.g., by directly comparing the query to the custom suggestions.
- custom suggestions can be used to augment the conventional autocomplete techniques.
- a conventional autocomplete technique can be used to identify n-grams that the query may represent.
- search submodule 126 can identify, from a suggestion resource, custom suggestions for the n-grams that the query input may represent, as described in further detail below with respect to FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example suggestion resource.
- a suggestion resource can be represented by a first data structure 210 (e.g., a database) that includes multiple rows that are indexed by a row key.
- a first data structure 210 e.g., a database
- each row can be represented by a protocol buffer.
- a row key can be a query input (e.g., a first n-gram or third n-gram) indexed by a hash technique, for example.
- Each row corresponds to a set of n-grams (e.g., second n-grams and fourth n-grams) that represent selectable alternatives to a query input (e.g., a first n-gram or a third n-gram) for a website.
- the sets of n-grams can be further classified into subsets that correspond to hierarchies or properties.
- a second data structure 220 (e.g., another database) is used as an index for one or more first data structures (e.g., data structure 200 ).
- Second data structure 220 can be used to “reverse map” a unigram (e.g., a term from an observed sequence of terms in the query input) to one or more row keys of one or more first data structures.
- Second data structure 220 can be a table of cells that is indexed by unigrams in an n-gram.
- Each cell can include a protocol buffer that includes one or more row keys that identify sets of n-grams in the one or more first data structures.
- each cell also includes scope information that defines the scope of a search (e.g., data hierarchies or properties that should be searched).
- the second data structure can include a group of n-grams (e.g., first n-grams) that corresponds to the sequence of characters “Da”.
- the protocol buffer for the group can include row keys that identify sets of n-grams (e.g., second n-grams) in first data structure 210 .
- the protocol buffer for the group of n-grams that corresponds to “Da” can include a first row key for a set of n-grams in the first data structure for “David”, a second row key for a set of n-grams in the first data structure for “Dan”, and a third row key for a set of n-grams in the first data structure for “John Davis”.
- a set of n-grams in the first data structure associated with the first row key can include a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for “David”.
- Another set of n-grams in the first data structure associated with the second row key can include a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for “Dan”.
- Another set of n-grams in the first data structure associated with the third row key can include a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for “John Davis”.
- Webmaster 102 can provide to the suggestion server 104 suggestion data that includes second n-grams, e.g., a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for each of the first n-grams “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”.
- the respective cell phone numbers, office phone numbers, residence addresses, and office addresses are examples of custom suggestions for the n-grams “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”, and represent selectable alternatives to “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”.
- Data processing submodule 122 parses the suggestion data to identify the first n-grams as being “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”, and the second n-grams as being the respective cell phone numbers, office phone numbers, residence addresses, and office addresses.
- Data processing submodule 122 sends the processed suggestion data to suggestion submodule 124 , and suggestion submodule 124 generates the suggestion resource, e.g., the first data structure and the second data structure, using the processed suggestion data.
- the suggestion submodule 124 indexes the first n-grams according to row keys and associates each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective first n-gram.
- Tool generation submodule 128 generates a suggestion tool for accessing the suggestion resource and the suggestion server provides the suggestion tool to a website or a webmaster associated with the website.
- the suggestion tool can be installed on one or more pages of the website to provide an interface for users to enter query input and receive and select custom suggestions.
- search submodule 126 and suggestion submodule 124 can use conventional autocomplete techniques, to identify n-grams that the query input may represent, e.g., “David” (using prefix matching), “Dan” (using prefix matching), and “John Davis” (using midfix matching) for “Da”.
- Search submodule 126 can use the identified n-grams to locate row keys in second data structure 220 identify custom suggestions, e.g., sets of n-grams in first data structure 210 .
- email addresses and telephone numbers can be identified from the sets of n-grams in the first data structure and returned as custom suggestions.
- webmaster 102 or a different webmaster can provide suggestion data for another webpage or website to generate a different portion of suggestion resource 200 , e.g., the group of third n-grams and fourth n-grams.
- N-grams and custom suggestions for the n-grams for each website or webpage can be considered to be stored in different portions of each of the data structures, e.g., first and second data structures 210 and 220 .
- the row keys can be a hash of the query input and the identifier, e.g., the particular website or webpage from which the query input was obtained. Accordingly, only custom suggestions directed to the particular webpage or website are identified and returned as selectable alternatives to the query input.
- another suggestion tool can also be generated.
- a single service provided by suggestion server 104 and suggestion resource 100 can store and retrieve custom suggestions directed to a particular website or webpage from a collection of custom suggestions for different websites and webpages by using the identifiers that indicate a source of a request, i.e., the particular website or webpage from which the request for custom suggestions originated.
- a single data structure e.g., one database
- a binary search can be used to search the first data structure to identify custom suggestions.
- an access table e.g., the second data structure
- a different suggestion resource is generated for each webpage or website.
- FIG. 3 is a screenshot illustrating an example of a webpage presenting a group of input suggestions.
- a suggestion tool is installed on the webpage.
- the suggestion tool can generate a query input field (e.g., query input field 310 ) or modify the query input field 310 (e.g., an existing input field) such that custom suggestions are provided in response to textual input, e.g., the sequence of characters “pb”, entered in the query input field 310 by a user.
- the custom suggestions for “peanu” are “peanut butter”, “jelly”, “honey roasted”, “chunky”, and “smooth”.
- “jelly”, “honey roasted”, “chunky”, and “smooth” can be custom suggestions specified in suggestion data for the webpage.
- “peanut butter” can be an input suggestion obtained from a conventional search service, e.g., a conventional suggestion service provided by a search engine.
- the custom suggestions can be presented to the user based on a ranking.
- the webmaster can specify rankings of each custom suggestion in the suggestion data.
- the ranking can be based on a separate authority ranking that measures the importance of each custom suggestion relative to other custom suggestions.
- the scores are computed from dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a custom suggestion, and the ranking of the custom suggestions is based on relevance scores.
- the custom suggestions can be ordered according to the rankings and provided to the user according to the order.
- suggestion server can create a suggestion management tool, e.g., a dashboard, that can provide statistics of users and facilitate modification of the suggestion resources, e.g., add, delete, change the suggestion resource.
- a suggestion management tool e.g., a dashboard
- FIG. 4A is a flow chart showing an example process for generating a suggestion tool.
- the process can be implemented in the suggestion server 104 .
- the process includes receiving a first set of suggestion data defining custom suggestions for a first website, the first set of suggestion data including one or more first n-grams and one or more second n-grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a first n-gram ( 410 ).

The first set of suggestion data includes one or more first n grams and one or more second n grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a first n gram. The method also includes generating a suggestion resource and providing a search query suggestion tool to the first website, the suggestion tool being configured to generate a search query input field for webpages on the first website, receive a query input entered in the search query input field, and request that one or more query suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input.
Description
- This specification relates to digital data processing, and in particular, to computer-implemented search services.
- Conventional search services provide search query suggestions as alternatives to input search queries. For example, a webpage can include a search query input field that receives an input search query. In response to receiving the input search query, a conventional search service can provide search query suggestions for the input search query. A user can select a search query suggestion for use as a search query, e.g., an alternative to the input search query. The quality of the search query suggestions can depend on the amount, precision, accuracy, and relevancy of data that is used to generate the search query suggestions.
- This specification describes technologies relating to generation of search query suggestions, e.g., search query suggestions directed to a particular website.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a first set of suggestion data defining custom suggestions for a first website, the first set of suggestion data including one or more first n-grams and one or more second n-grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a first n-gram; generating a suggestion resource, including: indexing the one or more first n-grams; and associating each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective first n-gram; storing the suggestion resource in a computer-readable memory; and providing a search query suggestion tool to the first website, the suggestion tool being configured to generate a search query input field for webpages on the first website, receive a query input entered in the search query input field, and request that one or more query suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- The foregoing and following embodiments can optionally include one or more of the following features. The method further includes receiving a first request for one or more input suggestions from the search query input tool provided to the first website; generating the one or more query suggestions based on a first n-gram identified as being represented by the query input and one or more second n-grams associated with the identified first n-gram; and providing the one or more query suggestions in response to the first request. The one or more query suggestions are generated as characters are entered in the search query input field and before a complete query is submitted for a search.
- The method further includes receiving a second set of suggestion data defining custom suggestions for a second website, the second set of suggestion data including one or more third n-grams and one or more fourth n-grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a third n-gram; partitioning the suggestion resource into first and second portions, the first portion being the data generated from the indexing the one or more first n-grams and the associating each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams, the second portion being data generated from: indexing the one or more third n-grams; associating each of the one or more third n-grams with the one or more fourth n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective third n-gram; and storing the second portion in the computer-readable memory; and providing a search query suggestion tool to the second website, the suggestion tool being configured to generate a search query input field for webpages on the second website, receive a query input entered in the search query input field, and request that one or more query suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the query input.
- The method further includes receiving a first request for one or more input suggestions from the suggestion tool provided to the first website; generating the one or more query suggestions based on a first n-gram identified as being represented by the query input and one or more second n-grams associated with the identified first n-gram; providing the one or more query suggestions in response to the first request; receiving a second request for one or more input suggestions from the suggestion tool provided to the second website; generating the one or more query suggestions based on a third n-gram identified as being represented by the query input and one or more fourth n-grams associated with the identified third n-gram; and providing the one or more query suggestions in response to the second request.
- The method further includes associating the first portion of the suggestion resource with a first identifier; and associating the second portion of the suggestion resource with a second identifier; where the search query suggestion tool provided to the first website is configured to include the first identifier with the first request; the search query suggestion tool provided to the second website is configured to include the second identifier with the second request; generating the one or more query suggestions based on the first n-gram includes determining that the first identifier of the first requests matches the first identifier associated with the first portion and in response using the first portion of the suggestion resource for generating the one or more query suggestions; and generating the one or more query suggestions based on the third n-gram includes determining that the second identifier of the second requests matches the second identifier associated with the second portion and in response using the second portion of the suggestion resource for generating the one or more query suggestions.
- The suggestion tool is plug-in software for each of the pages of the website. The suggestion data includes associations between first n-grams and second n-grams, each association indicating that a second n-gram is a selectable alternative of an associated first n-gram. The input suggestions are query expansions.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Providing custom suggestions reduces how much user interaction is required to obtain suggestions for an input search query and perform searches using one or more of the suggestions. In addition to saving time, providing custom suggestions can increase the precision, accuracy, and coverage of searches by refining a query before the query is submitted and capturing suggestions that are directed to, e.g., particularly relevant to, a particular website or webpage.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating an example of a flow of data in some implementations of a system that generates asuggestion resource 100. Awebmaster 102 provides a first set of suggestion data to afirst client 103. Thefirst client 103 sends to asuggestion server 104 the first set of suggestion data. The suggestion data includes one or more first n-grams and one or more second n-grams. - An n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive tokens, e.g., characters or words. An n-gram has an order, which is a number of tokens in the n-gram. For example, a 1-gram (or unigram) includes one token; a 2-gram (or bi-gram) includes two tokens. Examples of a 2-gram include “at”, which includes two characters, and “all terrain”, which includes 2 words.
- The second n-grams, in the suggestion data, each represent selectable alternatives to a first n-gram. The second n-grams can be referred to as custom suggestions because they are input suggestions that are defined by
webmaster 102 for a particular website. For example, the input suggestions can be expansions, completions, or any other n-gram specified bywebmaster 102. -
Suggestion server 104 receives the suggestion data and automatically generates asuggestion resource 100 from the suggestion data.Suggestion resource 100 is a searchable data structure that stores the first n-grams, second n-grams, and associations between the first n-grams and second n-grams. The associations identify that a particular second n-gram is a selectable alternative, e.g., a custom suggestion, for an associated first n-gram. - In addition,
suggestion server 104 generates a suggestion tool forsuggestion resource 100, and provides the suggestion tool tofirst client 103 forwebmaster 102, or alternatively to awebsite 105 thatwebmaster 102 maintains. The suggestion tool, e.g., a search query suggestion tool, is configured to modify existing search query input fields or generate a search query input field for webpages on the website. The suggestion tool is further configured to receive query input entered in the search query input field and request that one or more custom suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input. -
FIG. 1B is a block diagram illustrating an example of a flow of data in some implementations of a system that generates input suggestions. Auser 106 on a client device, e.g.,second client 107, enters query input, e.g., textual input, in a search query input field of a webpage. Asuser 106 enters the query input,second client 107 sends the query input tosuggestion server 104, andsuggestion server 104 identifies input suggestions usingsuggestion resource 100, as described in further detail below. -
Suggestion server 104 can provide input suggestions tosecond client 107 for display touser 106 in real time, i.e., asuser 106 is typing characters in the search engine query input field. In some implementations, the search query input field is provided by the suggestion tool. For example,suggestion server 104 can present a first collection of input suggestions associated with a first character typed byuser 106, and present a second collection of input suggestions associated with a sequence of the first character and a second character in response touser 106 typing the second character in the sequence. - In some implementations, the first set of suggestion data defines a complete set of custom suggestions for the website. In other words, the first set of suggestion data includes all the suggestions defined by
webmaster 102 for the website. Other implementations are possible. For example,suggestion server 104 can receive more than one set of suggestion data. Each set of suggestion data is provided for a different website and used to generate a different partition or portion ofsuggestion resource 100. - In these and other implementations, the suggestion tool also provides to
suggestion server 104 an identifier in addition to the query. The identifier can be a unique identifier that indicates the source of the request for input suggestions, e.g., the website or webpage in which the query input was entered byuser 106. In some implementations, the identifier is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The different partitions or portions ofsuggestion resource 100 can each be associated with the unique identifier that indicates that the partition or portion was generated using suggestion data provided for the website identified by the unique identifier. - In some implementations, the suggestions are a group of second n-grams that are not further organized in a particular hierarchy or classification. For example,
webmaster 102 can provide suggestion data that includes a first n-gram “food”. The suggestion data can further include second n-grams, i.e., custom suggestions for the first n-gram “food”, including “salad”, “vegetable soup”, “fajita”, and “meatloaf”. - In alternative implementations, the second n-grams are organized into hierarchies or classifications, e.g., properties. The second n-grams can be associated with properties that are related to the first n-gram. Returning to the previous example, properties of the first n-gram can, for example, include (1) course and (2) cuisine. The custom suggestions “salad” and “vegetable soup” could be associated with the property “appetizer”. The custom suggestions “fajita” and “meatloaf” could be associated with the property “entrée”. Furthermore, “fajita” could be associated with the property “Mexican” and “meatloaf” could be associated with the property “American”.
- The second n-grams can be selected as custom suggestions for a particular webpage based on the properties. In particular,
webmaster 102 can specify one or more properties from which associated custom suggestions are returned as selectable alternatives. For example,webmaster 102 can be responsible for maintaining a website for different ethnic cultures. The website can include a webpage about Mexican culture and a different webpage about American culture.Webmaster 102 can select the property “Mexican” for the webpage about Mexican culture and the property “American” for the webpage about American culture. Accordingly, if a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about Mexican culture, the custom suggestion “fajita” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “food”. If a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about American culture, the custom suggestion “meatloaf” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “food”. - As another example, if a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about Mexican culture, the custom suggestion “soccer” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “football”. If a user enters “foo” in a search query input field on the webpage about American culture, the custom suggestion “National Football League” can be returned, e.g., as a selectable alternative to “football”.
- As another example,
webmaster 102 can be responsible for maintaining a website for alumni of a school. The custom suggestions can be classified according to properties including home address, email address, and telephone number. Second n-grams associated with the properties home address, email address, and telephone number would be particular home addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers, respectively, of alumni members. Different groups of custom suggestions can be returned depending on the one or more properties specified for a particular webpage on the website for alumni of a school. For example, ifwebmaster 102 specified the properties email address and telephone number for a webpage, and a user entered “Da” in a search query input field on the webpage, then email addresses and telephone numbers for “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis” can be returned as custom suggestions. -
FIG. 1C is a block diagram of an example suggestion server, e.g.,suggestion server 104. The suggestion server includes a data processing submodule 122, a suggestion submodule 124, asearch submodule 126, and atool generation submodule 128. - Data processing submodule 122 parses data received by the suggestion server. In some implementations, webmasters provide formatted suggestion data. Example formats of the suggestion data include Extensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), line-by-line, and protocol buffers. A protocol buffer is a language and platform neutral, extensible technique for serializing structured data, e.g., by encoding structured data according to Google's data interchange format, Protocol Buffers.
- Data processing submodule 122 parses the formatted suggestion data to identify the first n-grams and the second n-grams that are associated with each first n-gram and that represent a selectable alternative to an associated first n-gram. Data processing submodule 122 can send the processed suggestion data to suggestion submodule 124, and suggestion submodule 124 can generate a suggestion resource, as described in further detail below with respect to
FIG. 2 . -
Tool generation submodule 128 can generate a suggestion tool. In some implementations, the suggestion tool is plug-in software, e.g., a JavaScript application programming interface (API), that can be installed on a website. Upon installation on a webpage of a website, the suggestion tool can provide a search query input field that receives a query input and requests one or more query suggestions be provided as selectable alternatives to the search query input. - Data processing submodule 122 can also process requests from suggestion tools. Data processing submodule 122 processes a query input to provide the query input in real time or “near” real time, e.g., after a predetermined period of after no further input is received, to search
submodule 126. In implementations where a request from a suggestion tool includes a unique identifier (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the webpage or website from which the request was sent), data processing submodule 122 parses the identifier and provides the identifier to searchsubmodule 126.Search submodule 126 uses the identifier to identify a partition of a suggestion resource that should be searched, e.g., according to a row key generated based on the identifier. -
Search submodule 126 and suggestion submodule 124 can use conventional autocomplete techniques, e.g., prefix matching, midfix matching, suffix matching, highlight matching, and locale feature matching, to identify n-grams that the query input may represent. In some implementations, selectable alternatives are identified only from custom suggestions specified by a webmaster for a particular website, e.g., by directly comparing the query to the custom suggestions. In some alternative implementations, custom suggestions can be used to augment the conventional autocomplete techniques. For example, a conventional autocomplete technique can be used to identify n-grams that the query may represent. Then, searchsubmodule 126 can identify, from a suggestion resource, custom suggestions for the n-grams that the query input may represent, as described in further detail below with respect toFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example suggestion resource. In some implementations, a suggestion resource can be represented by a first data structure 210 (e.g., a database) that includes multiple rows that are indexed by a row key. - In particular, each row can be represented by a protocol buffer. A row key can be a query input (e.g., a first n-gram or third n-gram) indexed by a hash technique, for example. Each row corresponds to a set of n-grams (e.g., second n-grams and fourth n-grams) that represent selectable alternatives to a query input (e.g., a first n-gram or a third n-gram) for a website. The sets of n-grams can be further classified into subsets that correspond to hierarchies or properties.
- A second data structure 220(e.g., another database) is used as an index for one or more first data structures (e.g., data structure 200). Second data structure 220 can be used to “reverse map” a unigram (e.g., a term from an observed sequence of terms in the query input) to one or more row keys of one or more first data structures. Second data structure 220 can be a table of cells that is indexed by unigrams in an n-gram. Each cell can include a protocol buffer that includes one or more row keys that identify sets of n-grams in the one or more first data structures. In some implementations, each cell also includes scope information that defines the scope of a search (e.g., data hierarchies or properties that should be searched).
- Returning to the previous example where
webmaster 102 is responsible for maintaining a website for alumni of a school, the second data structure can include a group of n-grams (e.g., first n-grams) that corresponds to the sequence of characters “Da”. The protocol buffer for the group can include row keys that identify sets of n-grams (e.g., second n-grams) in first data structure 210. For example, the protocol buffer for the group of n-grams that corresponds to “Da” can include a first row key for a set of n-grams in the first data structure for “David”, a second row key for a set of n-grams in the first data structure for “Dan”, and a third row key for a set of n-grams in the first data structure for “John Davis”. - A set of n-grams in the first data structure associated with the first row key can include a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for “David”. Another set of n-grams in the first data structure associated with the second row key can include a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for “Dan”. Another set of n-grams in the first data structure associated with the third row key can include a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for “John Davis”.
-
Webmaster 102 can provide to thesuggestion server 104 suggestion data that includes second n-grams, e.g., a cell phone number, an office phone number, a residence address, and an office address for each of the first n-grams “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”. The respective cell phone numbers, office phone numbers, residence addresses, and office addresses are examples of custom suggestions for the n-grams “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”, and represent selectable alternatives to “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”. - Data processing submodule 122 parses the suggestion data to identify the first n-grams as being “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis”, and the second n-grams as being the respective cell phone numbers, office phone numbers, residence addresses, and office addresses. Data processing submodule 122 sends the processed suggestion data to suggestion submodule 124, and suggestion submodule 124 generates the suggestion resource, e.g., the first data structure and the second data structure, using the processed suggestion data.
- In particular, the suggestion submodule 124 indexes the first n-grams according to row keys and associates each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective first n-gram.
Tool generation submodule 128 generates a suggestion tool for accessing the suggestion resource and the suggestion server provides the suggestion tool to a website or a webmaster associated with the website. The suggestion tool can be installed on one or more pages of the website to provide an interface for users to enter query input and receive and select custom suggestions. - If a user enters “Da” in a search query input field on the webpage, then search submodule 126 and suggestion submodule 124 can use conventional autocomplete techniques, to identify n-grams that the query input may represent, e.g., “David” (using prefix matching), “Dan” (using prefix matching), and “John Davis” (using midfix matching) for “Da”.
Search submodule 126 can use the identified n-grams to locate row keys in second data structure 220 identify custom suggestions, e.g., sets of n-grams in first data structure 210. - If
webmaster 102 specified the properties email address and telephone numbers for defining a scope of custom suggestions to be returned for a webpage, and a user entered “Da” in a search query input field on the webpage, then email addresses and telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and office phone numbers) for “David”, “Dan”, and “John Davis” can be identified from the sets of n-grams in the first data structure and returned as custom suggestions. - Similarly,
webmaster 102 or a different webmaster can provide suggestion data for another webpage or website to generate a different portion ofsuggestion resource 200, e.g., the group of third n-grams and fourth n-grams. N-grams and custom suggestions for the n-grams for each website or webpage can be considered to be stored in different portions of each of the data structures, e.g., first and second data structures 210 and 220. In particular, the row keys can be a hash of the query input and the identifier, e.g., the particular website or webpage from which the query input was obtained. Accordingly, only custom suggestions directed to the particular webpage or website are identified and returned as selectable alternatives to the query input. In some implementations, another suggestion tool can also be generated. - Consolidating custom suggestions for different websites and webpages, in this manner, increases the efficiency of generating and providing selectable alternatives for search queries. In particular, a single service provided by
suggestion server 104 andsuggestion resource 100 can store and retrieve custom suggestions directed to a particular website or webpage from a collection of custom suggestions for different websites and webpages by using the identifiers that indicate a source of a request, i.e., the particular website or webpage from which the request for custom suggestions originated. - Other implementations are possible. For example, other types of data structures (e.g., linear and non-linear data structures) can be used to store the suggestion resource. In addition, in some implementations, a single data structure (e.g., one database) is used to store the information instead of a separate first data structure and second data structure. In some implementations, only the first data structure is generated and a binary search can be used to search the first data structure to identify custom suggestions. In other words, an access table, e.g., the second data structure, is not generated. In some implementations, a different suggestion resource is generated for each webpage or website.
-
FIG. 3 is a screenshot illustrating an example of a webpage presenting a group of input suggestions. In particular, a suggestion tool is installed on the webpage. The suggestion tool can generate a query input field (e.g., query input field 310) or modify the query input field 310 (e.g., an existing input field) such that custom suggestions are provided in response to textual input, e.g., the sequence of characters “pb”, entered in thequery input field 310 by a user. In the example ofFIG. 3 , the custom suggestions for “peanu” are “peanut butter”, “jelly”, “honey roasted”, “chunky”, and “smooth”. In particular, “jelly”, “honey roasted”, “chunky”, and “smooth” can be custom suggestions specified in suggestion data for the webpage. In addition, “peanut butter” can be an input suggestion obtained from a conventional search service, e.g., a conventional suggestion service provided by a search engine. - In some implementations, the custom suggestions can be presented to the user based on a ranking. The webmaster can specify rankings of each custom suggestion in the suggestion data. Optionally the ranking can be based on a separate authority ranking that measures the importance of each custom suggestion relative to other custom suggestions. In some implementations, the scores are computed from dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a custom suggestion, and the ranking of the custom suggestions is based on relevance scores. The custom suggestions can be ordered according to the rankings and provided to the user according to the order.
- Other implementations are possible. For example, suggestion server can create a suggestion management tool, e.g., a dashboard, that can provide statistics of users and facilitate modification of the suggestion resources, e.g., add, delete, change the suggestion resource.
-
FIG. 4A is a flow chart showing an example process for generating a suggestion tool. The process can be implemented in thesuggestion server 104. The process includes receiving a first set of suggestion data defining custom suggestions for a first website, the first set of suggestion data including one or more first n-grams and one or more second n-grams that each represent a selectable alternative to a first n-gram (410). The process also includes generating a suggestion resource by indexing the one or more first n-grams, and associating each of the one or more first n-grams with the one or more second n-grams that represent selectable alternatives to the respective first n-gram (420).
