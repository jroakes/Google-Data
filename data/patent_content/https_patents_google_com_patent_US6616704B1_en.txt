Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to a very fast method for correcting the spelling of a word or phrase in a document.
- the method has application to any technique which searches documents.
- the edit distance between two words is the smallest number of operations which transform the candidate word into the given word (each operation consisting of removing one letter, adding one letter, replacing one letter with another letter, or transposing two letters).
- a method which proceeds in two steps: first applying a very fast method (comparing G to each candidate word) for eliminating most candidate words from consideration (without computing the exact edit distance between G and any candidate word), followed by the “slow method” which computes the exact edit distance between G and each of the few remaining candidate words.
- the second step is the slow exact method well-known in the art as described by Ukkonen.
- the invention consists of (1) a new fast approximate method and (2) combining this fast approximate method with the slow method.
- the combination results in a method that is almost as fast as the fast approximate method and as exact as the slow method.
- FIGS. 1A and 1B taken together, are a flow diagram showing the logic of the algorithm implemented by the invention.
- G is the given word whose spelling is to be corrected.
- S is the set of candidate words or phrases to be processed.
- ⁇ is the maximal edit distance for determining whether a candidate word is acceptable; i.e., if the edit distance between G and a candidate word C exceeds ⁇ , then C is unacceptable.
- W is the set of words that are within distance ⁇ of G.
- G poll is a vector indexed by the letters of the alphabet under consideration.
- the process begins by inputting a list of candidate words at function block 101 .
- a test is made in decision block 102 to determine if all words from the candidate word list have been processed. If so, the process returns the set of words W to the main program; otherwise, the next (non-null) candidate word is accessed in function block 103 .
- the value of the integer C val is initialized and set to zero.
- the value of the integer G val is initialized and set to the length of the given word G.
- the vector G poll is initialized by setting its entries equal to the number of times each corresponding letter of the alphabet appears in the word G.
- the next letter l of the candidate word C is accessed in function block 107 .
- a test is made in decision block 108 to determine if G poll (l) is greater than zero. If so, G poll (l) is decremented by one in function block 109 , and Gval is decremented by one in function block 110 .
- the process then proceeds to decision block 113 . If, however, G poll (l) is zero, then C val is incremented by one in function block 111 .
- a test is made in decision block 112 to determine if C val is greater than the maximal edit distance ⁇ . If so, the process loops back to decision block 102 to determine if there are more words to be processed. If not, the process proceeds to decision block 113 .
