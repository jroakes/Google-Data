Definitions
- the present invention is related to Ser. No. 09/872,554, entitled “READBACK SIGNAL DETECTION AND ANALYSIS IN A MAGNETIC DATA STORAGE SYSTEM”, concurrently filed on Jun. 1, 2001, having the same inventors and assignee as the present invention.
- the present invention relates generally to data storage systems, and more particularly, to envelope detection in a magnetic data storage system.
- a typical magnetic data storage system includes one or more data storage disks coaxially mounted on a hub of a spindle motor.
- the spindle motor rotates the disks at speeds typically on the order of several thousand revolutions-per-minute.
- Digital information representing various types of data, is typically written to and read from the data storage disks by one or more transducers, or read/write heads, which are mounted to an actuator and passed over the surface of the rapidly rotating disks.
- the actuator typically includes one or more outwardly extending arms to which in-line suspensions are attached and onto which one or more air bearing sliders are mounted at a distal end of the suspensions.
- One or more transducers are disposed on the air bearing slider. Airflow produced above the disk surface by the rapidly rotating disks results in the production of an air bearing upon which the aerodynamic slider is supported, thus causing the slider to fly a small distance above the rotating disk surface.
- the actuator arms are interleaved into and out of the stack of rotating disks, typically by means of a rotary voice coil assembly mounted to the actuator.
- the rotary voice coil assembly generally interacts with a permanent magnet structure, and the application of current to the coil in one polarity causes the actuator arms, suspensions and sliders to shift in one radial direction, while current of the opposite polarity shifts the actuator arms and sliders in an opposite radial direction.
- digital data is stored in the form of magnetic transitions on a series of concentric, closely spaced tracks comprising the surface of the magnetizable rigid data storage disks.
- the tracks are generally divided into a plurality of sectors, with each sector comprising a number of information fields.
- One of the information fields is typically designated for storing data, while other fields contain sector identification, synchronization and radial position information, for example.
- Data is transferred to and retrieved from specified track and sector locations by the transducers being moved from track to track, typically under the control of a position controller.
- the transducer also referred to as a read/write head, is one of the most important components in a magnetic disk drive system.
- the transducer assembly typically includes a read element and a write element.
- a common type of read element is the magnetoresistive (MR) head.
- MR magnetoresistive
- a conventional read head operates by sensing the rate of change of magnetic flux transitions stored on the surface of a magnetic disk.
- the MR head produces an electrical output signal in response to the sensed magnetic flux transitions.
- the MR head's output signal is velocity independent.
- Writing data to a data storage disk generally involves passing a current through the write element of the transducer assembly to produce magnetic lines of flux which magnetize a specific location of the disk surface. Reading data from a specified disk location is typically accomplished by a MR read element transducer sensing the magnetic field or flux lines emanating from the magnetized locations of the disk. As the read element passes over the rotating disk surface, the interaction between the read element and the emanating field from the magnetized locations on the disk surface results in the production of electrical signals, commonly referred to as readback signals, in the read element.
- MR heads represent an important improvement in magnetic disk drive systems.
- the output signal of a MR head is not dependent on the relative velocity between the head and the disk.
- MR heads may employ an inductive write element.
- a MR head uses a modified read element employing features such as a thin sensing element called an “MR stripe”.
- the MR stripe operates based upon the magnetoresistive effect. Namely, the resistance of the MR stripe changes in proportion to the magnetic field of the disk, passing by the MR stripe. If the MR stripe is driven with a constant bias current, the voltage across the MR stripe is proportional to its resistance. Thus, the MR stripe's voltage represents the magnetic signals encoded on the disk surface. In other arrangements, a constant voltage is applied to the MR stripe, and the resultant current is measured to detect magnetic signals stored on the disk surface.
- MR heads are especially susceptible to certain errors. Namely, the resistance of the MR stripe varies in response to heating and cooling of the MR stripe, in addition to the magnetic flux signals encoded on the disk surface. Normally, the MR stripe maintains a steady state temperature as the slider flies over the disk surface, separated by a thin cushion of air created by the rapidly spinning disk. In this state, the stored magnetic flux signals contribute most significantly to the MR stripe's output signals, as intended. An MR stripe, however, may experience heating under certain conditions, especially when the MR head inadvertently contacts another object on the disk.
- Physical contact with the MR head may occur in a number of different ways.
- the MR head may contact a raised irregularity in the disk surface, such as a defect in the material of the disk surface or a contaminant such as a particle of dust, debris, etc.
- the MR head may contact the disk surface during a high shock event, where G-forces momentarily bounce the MR head against the disk surface.
- thermal asperity A read channel in a magnetic disk drive, however, requires a reliable readback signal from the MR head, free from irregularities such as thermal asperities. Consequently, severe thermal asperities may prevent the read channel from correctly processing output signals of the MR head, causing a data error.
- thermal asperities may be manifested in a number of different ways. For instance, severe distortions of the readback signal may cause the magnetic disk drive to shut down. Other data errors may simply prevent reading of data on the disk. Such data errors may also prevent writing of data, if the servo signal embedded in the disk cannot be read correctly, or it indicates that the head is too far off track to write data without overwriting data on an adjacent track. This condition is called a “write inhibit error”. If data errors of this type persist, the disk drive may deem the entire sector “bad”, causing a write inhibit “hard” error. Repeated thermal asperities may also cause a disk drive to fail a predictive failure analysis measure, falsely signaling an impending disk failure to the disk drive user. As shown by the foregoing, thermal asperities in magnetic disk drive systems may cause significant problems in disk drives that use MR heads.
- the thermal asperites and other heating/cooling events contribute a thermal signal component (baseline-wander) to the overall readback signal.
- the readback signal may be understood as a composite signal comprising a magnetic component and the thermal component.
- the thermal signal component has been used to advantage in detecting any surface defects on disks.
- the thermal signal component By monitoring the thermal signal component of a readback signal, the foregoing problems related to thermal asperties may be identified and eliminated or mitigated.
- One attempt to address the effects of thermal asperities is by separating a thermal signal component from the magnetic component. Once separated, the thermal signal component may be analyzed to determine the presence of surface defects on a disk.
- Head modulation refers to a time varying fly height of the read/write head which may produce hard read errors or write-verify errors.
- the modulation occurs because of a resonance instability in the head-slider during the read/write-operation. This resonance may be due to airbearing resonance, suspension resonance, slider instability, etc. Head modulation may also be non-periodic which is caused by contact with asperities on the disk surface.
- the problem manifests itself by causing sinusoidal modulations of the readback signal at the airbearing resonance frequency, typically around 200-250 kHz for modern sliders.
- the head modulations can be present on one track or just a single sector, while the adjacent tracks and sectors are free from modulations.
- FIG. 1 shows a readback signal 100 contained within an upper envelope 102 a and a lower envelope 102 b.
- the sinusoidal modulation of the envelopes 102 a-b is clearly visible. This gives rise to data errors in the readback signal 100 .
- An automatic gain control uses a signal derived from the envelope of the readback signal to maintain a constant amplitude of the readback signal before detection by the data channel.
- a void in the magnetic-coating on the disk surface is easily detected as a very low level output of the envelope signal.
- the time/frequency analysis of magnitude variations in the envelope of the readback signal can, in many cases, reveal problems with the head/disk interference caused by defects on the disk surface, by suspension resonances, by airbearing resonances, by local aerodynamic instabilities of the slider, etc.
- FIG. 2 shows two lowpass-filtered, full-wave rectified representations of the upper envelope 102 a of the readback signal 100 (shown in FIG. 1 ). Specifically, a high-frequency bandwidth envelope 202 and a low-frequency envelope bandwidth 204 are shown. The high-frequency bandwidth envelope was the lowpass filtered at 5 MHz, while the low-frequency bandwidth envelope was lowpass filtered at 0.5 MHz. The lowpass filter was a sixth-order, elliptic filter. The sampling rate for this readback data was 500 MHz. Each envelope 202 , 204 substantially fails to provide an accurate representation of the upper envelope 102 a of the readback signal 100 .
- a method comprises receiving an envelope of a frequency modulated readback signal representative of data read by a head assembly from a storage medium and determining modulation activity of the head assembly based on amplitude characteristics of the envelope. Then, at least one of a read operation and a write operation is terminated.
- Another embodiment provides a signal bearing medium, comprising a sorting program for determining values of a readback signal envelope in order to determine head modulation activity of a head assembly in a disk drive facility.

- Method 600 is entered from method 500 at step 602 .
- the method 600 gets two samples from a window.
- the two samples are sorted as a two-element list. In the case of determining the Nth largest sample, the list is sorted in descending order. In the case of determining the Nth smallest sample, the list is sorted in ascending order.
- step 608 another input sample from the window is retrieved.
- the method 600 queries whether the sample retrieved at step 608 is greater than the second element in the sorted list, in the case of determining the Nth largest sample, or less than the second element in the list, in the case of determining the Nth smallest sample. If step 610 is answered affirmatively, the method 600 proceeds to step 612 and replaces the second element in the sorted list with the sample retrieved at step 608 . The two elements in the list are then sorted in ascending/descending order at step 614 . The method 600 then proceeds to step 616 . The method 600 also proceeds to step 616 from step 610 in the event that step 610 is answered negatively.
- the method 600 queries whether the window currently being analyzed contains additional samples for analysis. If not, the first element in the list is output as the Nth largest/smallest sample for the window analyzed. The method 600 then exits at step 620 . If step 616 is answered affirmatively, the method 600 returns to step 604 to retrieve another input sample.

As such, the low pass filter 713 attenuates higher signal frequencies present in the sampled signal x(n).

- the second detector 723 may determine an DFT index k 2 , referred to as GDFT@k 2 .
- the amplitude outputs of the first detector 721 and the second detector 723 are referred to as A 1 and A 2 , respectively.
- M is defined as the window length; that is, M is the number of samples of the readback signal in a window.
- N is defined as the number of consecutive adjacent windows.
- the Goertzel algorithm uses a recursive method to find the signal amplitude at a harmonic frequency fk.
- the frequency range of this envelope modulation frequency of interest is between f 1 and f 2 .
- Frequencies f 1 and f 2 are typically the lower and upper expected airbearing frequencies, respectively.
- the Goertzel algorithm processes the results of N windows. Each window is (previously) analyzed using the reduced sorting algorithm 318 in order to produce a single number. Therefore, the Goertzel algorithm receives N numbers received from the reduced sorting algorithm.
- Equations 2-3 The appropriate values for k for GFFT@k are determined as show by Equations 2-3.
- f 1 , f 2 are defined as r*fs/N, where r must be an integer that is less than or equal to N/2.
- the sampling rate of the down-sampler 715 is fs.
- the outputs of the detectors 721 , 723 (which are amplitude estimates) are sent both to the summing device 729 and to the airbearing frequency estimator 739 .
- the summing device 729 computes the sum of the two amplitude estimates and produces a sum, S.
- the sum S is then compared to a threshold value, T. in the comparator 733 .
- T may be tuned according to application and is selected according to a statistical method in manufacturing. If S is greater than T, a gate signal is sent to the airbearing frequency estimator 739 . If S is less than or equal to T, then no further processing is performed by the write/read inhibit system 716 . In this manner, a preliminary determination is made of the presence of an airbearing frequency in the readback signal.
- the airbearing frequency estimator 739 performs calculations to estimate the airbearing modulation frequency, fa. In one embodiment, the airbearing frequency estimator 739 computes a weighted average. Illustratively, Equation 4 may be used to determine fa.
- the frequency fo is calculated based on the sampling frequency, fs, of the sampler 715 and the number of samples, N, of the sampler output used for the calculation of A 1 and A 2 .
- M is the down sampling rate taken by the down-sampler 715 .
- the estimated airbearing frequency fa is provided to the inhibit signal processor 741 .
- the estimated airbearing frequency fa is compared to an upper and lower limit defining the expected range of airbearing frequencies. This comparison may be performed for typical limits between 150 ⁇ 10 3 Hz (150 kHz) and 250 ⁇ 10 3 Hz (250 kHz). If the airbearing frequency, fa, falls within the predetermined range, a write/read inhibit signal is issued to the R/W controller 719 , thereby causing data from to R/W controller 719 to not be written/read. If the airbearing frequency, fa, is not within the predetermined range, no further processing is performed by the write/read inhibit system 716 .
- FIG. 23 shows a sequence in which a read operation and write operation are alternated every other sector.
- the purpose of such an arrangement is to acquire a read back signal before and after each sector is written in order to determine the presence of head modulation. In some cases, however, it may be desirable to write to multiple sequential sectors before reading a sector.
- FIG. 24 illustrates an operation in which every third sector is read while the other sectors are written. Multiple sector sequential writes are common, for example, for audio, video and other multimedia data files. Multiple sequential sector writes may also be performed if the analysis for head modulation takes several sectors. It should be noted that regardless of the read/write pattern, the present embodiments do not limit the recording capacity of a disk drive because the sectors that are read between written sectors become sectors that can be written once it has been determined that no head modulation is present.
- FIG. 25 shows a method 2500 for determining head modulation during a pattern of alternate reading and writing.
- the method 2500 tracks sectors that need to be rewritten. This is done by managing a queue containing entries for each sector to be rewritten. Sectors that need to be rewritten include any sector preceding or following head modulation activity.
- the method 2500 is entered at step 2502 at a particular track for a given head and proceeds to step 2504 where a readback signal for a logical sector on a disk is acquired.
- readback signal envelope is analyzed for head modulation.
- the method 2500 queries whether head modulation is present in the logical sector from which the readback signal envelope was acquired. If so, the preceding and following sectors (with respect to the sector from which the readback signal envelope was acquired) are placed in a rewrite queue, at step 2510 .
- the data to be rewritten to the sectors specified in the rewrite queue is stored in some buffer.
- step 2508 is entered negatively, or following step 2510 , the method 2500 proceeds to step 2512 to query whether the last sector has been written. If not, the next sequential logical sector is written at step 2514 . Thus, a right operation takes place the than in the event that head modulation is detected at step 2508 . This is because by the time the readback signal envelope has been analyzed for head modulation, the head is already into the next sector. However, in another embodiment, detection of head modulation may be done before leaving the sector from which the readback signal envelope was acquired. In this case, steps may be taken to stabilize the disk drive facility before writing to any other sectors. In any event, the method 2500 and returns to step 2504 to get another readback signal envelope for a logical sector. The logical sector being examined for this iteration of step 2504 may be the sector immediately following the sector written at 2514 or maybe any number of sectors thereafter.
- step 2516 if the last sector has been written the method 2500 proceeds to step 2516 and queries whether any sectors are present in the rewrite queue. If not, the method exits at step 2518 . If the rewrite queue contains a representation for at least one sector, the method 2500 enters a loop which is repeated for each sector. The loop is entered at step 2520 where a representation for a sector first to be rewritten is retrieved. At step 2522 , the readback signal envelope is checked for head modulation in the logical sector preceding the sector to be rewritten. At step 2524 the method 2500 queries whether head modulation is present.
- step 2524 is entered negatively, or from step 2526 , the method 2500 proceeds to step 2528 where the next logical sector (i.e., the next adjacent sector following the sector from which the readback signal envelope was acquired at step 2522 ) is written.
- the method 2500 and returns to step 2520 to retrieve the next logical sector representation from the rewrite queue. Once all of the sectors represented in the rewrite queue have been processed the method 2500 exits at step 2518 . In this manner, the method 2500 provides a degree of assurance that each sector has been written without head modulation.
- a write verification methods employed to test for excessive head modulation which occurred during a write operation.
- the verification includes attempting to read the data written. Based on the entries in the rewrite queue, the disk drive facility can execute a read operation on the suspected badly written sectors to determine whether the data can be read. If the data can be read, then a sector need not be rewritten. In this case, the loop entered at step 2520 of the method 2500 may be avoided.
- a failure prevention operation may be selected from one of (i) issuing a read-write inhibit signal and (ii) storing a reference to each suspect disk sector (i.e., a disk sector over which head modulation occurred immediately prior to a scheduled write operation in that sector). In the latter operation, the data to be written to each of the suspect disk sectors is preserved for a subsequent write attempt (as described with reference to FIG. 25 ). In either case, the determination of head modulation may be made using the reduced sorting algorithm, for example.
- the reduced sorting algorithm 318 also computes a thermal component signal, th(m).
- the overall readback signal consists of two components, a magnetic component and a thermal component.
- the inventors have identified any changes in the baseline of the readback signal as being caused by the thermal signal component.
- the source of the thermal signal component has been discussed above. The following discussion provides embodiments for detection and analysis of the thermal signal component.
- a thermal component signal th(m) may be expressed as Equation 6.
- the thermal signal th(m) and the upper (or lower) envelope sample may then inputted to the PFA System 370 for additional analysis.
- the PFA system 370 is generally configured to determine the presence of a surface defect on a storage medium and/or head modulation activity. Once such a condition is detected, evasive or recovery steps may be taken. An illustrative embodiment of the PFA 370 is shown in FIG. 8 .
- the PFA system 370 comprises a thermal signal component processing unit 801 A, an envelope processing unit 801 B and a PFA decision system 820 .
- the thermal signal component processing unit 801 A and the envelope processing unit 801 B each comprise a rectifier 804 , 814 , a bandpass filter (BPF) 806 , 816 and a comparator 808 , 818 .
- the thermal signal component processing unit 801 A is configured to provide an output T to the PFA decision system 820 .
- the envelope processing unit 801 A is configured to provide an output U to the PFA decision system 820 .
- the PFA system 370 receives a thermal response th(m) and the upper (or lower) envelope, y_upper(m), from the dual envelope detector 317 (shown in FIG. 3 ).
- the thermal response th(m) is rectified by the rectifier 804 , which may be in a full-wave or a half-wave rectifier.
- the rectified output is filtered by the BPF 806 .
- the filter characteristics for both BPFs, 806 and 816 are identical and such that airbearing resonance frequencies (e.g., 200-300 kHz) and thermal asperity frequencies (e.g., 1-2 MHZ) will pass through the filters.
- a discrete rectified output signal R(th) from the BPF 806 is compared to a tunable and disk-surface-specific reference signal TH in the comparator 808 .
- the binary logical output T of the comparator 808 serves as one input to the PFA Decision System 420 .
- the upper envelope y_upper(m) is similarly rectified in a full-wave or a half-wave rectifier 814 , and the rectified output is filtered by a bandpass filter (BPF) 816 .
- BPF bandpass filter
- the discrete rectified output signal R(up) from the BPF 816 is compared to a tunable and disk-surface-specific reference signal UP in the comparator 818 .
- the binary logical output U serves as the another input to the PFA Decision System 820 .
- the three first entries in Table 1 may be considered non-critical and can be handled in various ways by the disk drive controller (shown in FIG. 3 ).
- Experimentation using the present embodiments demonstrates a high degree of effectiveness in the detection of envelopes over frequency-modulated data (i.e., data which produces a readback signal having a changing frequency).
- the envelopes may be used to determine the presence of detrimental conditions such as head modulation and surface defects.
- FIG. 9 shows an upper envelope 902 A and lower envelope 902 B of the readback signal 100 (shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the envelopes 902 A-B were derived using an embodiment which is a subset of a nonlinear, ordered-statistics filter provided herein.
- FIG. 9 illustrates how precisely the reduced ordered-statistics filter defines the modulating readback signal envelope in both amplitude and time as compared to the prior art envelopes 202 and 204 .
- FIG. 10 shows a portion of the readback signal 100 from FIG. 1 and a corresponding portion of the upper envelope 902 A from FIG. 9 .
- FIG. 11 is a comparative graph showing the corresponding envelope portions of envelopes 202 , 204 (shown in FIG. 2) and 902 A (shown in FIG. 9 ).
- the prior art envelopes 202 and 204 fail to accurately represent the envelope of the readback signal 100 .
- the filtered full-wave approach exhibits significant phase-shift as compared to the negligible phase shift of the envelope 902 A. The presence of phase-shift is undesirable because of timing-registration errors in the envelope detector output.
- embodiments of the present invention facilitate detection of a thermal asperity over data that produces a frequency modulated readback signal.
- FIG. 12 shows an exemplary readback signal 1200 containing a thermal asperity signal portion 1202 .
- the corresponding envelope signals, 1302 A-B shown in FIG. 13, are obtained using the reduced sorting methods provided herein.
- the thermal asperity detector system 360 may use the upper envelope 1302 A to detect a thermal asperity.
- FIG. 14 shows a pair of envelopes 1402 A-B generated using a conventional filtered full-wave approach.
- a high-bandwidth (1 MHz) envelope 1402 A shows the phase-shift (or phase-lag) problem associated with the filtered full-wave approach.
- a low-frequency (100 kHz) envelope 1402 B fails to represent the thermal asperity.
- FIGS. 12 and 15 - 22 illustrate readback signals, x(n), and their corresponding thermal response signals, th(n), acquired using embodiments provided herein.
- the readback signals x(n) are taken at the output of an AE module which operates as an amplifier cascaded with a highpass filter having a cutoff frequency of about 5 MHz. It is well known that a highpass filter acts as a differentiator below the cutoff frequency. Therefore, the thermal responses illustrated FIGS. 15, 17 , 19 , 21 and 22 are shown differentiated. To obtain the true thermal response the differentiated thermal responses have to be integrated appropriately. Illustrative methods for such integration are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,088,176, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Separating Magnetic and Thermal Components from an MR Read Signal.”
- FIG. 12 shows an exemplary readback signal 1200 indicative of a thermal asperity (as represented by signal portion 1202 ).
- a corresponding thermal response 1500 using the sorting algorithm 318 is shown in FIG. 15 .
- the window size, M, for the thermal response 1500 is equal to 10.
- TA thermal asperity
- the contact causes friction-heating and the resistance of the MR-element increases due to its positive temperature coefficient.
- the increased MR-resistance causes the voltage across the MR-element to increase for a constant MR-bias current.
- FIG. 15 is characteristic of such a voltage variation of more than 0.2 volts.
- FIGS. 16 and 17 show a readback signal 1600 and corresponding thermal response 1700 .
- the window size, M, for the thermal response 1700 is 100.
- the signals 1600 and 1700 are representative of traces occurring in the presence of a small bump.
- a protruding bump may or may not come in direct mechanical contact with the MR-stripe, however, it will influence the flyheight of the air-bearing slider.
- the FIG. 16 shows how the slider airbearing resonates after a being disturbed by a small bump.
- the thermal response 1700 using the same scale as the readback signal 1600 indicates some airbearing resonance.
- the sharp “glitches” in FIG. 16 indicate the readback signal induced during servo-sector boundaries. Notice the false influence the servo-sector glitch has on the thermal response 1700 . This false influence can be reduced by increasing the size of the window M used by the reduced sorting algorithm 318 .
- FIGS. 18-19 show a readback signal 1800 and corresponding thermal response 1900 in the presence of periodic head modulation.
- the periodic head modulation is represented by a modulating signal portion 1802 .
- Head modulation activity is caused by an airbearing resonance in the slider during the writing/reading process.
- the airbearing disturbance may be caused by a protruding bump, a loose particle or debris attached to the slider (the latter results in dynamic head instability due to altered flying characteristics of the slider).
- Each of these conditions can cause periodic head modulation which produces a concurrent thermal component in a signal.
- no thermal component is present in the readback signal. This is illustrated by FIG. 19 .
- the sharp glitches in FIG. 18 indicate servo-sector boundaries the effect of which on the thermal response 1900 may be reduced by increasing the size of the window M used by the reduced sorting algorithm 318 .
- FIGS. 20-21 show a readback signal 2000 and corresponding thermal response 2100 in the presence of a relatively larger bump.
- Modulating signal portion 2002 of FIG. 20 illustrates how the slider airbearing is resonating after a being disturbed by the bump.
- the differentiated thermal response 2100 using the same scale as the readback signal clearly represents the airbearing resonance by modulating portion 2102 .
- the sharp glitches in FIG. 20 indicate servo-sector boundaries the effect of which on the thermal response 2100 may be reduced by increasing the size of the window M used by the reduced sorting algorithm 318 .
- FIG. 22 shows the differentiated thermal response 2100 after amplification.
- the amplified signal is referenced as the thermal response 2200 and accentuates the airbearing resonance as modulating signal portion 2202 .
- FIGS. 15-22 demonstrate how the thermal response varies between a head modulation event and a bump/TA-event. Specifically, if the periodic head modulation event produces little thermal response, an airbearing modulation event occurred while writing the data.
