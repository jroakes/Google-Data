Definitions
- the present specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which advertisements can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, in a pop-up window.
- Content slots can be allocated to content providers through an auction. For example, advertisers can provide bids specifying amounts that the advertisers are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their advertisements (“ads”). In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated according, among other things, to bids and/or the relevance of the proposed content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content.
- Social networks may include online platforms for connecting users, and for allowing the users to exchange information and messages and to maintain and share profile pages.
- a user Upon registering with a social network, for example, a user can enter profile information, can maintain his or her profile page, can send personal and/or public messages to other users and can connect with other users. Entities may promote their social network profile through general advertisements that have their profile as a landing page.
- computer systems can facilitate a following of a content sponsor in a social network.
- a widget or control may be included within or provided along with a content item (e.g., a creative) and presented on a web page to a user.
- a content management system may facilitate a following of the sponsor of the content item by the user in the social network.
- Support may be provided for campaigns (e.g., a coordinated series of messages broadcast through various media channels) based on a cost per follower model, making it easier for campaign sponsors (such as advertisers) to budget, measure, and achieve their social marketing goals.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a creative for presentation to users in response to requests for content; receiving selection criteria and a bid from a sponsor associated with the creative, the selection criteria for use in determining when to present the creative, the bid being of the form of a cost per follower bid, wherein the sponsor is charged when the creative is presented and a user initiates an action to follow the sponsor in a social network; augmenting the creative to include a control that enables a user to follow the content sponsor automatically upon interaction with the control; and presenting the augmented creative in response to received requests for content in accordance with the selection criteria.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a creative for presentation to users in response to requests for content; presenting a user interface for managing a campaign by a content sponsor associated with the creative including receiving selection criteria for presentation of the creative and a bid; presenting a bid interface that includes bid criteria for the campaign, the bid interface including a selectable control for specifying a type of bid wherein bid types include cost per impression bids, cost per action bids and cost per follower bids; receiving a selection for the campaign indicating a cost per follower bid; responsive to received requests that satisfy the selection criteria, enabling presentation of the creative along with a control for automatically enabling a user to follow the content sponsor upon interaction with the control; receiving an indication that the user has interacted with the control and followed the content sponsor; and charging the content sponsor for presentation of the creative in response to receiving the indication in accordance with the bid.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a creative associated with a campaign, the campaign including selection criteria and a bid, the selection criteria used in determining when to present the creative in response to requests for content, wherein the creative includes a control to enable a user to follow a content sponsor of the creative in a social network; receiving a request for content from a user device; determining to present the creative responsive to the received request based at least in part on the selection criteria; enabling presentation of the creative in response to the received request; charging the content sponsor an amount in accordance with the bid only upon receiving an indication that the user has interacted with the control and followed the content sponsor in the social network.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a request for a content item to be presented to a user; identifying the content item from a plurality of content items, wherein the content item is associated with a content sponsor, and wherein the content item includes a control for receiving an account identifier for a social network associated with a viewer who interacts with the content item; providing the content item to the user, responsive to the request; receiving, through the control, the user's account identifier; and facilitating a following of the content sponsor in the social network by the user.

- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example system for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network
- FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram illustrating an example process for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network.
- FIGS. 4-6 show example user interfaces for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network.
- FIGS. 7-10 are flow charts illustrating example processes for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network.
- FIG. 11 shows an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device.
- a content item can be presented responsive to a conventional request for content (e.g., a display ad, search result ad, etc.).
- the content item may include a control which enables a user to enter his or her user identifier or to otherwise provide approval, allowing the user to follow the content sponsor that is associated with the content item.
- a cookie or another form of token may be used to provide the user identifier.
- the information may be validated and stored by a content management system.
- a content sponsor may be charged for the interaction (e.g., the following after presentation of the content item). Upon following the content sponsor, for example, the user may begin receiving posts from the content sponsor on his own profile page, such as in a timeline associated with the user in a social network.
- a control can be embedded on or in a creative, or rendered as an overlay.
- the control can allow a user to follow an advertiser's social network profile page directly by, for example, clicking on a button, without having to visit the specific profile page in a social network.
- the control may display social annotations related to the content sponsor's social network profile page, such as information about connected users that already follow the profile page or aggregated information (e.g., counts) about the profile followers.
- the content item may be directed to users that are more likely to interact with it. For example, a user may be selected if the he is predicted to be interested in a product or service associated with the content sponsor, if he is a frequent user of a social network, if he has previously followed other content sponsors, if one or more of his social network connections have followed the content sponsor, etc.
- a multi-dimensional machine learning algorithm may be used to identify users who may be more likely to interact with the content item.
- a user can be identified to determine whether he is already a follower of a content sponsor. Based on the determination, for example, a content item that might otherwise be shown to the user can be changed. In some implementations, a control for following may be removed from a content item presented to an existing follower, or the content item content may be changed. As another example, a bid parameter can be changed, to not bid on showing the content item to user.
- a cost per follow model can be supported, where a content sponsor may be charged whenever a user interacts with (e.g., clicks on a follow button associated with a creative and starts to follow the content sponsor's social network profile page).
- a content sponsor may be charged whenever a user interacts with (e.g., clicks on a follow button associated with a creative and starts to follow the content sponsor's social network profile page).
- the content sponsors can more easily budget, measure, and achieve their social marketing goals.
- user-related data for followers may be aggregated. For example, rather than evaluating a click-through rate, a follow-through rate may be evaluated.
- Tools can be provided to allow content sponsors to measure the marginal cost of acquiring a follower. Return on investment information may be provided. For example, when a content item is shown to a follower, conversions may occur more often than that of a regular user.
- the return of a campaign targeted to followers may be computed.
- an average follower may purchase $50 (on average) of goods or services from an online store vs. $15 (on average) of goods or services purchased by a regular user.
- the cost of acquiring a follower may be known (e.g., based on the bid for a cost per follower type content item), and the return that a follower may bring can be calculated. Based on such information, for example, a campaign budget may be optimized.
- a follow control may be defined as an option when designing a creative.
- content sponsors may select a template for a content item from a plurality of available templates. From the template, options may include adding text, pictures, videos, etc.
- a creative builder template may be prepopulated with content from a content sponsor's social network profile page, posts from page, etc.
- a content sponsor can use the builder to specify which social networks he wants to enable for potential user following. If a particular user is a member of multiple social networks, an option may be provided within a user interface for a user to choose which social networks to follow for the content sponsor. To determine if a content sponsor has a social network profile, the content sponsor can link their profile to one or more of their campaigns.
- a follow control may be displayed for content sponsors that have a social network profile page as a destination URL.
- an auction can be used to determine which content items to provide responsive to a given request.
- Content items of different formats or having different pricing models may be converted to an equivalent format so that they are compared for the purposes of the auction.
- a particular content item is associated with a cost per follower model, for example, it may be converted to an equivalent cost per click pricing, and it may compete in an auction.
- additional content may be directed to the user on web pages which receive content items from the content management system. Users may be classified into different degrees of engagement, for example. Content can be re-marketed to followers and return on investment calculated, for example, based on interactions of the user with the re-marketing content.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to users in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.

- the search system 112 can access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the content information system 110 can update usage information 124 for a user, based on activity of the user, subject, for example, to the user's express permission.
- the user may receive notice of what data may be collected and how such data may be used or retained, and may be provided with an opportunity consent to the use of such data.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable data is removed.
- the usage information 124 can include, for example, information about past user activities, such as past requests for resources 105 , past search queries 116 , other requests for content, websites visited, or interactions with content.
- the usage information 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content.
- the usage information 124 can include, for each entry, a timestamp, a cookie or an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requesting user device 106 , a type of usage, and details associated with the usage.
- the content management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .

- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords (or portions of keywords) or search queries 116 .
- content items having selection keywords that match the resource keywords (or portions thereof) or the search query 116 are selected as eligible content items by the content management system 110 .
- users that are members of social networks e.g., by being logged in or otherwise designating such status
- a selection keyword can match a resource keyword or a search query 116 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword or search query 116 .
- a content item e.g., an advertisement
- the selection keyword “automobiles” can be an eligible content item (or an eligible ad) for a content item request that includes the resource keyword “automobiles.”
- the ad can be selected as an eligible content item for a request including the search query “automobiles”.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource 105 or search results page 118 based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive bids from content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest effective bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource 105 or search results page 118 .

Abstract
Description
- This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/715,782, filed on Oct. 18, 2012, entitled “Facilitating Following A Content Provider,” the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
- The present specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which advertisements can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, in a pop-up window.
- Content slots can be allocated to content providers through an auction. For example, advertisers can provide bids specifying amounts that the advertisers are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their advertisements (“ads”). In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated according, among other things, to bids and/or the relevance of the proposed content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content.
- Social networks may include online platforms for connecting users, and for allowing the users to exchange information and messages and to maintain and share profile pages. Upon registering with a social network, for example, a user can enter profile information, can maintain his or her profile page, can send personal and/or public messages to other users and can connect with other users. Entities may promote their social network profile through general advertisements that have their profile as a landing page.
- In general, computer systems can facilitate a following of a content sponsor in a social network. A widget or control may be included within or provided along with a content item (e.g., a creative) and presented on a web page to a user. Upon receiving an indication of user interaction with the widget or control, a content management system may facilitate a following of the sponsor of the content item by the user in the social network. Support may be provided for campaigns (e.g., a coordinated series of messages broadcast through various media channels) based on a cost per follower model, making it easier for campaign sponsors (such as advertisers) to budget, measure, and achieve their social marketing goals.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a creative for presentation to users in response to requests for content; receiving selection criteria and a bid from a sponsor associated with the creative, the selection criteria for use in determining when to present the creative, the bid being of the form of a cost per follower bid, wherein the sponsor is charged when the creative is presented and a user initiates an action to follow the sponsor in a social network; augmenting the creative to include a control that enables a user to follow the content sponsor automatically upon interaction with the control; and presenting the augmented creative in response to received requests for content in accordance with the selection criteria.

- A content item can be presented responsive to a conventional request for content (e.g., a display ad, search result ad, etc.). The content item may include a control which enables a user to enter his or her user identifier or to otherwise provide approval, allowing the user to follow the content sponsor that is associated with the content item. In situations where the user is already logged into a social network, for example, a cookie or another form of token may be used to provide the user identifier. The information may be validated and stored by a content management system. A content sponsor may be charged for the interaction (e.g., the following after presentation of the content item). Upon following the content sponsor, for example, the user may begin receiving posts from the content sponsor on his own profile page, such as in a timeline associated with the user in a social network.
- A control can be embedded on or in a creative, or rendered as an overlay. The control can allow a user to follow an advertiser's social network profile page directly by, for example, clicking on a button, without having to visit the specific profile page in a social network. The control may display social annotations related to the content sponsor's social network profile page, such as information about connected users that already follow the profile page or aggregated information (e.g., counts) about the profile followers.
- The content item may be directed to users that are more likely to interact with it. For example, a user may be selected if the he is predicted to be interested in a product or service associated with the content sponsor, if he is a frequent user of a social network, if he has previously followed other content sponsors, if one or more of his social network connections have followed the content sponsor, etc. A multi-dimensional machine learning algorithm may be used to identify users who may be more likely to interact with the content item.
- A user can be identified to determine whether he is already a follower of a content sponsor. Based on the determination, for example, a content item that might otherwise be shown to the user can be changed. In some implementations, a control for following may be removed from a content item presented to an existing follower, or the content item content may be changed. As another example, a bid parameter can be changed, to not bid on showing the content item to user.
- A cost per follow model can be supported, where a content sponsor may be charged whenever a user interacts with (e.g., clicks on a follow button associated with a creative and starts to follow the content sponsor's social network profile page). By enabling content sponsors to track and bid on followers, for example, the content sponsors can more easily budget, measure, and achieve their social marketing goals. In general, user-related data for followers may be aggregated. For example, rather than evaluating a click-through rate, a follow-through rate may be evaluated. Tools can be provided to allow content sponsors to measure the marginal cost of acquiring a follower. Return on investment information may be provided. For example, when a content item is shown to a follower, conversions may occur more often than that of a regular user. With conversion tracking, for example, the return of a campaign targeted to followers may be computed. For example, an average follower may purchase $50 (on average) of goods or services from an online store vs. $15 (on average) of goods or services purchased by a regular user. The cost of acquiring a follower may be known (e.g., based on the bid for a cost per follower type content item), and the return that a follower may bring can be calculated. Based on such information, for example, a campaign budget may be optimized.
- A follow control may be defined as an option when designing a creative. In general, content sponsors may select a template for a content item from a plurality of available templates. From the template, options may include adding text, pictures, videos, etc. A creative builder template may be prepopulated with content from a content sponsor's social network profile page, posts from page, etc. A content sponsor can use the builder to specify which social networks he wants to enable for potential user following. If a particular user is a member of multiple social networks, an option may be provided within a user interface for a user to choose which social networks to follow for the content sponsor. To determine if a content sponsor has a social network profile, the content sponsor can link their profile to one or more of their campaigns. A follow control may be displayed for content sponsors that have a social network profile page as a destination URL.
- In some implementations, an auction can be used to determine which content items to provide responsive to a given request. Content items of different formats or having different pricing models may be converted to an equivalent format so that they are compared for the purposes of the auction. When a particular content item is associated with a cost per follower model, for example, it may be converted to an equivalent cost per click pricing, and it may compete in an auction.
- After a user starts to follow a content sponsor, additional content may be directed to the user on web pages which receive content items from the content management system. Users may be classified into different degrees of engagement, for example. Content can be re-marketed to followers and return on investment calculated, for example, based on interactions of the user with the re-marketing content.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to users in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers, one or more social network system(s) 130, and acontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andcontent providers 108. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - To facilitate searching of
resources 105, theenvironment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies theresources 105 by crawling and indexing theresources 105 provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 can be stored in anindexed cache 114. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. A request for aresource 105 or asearch query 116 sent from auser device 106 can include an identifier, such as a cookie, identifying the user of theuser device 106. - In response to a
search query 116, thesearch system 112 can access the indexedcache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 116, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The
content information system 110 can updateusage information 124 for a user, based on activity of the user, subject, for example, to the user's express permission. The user may receive notice of what data may be collected and how such data may be used or retained, and may be provided with an opportunity consent to the use of such data. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable data is removed. Theusage information 124 can include, for example, information about past user activities, such as past requests forresources 105, past search queries 116, other requests for content, websites visited, or interactions with content. In some implementations, theusage information 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content. In some implementations, theusage information 124 can include, for each entry, a timestamp, a cookie or an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requestinguser device 106, a type of usage, and details associated with the usage. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more “slots” that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page. For example, the data representing theresource 105 can include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page or a designated portion of a user interface associated with a search control, in which content can be presented. An example slot is an ad slot. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. - Information about slots can be provided to the
content management system 110. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords or portions of keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords (or portions of keywords) or search queries 116. As another example, content items having selection keywords that match the resource keywords (or portions thereof) or thesearch query 116 are selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, users that are members of social networks (e.g., by being logged in or otherwise designating such status) can be selected for presentation of particular content items that have selection criteria that specify that eligible viewers are members of the social networks (e.g., thereby identifying potential followers for the content sponsor). - A selection keyword can match a resource keyword or a
search query 116 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword orsearch query 116. For example, a content item (e.g., an advertisement) associated with the selection keyword “automobiles” can be an eligible content item (or an eligible ad) for a content item request that includes the resource keyword “automobiles.” Similarly, the ad can be selected as an eligible content item for a request including the search query “automobiles”. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of aresource 105 orsearch results page 118 based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive bids from content providers 108 (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest effective bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content providers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with aresource 105 orsearch results page 118. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content provider is willing to pay for each one thousand impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the content provider is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. In some implementations, the bid can specify an amount the content provider is willing to pay for a follower (e.g., of a profile page associated with the content sponsor) in a social network. The selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. - The
content management system 110 can communicate with one or more social networks (e.g., social network system(s) 130) through thenetwork 102. In general, social networks may include online platforms for connecting users (e.g., individuals, organizations, interest groups, etc.), and for allowing the users to exchange messages or data and to maintain and share profile pages. Users can register with one or more of the social network system(s) 130, for example, by providing a user name, a password, and other information. Upon registering, for example, a user can enter profile information (e.g., demographics, interests, photos, etc.), can maintain his or her profile page, can send personal and/or public messages to other users and can connect with (e.g., link to, subscribe to, etc.) other users. When a first user “follows” a second user, for example, a social network can associate the users, and the first user may automatically receive content (e.g., text, photos, videos, etc.) posted to the social network by the second user. Further, the first user may designate (e.g., indicate approval of, repost, comment on, etc.) the content. Social network information (e.g., profile information, connection information, message information, etc.) for registered users may be maintained by an accountinformation data store 132, for example. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample system 200 for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network. Thesystem 200 can include one or more client devices (e.g., client device 202) operated by corresponding users (e.g., user 204). Theclient device 202, for example, can communicate with one or more servers (e.g.,content server 220,publisher server 230, and social network server 240) over one or more networks (e.g., network(s) 208). The network(s) 208, for example, may include a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or WiFi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, an intranet, the Internet, or any other suitable network or any appropriate combination thereof. - The
client device 202 may be any suitable type of computing device (e.g., mobile phone, smartphone, personal digital assistant, tablet computer, laptop or desktop computer, or other stationary or portable device) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media. Among other components, for example, theclient device 202 includes one or more processors, computer readable media that store software applications, input device(s) (e.g., touch screens, keyboards, computer mice, motion sensors, microphones, etc.), output device(s) (e.g., display screens, speakers, etc.), and communications interfaces. - The
servers content server 220, for example, may include one or more components of acontent management system 250, such as arequest manager 252, acontent item manager 254, asocial network interface 256, and acampaign manager 258. Two or more of thecomponents request manager 252, for example, can handle requests (e.g., from publishers) for content items to be presented to users. Thecontent item manager 254, for example, can handle the creation of (e.g., definition of) content items by content sponsors, and may provide an interface (e.g., a builder) for creating content items. Thesocial network interface 256, for example, can handle communications between thecontent server 220 and thesocial network server 240. Thecampaign manager 258, for example, can aggregate information associated with user interactions with content items, can handle financial transactions with content sponsors, and can provide an interface (e.g., a reporting tool) for providing campaign information to the content sponsors. - The
content management system 250 may be in communication with one or more data stores, servers, and/or other systems. In the present example, thecontent management system 250 and thecontent server 220 may communicate with acontent data store 260, which may implement databases, file systems, or other suitable data management mechanisms to add, remove, maintain, and provide data used by thesystem 200. - Various content sponsors may provide content to be associated with web pages for presentation to users. In the present example a content sponsor 270 (Content Sponsor X), a content sponsor 272 (Content Sponsor Y), and a content sponsor 274 (Content Sponsor Z) may provide respective content items 280 (Content Item X), 282 (Content Item Y), and 284 (Content Item Z) to the
content server 220 through the network(s) 208, for inclusion in thecontent data store 260. To communicate with thecontent management system 250 and to provide, generate, and/or define content items, for example, each content sponsor may userespective computing devices content management system 250, such as builders which may allow the content sponsors to define their content items (e.g., advertisements) to define the intended audience for the content items, and to provide various campaign parameters (e.g., bids for an advertising auction) associated with the content items. User interfaces provided by thecontent management system 250, for example, may also include reporting tools for providing campaign status information, such as counts of various sorts of interactions (e.g., views, clicks, follows) associated with each content item, and return on investment information. - Content items may be provided to users along with requested web pages. When accessing a
web page 296 provided by thepublisher server 230, for example, the publisher server can request a content item from thecontent server 220. Alternatively, theweb page 296 can include code snippets that when processed by a browser on a client device makes a call to thecontent management system 250 to retrieve relevant content items from thecontent server 220. Thecontent management system 250 can retrieve one or more suitable content items from thecontent data store 260, for example, based on the results of an auction and/or attributes of theuser 204 and/or attributes of theclient device 202. In the present example, thecontent item 298 may be provided to thepublisher server 230 or to a browser rendering a publisher page, for inclusion in theweb page 296 to be presented to theuser 204. -
FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram illustrating anexample process 300 for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network. Various entities may participate in the process flow, including a user 304 (e.g., similar to theuser 204, shown inFIG. 2 ) employing a client device 302 (e.g., similar to the client device 202), a social network server 340 (e.g., similar to the social network server 240), a publisher server 330 (e.g., similar to the publisher server 230), a content server 320 (e.g., similar to the content server 220), and a content sponsor 370 (e.g., similar to the content sponsor 270) employing a computing device 390 (e.g., similar to computing device 290). The stages (A) to (K) depicted in theexample process 300 may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. For example, two or more of the stages (A) to (K), may occur concurrently. - During stage (A), the
content sponsor 370 can define a content item. For example, thecontent sponsor 370 can use thecomputing device 390 to communicate with thecontent server 320 and to receive aninterface 372 for defining a content item 380 (e.g., similar to thecontent item 280, shown inFIG. 2 ). Theinterface 372, for example, can also be used by thecontent sponsor 370 to provide a cost per follower bid associated with thecontent item 380, and to define the intended audience (e.g., the location and/or other attributes of users) for presentation of thecontent item 380. Thecontent server 320 maintains information associated with other content items provided by thecontent sponsor 370, and with other content items provided by other content sponsors, such as a content item 382 (e.g., similar to the content item 282), and a content item 384 (e.g., similar to the content item 284). - During stage (B), the
user 304 can use theclient device 302 to request a resource from thepublisher server 330. For example, thepublisher server 330 may maintain various web pages (e.g.,web pages 332, 334) for presentation to users. In the present example, theuser 304 may requestweb page 334. - During stage (C), the
publisher server 330 or rendering browser can request one or more content items from thecontent server 320. For example, theweb page 334 may include aslot 336 for including a content item for presentation to a user, along with the web page. Thecontent server 320, for example, may select thecontent item 380 for inclusion in theweb page 334 at theslot 336, based on information provided by thecontent sponsor 370, and based on attributes of theuser 304 and/or theclient device 302. - During stage (D), the
content server 320 can provide thecontent item 380 to thepublisher server 330 or directly to the client device for presentation to the user. In some implementations, the content item is provided by a server associated with the content sponsor. Upon receiving thecontent item 380, for example, thepublisher server 330 can include the content item in theweb page 334 at theslot 336. - During stage (E), the
publisher server 330 can provide the requested resource (e.g.,web page 396, similar toweb page 296, shown inFIG. 2 ) to theclient device 302 for presentation to theuser 304. Theweb page 396, for example, may be an instance of the web page 334 (including thecontent item 380 at the slot 336), rendered by a web browser of theclient device 302. In the present example, the content item 380 (here shown as content item 398) may include acontrol 399 for theuser 304 to provide an identifier (e.g., a user name) for his or her social networking account. As another example, theclient device 302 may determine that the user is already logged into his or her social network, and may provide thecontrol 399 as a button or other control to enable the following of thecontent sponsor 370 on the user's social network. - During stage (F), the
user 304 can interact with thecontent item 398, and information associated with the interaction can be provided to thecontent server 320 or another content management system. For example, theuser 304 can enter (e.g., type in) his or her social network account identifier. As another example, theuser 304 can click a control included on thecontent item 398 to indicate an intent to follow thecontent sponsor 370 in the social network. - During stage (G), the
content server 320 or content management system can facilitate a following of thecontent sponsor 370 by theuser 304 in the social network. For example, thecontent server 320 can use an application programming interface (API) provided by thesocial network server 340 to request that the social network server update information associated with theuser 302 and/or thecontent sponsor 370 to include the user as a follower of the content sponsor. - During stage (H), the
content server 320 can provide a notification to thecontent sponsor 370 that one or more users have been added as followers of the content sponsor. For example, thecontent server 320 can provide aggregated information about the users that have chosen to follow thecontent sponsor 370 upon being presented with thecontent item 398. Thecontent sponsor 370, for example, may review such information through theinterface 372 presented on thecomputing device 390. Thecontent sponsor 370 may be charged by an entity associated with thecontent server 320, for example, in response to receiving the indication, and in accordance with the content sponsor's bid. - During stage (I), the
user 304 can interact with content associated with the content sponsor. For example, theuser 304 can use theclient device 302 to navigate to aweb page 342 provided by thesocial network server 340. In the present example, theweb page 342 may include a message posted to the social network by thecontent sponsor 370. Theuser 304, for example, may interact with (e.g., indicate approval of, repost or forward, post related content, etc.) the message by interacting with thecontrol 344. As another example, theuser 304 can use theclient device 302 to interact with another content item (e.g., a general advertisement) provided by thepublisher server 330 to navigate to the content sponsor's landing page (e.g., a virtual storefront). While visiting a landing page associated with thecontent sponsor 370, for example, theuser 304 may perform various actions, such as exchanging messages, purchasing goods or services, etc. - During stage (J), the
content server 320 can be notified of user interaction with content associated with the content sponsor. For example, thesocial network server 340 can notify thecontent server 320 that theuser 302 interacted with thecontrol 344, thus indicating approval of a message posted to the social network by thecontent sponsor 370. As another example, a publisher server (e.g., publisher server 330) can notify thecontent server 320 that theuser 302 interacted with (e.g., clicked) another content item to navigate to a web page associated with thecontent sponsor 370. - During stage (K), the
content sponsor 370 can be notified of user interaction with content associated with the content sponsor. For example, thecontent server 320 can provide aggregated information associated with various user actions (e.g., clicks, messages, purchases, etc.) for presentation on thecomputing device 390 through theinterface 372. Such information, for example, may include return on investment information based on the value of user interactions with content remarketed to the user, and a cost associated with initially paying for the user to follow the content sponsor (e.g., the initial bid). In some implementations, thecontent sponsor 370 may be charged by an entity associated with thecontent server 320 for user interactions with the content sponsor (e.g., via the sponsor's social network profile page and/or other web pages) which may occur after the user has begun following the content sponsor. -
FIG. 4 shows an example user interface 400 for facilitating a following of a content sponsor in a social network.
