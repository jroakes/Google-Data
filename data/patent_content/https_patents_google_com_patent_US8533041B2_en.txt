Definitions
- the present invention is related to automated and semi-automated advertising and, in particular, to a method and system for selecting items for display and for scheduling display of the selected items.
- the present invention is applicable to many different types of information provision, including advertising of products and services, providing order information and features for ordering products and services, providing information concerning events and opportunities, and provision of information of general or personal interest to intended recipients, the present invention is discussed, below, in the context of advertisements added to web pages displayed to users over the Internet, a context in which the present invention finds particular utility and applicability.
- a web page describing a selected item is displayed to a user or customer who has requested information about that item
- references may be descriptive material related to the additional items of interest, including images, summaries, and/or annotations, and may also be or include links to other web pages that describe the additional items of interest.
- Selecting and adding the references to the items may be an important marketing and advertising effort undertaken by an Internet retailer. Effective displays of items for purchase promote increased sales and revenues as well as additionally providing timely and useful information to browsers and purchasers of items from Internet-based shopping sites and catalogs, even when the users and customers do not immediately choose to purchase the items. Therefore, designers and vendors of web-page-based retailing sites and catalogs, Internet retailers, and, ultimately, customers of Internet retailers have all recognized that continued research and development efforts should be applied to advertising methods and systems.
- One embodiment of the present invention is directed to an advertising system that includes an advertising-selection-and-scheduling component and an information-provision system.
- the advertising-selection-and-scheduling component executes on a computer processor, selects advertising for inclusion in information provided to users, prepares a schedule based on risk associated with including the selected advertising in the information provided to the users according to the schedule and based on return expected from including the selected advertising in the information provided to the users according to the schedule, and stores the prepared schedule in a computer-readable medium for subsequent access by the information-provision system.
- the information-provision system accesses the stored schedule to select advertising for inclusion in the information, and provides the information, including advertising selected according to the schedule, to users for display.

- FIGS. 16-19 provide flow-control diagrams for one embodiment of the present invention.
- the present invention is related to selecting items for display in advertisements and for scheduling display of the selected items. Items may be textual or graphical information, representations of products or services available for purchase or access, information about opportunities, events, and information deemed to be useful or desired by various intended recipients.
- the word “advertisement” refers, in this document, not only to information related to retailing of products and services, but also to any type of general or specific information that is provided to one or more users of an information-provision system. Embodiments of the present invention are discussed, below, in the context of adding summaries of, images of, and/or links to, items on web pages in order to stimulate sales as well as provide useful information to purchasers and browsers.
- Provision of information to users provides for display of the information to a user, including displaying the information on a computer screen through a web browser, printing the information on a physical medium that can be read or accessed by the user, and other means for providing the information in a useable form to users.
- the context for the following description of embodiments of the present invention is Internet-based retailing in which short description, small images, and/or links describing items for purchase are included on web pages that are returned by an Internet retailer to customers of the Internet retailer for display on the display screen of the customer's computer.
- alternative method and system embodiments of the present invention may provide for selection of items for display, and scheduling display of the selected items, in a variety of different communications media and information-provision environments.
- the methods and systems to which the current application is directed involve computing schedules on computer systems or other computational engines and storing results in computer memories, on mass-storage devices, or in other permanent or semi-permanent electronic data-storage devices or physical media.
- FIG. 1 shows an exemplary web page that may be provided by an Internet retailer to a customer via the Internet, the customer's personal computer, and a web browser executing on the personal computer.
- the customer may have browsed through a catalog of items for display and selected a particular item via input to a web-page input feature, in response to which the Internet retailer's web-page server has provided the web page shown in FIG. 1 .
- the web page includes an image of the item that is available for purchase 104 , alphanumeric information concerning the item 106 , and features 108 and 110 that allow a user to initiate purchase or defer purchase of the item.
- the exemplary web page shown in FIG. 1 contains a relatively large blank display area, or available web-page real estate.
- An Internet retailer may wish to better utilize this available web-page real estate by including descriptions and/or pictures of, and/or hyperlinks to, additional items available for purchase in order to facilitate users' browsing and to encourage users to purchase items.
- FIG. 2 shows the web page of FIG. 1 supplemented with a list of hyperlinks to items available for purchase.
- the list 204 ends with a hyperlink 206 to one or more additional pages of hyperlinks that describe items for purchase.
- Internet retailers have learned, through extensive marketing and advertising research, that filling a web page with references to items is quite often ineffective and even counterproductive with respect to the goal of encouraging additional purchases and facilitating browsing. Often, users and customers are overwhelmed by large amounts of additional information, and tend to ignore all of the additional links rather than spending time to read and consider even a few of the additional links.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an effective approach to including descriptions and images of, and/or links to, items for purchase within a web page. As shown in FIG. 3 , hyperlinks to only three items 304 have been included in the web page. Display of a relatively small number of items is a far more effective approach to attracting a potential purchasers' attention and inducing the potential purchasers to seek additional information about the items.
- Determining a schedule for displaying different sets of selected items represents yet another problem, or consideration, that needs to be addressed. For example, it is likely the case that, by varying the items displayed on web pages, such as the web page shown in FIG. 3 , an Internet retailer is more likely to promote additional sales than by simply selecting a fixed, small set of items and displaying those items for an extended period of time. As one example, were a user to access a particular web page multiple times during a time interval, and were the Internet retailer to display to the user a different set of items each time the web page is accessed by the user, it would intuitively seem more likely that the Internet retailer will end up displaying one or more items of interest to the user. However, it may also be the case that a user or customer only notices an item after multiple displays.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary histogram representing a record of sales or purchases for a first item. Time is plotted with respect to the horizontal axis 402 of the histogram 400 and the number of sales or purchases of the item during each fixed-length interval of time is plotted with respect to the vertical axis 404 .
- the fixed length of time intervals for which purchases are summed may vary from seconds to hours, days, months, or even longer periods of time. For the purpose of describing the present invention, the length and units of these fixed intervals is irrelevant.
- Each vertical bar, or column, in the histogram represents the number of sales or purchases of an item during a time interval represented by the width of the vertical bar.
- the vertical bar 406 indicates that 60 items were purchased or sold during a first time interval.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary histogram representing a record of sales or purchases for a second item. Notice that, in comparison with the historical purchase or sales data shown in FIG. 4 for the first item, the purchase or sales activity for the second item, shown in FIG. 5 , indicates that the second item is purchased with more regularity than the first item. As can be seen in the histogram shown in FIG. 4 , in any given interval of time, purchases of the first item may vary from no purchases, represented by the lack of a vertical bar 411 for the fourth time interval all the way up to 140 purchases, represented by vertical bar 412 . By contrast, the item for which the purchase or sales history is shown in FIG.
- FIG. 6 illustrates the data that is assumed to be available for candidate items for display on a particular web page according to embodiments of the present invention.
- the candidate items for display may be selected from some much larger set of items on the basis of the relatedness of the candidate items to the information included in the web page into which the items are displayed.
- the list of candidate items for display may include either a random selection from a larger set of items or it may include all of the items that may be sold by a particular Internet retailer.
- Each item may be described by a row in an items table 602 .
- the items table may include columns, or fields, such as an item ID, or product ID, the alphanumeric name of the item, a numeric price for the item, and other such information.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a simple statistics-based estimation of return according to embodiments of the present invention.
- the term “return” may mean number of sales within a period of time or revenue generated from sales over a period of time.
- a sales-history or purchase-history histogram 702 can be essentially turned into a linear return function 704 using the average purchase rate or sales rate computed from the histogram.
- An estimated return can be computed as:
- the estimated return function is essentially a linear function where the average rate of return, or statistical average, computed for the histogram is the slope 706 of the linear function.
- the risk associated with advertising an item can be computed as a function of the statistical variance of the purchase rate ⁇ 2 or the standard deviation, ⁇ .
- the risk reflects an uncertainty in the estimated return function.
- FIG. 8 illustrates the risk associated with estimated return functions according to embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 8 shows a first histogram 802 representing the purchase history for a first item and a second histogram 804 representing the purchase history for a second item.
- the estimated return functions 806 and 808 to the right of the histograms, are the linear estimated return functions obtained using the average purchase rates or sales rates computed from the histograms.
- the average sales rate would be extremely small, and would result in a return function 812 with a very small slope.
- a very high sales or purchase rate would be estimated, producing the estimated return function 816 .
- the return function 806 is obtained.
- the range of slopes of the different estimated linear return functions that can be obtained using different time intervals, ⁇ 822 is related to the standard deviation ⁇ computed from the sales or purchase record, represented by histogram 802 .
- histogram 802 in FIG. 8 produces a wide potential variation in estimated sales or purchase rates, and therefore a wide possible range of slopes of estimated linear return functions obtained from average sales rates or purchase rates estimated over different time intervals.
- a relatively regular and stable sales history such as that represented by histogram 804 , results in a very narrow range 824 of possible estimated-return-function slopes.
- the standard deviation is therefore related to the risk in incorrectly estimating a local, particular sales rate or purchase rate for an item based on cumulative statistics computed from a histogram over a large interval of time.
- Another way of looking at this risk is that, were one to estimate the return function for histogram 802 as the return function 806 computed from the average purchase or sales rates for the first item over the full time interval 820 , then were one to use this function to estimate the sales rate for the first item over some shorter period of time, such as time interval t 1 810 or time interval t 2 814 , it is likely that the estimate based on return function 806 would be quite different from the actual purchase or sales rate observed.
- the estimate for a short time period based on return function 808 for the second item would likely be nearly correct, regardless of the subinterval for which the estimate is made.
- displaying a link for an item associated with a high variance represents a greater risk than displaying a link for an item associated with a low variance.
- a large net return would be expected, but if displayed during a time when the local purchase rate or sales rate is low, the expected return would correspondingly be low.
- the correlation coefficient P X,Y ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0, and provides a numeric indication of the degree of dependence, or relatedness, of the two random variables, with the value 0.0 indicating independence and the value 1.0 indicating complete dependence.
- the variance for a sum of random-variable values, X 1 +X 2 + . . . +X n is given by:
- FIG. 9 illustrates creation of a list of k-partitions from a list of candidate items for display according to embodiments of the present invention. The total list of candidate items for display 902 can be used as a basis for computing all possible combinations of k items selected from the list of candidate items 902 .
- the list of all possible k-partitions 904 represents the list of all possible sets of k items for additional display in a web page.
- k is small, one can deterministically compute all possible k-partitions. However, since the number of k-partitions is
- n k n ! k ! ⁇ ( n - k ) !
- a random or deterministic selection of a set of m k-partitions from the set of all possible k-partitions can be made.
- the candidate items 902 may be ordered by a metric, such as the ratio of average return rate to risk, and m k-partitions may then be selected from all possible k-partitions of a number of candidate items with largest metric values. Alternatively, one can simply randomly generate m k-partitions.
- a second step of the process that represents one embodiment of the present invention produces a list of m k-partitions 904 .
- the rate of return and standard deviation for each of the k-partitions can be computed as:
- each of the m k-partitions represents a different set of items to be displayed on a web page, and each k partition is associated with average estimated rate of purchases, sales, or revenue and a standard deviation.
- the fraction of some time interval, ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 , . . . , ⁇ n , or the amount of times, t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t m , for which each of the different possible k-partitions should be displayed over some longer time interval is computed.
- t 1 , t 2 . . . , t m represent the total amount of time that the partitions P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P m are displayed within some longer of time period, and ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 , . . .
- ⁇ n are the fractions of a period of time for display of each of the k-partitions, the total return and risk for any given set of times t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n or fractions ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 , . . . , ⁇ m , are given by:
- FIG. 10 illustrates a schedule-creation process employed by embodiments of the present invention.
- a schedule 1004 is created in which one k partition is assigned to each time interval in the period of time during which display of items is undertaken by an Internet retailer.
- the k items in the k partition P 7 are displayed during time interval t 1 1008 and during time intervals t 6 and t 7 1010 in schedule 1004 .
- an optimal set of fractional display times of each of the m k-partitions may include significant fractional display times for k-partitions associated with high risk.
- optimization, or estimates of optimization, of fractional display times for display of each of the k-partitions can produce a more optimal schedule than simply selecting only those k-partitions with high rates of return coupled with low risk for display.
- FIG. 11 shows hypothetical statistical data for a set of three k-partitions according to embodiments of the present invention.
- the k-partitions are named “P 1 ,” “P 2 ,” and “P 3 .”
- a first table 1102 shows the average rate of return and standard deviation for each of the three partitions and the second table 1104 shows the correlation coefficients for each possible pair of partitions. These data are then used to compute an estimated return, variance, and return/risk ratio for possible fractional display times, as shown in FIGS. 12-15 .
- FIG. 12 shows the estimated return computed according to embodiments of the present invention for possible fractional display times for the three k-partitions described by data shown in FIG. 11 .
- the return is estimated for displaying items for 10 time units.
- the x axis 1202 corresponds to the fraction of time that partition P 1 is displayed, ⁇ 1 . They axis corresponds to the fraction of time that partition P 2 is displayed, ⁇ 2 .
- the fraction of time for display of partition P 3 , ⁇ 1 is 1 ⁇ 1 ⁇ 2 .
- FIG. 13 shows a plot of computed risk versus fractional display times ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 for the three k-partitions described by data shown in FIG. 11 according to embodiments of the present invention.
- the maximum rate of return is also associated with maximum risk.
- FIG. 14 illustrates the portion of the ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 plane above which the risk values are below 220 for the plot of FIG. 13 , according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 14 displays a plot of the function min (risk, 220).
- suitable values for ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 for which the computed risk is at or below 220, fall between a curved line 1402 and a diagonal 1404 on the risk surface. Comparing FIG. 12 to FIG. 14 , it is apparent that optimal ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 values at which the rate of return is maximized and the risk is at or below 220 underlie the region shown by a dashed circle 1406 in FIG. 14 .
- FIG. 15 shows a plot of a return/risk ratio computed over fractional display times ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 for the three k-partitions described by data shown in FIG. 11 according to embodiments of the present invention.
- partitions may range in the number of included items depredating on the items included.
- a more complex partition-selection method may be used to select not only a number of partitions, but also the number of items, and the identities of the number of items, for each partition.
- FIGS. 16-19 provide flow-control diagrams for one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 16 provides a control-flow diagram for the routine “display times,” which selects candidate items for display, creates k-partitions from those candidates, and computes a schedule for display of the k-partitions.
- step 1602 a list of candidate items for display, R 1 , R 2 , . . . R n , is obtained, along with historical sales or purchase data, such as the data shown in FIG. 6 .
- the value k is determined. The value of k may be determined from historical marketing and sales efforts and/or from comprehensive testing of additional-item displays within web pages.
- step 1606 k-partitions, P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P n are constructed, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 9 .
- step 1608 the length of individual display intervals, or, in other words, a short, fixed period of time during which items within any particular k partition are displayed during some longer period of time, is determined. In certain cases, this interval may be extremely short, so that each version of a web page returned to a customer generally features additional displayed items selected from a different k partition. In other cases, the interval is longer, so that during the interval, all customers to whom a particular web page is returned within the interval all receive the same item display.
- step 1610 an optimization method is used to determine optional fractional display times for each of the m k-partitions.
- a schedule is constructed using the determined fractional display times.
- step 1614 the schedule is stored in a computer-readable memory in order to control display of items within a web page according to the schedule, in step 1616 .
- FIG. 17 provides a control-flow diagram for the partition-constructing routine called in step 1606 in FIG. 16 .
- some number L of the N candidate items for display received in step 1602 of FIG. 16 are selected based on a metric.
- One possible metric is the ratio of rate of return to risk.
- the desired number of k-partitions, m is determined. For small values of k, m may equal
- step 1704 an l-dimensional matrix S of Boolean values is initialized to all “0” values and a list of partitions P is initialized to null.
- local variable num is initialized to 0.
- step 1707 additional candidate partitions are randomly selected until m partitions have been constructed.
- step 1707 the next candidate partition is selected from some random k-index selection method. If this candidate partition has already been randomly selected, as determined in step 1708 , then control flows back to step 1707 . Otherwise, the randomly selected partition is added to the list of partitions, in step 1709 , and the value in the S matrix corresponding to the candidate partition is set to 1, in step 1710 . Also in step 1710 , the local variable num is incremented.
- FIG. 18 shows a control-flow diagram for the fractional-time-display determining routine called in step 1610 of FIG. 16 .
- local variable num is initialized to 0.
- a generator function ⁇ _generator that randomly generates a next set of fractional display time values ⁇ 1 , ⁇ 2 , . . . ⁇ m-1 is initialized.
- the local variable max_return is initialized to a large negative value.
- steps 1804 - 1810 a large number of different points in fractional-display-time space are evaluated in order to find an optimal set of fractional display times.
- the next point in fractional-display-time space is generated by a call to the function ⁇ _generator, in step 1805 , and the local variable num is incremented.
- step 1806 the risk and return for the currently considered set of fractional times is computed, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 10 . If the computed risk is less than or equal to a risk threshold, as determined in step 1807 , then, if the computed rate of return is greater than the current maximum rate of return, as determined in step 1808 , the current point in fractional-display-time space is saved as the best set of fractional display times so far computed, and the local variable max_return is updated to contain the return value computed in step 1806 .
- FIG. 19 provides a control-flow diagram for the routine “construct schedule” called in step 1612 of FIG. 16 .
- a list of partitions P 1 , P 2 , . . . P m is initialized so that each partition is allocated a number of time intervals corresponding to the optimal fraction of display time computed for that partition in step 1610 of FIG. 16 , and a schedule data structure is initialized to be empty.
- a next partition is randomly selected for display at a next time interval until the entire schedule is filled.
- a next partition is selected from the list of partitions by some random process.
- step 1906 the selected partition is entered into the next time slot within the schedule.
- the count of time intervals to which the partition may be subsequently assigned is decremented, in step 1907 . If no additional time intervals remain for the partition, as determined in step 1908 , then, in step 1909 , the partition is deleted from the list of partitions. When the list of partitions is empty, and the scheduled filled, the routine finishes.
- the partitioning of candidate items into k partition steps may be omitted, and fractional display times directly computed for the candidate items based on the risk and rate of returns estimated for each of the items, as well as the covariances or correlations between items, when available.
- computed variances may simply omit the covariance or correlation-coefficient-related terms.
- Correlations between k-partitions may be estimated by various means, including the percentage of items shared between two partitions, or may be determined from statistical analysis of data collected for various pairings of items in displayed advertisements. Risk and return can be defined for any of various types of information display.
- a system may employ data collected with regard to website navigation, the number of click-throughs from one web page to additional web pages, number of requests for maps or directions to events, and many other types of data on which the above-mentioned statistical parameters can be calculated in order to determine risk/reward based schedules.

The notation “average/δt” is used to indicate that an average rate of sales or purchases is obtained.

The correlation coefficient PX,Y ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0, and provides a numeric indication of the degree of dependence, or relatedness, of the two random variables, with the value 0.0 indicating independence and the value 1.0 indicating complete dependence. The variance for a sum of random-variable values, X1+X2+ . . . +Xn, is given by:

it is computationally infeasible to compute all possible k-partitions for larger values of k. In the latter case, a random or deterministic selection of a set of m k-partitions from the set of all possible k-partitions can be made. The
Thus, each of the m k-partitions represents a different set of items to be displayed on a web page, and each k partition is associated with average estimated rate of purchases, sales, or revenue and a standard deviation.
Computing optimal values for ƒ1, ƒ2, . . . , ƒm is a traditional optimization problem. An objective function ƒ( ) can first be determined, such as:
-
- ƒ( )=return/risk; or
- ƒ( )=return at points ƒ1, ƒ2, . . . , ƒm in fractional-display-time space
- where risk <=threshold
Determining a best set of fractional display times for each k partition is then an optimization problem in which a set of fractional-display-time values ƒ1, ƒ2, . . . , ƒm for which the objective function returns a maximal value is determined and returned as an optimal set of fractional-display-times values.
- where risk <=threshold
In other cases, it may be some fraction of the total number of possible combinations of k-partitions. In
