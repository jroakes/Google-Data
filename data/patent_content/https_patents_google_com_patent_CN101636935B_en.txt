Figure 1A illustrates the exemplary user interface 100 that can be used to organize with obtaining information.Particularly, user interface 100 can be loaded into such as smart phone, cell phone or support to conduct interviews in the electronic equipment the wireless personal digital assistant or from described electronic equipment.In some embodiments, the user of described electronic equipment can organize the information of frequent access and easily obtain additional information with described user interface.Shown in Figure 1A, the various modules that are shown as label 103A-103F can only illustrate shown in folding (collapsed) list of title, and when they can be unfolded to show the more information of relevant particular topic during by user selection.Described module can form the user's of remote equipment customized homepage, and can coordinate mutually with user's desktop computer homepage.Each module can be the user location and shows the information of particular type.
As shown, user interface 100 comprises a plurality of label 103A-103F, and wherein each is provided to the link of dissimilar information.In some embodiments, can select and dispose dissimilar information by the user, and can cause user interface 100 display additional informations to the selection of each label, this also can be configured in advance.For example, in some embodiments, to the user selection of weather label 103A so that user interface show and detailed Weather information current or that default position is corresponding.User selection to traffic label 103B can be so that user interface 100 demonstration and transport information current or that default position is corresponding.According to the performance of mobile device, on equipment, can directly carry out label and launch and need not another and come and go to obtain additional information, perhaps can relate to central server is carried out another time request.
User selection to news label 103C can be so that user interface 100 shows news information, and it can comprise the local or regional news corresponding to current or default position.User selection to data service labels 103D can pass through the interface of the data, services of its access such as new the tinkle of bells, music and other data, services so that user interface 100 shows the user.Email be read, write and be sent to user selection to Email label 103E can so that user interface 100 is provided to the access of electronic mail account, for example to allow the user.User selection to physical culture label 103F can be so that user interface shows sport information.Information labels 103A-103F shown in Figure 1A only is exemplary.Other execution mode can comprise more or less label, perhaps corresponding to the label of different information types.
Except dissimilar information is provided in response to the user selection to label 103A-103F, can also in each label, show some profile information.For example, can be in weather label 103A display graphics weather designator 106 and temperature indicator 109 so that the instant access to the weather profile information to be provided to the user.Such as another example, the new article designator 112 among the news label 130C or the new message indicator 115 among the Email label 103E can provide respectively many news articles or not read the notice of email message.Such as another example, can in physical culture label 103F, provide score to upgrade designator 118 so that the interested physical profile information of user (for example, current or nearest sports score) to be provided.
By profile information is provided, some execution modes of user interface 100 are optimised for (with the input of user seldom or do not require that the user inputs) and provide bulk information to the user, simultaneously by selecting each information labels 103A-103F that user's access to additional information is provided.In addition, user interface 100 can comprise search box 121 so that the reception user search queries comes (for example, in case inputted search inquiry and activate the corresponding beginning control 124 of searching in search box 121) that the access to more information is provided.
As mentioned above, the specific label that shows in user interface 100 can be configured and be associated with account corresponding to this user by the user.In addition, can be to being configured by the customizing messages that each label conducts interviews.For example, in some embodiments, the user can configuration user interfaces 100 with (for example, by the physical culture module corresponding to sport information label 103F) provide special exercise (for example, hockey) or the sport information of special exercise team (for example, Wisconsin university and North Dakota university).Such as another example, in some embodiments, the user can be configured to provide one or more specific e-mail accounts' that the user is safeguarded access by Email label 103E to e-mail module.
In some embodiments, specify the configuration information of the interested various information types of specific user to be stored in account or the profile.In some embodiments, described profile is safeguarded by the informant, is connected to it to receive the informant of information such as electronic equipment.(details reference Fig. 3 and 4 of exemplary information supplier describes and describes).In other embodiments, configuration information is maintained in (among the one or more cookie or configuration file that for example, store) in the electronic equipment itself in electronic equipment.In other execution mode, configuration information is stored with distributed way---and namely, part is stored in one or more informants place, (for example, utilizes the only cookie of storaging mark number) and partly be stored in the electronic equipment itself.
As shown in a kind of execution mode, user interface 100 can comprise the designator 127 corresponding to the account of store configuration information or profile.Described designator can comprise the user name (for example, " Andrew ") corresponding to the account, perhaps to certain other handle (handle) of account or quote.Can be stored in the default position of a configuration information for will in location-based search, using in the profile.As shown, user interface 100 can also provide the designator 130 of the default position of electronic equipment.As selection, in the execution mode that can determine current location, designator 130 can show current location.
In some embodiments, determine accurately that by the position technology determines current location, for example receive and explain the hardware of global positioning system (GPS) information (or other geographic code signal message), perhaps with electronic equipment and its interactive signal with the hardware/software (for example, will compare from the signal strength signal intensity of the different districts control tower in the wireless network accurately determine the hardware/software of device location) that transmits and the wireless network of the information of reception is associated.In some embodiments (for example, the execution mode that electronic equipment and/or wireless network lack or supporting location is accurately determined technology), designator 130 with and the default position that is associated corresponding to the user profiles of user interface 100 corresponding.
In some embodiments, in case detect current location information (for example, accurately determining technology by GPS or other position) or any user's configurable module has been disposed default position information, then described positional information is propagated into the out of Memory module.That is to say, also can be used by traffic or news template specific to the position of weather module.In some embodiments, user profiles can be associated with a plurality of positions.For example, California Palo Alto user who has a smart phone of GPS function can be configured to the Palo Alto in California provide to smart phone default " homing position " of its traffic, weather and news information.Describe in more detail as following, in some embodiments, for example add default position so that the informant determines the correlation of local search results and local search results is provided subsequently to the search inquiry of assigned address information not.
In some embodiments, when the two not simultaneously, " current " (for example, GPS provides) position has precedence over default " ownership " position.For example, when above-mentioned Palo Alto user comes when being in the New York Brooklyn, respective user interfaces can be configured to provide weather and the transport information of New York Brooklyn for example rather than California Palo Alto.
In some embodiments, provide a kind of mode to replace current or default position is favourable to the user.For example, the current Palo Alto user who is in the New York Brooklyn may plan to go to new position---the Plymouth of Minnesota for example.Therefore, described user may be to the Weather information of Minnesota Plymouth and interested to the route in the famous restaurant of Plymouth, Minnesota.Can substitute exemplary interfaces current and/or default position by it illustrates in Figure 1B and will next be described.
Figure 1B illustrates the user can change current or default position in order to the interface 133 of new reference by location for example is provided for each information module by it.In some embodiments, can activate interface 133 by selecting to change position control 136.In case selected change position control 136, just the window the interface 133 of appearance shown in Figure 1B.In some embodiments, interface 133 comprises that the user can input the input frame 139 of the city corresponding with reposition or postcode or out of Memory therein.Interface 133 can also comprise control 142 (for example, " go " button), in case selected, its just with new location application to respective profiles.Use reposition and can comprise that reposition is set to default " ownership " position temporarily, perhaps so that reposition substitutes arbitrarily " current " (for example, GPS is correlated with) position temporarily.For example, in some embodiments, reposition alternative " current " or " ownership " position are until the electronic equipment outage; In other embodiments, reposition substitutes " current " or " ownership " position or measures (for example, 5 minutes) until the electronic equipment inertia reaches another scheduled time in scheduled time amount (for example, 15 minutes).
For example, can not generate at mobile device in the situation of demonstration of Figure 1B, can adopt other mechanism to change the position of user account or equipment.For example, in case selected control to upgrade the position, user's equipment can the directed different pages, and the user can provide at the described page information (for example, postcode) of sign reposition.Under these circumstances, user's equipment can then return for the demonstration before the demonstration that changes the position.
As shown, change the designator 145 that interface, position 133 can comprise current or homing position, and the proximal most position that has been used of electronic equipment, included proximal most position or be designated as the designator 148 of the proximal most position of interim default position in inquiry.Various positions can select to allow more easily to change default position by avoiding needing to repeat input position information by the user.
In some embodiments, no matter at any time changing the interface by the position provides new position, and described new position all is added to the proximal most position tabulation.This proximal most position tabulation can be stored with other configuration information---for example in the included memory of electronic equipment, perhaps in the profile of the informant place storage that electronic equipment is accessed.In some embodiments, the size of proximal most position tabulation is restricted to the position of predetermined quantity, for example five nearest or ten positions.The quantity of the proximal most position of safeguarding in some embodiments, is set by another user's configuration parameter.
Fig. 2 A, 2B and 2C illustrate the example results set that can be provided in response to the inquiry that receives from electronic equipment described electronic equipment and show therein.For example, Fig. 2 A illustrates in response to the example results set that can provide the inquiry of " Startbuck ".As shown, inquiry itself 201 can provide together with the result, and it can comprise location-based result 204 and non-location-based result 207 (be described in " screen is outer ", but can check by operation rolling control element 210 in some embodiments).Shown in one embodiment, location-based result 204 comprises address and the phone information of different Starbucks; Shown specific Starbucks is positioned at current or default position " New York Brooklyn ", as indicated in position controller chassis 213.
In some embodiments, Position Control frame 213 shows the current or default position top end member 216 as the drop-down list 219 that can conduct interviews by drop-down control element 222.As described in one embodiment, drop-down list 219 comprises other proximal most position that is associated with electronic equipment.In some embodiments, the user of electronic equipment can select the another location from drop-down list 219, and can be so that new location-based result be provided when active position changes order (for example, by activating the control such as " go " button 225).Described drop-down list 219 can also or be listed the position that is associated with searching request as an alternative.For example, can indicate the result who is associated with the Orlando of Florida about the search of " Disney (Disney) ", and the result who is associated with the Pasadena (and possible Tokyo and Paris) in California in addition.Although can in drop-down list or other such mechanism, show the position that is associated with other, but position or little numeral (for example, have the highest search score value those) can make its information be shown to allow the user position of its search of easily refining.
Other non-location-based result 207 can be provided except location-based result 204.(for example providing location-based result, location-based result 204) and non-location-based result (for example, non-location-based result 207) in some execution modes, at first shows location-based result (for example, " being raised ").That is to say that some execution modes are configured to " lifting " location-based result arbitrarily the time, such result be considered to inquire about relevant.Advantageously, such execution mode can allow to utilize minimum input to obtain the positional information of height correlation such as the user of the electronic equipment of smart phone (for example, it may have limited input capability) and so on.In other words, with reference to the above example that provides, the user that such execution mode can allow to be in the electronic equipment of New York Brooklyn only just can obtain the information relevant with local Starbucks by input " Startbuck "---and that is to say, do not need the user to input " Startbuck of New York Brooklyn " and obtain identical information.
In its search, (for example clearly identified location identifier the user, by comprising postcode) situation under, local search results can be risen on other result, and when the user did not comprise clear and definite location identifier in its search, system can determine that the local search results group is with respect to the appropriate location of other Search Results with the various mechanism that more discuss in detail below for example.
For the ease of visiting location-based information in response to the short inquiry that does not rely on the position, in some embodiments, electronic equipment is sent to corresponding informant with positional information (for example, about GPS information) together with inquiry.In other embodiments, corresponding informant can for example obtain positional information from wireless network independently, described wireless network will (for example be relayed to the informant from the respective queries of electronic equipment, together with inquiry, described wireless network can provide its positional information of for example calculating or determining by the corresponding signal intensity of the triangulation carried out based on the particular cell phone control tower that receives described inquiry and each control tower).In other embodiments, the informant can retrieve the profile that is associated with the user of the electronic equipment that receives inquiry or this electronic equipment; In these execution modes, the profile of retrieving can comprise default position information, and the informant can provide the location-based described default position information of using as a result the time.
The informant can determine in many ways that the position possibility is relevant with inquiry.In some embodiments, informant's two or more results sets execution comparative analyses that generate through revising inquiry to generating in response to the inquiry that does not rely on the position and comprising current or default position information.For example, in case the informant receives search inquiry and the current or default position that does not rely on the position, described informant just can carry out two search---and a search is based on received inquiry, and second search is current based on received being added with (or otherwise comprising) or the inquiry of default information position.So described informant can be to two corresponding results sets---since comprise current or default position one of them can comprise location-based result---to determine whether the position relevant with initial search query.
It is associated with the query definite to carry out in many ways the position possibility.For example, explain in more detail as following, can score value be associated with search inquiry such as the rule that generates by the machine learning system of training about prior search queries.Described score value can provide search inquiry (or partial query) and the Search Results of particular type such as local search results that how relevant indication arranged.If it is local relevant fully to heavens determining inquiry, then local result can be risen on the result of other type.And, can also height of formation local relevant and not relevant with general web inquiry Query List, and the inquiry of described tabulation can receive local result and is lifted at result on other result.Can also preserve the counter-rotating tabulation (namely, search for height correlation but inquiry or the query terms very not relevant with local search with general web), and the inquiry that is associated with this tabulation can cause local result not to be thus lifted to the top, perhaps even cause local result to be lowered by the bottom (in this case, they may not be transmitted, and perhaps may only just transmit in response to the additional request to the result).
Such as another example, in some embodiments, if corresponding to receive the inquiry the first results set from obviously different corresponding to the second results set of the same queries that comprises positional information that receives, can think that then the position is relevant with initial search query.In some embodiments, if the second results set comprise the quoting of one or more specific physical location (for example address or telephone number (website is relative with only having)), can think that then the position is relevant with initial search query.
In some embodiments, inquiry itself and position may can be compared by relative Query List.For example, some inquiry that the informant is received-such as " Startbuck " or " Pizza "-statistical analysis may disclose these inquiries and usually be associated with location-based result; Therefore, in some embodiments, described informant can safeguard " white list " that can carry out to it these inquiries of special processing.Particularly, in such execution mode, when being included in the white list that the informant safeguards, potential inquiry can automatically any location-based Search Results be promoted.
In some embodiments, the informant safeguards similar " blacklist " of inquiry, and its possible errors ground triggers location-based result's demonstration or lifting.For example, the informant can carry out statistical analysis to the inquiry that receives and trigger corresponding location-based result's demonstration or the ad hoc inquiry of lifting with identification, and described location-based result is confirmed as with original query uncorrelated subsequently.(for example, in some embodiments, the informant can by to user after the result is provided to subscriber equipment and described result analyze alternately determine that some result is uncorrelated.Particularly, the user is to indicating described result relevant to the selection of result's link; Then can be considered to uncorrelated by the result that the user ignored.Pass in time, and by a large amount of similar inquiries are analyzed, in some embodiments, the informant can determine that the position is usually relevant or uncorrelated with ad hoc inquiry.)
It is that incoherent some inquiry can be stored in " blacklist " that the position is considered to it.Subsequently, when results set being analyzed when determining the correlation of position and respective queries, can substitute with blacklist that to determine that by position correlation algorithm carries out definite.That is to say, if position correlation is determined algorithm and is determined that the position is relevant with inquiry, but described inquiry---or similar variant of described inquiry---appears in the blacklist, the any location-based result who then identifies can be left in the basket, and perhaps can be provided and does not rise at first the position that shows.
The non-location-based result's who provides in response to inquiry example is provided Fig. 2 B.Shown in Fig. 2 B, original query is " address of Steven Spielberg ".In some embodiments, comprise in search inquiry that " address " triggers location-based result.Yet, in this example, do not have available location-based result (for example, owing to may not be that the public retrievable such as the famous person's of Steven Spielberg individual address information).In addition, any location-based the possibility of result of identifying is uncorrelated with user's initial search query.(the possibility of result of for example, identifying with relevant with the site address that is associated of Steven Spielberg or with contact with the not directly related general famous person of Steven Spielberg or the street address of supporter's filtrating mail mechanism is correlated with.) also can use other various keywords in the lifting of local search results or in descending.
In order to determine that the position may be with uncorrelated about the inquiry of Steven Spielberg, the informant who receives described inquiry can retrieve blacklist.Particularly, described informant may determine location-based the possibility of result and comprise that the inquiry of " Steven Spielberg " is uncorrelated, and " Steven Spielberg " can be included in the blacklist (for example, informant safeguard blacklist) thus.Therefore, even determine that by position correlation algorithm determined that the position is relevant (for example with the inquiry of " address of Steven Spielberg " at first, " address " part based on inquiry), but also can substitute described position correlation with blacklist and determine algorithm, and can ignore any location-based result who identifies, described result perhaps is provided and does not promote.On the contrary, as shown in a kind of execution mode, can provide other result such as image result 231 or news results 233.
Fig. 2 C illustrate wherein the position be confirmed as with inquire about relevant, but do not have the corresponding current or default addresses for use of the available electronic equipment with receive described inquiry from it.In this embodiment, provide to the user interested position is provided.For example, the disabled cell phone of service (is for example accurately determined in the position, described cell phone lack or not supporting location determine that accurately hardware and corresponding wireless network can't or not provide positional information) the user, and, it does not have setting to have the respective profiles of default position, may input the inquiry to " Pizza ".The informant ex ante analysis for the multiple queries of " Pizza " or other similar keyword and determined that the position may inquire about height correlation with this.Therefore, as mentioned above, the informant can safeguard the white list that comprises " Pizza ".Therefore, in response to the inquiry to " Pizza ", the informant can be to the electronic equipment transmission message that receives from it inquiry of " Pizza ", in order to point out user's input of described electronic equipment that " Pizza " inquired about interested ad-hoc location.
In some embodiments, the prompting of location information comprises input frame 239, and the user can input city or the postcode corresponding to reposition therein.Described prompting can also comprise control 242 (for example, " go " button), in case selected, it just submits to the informant with described reposition.In some embodiments, even without available current or default position, proximal most position may be still available; As shown, if they are available, then can tabulate in proximal most position shows them in 245.(not shown) in some embodiments, if proximal most position can be used, then proximal most position is used as interim current or default position.Shown in Fig. 2 C, in one embodiment, when thinking that position and relevant and the current or default position of inquiry provide the prompting to the position when unavailable.
Be confirmed as in the position and inquire about relevant but do not have in some execution modes of available current or default position information, can be based on existing or do not exist respective queries to determine position to the prompting of information in the white list.For example, if inquiry is included in the white list, then the position may be confirmed as in advance and inquire about relevantly, and is arbitrarily showing that the prompting (for example, shown in Fig. 2 C) of location information may be favourable before the non-location-based result.Such as another example, if inquiry is not included in the white list, then the position so may be not relevant with described inquiry, and showing that the prompting of location information may be favourable after the non-location-based result arbitrarily.The very brief inquiry that can transmit in response to the electronic equipment of representative of consumer by this way, provides the Search Results of height correlation in order to show to the user to electronic equipment.
Fig. 3 can receive the correlation of inquiry, predicted position and described inquiry and based on the correlation generation of the position of predicting and the inquiry block diagram in response to the example system 300 of the results set of described inquiry from user's electronic equipment.For example, system 300 can receive inquiry to " Startbuck " from cell phone 315, predicted position and described inquiry height correlation, and generation for example comprises the results set of the information that near the current location with cell phone 315 Starbucks is relevant.Such as another example, system 300 can receive the inquiry to " polydicyclopentadiene ", predicted position is not relevant with this inquiry, and generates the results set for example comprise the science article relevant with condensate (rather than for example the results set of " position-based ").
In order to receive from electronic equipment and to process inquiry, example system 300 comprises informant 303.In some embodiments, the search engine (search engine that for example, provides such as Google) that carries out index to being stored in informant 303 inside or outside various types of information is provided informant 303.For example, in some embodiments, can in such as an index of index 300, store location-based information, and in such as another index of index 333, store non-location-based information.Described search engine can receive the inquiry to information, searches for the index of its various types of information, and the tabulation that ranges the related content in one or more information types is provided.The reader should be understood that this configuration only is exemplary.A plurality of index be can safeguard and can logic and geographical distribution be carried out in the mode different from the described exemplary configuration of Fig. 3.
The tabulation of related content can comprise quoting rather than the tabulation of content itself described content.Perhaps the tabulation of described content can comprise the preview of actual content or actual content.For example, the tabulation of related news content can be included in the various links of the news content that is stored in outside the informant 303.Can utilize the preview of the actual available information such as title and/or story foreword (story hook) to visit each link, determine whether will follow specific link and access actual content to help the user.Such as another example, the tabulation of associated picture content can be included in the link of various image resources, and the little figure of usable image or low resolution preview are helped the user and determined whether will follow specific link and access real image.
In some embodiments, the actual content of 303 index of informant is stored among each content provider, such as content provider 306 and 309.In some embodiments, each content provider 306 or 309 storages belong to the content of customizing messages type.For example, content provider 306 is store image information only, and content provider 309 can only store news information.In other embodiments, each content provider all stores and provides polytype information.Content provider 306 and 309 is illustrated by discrete, but can be operated by single mechanism or a plurality of mechanism.
In some embodiments, the informant can adopt profiles database 310 to safeguard the profile information that is associated with each user or subscriber equipment (for example, cell phone 315).Described profiles database can be used to store the configuration parameter that the information of especially frequently accessing with the user is associated.Described profiles database can also be used to store default position information in case in response to and indefinitely comprise that the location-based inquiry of location parameter uses---describe in further detail such as following institute.
As shown in Figure 3, diverse network with informant 303, content provider 306 and 309 and the various electronic equipments (for example, desktop computer 312, cell phone 315 and smart phone 318) of the information that can visit information supplier 303 provides or the information that is stored in content provider 306 and 309 be coupled in together.For example, the wide area network such as the internet (WAN) 321 can be coupled in informant 303 and content provider 306 and 309 together, and can promote to carry out exchanges data between each supplier 303,306 and 309.Other network can be coupled to each other various miscellaneous equipments and be couple to informant 303 or content provider 306 or 309.For example, wireless network 324 can be coupled to each other various mobile wireless devices (for example, cell phone 315 and smart phone 318).In some embodiments, wireless network 324 is directly coupled to WAN 321; In other embodiments, wireless network 324 can be couple to wide area network 321 by another network 327 such as public switch telephone network (PSTN).As shown, the non-moving or permanent plant such as desktop computer 312 also can be by for example to the connection of wide area network 321 or visit the various resources of system 300 to the connection of PSTN 327.
Provide now the exemplary information flow process in the system 300.The user can be for example in its cell phone 315 input directional information suppliers 303 (for example, Google) inquiry to " Startbuck ".When the described inquiry of user's " submission ", its cell phone 315 can be so that described inquiry be sent to informant 303 via wireless network 324 and wide area network 321 respectively on path A and B.Informant 303 can determine that location-based information possibility is relevant with described inquiry.May be correlated with if determined location-based information, then informant 303 can obtain current or default position to add search inquiry (supposing in above " Startbuck " example, not comprise positional information in the inquiry itself) to.For example, in some embodiments, informant 303 receives current location information (for example, technology is accurately determined in the GPS from cell phone 315 or other position) from cell phone 315.
In other embodiments, informant 303 can obtain from wireless network 324 positional information of cell phone 315.Such as another example, the informant can be from profile (for example, from profiles database 310) the retrieval default position corresponding to cell phone 315.The informant can use inquiry and current or default information (for example, via path C
1And D
1From index 330) obtain location-based Search Results, and use original query (for example, via path C
2And D
2From index 333) obtain non-location-based Search Results.Can sort, format and offer cell phone 315 (for example, via path E and F) in order to show to position-based and non-location-based result.
Fig. 4 is the block diagram that informant's shown in Figure 3 additional exemplary details is shown.As shown, in one embodiment, informant 303 adopts search engine 401 and a plurality of index for dissimilar information being carried out index or tissue.Each index can comprise the data that expression informant 303 offers user's information.For example, search engine 401 can comprise typical internet search engine, and each index can be included in the link that is stored in the information outside the informant.Informant 303 can (for example, in response to search inquiry) be provided to user's link, and can be at user selection actual information corresponding to described link is provided during described link.
Some information that clauses and subclauses in the various index are quoted can be stored in (for example, in storage inside 402) within the informant 303.For example, in some embodiments, storage inside 402 can " mirror image " receives the information of search inquiry, for example breaking news event or weather or transport information regularly.Storage inside 402 can also be stored informant 303 the required various assemblies of general operation, such as application, system parameters and with the user-dependent information of access system.
As shown, in one embodiment, informant 303 can safeguard the various index corresponding to dissimilar information.For example, informant 303 can comprise for the web index 404 that web information is carried out index, for the image index 407 that image information is carried out index, for the news index 410 that news information is carried out index, for the local index 413 that the location-based information of each physical location is carried out index, be used for entertainment information is carried out the amusement index 416 of index and the weather index 419 that is used for obtaining and organizing Weather information.In other embodiments, informant 303 can safeguard the single index that is carried out index by all types of information of described those types of index 404-419 to comprising.Listed information type only is exemplary.Can use the information with various other types of index.In addition, can carry out the differentiation setting to index itself.For example, polytype information can be processed in an index.
Can carry out buffer memory or not carry out buffer memory various index (or an index).For example, index 404-419 can be corresponding to one or more index data bases of discrete buffer memory to support the faster access to Search Results.Index 404-419 (or an index) can be in informant this locality, and perhaps they can comprise external server or storage facility (farm) (not shown).Usually, each index can be striden many different machines and distributed with many different physical locations.For example, index can be realized by the hundreds of or thousands of memory devices in a plurality of data centers in all parts of the world.Storage inside 402 also can be local or distributed.
As shown in an execution mode, informant 303 is undertaken by interface 422 and miscellaneous equipment alternately.In some embodiments, interface 422 comprises by it and receives inquiry and transmit one or more web servers or the application server of the information that described inquiry is responded from it.Interface 422 is illustrated as individual interface, but interface 422 can comprise various other internal interfaces that can information inside be routed to by it informant.For example, interface 422 can comprise the arbitrarily suitable communication hardware that moves for the interface equipment of the high speed such as SONET, infinite bandwidth, Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, high bandwidth network or under suitable agreement, so that informant 303 can respond a large amount of different requests simultaneously.Interface 422 can comprise network interface unit (NICS) or be applicable to other communication equipment and other assembly or the interface of high speed, high bandwidth network.Definite design of the informant 303 is not to be crucial and can to adopt any appropriate format for this document.
Can collect information among the various index 404-419 by for example crawl device (crawler) or the automatic information collecting device 423 that crawls device (spider) and so on.In some embodiments, automatic information collecting device 423 continuously or almost obtains fresh information from the source that is connected to WAN 321 or from other source (not shown) that is connected to informant 303 continuously.This fresh information can be provided for suitable index 404-419 or storage inside 402.Except be added to various index 404-419 or storage inside 402 with automated manner, information can be retrieved by manual being carried in various index 404-419 or the storage inside 402 or from it by maintenance interface 426.In some embodiments, maintenance interface 426 can allow informant 303 keeper to manually add mass data.
Request of data such as search inquiry can be processed by request processor 425.In some embodiments, request processor 425 can be resolved search inquiry or other data query, and if necessary, to their reformattings with search and search engine 401 mutually character string or the search terms of compatibility.For example, in some embodiments, request processor is reformatted as form or the agreement that search engine 401 is adopted to the search inquiry that receives with HTML (HTML) form or text formatting.Request processor 425 can also be considered to be article, preposition or other word of " non-intrinsically safe ", search inquiry or the request to the data that receive are refined finishing search or data access by removing.In addition, request processor 425 can be to the search inquiry point of addition information that receives to obtain location-based Search Results.
For to the search inquiry point of addition information that receives, request processor can adopt profile manager 431 and profiles database 310.As mentioned above, profiles database can the storage configuration information relevant with the information of electronic equipment or the frequent access of its user.Profiles database can also be stored the default position information (for example, according to identifier or other metamessage in the receive inquiry, it matches with described inquiry or from its equipment and certain profiles that receives inquiry) that can be retrieved.For example, when the cellular telephone subscribers of California Palo Alto-for example, it has, and previous the ownership of storage or default position information is (for example in profiles database 310, " Palo Alto; CA ")-when having submitted the inquiry to " Startbuck " to, request processor 425 can be retrieved corresponding default position information.Particularly, request processor 425 can adopt profile manager 431 and profiles database 310 to retrieve the profile corresponding with the electronic equipment that receives " Startbuck " from it, identify in the described profile default position information (for example, " PaloAlto; CA "), and this default position information is added to the inquiry (for example, to form the inside inquiry string of " at Palo Alto, the Startbuck of CA ") that receives.By this way, can come to inquire about the relevant location-based information that obtains in response to the user who does not rely on the position who receives with the information in the profiles database 310.
Device-dependent customizing messages also can be stored in such as the form with so-called " cookie " in the described equipment self.For example, can in cookie, store various positional information fragments.As selection, but cookie storaging mark number, and it then is used as accessing the key of the information in the database such as profiles database 310.Other similar execution modes can also be provided.
As shown, in one embodiment, informant 303 comprises in response to the response formatter 428 that the search inquiry of data or request are formatd information.In some embodiments, response formatter 428 is to help information in the mode (for example, with form or certain other appropriate format such as HTML, XML (extend markup language), WML (WAP Markup Language)) that shows from the particular device of its reception respective queries information to be formatd.In some embodiments, response formatter 428 also sorts to location-based information and non-location-based information, and determines whether " lifting " location-based information.Response formatter 428 in some cases (for example, such as above with reference to the described wherein current or disabled situation of default position information of figure 2C) can also generate the message of the specific location-based information of request.
For location-based information and non-location-based information are sorted, response formatter 428 can adopt sort result device 429, and it can determine the order of location-based and non-location-based result type.In some embodiments, sort result device 429 is also may help to provide user's the mode of result's electronic equipment that the result in each type is sorted to it.
For result type is sorted, particularly about local result, sort result device 429 can adopt blacklist database 432, and as described above, it can store the inquiry that may be associated with positional fault.In some embodiments, sort result device 429 is used algorithm and is determined that initially the position possibility is relevant with ad hoc inquiry, in order to any location-based result is suitably sorted with respect to other non-location-based result.In these execution modes, it is initial definite to adopt blacklist database 432 to substitute.That is to say that if sort result device 429 determines that at first positions may be relevant with inquiry, but inquiry (or its part or variant) is included in the blacklist, then initially determining can be replaced, and non-location-based result can at first be provided.On the other hand, if sort result device 429 initial definite positions may be relevant with inquiry, and inquiry (or its part or variant) is not included in the blacklist, then can support initial to determine, and can or be presented at before the non-location-based result location-based result " lifting ".
In some embodiments, the position may with the inquiry height correlation that receives, but may not have current or default position for being available from its equipment or user who receives inquiry.In such execution mode, be favourable for the user points out interested position.Yet such prompting may be interfering for the user, especially for being defined as improperly those inquiries relevant with the position.In order to minimize the unnecessary interference to the user, the sort result device can adopt white list database 430.
In some embodiments, 430 storages of white list database before had been confirmed as the inquiry relevant with position height.White list database 430 can be used to the arbitrary inscription to ad-hoc location is sorted, and described prompting is generated and provides in order to show the electronic equipment that receives original query from it.Particularly, if original query (or its part or variant) is stored in the white list, then can be with to the arbitrary inscription " lifting " of ad-hoc location and be presented at (for example, shown in Fig. 2 C) before any Search Results; If original query (or its part or variant) is not stored in the white list, then can be included in before the common arbitrarily location-based Search Results the arbitrary inscription of ad-hoc location, but be in after other non-location-based result.By this way, can minimize the interference characteristic of the prompting that the specific location information mistake is presented.
Except using white list and/or blacklist or as it, substitute, can determine with other mechanism the local correlation of ad hoc inquiry.Whether what the machine learning system that for example, is subjected to supervision can use removal search is that daily record data local or that indication non-indigenous is associated is trained with search.Described system can respond the search regular collection whether this locality is associated that generates scoring or be used for determining other future with instruction.The various mechanism that are used for this study all are suitable for.
Fig. 5 is for the inquiry that receives information; Predicted position and the receive correlation of inquiring about; And be provided as the flow chart of the position-based of response of described inquiry and/or non-location-based result's method 500 to electronic equipment based on the correlation of predicting.Method 500 is to receive (501) inquiry beginning.For example, informant 303 can be from the inquiry of cell phone 315 receptions to information.
Method 500 can comprise in definite (505) inquiry main body whether comprising positional information.For example, in some embodiments, 425 pairs of inquiries of informant 303 request processor resolve to identify the arbitrary portion corresponding with physical region or position (for example, postcode, city or other city, GPS or other " geographic code " coordinate etc.).Particularly, request processor 425 can for example be identified as positional information with " MN, Plymouth " in the inquiry such as " MN, the steak house of Plymouth ".
If comprise positional information in the inquiry main body, then in some embodiments, method 500 comprises obtains (508) in response to the location-based result of described inquiry, and alternatively, comprises non-location-based result.For example, search engine 401 can be searched for various index 404-419 (for example, particular index 413) and obtain the information in response to described inquiry.As the result of search, search engine 401 can be identified one or more Search Results, for example location-based search result set and " based on web's " results set (that is the results set that, comprises the information that is classified as " web information ").Correlated results can be provided (511) and give from its electronic equipment that receives described inquiry to show.
If in the proximal most position tabulation of storing the profile that included position also is not in the electronic equipment that receives described inquiry from it and is associated in the described inquiry (or be associated with the user of this equipment), then (514) can be added in profile in described position.Particularly, for example, described position can be stored in in the profiles database 310 and the profile that described electronic equipment is associated.
In some embodiments, if positional information is not included in the inquiry main body that receives, then method 500 comprises whether definite (517) positional information otherwise is associated with described inquiry.For example, method 500 can comprise whether definite (517) can obtain current location information from the metamessage with described inquire-receive.Particularly, the informant can determine (517) whether with inquire-receive to gps coordinate-or other geographic code information, perhaps whether can be with for example from described inquiry be obtained positional information from the alternate manner that electronic equipment is sent to informant's wireless network.Such as another example, method 500 can comprise whether definite (517) default position information is associated with the electronic equipment that receives described inquiry from it (or user of this equipment).Particularly, informant 303 can adopt profile manager 431 to retrieve the profile that is associated with electronic equipment (for example, cell phone 315) to determine whether comprise default position information in the described profile.
If if can obtain to comprise in current location information or the respective profiles default position information, then current or default position information can be added the inquiry that revise to form (520) in the inquiry that receives (520), and can carry out (520) original query and modified inquiry.For example, under default position information is stored in situation in the profile, the default position information that request processor 425 can provide profile manager 431 is added in the inquiry that receives, and the modified inquiry that then inquiry of primary reception is offered search engine 401 and will have default position information offers search engine 401.
Method 500 can comprise whether definite (524) local result is relevant with receive inquiry.For example, in response to the first inquiry (for example, the inquiry of primary reception) result who generates can compare to determine whether the position is relevant with described inquiry with the result who generates in response to the second inquiry (for example, utilizing inquiry default or that current location information is revised).Particularly, in some embodiments, whether response formatter 428 can determine a plurality of results by 413 index of local index, and perhaps response formatter 428 can determine whether there is notable difference between the result who returns from the inquiry of primary reception and the result that returns from modified inquiry.As mentioned above, can otherwise come to determine the correlation of location-based result and search inquiry.
If location-based result is determined (524) for uncorrelated, other result that then can provide (527) to be confirmed as being correlated with is used for showing from its electronic equipment that receives inquiry.(for example, see the result shown in Fig. 2 B.)
If location-based result (at first) is determined (524) for relevant with inquiry, then some execution modes comprise execution additional examination-that is to say some execution modes comprise whether definite original query (perhaps its part or variant) is included in the blacklist.For example, informant 303 can utilize sort result device 429 that the inquiry of storing in the inquiry that receives and the blacklist database 432 or a part or the variant of inquiry are compared.If inquiry is corresponding to the clauses and subclauses in the blacklist database 432, then described inquiry before had been marked as possible errors and had been triggered corresponding with location-based result, and can substitute location-based correlation initially determine (524).That is to say, in some embodiments, can provide (533) location-based result in order in electronic equipment, show, but only after other non-location-based result, show (namely, in the mode of " non-lifting ", perhaps not as the first results set).
