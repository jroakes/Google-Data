- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing performance estimates for a content campaign.
- the method comprises: identifying a campaign including one or more targeting criteria for targeting content items to users; determining a number of unique users that will be targeted based on the targeting criteria in a predetermined time period including: identifying historical auction results including content served in response to content requests; storing the historical auction results as a plurality of documents, one for each auction result, wherein storing an auction result as a document comprises storing serving criteria and a user identifier for a user that was served a content item based on the auction result; evaluating the plurality of documents including initiating a query on the plurality of documents to determine an estimated number of impressions that would occur in the plurality of documents based on the targeting criteria; determining an estimated total number of impressions for the targeting criteria in the time period based at least in part on the estimated number of impressions in the plurality of documents; and determining a total number of unique targeted users including determining a frequency
- the method can include identifying a number of documents that are required to produce a query result and determining the estimated total number of impressions can include determining a number of unique users that are determined when evaluating the plurality of documents in order to satisfy the number of documents. Determining the frequency can include determining a frequency for each of the unique users which are associated with one or more documents. Determining the frequency can include determining an average frequency for the unique users.
- the method can include storing the plurality of documents in a repository. Determining the number of unique users that will be targeted based on the targeting criteria in the predetermined time period can include initiating a first query and one or more second queries on the repository. The first query can be initiated on a beginning of the plurality of documents in the repository.
- At least one second query can be initiated on an entry in the repository that is located after where the first query terminated. At least one second query can be initiated on an entry in the repository where the first query terminated. At least one second query can be initiated from a beginning of the plurality of documents in the repository.
- the first query can be a query to determine a number of unique users that are associated with documents that satisfy the targeting criteria.
- the first query can be a query to determine a number of unique users that are associated with documents that satisfy the targeting criteria in a subset of the repository.
- At least one second query can be a query to determine a number of unique users by querying the repository to determine a frequency of impression for some or all users represented in the repository.
- the estimated total number of impressions can be determined as an extrapolation based on a number of historical auctions that are evaluated as compared to a total number of auctions that are conducted in a time period.
- the campaign can be associated with a video content item.
- the method can include providing the total number of unique targeted users to a campaign sponsor. Providing the total number of unique targeted users can include providing the total number of unique targeted users to a campaign sponsor in response to selection or designation of the targeting criteria.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment for providing content to a user.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example system for managing a content campaign.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this disclosure, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- a content campaign (e.g., an advertising campaign, such as a campaign that includes video advertisements) can be defined by campaign parameters, such as a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, and targeting criteria.
- a campaign sponsor can configure campaign parameters for the content campaign. The campaign sponsor may desire to know how many unique users may be targeted by the campaign in a particular time period.
- a content management system can estimate the number of unique users targeted by the campaign using an approach that can provide an estimate in real time or near real time (e.g., within a second or a few seconds).
- the content management system can identify historical auction results that include content served in response to content requests and can store the historical results as a set of documents, where each document includes information about a respective auction.
- the content management system can evaluate the set of documents to determine an estimated number of impressions associated with the documents, extrapolate to determine a total number of impressions estimate for the targeting criteria for the time period, and determine a total number of unique targeted users using the total number of impressions estimate.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , publishers, a video sharing environment 109 , and a content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content providers 108 .
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the content providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible.
- a content provider 108 or campaign sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more video content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- the content provider 108 can create, for example, a video campaign or some other type of campaign.
- the content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 111 which define the content campaign.
- the campaign parameters 111 can be stored in a parameters data store 112 .
- Campaign parameters 111 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., a creative, such as video content to be made available on the video sharing environment 109 ), bids for one or more content items, and targeting criteria.
- Targeting criteria can include, for example, a targeted language, one or more targeted geographical locations or websites, one or more targeted verticals, one or more networks on which to provide content, and/or one or more targeting terms.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 111 specified by the content provider 108 .
- the content provider 108 can experiment with different campaign parameters 111 to identify particular campaign parameters 111 that meet one or more performance goals identified by the content provider 108 .
- the content provider 108 may identify a goal of targeting a particular number (e.g., ten thousand) of unique users with the campaign and/or having the campaign result in a particular number (e.g., one hundred thousand) of impressions.
- the content provider 108 can, using an account management interface, specify a particular time period and particular targeting criteria and the content management system 110 can determine an estimated number of unique users targeted by the campaign during the time period in response to selection or designation of the targeting criteria by the content provider 108 .
- the content management system 110 can determine the total number of unique users estimate in real time or near real time (e.g., within a second or a few seconds). Accordingly, the account management user interface used by the content provider can be responsive to the content provider 108 , providing estimates to the content provider 108 and allowing the content provider 108 to experiment with different targeting criteria until the number of unique users estimate (and/or the number of impressions estimate) is satisfactory to the content provider 108 .
- the content management system 110 can identify historical auction results 115 that include information regarding historical auctions previously conducted by the content management system 110 in response to the content management system 110 receiving content requests.
- the content management system 110 can store, for each identified auction result, some or all of the information for each identified auction result in a document and can store each document in a documents repository 116 .
- each document can include serving criteria and a user identifier of a user that was served a content item based on the associated auction.
- the content management system 110 can store a document in the documents repository 116 for a subset of the historical auction results 115 .
- the documents repository 116 can include documents which correspond to one percent of the users for which information is stored in the historical auction results 115 .
- the content management system 110 can evaluate documents in the document repository 116 . For example, the content management system 110 can process a subset of the documents in the document repository 116 and can estimate a number of impressions that would occur in the documents in the documents repository 116 based on the processing of the subset. The content management system 110 can determine an estimated total number of impressions for the specified targeting criteria in the specified time period based at least in part on the estimated number of impressions that would occur in the documents in the document repository 116 (e.g., the estimated total number of impressions can be determined using extrapolation).
- the content management system 110 can determine an estimate of the total number of unique users that will be targeted based on the specified targeting criteria in the specified time period using the determined estimated total number of impressions. For example, the content management system 110 can determine an average frequency of impression and can determine the total number of unique users as the total number of impressions divided by the average frequency of impression. Determining the total number of impressions, the average frequency of impression, and the total number of unique users is described in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 2 and 3 .

- the content sponsor 202 can, using the campaign management user interface 206 , specify a bid using a control 222 .
- the bid may be a “CPM” (Cost Per Mille) bid, or a bid for one thousand impressions for a particular video content item that is included in the selected campaign.
- the campaign sponsor 202 can specify targeting criteria 224 , for example, a URL of “www.example1.com”, a language of English, a country of the United States, a keyword of “keyword1”, and user characteristics of male, sports-fan, and age thirty four to forty nine.
- the targeting criteria 224 can include, for example, one or more URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) of web sites to target, a language, a country, region, or other location, one or more keywords, one or more verticals, and one or more user targeting criteria.
- User targeting criteria can include for example, age, gender, and user-list information, such as whether a user is included in one or more user lists, such as a user list associated with a particular user interest (e.g., sports). Other types of targeting criteria can be specified, such as one or more topics, one or more networks on which to place content items, or placement of content items, to name a few examples.
- the campaign sponsor 202 can select a control 226 to indicate that the campaign sponsor 202 is interested in satisfying all of the targeting criteria 224 or can select a control 228 to indicate that the campaign sponsor 202 is interested in satisfying at least one of the targeting criteria 224 .
- the campaign sponsor 202 can select a time period using a control 230 .
- the content management system 208 can determine an estimate of the number of unique users that will be targeted based on the targeting criteria 224 in the specified time period.
- the content management system 208 can identify historical auction results that are included in an auction results repository 232 .
- Each of the historical auction results can include information associated with an auction result corresponding to a previous serving of content by the content management system 208 in response to a content request.
- the auction results repository 232 can be maintained, for example, to include auction results from the previous week.
- the content management system 208 identifies a subset of the historical auction results included in the auction results repository 232 .
- the content management system 208 can identify historical auction results in the auction results repository 232 that are associated with one percent of users for which auction results are stored in the auction results repository 232 .
- the content management system 208 can store a document for each of the identified historical auction results in a document repository 234 .
- Each of the documents in the document repository 234 can include serving criteria and a user identifier for a user that was served a content item based on the auction.
- the serving criteria can include, for example, information about keywords, formats, URLs, verticals, topics, placements, user signals, bid information, and information about networks on which to serve content.
- a document with document number “1” (e.g., the document “1”) includes a user identifier of “5”, a user age of “29” (in cases when the user provides such information and consents to its use), a bid amount of “0.08”, a URL of “www.example5.com”, and a keyword of “keyword5”.
- the example documents 236 include a document “2” that includes a user identifier of “4”, a user age of “36”, a bid amount of “0.04”, a URL of “www.example1.com”, and a keyword of “keyword1”.
- the document “1” and the document “2” can include other serving criteria.
- the serving criteria that is stored in a document is based on a network on which the served content associated with the document was served.
- the document “2”, which may correspond to content that was served on a video sharing network includes the keyword “keyword1” while a document “3”, which may have been served on a display network, does not include keyword information, but does include a classification (e.g., “sports-fan”) which describes a type of web page that the content was served on.
- the user signals can include, for example, age, gender, location, and/or user list membership information (e.g., information about membership in a list of users who appear to be interested in a particular web site, or a particular type of content, such as sports), as authorized by the user.
- Bid information can include information indicating a winning bid amount for the auction associated with the document.
- one or more indices can be associated with the documents 236 .
- an index is associated with the documents 236 for each type of serving criteria.
- a first index associated with keywords and a second index associated with URLs can each be associated with the documents 236 .
- the content management system 208 can perform a query on the documents 236 using one or more of the indices.
- the content management system 208 can evaluate the documents 236 to determine an estimated number of impressions that would occur in the plurality of documents based on the targeting criteria 224 and the time period specified by the campaign sponsor 202 .
- the content management system 208 can initiate a query from the beginning of the documents 236 and can identify documents that include serving criteria that match the targeting criteria 224 and that have a bid that is less than (or in some implementations, less than or equal to) the bid specified using the bid control 222 .
- the content management system can determine that the documents “2” and “3” include serving criteria that match the targeting criteria 224 and have a bid amount that is less than the specified bid.
- the content management system 208 can use multiple indices (e.g., one index per type of targeting criteria) to evaluate the documents 236 .
- the content management system can use a first index to determine a first set of matching documents, a second index to determine a second set of matching documents, and can determine an overall set of matching documents by determining an overlap between the first set of documents and the second set of documents.
- the content management system 208 uses multiple indices in parallel.
- the content management system 208 may perform one type of processing (e.g., “AND” logic processing) if the campaign sponsor 202 selects the control 226 and may perform another type of processing (e.g., “OR” logic processing) if the campaign sponsor 202 selects the control 228 .
- one type of processing e.g., “AND” logic processing
- another type of processing e.g., “OR” logic processing
- the content management system 208 can query the documents 236 from the beginning of the documents 236 until a predetermined number of documents that match the targeting criteria 224 and have a bid amount that is less than the specified bid are identified.
- the content management system 208 can extrapolate to determine an estimated number of impressions that would occur in the documents 236 based on the specified bid and the specified targeting criteria. For example, the content management system 208 can evaluate the documents 236 until three hundred matching documents have been identified. For example, a document “5,200” may be the 300 th matching document.
- the content management system 208 can determine which percentage of the documents from the document “1” to the document “5,200” are matching documents (e.g., 300/5200, or 5.77%).
- the content management system 208 can determine an estimated number of matching documents in the documents 236 by multiplying the determined percentage by the total number of documents in the documents 236 (e.g., 5.77%*24,000 documents, resulting in an estimate of 1385 matching documents, or an estimated 1385 impressions that would occur in the documents 236 based on the specified bid and the specified targeting criteria).
- Such an extrapolation approach can be used to determine an estimate since the documents 236 can be randomly ordered (e.g., no particular user, no particular targeting criteria, etc. is grouped in the documents 236 (e.g., since grouping may skew an estimate performed using extrapolation)).
- the content management system 208 can determine an estimated total number of impressions for the specified targeting criteria in the specified time period based at least in part on the estimated number of impressions that would occur in the documents 236 . For example, suppose the documents 236 include documents associated with auction results for one percent of the users for which auction results are stored in the auction results repository 232 . The content management system 208 can determine an estimated total number of impressions by multiplying the estimate of matching documents that would occur in the documents 236 by one hundred, or, in the example of FIG. 2 , a total estimated number of impressions of 138,460. In some implementations, the rounded estimated number of documents value of 1385 is used rather than an unrounded estimated number of documents, which can result in a total estimated number of impressions of 138,500.
- the content management system 208 can determine an estimated number of unique users that will be targeted based on the specified targeting criteria in the specified time period using the estimated total number of impressions. For example, the content management system 208 can determine an estimated average frequency for some or all of the users for which documents are stored in the documents 236 and can determine the estimated number of unique users by dividing the estimated total number of impressions by the average frequency. For example, the content management system 208 can determine a frequency of impression in the documents 236 for selected users “2”, “3”, and “4”. That is, a number of matching documents associated with each of the selected users “2”, “3”, and “4” can be determined or estimated.
- all of the documents 236 are processed to determine the frequencies for each of the selected users “2”, “3”, and “4”.
- a subset of the documents 236 are processed for some or all of the selected users “2”, “3”, and “4”, to determine a frequency for one or more particular respective users.
- the documents 236 can be processed until a threshold number of matching documents that are associated with the user are reached.
- a document “2800” associated with the user “4” may be the tenth matching document associated with the user “4”.
- ten out of the twenty eight hundred, or 0.36% of the processed documents are matching documents associated with the user “4”.
- a frequency for the user “4” for all of the documents 236 can be estimated by multiplying the 0.36% times the total number of documents (e.g., 0.36%*24,000, resulting in a frequency estimate of eighty six for the user “4”.
- processing to determine frequency estimates for each of the selected users “2”, “3”, and “4” can be performed in parallel, and once a number of matching documents associated with a particular user are determined, processing for that particular user can stop and processing for the other users can continue, until frequency estimates have been determined for each of the selected users.
- An average frequency can be determined based on the frequencies determined for the selected users. For example, suppose that in addition to the frequency estimate of eighty six for the user “4”, frequency estimates of sixteen and three have been determined for the users “2”, and “3”, respectively.
- An average frequency for the selected users can be determined by summing the determined selected user estimated frequencies and dividing by the number of selected users (e.g., 86+16+3/3, for an average frequency of thirty five).
- An estimated number of unique users can be determined by dividing the estimated total number of impressions by the average frequency. For instance, in the example of FIG. 2 , the estimated number of unique users that may be targeted based on the specified targeting criteria in the specified time period can be determined as 138,460 divided by thirty five, or three thousand nine hundred fifty six unique users.
- the content management system 208 can display the estimated total number of impressions and the estimated number of unique users to the campaign sponsor 202 , such as in controls 237 and 238 , respectively.
- the content management system 208 can determine the estimated total number of impressions and the number of unique users by processing a subset of the documents 236 , which are associated with a subset of the historical auction results stored in the auction results repository 232 .
- the content management system 208 can provide these estimates in a timely, responsive manner to the campaign sponsor 202 on the campaign management user interface 206 .
- Other approaches which may involve processing all of the historical auction results in the auction results repository 232 , and/or all of the documents 236 , or re-running some or all auctions, can result in a response time that is unsatisfactory to the campaign sponsor 202 .
- the content management system 208 can, for campaigns that include video content items, determine an estimated number of views, as shown in a control 239 .
- a view is considered different than an impression.
- a pre-roll video content item it can be considered that the user views the video content item if the user does not skip the video content item before completion of the video content item.
- a thumbnail video content item it can be considered that the user views the video content item if the user selects the thumbnail video content item (whereas if the user does not select the thumbnail video content item, it can be considered that an impression, but not a view, of the thumbnail video content item occurred).
- information indicating whether a user viewed a video content item is stored in the documents 236 that are associated with video content items and a number of views estimate can be determined by processing such information.
- a number of views estimate can be determined based on the format of the video content item. For example, a predetermined estimated view rate for a particular video content item format can be used to estimate a number of views.
- a range of values may be displayed in some or all of the controls 237 , 238 , and 239 .
- a range of values may be shown to prevent a user from being able to enter extremely specific targeting information as the targeting criteria 224 to determine information about particular users.
- a range of values may be shown in some or all of the controls 237 , 238 , or 239 if less than a threshold number of users (e.g., one thousand) are identified for which documents matching the targeting criteria 224 are stored in the document repository 234 .
- a threshold number of users e.g., one thousand
- a range of values may be shown, or a message indicating an estimate cannot be obtained, if matching documents included in the document repository 234 are associated with only one or two users.
- the targeting criteria 224 includes networks on which to serve content
- separate estimated total number of impressions and estimated number of users can be displayed for each network.
- the content management system 208 can recommend a particular bid amount to maximize estimated total number of impressions and/or number of unique users, in light of a specified budget.
- the content management system 208 can cache information needed for the second stage of processing.
- the content management system 208 can perform processing for multiple users in parallel, such as when determining frequency estimates for multiple users.
- the content management system 208 can, over time, perform analysis to determine a number of users for which to estimate frequency, with a goal of reducing the number of users for which to obtain frequency estimates.
- some or all of the users used in the stage one processing can be selected as users for the stage two processing, and the stage two processing can be initiated immediately after the stage one processing (e.g., at the document “5201” in the example above).
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing performance estimates for a content campaign.
- the process 300 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 110 described above with respect to FIG. 1 or the content management system 208 described above with respect to FIG. 2 .
- a campaign including one or more targeting criteria for targeting content items to users is identified ( 302 ).
- a campaign sponsor can provide user input to create or edit a campaign using a campaign management user interface provided by the content management system 110 .
- the campaign can be, for example, a video campaign or some other type of campaign.
- Historical auction results are identified ( 304 ).
- the content management system 110 can identify historical auction results associated with auctions occurring during a predetermined time period. For example, historical auction results, including content served in response to content requests, from the previous week can be identified. A full week of historical auction results can be identified, for example, so that both weekend and weekday auction results are included in the identified historical auction results.
- a subset of the historical auction results occurring in the predetermined time period is identified. For example, historical auction results that are associated with one percent of the users for which auctions were performed during the predetermined time period can be identified. For example, if user identifiers associated with the historical auction results are numeric values, historical auction results that are associated with one percent of the users can be identified by identifying historical auction results that have an associated user identifier ending in a particular two digit value.
- a random two digit value can be determined (e.g., “38”), and all historical auction results that have associated user identifiers that end with the random two digit value (e.g., user identifiers “123438”, “445638”) can be identified, where the identified historical auction results can be an approximation of historical auction results that are associated with one percent of the users for which auctions were performed during the predetermined time period.
- the percentage of users for which auction results are identified is based on a country or region included in the targeting criteria. For example, a larger percentage of users may be identified for a country or region that has previously been identified as less homogenous or consistent in terms of user demographics or user behavior as compared to other countries or regions.
- the historical results are stored as a plurality of documents ( 306 ), one document for each auction, where storing an auction as a document includes storing serving criteria and a user identifier for a user that was served the content item based on the auction.
- a document can be, for example, one or more records in a database, a file, a part of a file, or a set of files, or some other type of structure for storing data.
- the documents can be stored, for example, in a repository (e.g., the document repository 234 , described above with respect to FIG. 2 ).
- the user identifier can be, for example, a cookie or some other type of user identifier.
- the plurality of documents is evaluated ( 308 ).
- the content management system can perform one or more queries.
- a query can include, for example, one or more index values, and document(s) that match the one or more index values can be retrieved.
- a query can be initiated from a beginning of the plurality of documents to determine an estimated number of impressions that would occur in the plurality of documents based on the targeting criteria.
- the content management system 110 can process the documents to identify documents that include serving criteria that match the targeting criteria. In some implementations, the content management system can process the documents until a predetermined number of matching documents are identified.
- the content management system 110 can determine a percentage of the processed documents as matching documents and can extrapolate to determine the estimated number of impressions that would occur in the plurality of documents based on the targeting criteria.
- An estimated total number of impressions for the targeting criteria in the time period is determined, based at least in part on the estimated number of impressions in the plurality of documents ( 310 ).
- the estimated total number of impressions can be determined as an extrapolation based on a number of historical auctions that are evaluated as compared to a total number of auctions that are conducted in a time period associated with the historical auction results.
- the estimated number of impressions in the plurality of documents is determined to be ten thousand.
- the plurality of documents is associated with one percent of the users for which auction results are stored.
- An estimated total number of impressions can be determined to be ten thousand divided by one percent, or one million.
- a total number of unique targeted users that will be targeted based on the targeting criteria in the time period is determined ( 312 ). For example, a frequency of impression can be determined for a plurality of the users represented in the plurality of documents as a sum of a frequency of impression for the plurality of users divided by a number of users. The total number of unique targeted users can be determined as the total number of impressions divided by the frequency of impression. In some implementations, a frequency for each of the unique users that are associated with one or more documents is determined. In some implementations, a frequency is determined for a subset of the users represented in the plurality of documents.
- the estimated total number of impressions is determined to be one million and suppose that the average frequency for ten identified users for which information is stored in the documents is estimated to be twenty.
- the estimated number of users can be determined to be one million divided by twenty, or fifty thousand.
- the estimated number of users can be presented to the campaign sponsor, such as on the campaign management user interface.
- determining the number of unique users that will be targeted based on the targeting criteria in the predetermined time period includes initiating a first query and one or more second queries on the document repository (e.g., the document repository 234 ).
- the first query can be a query to determine the estimated number of impressions that would occur in the documents based on the targeting criteria.
- the first query can be a query to determine a number of unique users that are associated with documents that satisfy the targeting criteria.
- the first query can be a query to determine a number of unique users that are associated with documents that satisfy the targeting criteria in a first subset of the document repository.
- One or more of the second queries can be a query to determine a number of unique users by querying the repository to determine a frequency of impression for users for the targeting criteria in the repository.
- the first query can be initiated at the beginning of the documents in the repository.
- at least one second query can be initiated also from the beginning of the documents in the repository.
- at least one second query can be initiated on or just after an entry in the repository where the first query terminated.
