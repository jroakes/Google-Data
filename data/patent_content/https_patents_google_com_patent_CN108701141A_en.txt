More specifically, the system and method for the present invention may include user apparatus (such as phone, wearable device) and calculate
System (such as server system).User apparatus can periodically provide home position to the computing system for implementing the present invention and report
It accuses.The report of each position can provide and user apparatus associated time and position.E.g., including in each position is reported
Position can be geocoding (such as latitude and longitude), IP address information, WiFi location informations or identification or be associated with specifically
The other information of position.
User can be provided that control, allows the user to choose whether and when allows system, program or feature as described herein
Collect user information (such as the current location of user, the information of social networks about user, social action or activity, occupation
Or preference), and whether from server to user send in perhaps communicate.Furthermore, it is possible to be stored or used in certain data
Handle the data in one or more ways before so that removal can recognize that the information of identity.For example, the identity of user can be by
Processing so that the information of recognizable identity will not be determined for user.What user can be to that should collect about user as a result,
How information use information and provides a user that information is controlled.
