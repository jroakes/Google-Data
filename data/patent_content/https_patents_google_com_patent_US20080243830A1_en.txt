Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of user suggested ordering to influence search result ranking.
- a search engine may use an algorithm (e.g., page rank, alphabetical, time based, influence based, credibility, etc.) to determine an order in which search results are displayed (e.g., which links are listed first, second, third, etc.).
- the search engine may seek to deliver more relevant search results to a user through the algorithm.
- Google® e.g., the search engine
- the page rank algorithm may consider how many other websites link to a particular link in determining an order in which the various links are displayed (e.g., to determine a relevancy, popularity, influence, etc. of the particular link).
- SEO professional Search Engine Optimization
- the search engine may consider which of the various links previous users had clicked on when they also entered ‘online education’. For example, if previous users had clicked more on a third link in the search results, that link may later move up in ranking of future search results. However, the user may have clicked on the third link only because it was listed earlier in the search results and/or because the snippet text in the search results was not clear as to what the content of the website referenced by the third link contained.
- the search engine may also consider credibility of a particular website. For example, Google® may place more weight when the third link is shown on a first page of search results on Yahoo® (e.g., the particular website) than when it shown on a first page of a link aggregator website (e.g., owned by the SEO company). However, credibility of a website may not reflect whether content in the particular link is credible with an average user.
- the search engine may consider a length of time a particular domain (e.g., a domain associated with the link) has been registered.
- the search engine may give more credence in search rankings to domains (e.g., websites and/or web pages, etc.) which have been in existence for a longer period of time as opposed to ones which have been in existence for shorter periods of time.
- domains e.g., websites and/or web pages, etc.
- most relevant content may just be on the domains which were most recently created.
- the search engine may give more preference to websites that have higher percentages of user generated content by placing them higher in the search result. For example, Wikipedia® or Fatdoor® may show up higher in a search result than other websites because they may include more user generated content. However, there may be other links in the search result which have content that is more relevant than the sites having the user generated content.
- Some websites may employ human editors to aid in search result rankings and/or relevancy (e.g., Yahoo®, Wikia®, etc.). However, such a model may not provide a voice to whether any particular link was relevant to the average user. In addition, on certain websites users may vote on whether a particular review was helpful to them (e.g., Yelp®, Amazon®, etc.). However, such a model may merely look at the particular review in isolation and may not consider the relative order in which any particular review was more or less helpful than reviews appearing immediately above or below the particular review.
- the other websites may seek to create ‘specialized’ search engines to improve results in a particular vertical.
- YouTube® may be specific for those searching for videos
- Froogle® may be specific for those searching for deals
- Spock® may be specific to those searching for people.
- the users may have to go to different websites to search for different categories of items and this can be a time consuming and/or a frustrating task.
- search results through current search engines do not provide a way for the users to express their personal relevance that can contribute to overall relevance.
- search engines e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, MSN®, Ask®, Amazon®, Yelp®, Spock® etc.
- the first two and/or three pages on the Google®, Yahoo®, and Ask® search results page for ‘online education’ today are filled with links to link aggregator websites (e.g., websites which may get paid to provide referrals).
- a method includes generating a search result having a set of links, each associated with a content data relevant to a search query, ranking individual ones of the set of links based on an algorithm (e.g., a page rank algorithm, an influence based algorithm, a human editor rank algorithm, a temporal existence algorithm, a user-generated content premium algorithm, and/or a specialized category search algorithm, etc.) in the search result, applying a weighting factor to certain ones of the set of links based on a user suggested ordering of the ranking of the individual ones of the set of links in relation to each other, and ordering the search result based on an application of the weighting factor on the search result.
- an algorithm e.g., a page rank algorithm, an influence based algorithm, a human editor rank algorithm, a temporal existence algorithm, a user-generated content premium algorithm, and/or a specialized category search algorithm, etc.
- the method may further include mathematically determining an influence of any individual one of the user suggested ordering in relation to other user suggested reordering requests based on a polymeric function that optimizes a relevance of the search result to an average user generating the search query.
- the method may also include balancing the weighting factor against a quantity of search queries in which there was no user suggested ordering requested during search sessions.
- the method may yet include providing an up arrow and a down arrow in each individual one of the set of links so that the average user clicks on at least one of the up arrow and the down arrow to see a requested movement above and/or below other individual ones of the set of links.
- the method may include generating a count of a number of times that the average users select the up arrow and the down arrow such that the count is visually displayed during a search experience of the average user.
- the method may further include providing recognition to the average user in helping to order the search result in a form of points viewable by other users of a search engine.
- the method may also include enabling the average user to select a page in which any particular link is suggested to be moved by the average user.
- the method may also include determining a relative influence of the average user with other average users based on an algorithmic scoring of influence of the average user on future search results conducted on shuffled data without receiving move requests by users to determine a relative alignment of the average user with relevancy to a popular outcome of the search query.
- the method may yet include providing a pointer to shuffled links such that even when the algorithm is rerun, the pointer provides a context of previous order preferences of a community of users in relation to other links in the refreshed search query.
- a system in another aspect, includes a user influence module to shuffle a search result based on a weighted preference of relevant links as determined by users contributing a perspective on relative order of the search result, a function module to apply a page rank algorithm in determining a relative order of links in the search result responsive to a search query, a factor module to apply a weighting factor to individual links in the search result such that certain ones of the individual links may be prioritized before other links, and a search module to generate the search result that dynamically adjusts as different users contribute perspectives through the user influence module.
- the system may further include an advertising module to embed certain links adjacent to the search result based on bidding between advertisers seeking impressions adjacent to the search result.
- the system may also include a category search module to enhance relevancy of the search results based on a category being searched through an application of different algorithms optimized to a category search employed.
- the system may yet include a claimable wiki module to embed in the search results, a section relevant to the search query associated with a claimable people profile wiki, a business profile wiki, an organization claimable profile wiki, a places wiki, and/or an other object wiki.
- system may include a pointer module to index and/or capture shuffled links across iterations of the search query with a search algorithm and a refresh module to apply the pointer module each time the search algorithm is reapplied even when certain links in the search result are activated, deactivated, modified, added, and/or deleted based on a re-indexing of Internet through the search algorithm.
- a method includes providing an interface in a search result that empowers each individual user to suggest where a particular listing in the search result is preferably placed, previewing each listing such that a summary text enables each individual user to make an informed placement selection, and generating a new search result based on a plurality of suggestions provided by the individual users through an algorithm that determines a relative weight of any one search movement request with each other.
- the method may further include applying a page ranking algorithm to determine the search result on a periodic basis while retaining an influence of the aggregate relative weight influence of the individual users providing feedback on specific links in the search result.
- the method may also include determining which of the individual users are more in line with a model average user based on an analysis of users not challenging a shuffled ranking order.

Abstract
Description
- This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional patent application No. 60/921,339, titled ‘User suggested ordering to influence search result ranking’ filed on Mar. 30, 2007.
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of user suggested ordering to influence search result ranking.
- A search engine (e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, YouTube®, MSN®, Amazon®, Wikipedia®, Wikia®, Spock®, A9®, Froogle®, etc.) may use an algorithm (e.g., page rank, alphabetical, time based, influence based, credibility, etc.) to determine an order in which search results are displayed (e.g., which links are listed first, second, third, etc.). The search engine may seek to deliver more relevant search results to a user through the algorithm.
- For example, Google® (e.g., the search engine) may use the page rank algorithm to determine the order in which various links (e.g., website URLs) are displayed when a user enters ‘online education’ in a search query. The page rank algorithm may consider how many other websites link to a particular link in determining an order in which the various links are displayed (e.g., to determine a relevancy, popularity, influence, etc. of the particular link). However, professional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) companies may artificially influence placement of the particular link by mass exchanging the particular link with other websites to increase references back.
- In addition, the search engine may consider which of the various links previous users had clicked on when they also entered ‘online education’. For example, if previous users had clicked more on a third link in the search results, that link may later move up in ranking of future search results. However, the user may have clicked on the third link only because it was listed earlier in the search results and/or because the snippet text in the search results was not clear as to what the content of the website referenced by the third link contained.
- The search engine may also consider credibility of a particular website. For example, Google® may place more weight when the third link is shown on a first page of search results on Yahoo® (e.g., the particular website) than when it shown on a first page of a link aggregator website (e.g., owned by the SEO company). However, credibility of a website may not reflect whether content in the particular link is credible with an average user.
- The search engine may consider a length of time a particular domain (e.g., a domain associated with the link) has been registered. The search engine may give more credence in search rankings to domains (e.g., websites and/or web pages, etc.) which have been in existence for a longer period of time as opposed to ones which have been in existence for shorter periods of time. However, sometimes, most relevant content may just be on the domains which were most recently created.
- The search engine may give more preference to websites that have higher percentages of user generated content by placing them higher in the search result. For example, Wikipedia® or Fatdoor® may show up higher in a search result than other websites because they may include more user generated content. However, there may be other links in the search result which have content that is more relevant than the sites having the user generated content.
- Some websites may employ human editors to aid in search result rankings and/or relevancy (e.g., Yahoo®, Wikia®, etc.). However, such a model may not provide a voice to whether any particular link was relevant to the average user. In addition, on certain websites users may vote on whether a particular review was helpful to them (e.g., Yelp®, Amazon®, etc.). However, such a model may merely look at the particular review in isolation and may not consider the relative order in which any particular review was more or less helpful than reviews appearing immediately above or below the particular review.
- The other websites may seek to create ‘specialized’ search engines to improve results in a particular vertical. For example, YouTube® may be specific for those searching for videos, while Froogle® may be specific for those searching for deals, and Spock® may be specific to those searching for people. However, the users may have to go to different websites to search for different categories of items and this can be a time consuming and/or a frustrating task.
- As a result, the search results through current search engines (e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, MSN®, Ask®, Amazon®, Yelp®, Spock® etc.) do not provide a way for the users to express their personal relevance that can contribute to overall relevance. For example, the first two and/or three pages on the Google®, Yahoo®, and Ask® search results page for ‘online education’ today are filled with links to link aggregator websites (e.g., websites which may get paid to provide referrals).
- A method, apparatus and system of user suggested ordering to influence search result ranking are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes generating a search result having a set of links, each associated with a content data relevant to a search query, ranking individual ones of the set of links based on an algorithm (e.g., a page rank algorithm, an influence based algorithm, a human editor rank algorithm, a temporal existence algorithm, a user-generated content premium algorithm, and/or a specialized category search algorithm, etc.) in the search result, applying a weighting factor to certain ones of the set of links based on a user suggested ordering of the ranking of the individual ones of the set of links in relation to each other, and ordering the search result based on an application of the weighting factor on the search result.
- The method may further include mathematically determining an influence of any individual one of the user suggested ordering in relation to other user suggested reordering requests based on a polymeric function that optimizes a relevance of the search result to an average user generating the search query. The method may also include balancing the weighting factor against a quantity of search queries in which there was no user suggested ordering requested during search sessions. The method may yet include providing an up arrow and a down arrow in each individual one of the set of links so that the average user clicks on at least one of the up arrow and the down arrow to see a requested movement above and/or below other individual ones of the set of links. In addition, the method may include generating a count of a number of times that the average users select the up arrow and the down arrow such that the count is visually displayed during a search experience of the average user.
- The method may further include providing recognition to the average user in helping to order the search result in a form of points viewable by other users of a search engine. The method may also include enabling the average user to select a page in which any particular link is suggested to be moved by the average user. The method may also include determining a relative influence of the average user with other average users based on an algorithmic scoring of influence of the average user on future search results conducted on shuffled data without receiving move requests by users to determine a relative alignment of the average user with relevancy to a popular outcome of the search query. The method may yet include providing a pointer to shuffled links such that even when the algorithm is rerun, the pointer provides a context of previous order preferences of a community of users in relation to other links in the refreshed search query.
- In another aspect, a system includes a user influence module to shuffle a search result based on a weighted preference of relevant links as determined by users contributing a perspective on relative order of the search result, a function module to apply a page rank algorithm in determining a relative order of links in the search result responsive to a search query, a factor module to apply a weighting factor to individual links in the search result such that certain ones of the individual links may be prioritized before other links, and a search module to generate the search result that dynamically adjusts as different users contribute perspectives through the user influence module.
- The system may further include an advertising module to embed certain links adjacent to the search result based on bidding between advertisers seeking impressions adjacent to the search result. The system may also include a category search module to enhance relevancy of the search results based on a category being searched through an application of different algorithms optimized to a category search employed. The system may yet include a claimable wiki module to embed in the search results, a section relevant to the search query associated with a claimable people profile wiki, a business profile wiki, an organization claimable profile wiki, a places wiki, and/or an other object wiki.
- In addition, the system may include a pointer module to index and/or capture shuffled links across iterations of the search query with a search algorithm and a refresh module to apply the pointer module each time the search algorithm is reapplied even when certain links in the search result are activated, deactivated, modified, added, and/or deleted based on a re-indexing of Internet through the search algorithm.
- In yet another aspect, a method includes providing an interface in a search result that empowers each individual user to suggest where a particular listing in the search result is preferably placed, previewing each listing such that a summary text enables each individual user to make an informed placement selection, and generating a new search result based on a plurality of suggestions provided by the individual users through an algorithm that determines a relative weight of any one search movement request with each other.
- The method may further include applying a page ranking algorithm to determine the search result on a periodic basis while retaining an influence of the aggregate relative weight influence of the individual users providing feedback on specific links in the search result. The method may also include determining which of the individual users are more in line with a model average user based on an analysis of users not challenging a shuffled ranking order.

user influence module 100 may enable average users to contribute a new perspective on the relative order of a search result as determined by other users based on a weighted preference of various links. Thefactor module 102 may apply a weighting factor to individual links in the search result to prioritize certain links based on user suggested ordering. Thesearch module 104 may generate the search result that dynamically adjusts according to the new perspective of the average users. Thepointer module 106 may capture shuffled links in the search result such that a pointer provides a context of previous order of the various links in a refreshed search result. Theadvertising module 108 may embed certain links (e.g., an advertisement link) adjacent to the various links during generation of the search result. - The
function module 110 may apply an algorithm (e.g., a page rank algorithm, an influence based algorithm, a human editor rank algorithm, a temporal existence algorithm, a user-generated premium algorithm and/or a specialized category search algorithm, etc.) to determine a relative order of the various links in the search result. Therefresh module 112 may apply thepointer module 106 to capture all shuffled links even when certain links are activated, deactivated, modified, added and/or deleted in a user influenced search result. - The
claimable wiki module 114 may provide a wiki interface (e.g., a people profile wiki, a business profile wiki, an organization profile wiki and/or a places wiki, etc.) generated in the search result along with the various links. Thecategory search module 116 may enable a category based search using the algorithm (e.g., the specialized category search algorithm) to generate accurate and/or relevant search results. - The
higher module 118 may enable the average users to move a particular link upwards in the search result for obtaining the user influenced search result.

search module 104 ofFIG. 1 ) and individual ones of the set of links may be ranked based on the algorithm (e.g., a page rank algorithm, a influence based algorithm, a human editor rank algorithm, a temporal existence algorithm, a user-generated content premium algorithm, and/or a specialized category search algorithm, etc.) in the search result. The weighting factor may be applied (e.g., using thefactor module 102 ofFIG. 1 ) to certain ones of the set of links (e.g., based on the user suggested ordering of the ranking of the individual ones of the set of links in relation to each other). - The search result may be ordered based on an application of the weighting factor (e.g., using the
factor module 102 ofFIG. 1 ) on the search result. An influence of any individual one of the user suggested ordering may be determined mathematically in relation to other user suggested reordering requests based on a polymeric function that optimizes a relevance of the search result to an average user generating the search query. The weighting factor may be balanced against a quantity of search queries in which there was no user suggested ordering requested during search sessions. - A recognition may be provided to the average user in helping to order the search result in a form of points viewable by the other users of the search engine (e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, YouTube®, MSN®, Amazon®, Wikipedia®, Wikia®, Spock®, A9®, Froogle®, etc.). For example, the average user may be enabled to select a page in which any particular link is suggested to be moved by the average user. A relative influence of the average user with other average users may be determined (e.g., based on an algorithmic scoring of influence of the average user on future search results conducted on shuffled data without receiving move requests by users to determine a relative alignment of the average user with relevancy to a popular outcome of the search query).
- The pointer may be provided (e.g., through the
pointer module 106 ofFIG. 1 ) to shuffled links such that even when the algorithm is rerun, the pointer provides the context of previous order preferences of a community of users in relation to other links in the refreshed search query. Theuser influence module 100 may shuffle the search result based on the weighted preference of relevant links as determined by the users contributing the perspective on the relative order of the search result. Thefunction module 110 may apply the page rank algorithm in determining the relative order of links in the search result responsive to the search query. - The
factor module 102 may apply a weighting factor to individual links in the search result such that certain ones of the individual links are prioritized before other links. Thesearch module 104 may generate a search result that dynamically adjusts as different users contribute perspectives through theuser influence module 100. Theadvertising module 108 may embed certain links adjacent to the search result based on bidding between advertisers seeking impressions adjacent to the search result. Thecategory search module 116 may enhance relevancy of the search results based on a category being searched through an application of different algorithms optimized to a category search employed. - The
claimable wiki module 114 may embed in the search results, a section relevant to the search query associated with a claimable people profile wiki, a business profile wiki, an organization claimable profile wiki, a places wiki, and/or an other object wiki. Thepointer module 106 may index and/or capture shuffled links across iterations of the search query with a search algorithm (e.g., the category search algorithm). Therefresh module 112 may apply the pointer module each time the search algorithm is reapplied even when certain links in the search result are activated, deactivated, modified, added, and/or deleted based on a re-indexing of Internet through the search algorithm. For example, it may be determined which of the individual users are more in line with a model average user based on an analysis of users not challenging a shuffled ranking order. -

FIG. 15 is a schematic representation of a typical relationship between three hypertext documents and the userinfluence module D 100, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 15 illustrates the userinfluence module D 100, ahypertext document A 1500, ahypertext document B 1502 and ahypertext document C 1504, according to one embodiment. - The user
influence module D 100 may enable a user to contribute a new perspective on relative order of the search result as determined by the users based on the weighted preference of relevant links. The hypertext documents A 1500,B 1502 andC 1504 may include links relevant to the search query. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 15 , the first link in thehypertext document B 1502 points to thehypertext document A 1500. Similarly, the first link in thehypertext document C 1504 points to thehypertext document A 1500. Thus, the hypertext documents B 1502 andC 1504 are backlinks of thehypertext document A 1500. Thehypertext document A 1500 is a forward link of the hypertext documents B 1502 andC 1504. The userinfluence module D 100 interacts with thehypertext document A 1500 allowing the average users to rank the various links present in the hypertext documents such that the user suggested ordering of the search result may be obtained. -
FIG. 16 is anexample formula 1600 using a page rank algorithm, according to one embodiment. The rank ‘r(A)’ of a page A (e.g., thehypertext document A 1500 ofFIG. 15 ) is defined by the formula -
r(A)=(α/N+(1−α)(r(B 1)/|B 1 |+ . . . +r(B n)/|B n|))X - where,
B1, . . . , Bn are the backlink pages of A,
r(B1), . . . , r(Bn) are the ranks of B1, . . . , Bn respectively,
|B1|, . . . , |Bn| are the numbers of forward links of B1, . . . , Bn respectively,
α is a constant in the interval [0,1],
N is the total number of pages in the web and
X is the user influence factor, according to one embodiment. - The rank of a page may be a measure of importance of the page. The rank of the page may be interpreted as the probability that a surfer (e.g., a user) will be at the page after following a large number of forward links. The ranks form a probability distribution over web pages, so that the sum of ranks over all web pages is unity. The constant α in the formula is interpreted as the probability that the web surfer will jump randomly to any web page instead of following the forward link. Page ranks for all the pages may be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm and corresponds to principal eigenvector of normalized link matrix of the web.
- The iteration process can be understood as a steady-state probability distribution calculated from a model of a random surfer. The model includes an initial N-dimensional probability distribution vector p0 where each component p0[i] gives the initial probability that the random surfer will start at a node i and an N×N transition probability matrix A where each component A[i][j] gives the probability that the surfer will move from node i to node j.
- The search engine is used to locate documents that match the specified search criteria, either by searching full text, or by searching titles only. In addition, the search may include anchor text associated with backlinks to the page. Once a set of documents is identified that match the search terms, the list of documents may be then sorted with high ranking documents first and low ranking documents last.
- In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 16 , the user influence factor X is deployed. The results generated by the iterative process may be further fine tuned according to the preference of the average user by using a suitable input for X. The search result may be shuffled and reorganized to suit the needs of the particular average user according to the value used for X. Hence, the end user may be allowed to modify the search to suit his/her specific needs making the search experience more user-friendly and meaningful. In this way, the model may better approximate human usage and/or rank documents in a database by modeling human behavior when surfing the web in a better manner. - In one example embodiment, the quality of results from web search engines (e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, etc.) may be enhanced. For example, an individual user influenced ranking method may be integrated into a web search engine to produce results far superior to existing methods.
- In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 16 , the page ranking algorithm may be applied to determine the search result on a periodic basis while retaining an influence of the aggregate relative weight influence of the individual users providing feedback on the specific links in the search result. -
FIG. 17 is a schematic representation of a ranking method of hypertext documents using the userinfluence module D 100, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 17 illustrates the userinfluence module D 100, ahypertext document A 1700, ahypertext document B 1702 and ahypertext document C 1704, according to one embodiment. - The user
influence module D 100 may enable the user to contribute a new perspective on relative order of the search result as determined by the users based on a weighted preference of relevant links. The hypertext documents A 1700,B 1702 andC 1704 may include links relevant to the search query. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 17 , each of the hypertext documents includes links represented by horizontal dark lines. The value written below the label A namely 0.4 represents the rank r(A) of thehypertext document A 1700. The value written below the label B namely 0.2 represents the rank r(B) of thehypertext document B 1702. The value written below the label C namely 0.4 represents the rank r(C) of thehypertext document C 1704. - For ease of illustration we assume that r=0. In the present example, the
hypertext document A 1700 has a single backlink to thehypertext document C 1704 and this is the only forward link of thehypertext document C 1704, so -
r(A)=r(C). - The
hypertext document B 1702 has a single backlink to thehypertext document A 1700, but this is one of two forward links of thehypertext document A 1700, so -
r(B)=r(A)/2. - The
hypertext document C 1704 has two backlinks. One backlink is to thehypertext document B 1702 and this is the only forward link ofhypertext document B 1702. The other backlink is to document A 1700 via the other of the two forward links from thehypertext document A 1700. Thus -
r(C)=r(B)+r(A)/2 - Since the sum of ranks over all web pages is unity,
-
r(A)+r(B)+r(C)=1. - Substituting from above relations, r(A)=0.4, r(B)=0.2 and r(C)=0.4.
- Although a typical value for α is about 0.1, if for simplicity we set α=0.5 (which corresponds to a 50% chance that a surfer will randomly jump to one of the three pages rather than following a forward link), then the mathematical relationships between the ranks may become more complicated.
- In particular, we then have
-
r(A)=⅙+r(C)/2, -
r(B)=⅙+r(A)/4 and -
r(C)=⅙+r(A)/4+r(B)/2. - The solution in the case is r(A)= 14/39, r(B)= 10/39 and r(C)= 15/39.
- In practice, there may be millions of documents and hence, it may not be possible to find the solution to millions of equations by inspection. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment an iterative procedure is used. At the initial state we may simply set all the ranks equal to 1/N. The formulas may be then used to calculate a new set of ranks based on the existing ranks. In the case of millions of documents, sufficient convergence typically takes on the order of 100 iterations.
- The user
influence module D 100 interacts with thehypertext document C 1704 allowing the average users to rank various links present in the hypertext documents (e.g., the hyper text document 1700A, thehypertext document B 1702 and the hypertext document C 1704) such that a user suggested ordering of the search result may be obtained. -
FIG. 18 is a process flow of a computer implemented method for calculating an importance rank for N linked nodes (e.g., a node may correspond to a web page document) of a linked database, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 1802, an initial N-dimensional vector p0 may be selected. Inoperation 1804, an approximation pn to a steady-state probability p∞ may be computed in accordance with the equation pn=Anp0. Inoperation 1806, a rank r[k] for node k may be determined from a kth component of pn and a user influence module score may be applied. -
FIG. 19A is a process flow of generating a user suggested ordering of links in a search result, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 1902, a search result having a set of links each associated with a content data relevant to a search query may be generated (e.g., using thesearch module 104 ofFIG. 1 ). Inoperation 1904, individual ones of the set of links may be ranked (e.g., using thefunction module 110 ofFIG. 1 ) based on an algorithm in the search result. Inoperation 1906, a weighting factor may be applied (e.g., using thefactor module 102 ofFIG. 1 ) to certain ones of the set of links based on a user suggested ordering of the ranking of the individual ones of the set of links in relation to each other. - In
operation 1908, the search result may be ordered based on an application of the weighting factor (e.g., using thefactor module 102 ofFIG. 1 ) on the search result. Inoperation 1910, an influence of any individual one of the user suggested ordering in relation to other user suggested reordering requests may be determined mathematically (e.g., using theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) based on a polymeric function that optimizes a relevance of the search result to an average user generating the search query. Inoperation 1912, the weighting factor may be balanced against a quantity of search queries (e.g., using theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) in which there was no user suggested ordering requested during search sessions. -
FIG. 19B is a continuation of the process flow ofFIG. 19A illustrating additional processes, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 1914, an up arrow and a down arrow may be provided (e.g., through thehigher module 118 and thelower module 120 ofFIG. 1 ) in each individual one of the set of links so that the average user clicks on the any one of the up arrow and the down arrow to see the requested movement above and/or below other individual ones of the set of links. Inoperation 1916, a count of a number of times that the average users select the up arrow and the down arrow may be generated (e.g., through thepointer module 106 ofFIG. 1 ) such that the count is visually displayed during a search experience of the average user. Inoperation 1918, recognition may be provided (e.g., through theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) to the average user in helping to order the search result in a form of points viewable by other users of a search engine. - In
operation 1920, the average user may be enabled to select a page (e.g., using theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) in which any particular link is suggested to be moved by the average user. Inoperation 1922, a relative influence of the average user with other average users may be determined (e.g., using theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) based on an algorithmic scoring of influence of the average user on future search results conducted on shuffled data without receiving move requests by users to determine a relative alignment of the average user with relevancy to a popular outcome of the search query. Inoperation 1924, a pointer may be provided (e.g., using thepointer module 106 ofFIG. 1 ) to shuffled links such that even when the algorithm is rerun, the pointer provides a context of previous order preferences of a community of users in relation to other links in the refreshed search query. -
FIG. 20 is a process flow of providing an interface to shuffle a search result, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 2002, an interface may be provided (e.g., using theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) in a search result that empowers each individual user to suggest where a particular listing in the search result is preferably placed. Inoperation 2004, each listing may be previewed such that a summary text enables each individual user to make an informed placement selection. Inoperation 2006, a new search result may be generated (e.g., using therefresh module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) based on suggestions provided by individual users through an algorithm that determines a relative weight of any one search movement request with each other. - In
operation 2008, a page ranking algorithm may be applied (e.g., using thefunction module 110 ofFIG. 1 ) to determine the search result on a periodic basis while retaining an influence of the aggregate relative weight influence of individual users providing feedback on specific links in the search result. Inoperation 2010, it may be determined (e.g., using theuser influence module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) which of the individual users are more in line with a model average user based on an analysis of users not challenging a shuffled ranking order. - Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments. For example, the various devices, modules, analyzers, generators, etc. described herein may be enabled and operated using hardware circuitry (e.g., CMOS based logic circuitry), firmware, software and/or any combination of hardware, firmware, and/or software (e.g., embodied in a machine readable medium).
