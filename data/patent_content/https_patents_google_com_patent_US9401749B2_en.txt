CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/775,333, filed Mar. 8, 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure is directed to a method and apparatus for channel feedback in a wireless system with antenna arrays. More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to feedback from a wireless terminal to a base station.
BACKGROUND
A Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) communication system uses a plurality of channels in a spatial area. Antenna arrays that have multiple transmission antennas can increase the capacity of data transmission through MIMO transmission schemes.
Two types of MIMO transmission schemes can be employed. Single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) involves transmitting at least one data stream to a single user over a time frequency resource. Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) involves transmitting at least one data stream per user to at least two co-scheduled users over a single, i.e., same time frequency, resource.
In a MIMO communication system, base stations and mobile stations use codebooks to enable channel state information feedback. The codebooks may additionally be used for precoding the information streams at the transmitter. Elements of a codebook are stored in both base stations and in mobile stations, and can be used to quantize the spatial channel state information for feedback. Each codebook element is a vector or a matrix, depending on the dimension of the channel matrix and the number of data streams supported. When communicating with a base station, the mobile station receives a Channel State Information Reference Signal (CSI-RS) from the base station and, using the CSI-RS, determines the state of the channel (generally referred to as Channel State Information (CSI)) between it and the base station and, based on the channel state, selects a vector or a matrix from the codebook. The mobile station then “recommends” the selected vector or matrix to the base station as part of overall CSI feedback. The base station may then use the recommended vector for beamforming or, more generally, the recommended matrix for precoding data streams prior to transmission via multiple antennas. Precoding is a technique that is used to weight multiple data streams transmitted from an antenna array in order to maximize the throughput of the link.
Typically, MIMO systems support a maximum of eight CSI-RS ports. However, some base station antenna arrays may employ more than eight antenna elements, which exceeds the number of CSI-RS antenna ports available. Furthermore, large antenna arrays may require additional CSI, including precoding vector or matrix recommendations, from connected mobile stations.

FIG. 4 is a block diagram of the antenna array 345 (FIG. 2) according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, the antenna array 345 is a transmit (Tx) antenna grid of M×N antennas 410, and includes M dipoles and N (N>1) columns of M dipole elements arranged as N columns of M elements each. Antennas other than dipoles may also be used. Alternatively, the antenna array 345 can include (M/2) cross-pole antenna pairs arranged as N columns of (M/2) cross-pole antenna pairs. Vertical inter-element separation is denoted by dV, where dVε{0.5λ,4λ} and horizontal inter-element separation is denoted by dV, where dVε{0.5λ,4λ}, and where λ is the wavelength applicable to the center frequency of the LTE carrier or carrier frequency of the transmitted signal. In an alternative embodiment, the antenna array 345 is a closely-spaced 4 Tx antenna array having two pairs of cross-polarized antennas 430 separated by 0.5λ. In a further embodiment, antenna array 345 is a widely-spaced 4 Tx antenna array having two pairs of cross-polarized antennas 450 separated by 4λ.
The eNB 120 (FIG. 1) can estimate an Angle of Departure (AoD) of a Tx signal and/or a UE 110 coarse location with respect to the antenna array 345 (FIG. 2) based on an uplink Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) transmission or more generally, any uplink transmissions from the UE 110 (FIG. 1), by leveraging uplink channel response reciprocity (in Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems) or multipath direction of arrival reciprocity (in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)) systems). The antenna array 345 can be calibrated with respect to AoD, which allows beamsteering in the direction of the UE 110.
FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates the signal processing that the eNB 120 (FIG. 1) carries out when communicating with the UE 110 (FIG. 1) according to an embodiment. A data stream 560, which is a spatial layer that includes a sequence of modulation symbols, is first multiplied in multipliers 540 by complex-valued weighting factors. The resulting baseband signals, one for each antenna 530 of the antenna array 345 (FIG. 3) are provided to transceivers 510, which convert the baseband signals to a carrier frequency.
The transceivers 510 may also apply filtering and additional processing to the signal. The transceiver output is then passed to power amplifiers (PA) 520, which increase the signal's power. The output of the PAs 520 is then fed to the antennas 530. The phase and amplitude of the signals in each antenna 530 can be therefore be controlled so as to obtain a constructive signal pattern at the UE 110 (FIG. 1). The beams or transmit radiation patterns can be adjusted in the horizontal and the vertical direction by changing the weighting factors 550. Transmission-power adjustment or deployment of beams for transmitting and receiving signals can be used to meet channel requirements. Beamforming can help to cope with multipath situations and can overcome extra attenuation by providing extra power concentration. Beamforming can also be used to reduce interference to adjacent cells or co-scheduled UEs within a cell or coordinating cluster of cells in case of MU-MIMO.
The method of beamforming illustrated in FIG. 5 is only an example of how to implement beamforming of a data stream 560. Alternatively, the weighting factors may be applied after the signal has been translated to the carrier frequency either immediately after the transceiver or after the PA or may be divided in to multiple weighting factors applied at different locations in the transmit chain, e.g., a weighting factor applied in baseband and a weighting factor applied after the transceiver.
Precoding is a part of 3GPP Release 8 and Release 10. According to 3GPP Release 8 and Release 10, the precoder takes as input a block of vectors x(i)=[x(0)(i) . . . x(υ-1)(i)]T, i=0, 1, . . . , Msymb layer−1 from the layer mapping and generates a block of vectors y(i)=[ . . . y(p)(i) . . . ]T, i=0, 1, . . . , Msymb ap−1 to be mapped onto resources on each of the antenna ports, where y(p)(i) represents the signal for antenna port p.
Precoding for spatial multiplexing is defined by
where the precoding matrix W(i) is of size P×υ and i=0, 1, . . . , Msymb ap−1, Msymb ap=Msymb layer.
For spatial multiplexing, the values of W(i) can be selected among the precoder elements in the codebook configured in the eNodeB and the UE. The eNodeB can further confine the precoder selection in the UE to a subset of the elements in the codebook using codebook subset restrictions.
Release 8 precoding for two antenna ports (2 Tx) and four antenna ports (4 Tx) can be of the form as below.
For transmission on two antenna ports, pε{0,1}, the precoding matrix W(i) can be selected from Table 1 or a subset thereof. For the closed-loop spatial multiplexing transmission mode, the codebook index 0 is not used when the number layers is υ=2.

For a Release 10, 8 Tx codebook, precoding can be represented as
y=W 1 W 2 x (Equation 1)
where W1 can be a wideband precoder that takes advantage of the correlation properties of the channel, properties which are long-term in nature, and W2 performs co-phasing on a short-term basis. Here, x is the vector of modulated symbols and y is the vector of signal transmitted from each PA. The matrix W1 has the structure
where the NT/2×r matrix {tilde over (W)} has columns taken from an oversampled Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix. The 2r×r co-phasing matrix W2 is of the form
for rank 1 and
for rank 2.
The present disclosure sets forth 4 Tx codebook enhancements that may be used as further enhancements to the DL-MIMO Work Item in LTE Release 12 in an embodiment. It has been proposed that the existing codebooks (Release 8) based on Householder reflections are sufficient. It has also been proposed that there is a need to define a dual codebook structure (similar to the Release 10 8-Tx codebook in principle). The Householder reflections-based 4 Tx codebook is not ideally suited for MU-MIMO scheduling as the limited 4-bit PMI feedback results in suboptimal Block-Zero Forcing (ZF) or Zero-Forcing Dirty Paper Coding (ZF-DPC) implementations at the eNB. This leads to co-scheduled user interference at the receiver limiting the sum rate.
To illustrate, consider a K-user system with each user equipped N receive antennas and the base station equipped with M (<K) Tx antennas. For simplicity, consider the case of N=1 receive antennas at each user. The received signal vector at the K users can be written as
y=HUs+v
where H is the K×M channel matrix, U is the M×M precoding matrix, s is the M×1 Tx signal vector and the co-channel interference plus noise, n, is complex Gaussian, i.e., v˜CN(0,σ2 I). The sum-rate for this system is
where h*k is the k-th row of H, uk is the k-th column of U and k(m) denotes the user selected for the m-th stream. In the large-SNR regime (σ2→0), the ergodic sum-rate can be written as
under the assumption that U is unitary and g*k(m):=h*k(m)/|h*k(m)|.
If the UEs use a first codebook that allows the eNB to realize a certain set of absolute values of the inner products {|g*k(m)uk(m)|C1} and there exists a second codebook that allows the eNB to realize a second set of inner products {|g*k(m)uk(m)|C2} such that
holds with non-zero probability, then the MU-MIMO sum rate can be increased.
In an embodiment, codebook enhancement by linear extension can be used to increase the MU-MIMO sum rate. Suppose that the B-bit rank-L codebook comprising M×L matrices is denoted as C(L)={Uj:1≦j≦2B} where the columns within each matrix are mutually orthonormal. If v1 and v2 are two distinct columns of some UεC(L), the vector formed by the linear extension u:=(v1+αv2)/√{square root over (1+|α|2)} is also a unit vector, where a is a real or complex-valued number.
A Release 8, 4 Tx codebook has the property that the unit vectors comprising the C(1) codebook are one of the 4 columns of a corresponding matrix in the C(4) codebook. Therefore, the codebook enhancement can be viewed as a 2-step process:
-
- 1. The k-th UE can be configured to feed back the best v1 vector using rank-1 feedback (e.g., using an appropriate codebook subset restriction).
- 2. Since v1 is a column of some matrix UεC(4), the UE can then find a v2 (different from v1) which is another distinct column from U so as to maximize the inner product |h*ku| where:
u:=(v 1 +αv 2)/√{square root over (1+|α|2)} (Equation 5)
- a. In an embodiment, only ┌log2 M┐=2 (M=4) additional bits are required to feedback
- i. the index of v2 given that v1 has been selected by the usual rank-1 PMI feedback and
- ii. the case when α=0 (or v2=0) is optimal
- b. The parameter α can be fixed (in the specification) or can be quantized to a B′ bit codebook and fed back to the base station.
Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Receiver SNR with Codebook Linear Extension.
For simplicity, α can be real valued. A MISO receiver at the UE selects a PMI vector so as to maximize the inner product |g*ku|, where gk=hk/|hk|. Note that
Futhermore,
a 2 :=|g* k v 1|2
b 2 :=|g* k v 2|2
c:=Re(g* k v 1 v* 2 g k)/ab
In an embodiment, 0≦|c|≦1 and b2≦a2, the latter by the virtue of the fact
that rank-1 PMI feedback selected v1. By change of variables f(z):=|g*ku|2=a2 z+b2(1−z)±2abc√{square root over (z−z2)} is derived. The sign ambiguity comes from a choice for the change of variables. It is also possible that ½<z≦1 and
By selecting a positive solution for α (for a given v2, a positive solution is used for α (i.e., α>0) when c>0; otherwise choose a negative solution for α), it can be ensured that f(z) is concave and has a unique maximum.
It can be noted that
f(z)−a 2=√{square root over (1−z)}{−(a 2 −b 2)√{square root over (1−z)}±2abc√{square root over (z)}}.
If a=b, i.e., |g*kv1|=|g*kv2|, selecting the positive root for α (again, for a given v2, a positive solution is used for α (i.e., α>0) when c>0; otherwise choose a negative solution for α) leads to f(z)−a2>0 or |g*ku|>|g*kv1|.
For a>b, by selecting
it is determined that f(z)−a2>0 or |g*ku|>|g*kv1|.
As understood from the foregoing, the maximum absolute value of inner product |g*ku| can be increased by allowing linear extensions to the codebook leading to an improvement in the supported SNR and the reported CQI.
UE Feedback
In an embodiment, a UE can select a best v1, v2 and α jointly such that
The range zε(0.5,1] can be sampled (e.g., uniformly sampled) with B′ bits and the corresponding α can be fed back to the base station along with a 2-bit feedback for v2. Alternatively, α can be directly quantized with B′ bits and the corresponding α can be fed back to the base station along with a 2-bit feedback for v2. With this approach, the PMI feedback comprises
1. 4-bit PMI to feedback v1
2. 2-bit PMI to feedback v2
3. B′ bits to feedback α.
α, v2 and/or v1 may be fed back separately (separate encoding e.g. mapped to different set of bits in a message) or two or more of α, v2 and v1 may be jointly encoded and fed back by the UE in one CSI (Channel State Information) report. For example, v1 may be fed back as done currently in Releases 8-11 using a 4-bit PMI indicator and (α, v2) may be jointly encoded and fed-back as a X-bit indicator.
The PMI feedback of v1, α, v2 may be in the same uplink subframe or in different uplink subframes. The uplink subframe carrying PMI feedback of v1, α, and/or v2, may also carry other CSI related information such as Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Type Indicator (PTI), and CQI (Channel Quality Information) conditioned on the selected PMI u. The CQI may be wideband CQI (e.g., spanning the entire downlink system bandwidth) or subband CQI (e.g., a set of k contiguous PRBs (Physical Resource Blocks) where k is a function of system bandwidth). For example, the 4-bit PMI indicator for v1 may be indicated in a first subframe and the α, v2 may be indicated in a second uplink subframe, the second uplink subframe being different than the first uplink subframe. The first uplink subframe may carry other CSI related information such as a Rank Indicator (RI). The second uplink subframe may carry other CSI related information such as a CQI. In another embodiment, the RI and the PTI may be indicated in a CSI report in a subframe other than the first and second subframe.
In a second approach, a is fixed (in the specification) and UE selects best v1 and v2 such that
With this approach, the components of PMI are same as described above except that feedback for α is absent.
For case of α being fixed, v2 can be fed back using a 2-bit PMI (second PMI) indicator (including a state for the case of v2=0 or α=0). The PMI feedback of v1, v2 may be in the same uplink subframe or in different uplink subframes. For example, the 4-bit PMI indicator for v1 may be indicated in a first subframe and the 2-bit PMI indicator v2 may be indicated in a second uplink subframe, the second uplink subframe being different than the first uplink subframe. The uplink subframe carrying PMI feedback of v1 and/or v2, may also carry other CSI related information such as Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Type Indicator (PTI), and CQI (Channel Quality Information) conditioned on the selected PMI u. The CQI may be wideband CQI (e.g., spanning the entire downlink system bandwidth) or subband CQI (e.g., a set of k contiguous PRBs (Physical Resource Blocks) where k is a function of system bandwidth).
For example, the 4-bit PMI indicator for v1 may be indicated in a first subframe and the v2 may be indicated in a second uplink subframe, the second uplink subframe being different than the first uplink subframe. The first uplink subframe may carry other CSI related information such as a Rank Indicator (RI). The second uplink subframe may carry other CSI related information such as a CQI. In another embodiment, the RI and the PTI may be indicated in a CSI report in a subframe other than the first and second subframe.
Relation of Linear Extension to W1 W2 Product Form
The overall precoding matrix can be written down in product form as below.
where only one of α2, α3 and α4 is equal to α and the remainder are zeros and where UεC(4).
Linear Extension for Rank>1
This approach can be extended to the multiple rank (rank>1) case by adding more columns to the second matrix in the product form. Specifically, for rank 2:
thus ensuring that the precoder has unit power and the columns of the overall precoder are orthogonal.
In LTE Release 8, for rank 2, α12=0, α21=α31=α41=0 and α12=1 for only one i>1. For the rank 2 precoding matrices for which α22=1, linear extension to the rank 2 codebook can be formed by letting the second matrix take one the following two alternative forms:
where the αij's shown are non-zero. Extending the Release 8 codebook for rank 3 and rank 4 needs further consideration.
General Representation in Product Form
Linear extension can be represented in a general form:
where U is a NTX×n matrix from a codebook with unit-norm columns, U(:, j) is the j-th columns of U, αj,k are real-valued or complex-valued numbers, and v is the number of spatial layers or rank associated with the precoding matrix P.
Since,
the k-th column of P (k=1, . . . , ν) is a linear combination of distinct columns of U.
Rank-1 Codebook
In an embodiment, the set of precoders are denoted by a set of 64 vectors vi, iε{0, 1, . . . , 63}, each of length 4. The first 16 precoders of the codebook are given by the 16 Release 8 precoding matrices,
v i =W i (1) , i={0,1, . . . , 15},
where Wi (1), i={0, 1, . . . , 15} are defined in Table 2. Wn (s) denotes the matrix defined by the column set (s) of the unitary matrix Wn formed by Householder reflections, where Wn=I−2unun H/un Hun where I is the 4×4 identity matrix and the vector un is given by Table 2.
The remaining 48 precoders are the set of all possible precoders of the form:
where j≠1, j={2, 3, 4}. We can choose a fixed value for α (e.g., α equal to 0.8).
In an embodiment, the UE can first choose the best Release 8 precoder within the existing set of 16 rank-1 precoders vi=Wi (1), i={0, 1, . . . , 15}, and then can determine if this best Release 8 precoder (with codebook index i) can be improved by linear combination with any one of the column vectors (scaled by α) Wi (2), Wi (3), and Wi (4). With this codebook structure, the UE processing can be simplified into two steps:
Step 1. UE selects the best Wi (1) from a set of 16 candidates
Step 2. UE selects the best Wi (j) from the set of {0, Wi (2), Wi (3), Wi (4)} where 0 is the null vector conditioned on already selected best Wi (1) from Step 1.
Accordingly, the UE is able to select the pair (Wi (1), Wi (j)) based on evaluating an SINR (or CQI) metric over a total of 19 candidates (as opposed to 16 candidates in Release 8 for rank-1 feedback). The last three candidates are linear combinations of Release 8 rank-1 precoding vectors that depend on the selected Wi (1).
The four candidates in Step 1 and Step 2 above can be written as:
where only one αj=α for exactly one value of j such that 2≦j≦4 and equal to zero otherwise. The precoding vector vk complies with the W1W2 product form where W1 can correspond to wideband PMI and W2 can correspond to subband PMI.
Alternatively, the precoding vector obtained by linear extension can be decomposed as:
such that W1=I.
There are two alternatives for selecting α.
Alternative 1: Fixed α
The optimal value for α can be determined based on system simulations. For example, a value of α=0.8 can be used.
Alternative 2: Variable α
For this alternative, larger codebooks must be considered. For example, the codebook can be expanded by increasing the alphabet for α from the single value of 0.8 to a set of values such as αε{-0.8, 0.8}. In general, if the size of the allowed alphabet for α is K, the size of the codebook is given by 16·(1+3K), and the number of candidate precoders that must be evaluated by the UE is 16+3K.
Rank-2 Codebook (First Embodiment)
In one embodiment, the existing rank-2 codebook in Table 2 for four Tx antennas is specified in the column for υ=2 layers of Table 2. The codebook consists of a total of sixteen 4×2 matrices. For rank-2 transmissions, the size of this codebook is expanded from 16 to 48 in the following manner.
To begin, the 16 rank-2 codebooks from Table 2 are included. The following three 4×4 permutation matrices can then be defined. The first of these permutation matrices P1 is the identity matrix. The second permutation matrix P2 exchanges the second and third columns and is given by:
The third permutation matrix P3 exchanges the second and fourth columns and is given by
Wi,2 can denote the rank-2 precoding matrix corresponding to the codebook index i in Table 2. With the above permutation matrices, the Release-8 rank-2 codebook in Table 2 can be expressed as
where the unitary matrix Wn is Wn=I−2unun H/un Hun where I is the 4×4 identity matrix and the vector un is given by Table 2, and m (0 is given in Table 4:

The codebook from 16 to 48 can be extended by defining
In the enhanced codebook, the triplet (Wi′,2, Wi′+16,2, Wi′+32,2) where i′=0, 2, . . . , 15 corresponds to the original codebook and its linear extensions (e.g., (W0,2, W16,2, W32,2) is one triplet where W16,2 and W32,2 are linear extensions of W0,2).
Similar to the rank-1 case, the UE can first choose the best Release 8 precoder within the existing set of 16 rank-2 precoders Wi,2=, i={0, 1, . . . , 15}, and then can determine if this best Release 8 precoder (with codebook index i) can be improved by linear combinations with the unused column vectors (scaled by α) of Wi. With this method, the UE may only need to evaluate a total of 18 rank-2 candidate precoders which includes first selecting a precoder from the set of 16 existing Release 8 rank-2 precoders Wi,2=, i={0, 1, . . . , 15}, and then selecting from two linear combination rank-2 precoders that depend on the selected Wi,2.
Rank-2 Codebook (Second Embodiment)
In another embodiment, the existing rank-2 codebook for four Tx antennas is specified in the column for υ=2 layers of Table 2. The codebook consists of a total of sixteen 4×2 matrices. For rank-2 transmissions, the size of the codebook is expanded from 16 to 48 in the following manner. Each of the rank 2 codebooks in Table 2 can be represented in the following manner:
where Wi,2 denotes the rank two precoding matrix corresponding to codebook index i in Table 2, and the vectors β•,1 i and β•,2 i also depend on the codebook index i. The unitary matrix Wn is Wn=I−2unun H/un Hun where I is the 4×4 identity matrix and the vector un is given by Table 2. The vectors β•,1 i and β•,2 i for all i are defined in the Table 5 below.

In the enhanced codebook, the triplet is, (Wi′,2, Wi′+16,2, Wi′+32,2) where i′=0, 2, . . . , 15 corresponds to the original codebook and its linear extensions (e.g., (W0,2, W16,2, W32,2) is one triplet where W16,2 and W32,2 are linear extensions of W0,2).
Similar to the rank-1 case the UE can first choose the best Release 8 precoder within the existing set of 16 rank-2 precoders Wi,2=, i={0, 1, . . . , 15}, and then can determine if this best Release 8 precoder (with codebook index i) can be improved by linear combinations with the unused column vectors (scaled by α) of Wi. With this method, the UE may only need to evaluate a total of 18 rank-2 precoders, 16 existing Release 8 rank-2 precoders=, i={0, 1, . . . , 15}, and two linear combination rank-2 precoders that depend on the selected Wi,2.
Simulation Results
An MU-MIMO system simulation with K=10 users, M=4 Tx antennas and N=1 receive antennawas performed. A max-rate scheduler that selects up to M users based on Greedy User Selection (GUS) approach was used.
FIG. 6 shows the mean sum rate for the enhanced codebook for different values of α at SNR=20 dB.
FIG. 7 shows mean sum rate versus SNR for both the Release 8 codebook and the enhanced 4-Tx codebook with α=0.8. In other words, there is no feedback for α (Approach 2). The codebook enhancement outperforms Release 8 codebook. At 20 dB SNR, the improvement is about 42.8% or 1.43 b/s/Hz.
FIG. 8 shows three embodiments where α is quantized to a finite alphabet. In the first embodiment 7(a), α can take on values from the set {-0.8, 0, 0.8}. In the second embodiment 7(b), α can take on values from two 4-PSK consetallations with amplitudes 0.6 and 0.9. In addition to 0, there aretherefore 8 values that α can take. In the third embodiment 7(c), α can take on values from two 8-PSK constellations with amplitudes r1 and r2.
At least a partial representation of the first component matrix (V1) can be a first index (i1). At least a partial representation of the second component matrix (V2) can be a second index (i2). At least a partial representation of α can be a third index (i3). The first index (i1) and the second index (i2) may be a complete representation of the precoding matrix (U) when α is selected from a set comprising a pre-determined value (e.g., 0.8) and zero. The second index (i2) can be used to indicate the 0-valued state for α.
Alternatively, a single joint index (j1) can be used to represent V1 and V2. In one embodiment, the UE 110 is configured with a CSI process for generating CSI feedback. The CSI process is associated with the generation of one set of CSI which can include PMI, RI, and/or CQI, based on an associated one or more CSI-RS resource(s) (for which the UE assumes non-zero transmission power for the CSI-RS) and one or more interference measurement resource. The PMI may correspond to the first index (i1), the second index (i2), third index (i3) or the joint index (j1). The CSI-RS antenna ports corresponding to the CSI-RS resource(s) is associated to one or more antenna elements of an antenna array. The UE 110 may determine the RI, CQI, the first index (i1), the second index (i2) and third index (i3) based on the CSI-RS received on the CSI-RS antenna ports corresponding to the CSI-RS resource(s) associated with the CSI process. The PMI and thus the first index (i1), the second index (i2) and third index (i3) are conditioned on the most recent RI. The CQI is conditioned on the most recent PMI. The UE 110 may be configured with periodic CSI reporting. The UE may be configured with two reporting instances (first and second reporting instance) each with its own periodicities (first and second periodicity) for reporting on a set of CSI comprising CQI/PMI/RI. The first reporting instance may be in a first uplink subframe and the second reporting instance may be in a second uplink subframe. The first uplink subframe and the second uplink subframe can occur at different times. The first and second periodicities may be different.
In one example, the UE may be configured for wideband CQI/wideband PMI periodic reporting. In one mode of operation, the UE may transmit a first CSI report including RI and a first PMI, the first PMI being a representation of the first index (i1), on the first reporting instances with the first periodicity. The RI and the first PMI may be separately encoded (e.g. mapped to different set of bits in a message) or jointly encoded. In some cases, the first index (i3) may be sub-sampled (i.e., only certain specified values or a subset of the possible values are available to select from) to fit within the available number of bits for the first CSI report. The UE 110 may transmit a second CSI report including the wideband CQI and second PMI, the second PMI being a representation of the second index (i2), on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity. The wideband CQI and the second PMI may be separately or jointly encoded. Alternatively, the UE 110 may transmit a second CSI report including the wideband CQI and second PMI (the second PMI being a representation of the second index (i2)), and third PMI (the third PMI being a representation of the third index (i3)), on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity. The wideband CQI, second PMI and the third PMI may be separately or jointly encoded. In some cases, the first codebook index (i1) and/or the second codebook index (i2) may be sub-sampled (i.e., only certain specified values or a subset of the possible values are available to select from) to fit within the available number of bits for the second CSI report.
In another configured mode of operation, the UE may transmit a first CSI report including RI and a first PMI, the first PMI being a representation of the first index (i1) and the third index (i3), on the first reporting instances with the first periodicity. The RI and the first PMI may be separately encoded (e.g. mapped to different set of bits in a message) or jointly encoded. In some cases, the first index (i1) and/or the third index (i3) may be sub-sampled (i.e., only certain specified values or a subset of the possible values are available to select from) to fit within the available number of bits for the first CSI report. The UE 110 may transmit a second CSI report including the wideband CQI and second PMI, the second PMI being a representation of the second index (i2), on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity. The wideband CQI and the second PMI may be separately or jointly encoded. In some cases, the second index (i2) may be sub-sampled (i.e., only certain specified values or a subset of the possible values are available to select from) to fit within the available number of bits for the second CSI report.
In another mode of operation, the UE may transmit a first CSI report including RI on the first reporting instances with the first periodicity. The UE 110 may transmit a second CSI report including the wideband CQI and PMI, the PMI being a representation of the first index (i1), the second index (i2), and the third index (i3), on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity. The wideband CQI and the PMI may be separately or jointly encoded. In some cases, the first index (i1), the second index (i2), and/or the third index (i3) may be sub-sampled (i.e., only certain specified values or a subset of the possible values are available to select from) to fit within the available number of bits for the second CSI report. In one embodiment, the UE 110 may be signaled an operation mode from a set of modes (including one or more modes described above) by the eNB 120. The different modes can exploit different feedback rates described and tradeoff the subsampling impacts of the codebook index or indices and provide mechanisms to minimize the uplink overhead for CSI feedback.
In another example, the UE may be configured for suband CQI/PMI periodic reporting. In one mode of operation, the UE may determine a Precoder Type Indicator (PTI) and transmit a first CSI report including RI and the PTI on the first reporting instances with the first periodicity. The RI and the PTI may be separately or jointly encoded. The UE 110 uses the PTI to indicate the contents of the CSI reports on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity until the next RI+PTI report. If the most recent transmitted PTI is set to ‘0’ (first state) or ‘2’ (third state), the UE 110 transmits a second CSI report on a subset of the second reporting instances with a third periodicity (e.g., third periodicity=k*second periodicity, k being an integer). If the most recent transmitted PTI is set to ‘0’, the second CSI report includes a first PMI, the first PMI being a representation of the first index (i1).
If the most recent transmitted PTI is set to ‘2’, the second CSI report includes a second PMI, the second PMI being a representation of the third index (i3). Between every two consecutive first/second PMI reports on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity, the UE 110 transmits a third CSI report including a wideband CQI and a third PMI assuming transmission on a wideband channel bandwidth, the third PMI being a representation of the second index (i2). In case of CSI report collision due to the UE configured with multiple carriers (carrier aggregation) or multiple serving cells, the UE transmits a CSI report of only one serving cell with the CSI report including only the representation of the first index (i1) or representation of the third index (i3) have higher priority than other CSI reports including at least CQI which are dropped.
If the most recent transmitted PTI is set to ‘1’ (second state), the UE 110 transmits the second CSI report on a subset of the second reporting instances with a fourth periodicity (e.g., fourth periodicity=m*second periodicity, m being an integer), the second CSI report including the wideband CQI and the third PMI, the third PMI being a representation of the second index (i2) assuming transmission on a wideband channel bandwidth. The fourth periodicity can be different than the third periodicity. Between every two consecutive wideband CQI/wideband third PMI reports on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity, the UE 110 transmits a fourth CSI report including a subband CQI and a fourth PMI assuming transmission on a subband channel bandwidth, the fourth PMI being a representation of the second index (i2). Thus, with the use of PTI, in scenarios where first index (i1) and third index (i3) are not changing, subband feedback of the second index (i2) and associated CQI can be achieved which can improve UE throughput performance.
In an alternate example, if the most recent transmitted PTI is set to ‘0’ (first state) the UE 110 transmits a second CSI report on a subset of the second reporting instances with a third periodicity (e.g., third periodicity=k*second periodicity, k being an integer). The second CSI report includes a first PMI and a second PMI, the first PMI being a representation of the first index (i1), and the second PMI being a representation of the third index (i3). Between every two consecutive first and second PMI reports on the second reporting instances with the second periodicity, the UE 110 transmits a third CSI report including a wideband CQI and a third PMI assuming transmission on a wideband channel, the third PMI being a representation of the second index (i2). The UE 110 behavior if the most recent transmitted PTI is set to ‘1’ (second state), is the same as described in the previous mode of the operation above. In case of CSI report collision due to UE configured with multiple carriers (carrier aggregation) or multiple serving cells, the UE transmits a CSI report of only one serving cell with the CSI report including the representation of the first index (i1) and the representation of the third index (i3) have higher priority that other CSI reports including at least CQI which are dropped.
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the UE 110 (FIG. 1) according to an embodiment. At 910, the flowchart begins. At 920, the UE 110 receives a pilot signal such as a CSI-RS (described above) or Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS) from the eNB 120 (FIG. 1).
At 930, the UE 110 determines the precoding matrix as a linear combination of u:=(v1+αv2)/√{square root over (1+|α|2)} as noted above with respect to Equation 5 and the many example implementations following it. The UE 110 can also transmit a first CSI report including at least the representation of at least a portion of the precoding matrix (U) in an uplink subframe. At 940, the UE 110 transmits the representation of at least a portion of the precoding matrix (U) (e.g., as shown in FIG. 8 and the accompanying description) an uplink subframe over one of a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) and a Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH). The UE 110 can also transmit CSI, which can include one or more of V1, V2 and α. At 950, the flowchart ends.
