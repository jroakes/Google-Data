Detailed Description
The systems and methods of the present disclosure relate to a data processing system for synchronizing or matching voice call entries received from a content provider with log entries maintained or detected by the data processing system. The voice call entry received from the content provider may be inaccurate or otherwise corrupted. The data processing system may be configured to match the received voice call data to an internal log entry of the data processing system using one or more data processing techniques that parse inaccurate or corrupted data.
The content provider may receive a large number of telephone calls from potential customers. The content provider may benefit from a report identifying the content item that caused the phone call. However, it is challenging for a data processing system to accurately and reliably identify content items that result in a particular telephone call because the information that a content provider can provide about a telephone call is limited or incomplete. For example, the content provider may only have access to the call identifier (e.g., caller ID), call start time, and call duration of the device from which the telephone call originated. The data processing system may record information about the call individually, such as device identifier, time of call, duration of call. However, the call start time and duration detected by the data processing system are different from the call start time and duration recorded by the content provider due to different timing strategies, asynchronous timers, or due to time offsets caused by daylight savings time.
Thus, due to the limited number of signals and the variability of the recording or measurement of the signals, it is challenging for a data processing system to locate a particular telephone call from log data detected by the data processing system that corresponds to a voice call entry provided by the content provider alone.
The data processing system of the present solution may generate the report using voice call entries received from the content provider via the data file. The data processing system may generate or provide an interface via which the content provider may upload data files. In some cases, the data processing system may include a data feed interface or a streaming interface through which the content provider provides voice call entries. The voice call entry may include a device identifier (e.g., caller ID) of the device used to initiate the voice call, a voice call start time, a voice call duration, and optionally any other information as determined by the content provider. The data processing system may associate or match the uploaded incompletely reliable voice call entry data with the internally detected log entry. The data processing system addresses inaccuracies in the input, including deviations, of the call start time and call duration by creating one or more time windows (or time ranges) or duration windows (or duration ranges) that can be used to match the call with inaccurate time information. Where the data processing system identifies a plurality of voice call entries that match the log entry (or a plurality of log entries that match the voice call entry), the data processing system may initiate tie breaking to attribute or assign one of the voice call entries to the log entry (or assign one of the log entries to the voice call entry).
In some implementations, a data processing system provides call content items to potential customers for display via a device (e.g., a call computing device such as a mobile device). In some implementations, the call content item can be configured to provide a phone number to allow a potential customer to call the computing device. The data processing system may dynamically generate, specify, or assign a virtual phone number for calling the content item that directs the voice call to the data processing system. The potential customer may select or dial the telephone number indicated via the call content item. The data processing system may receive the voice call and bridge or forward the voice call to a provider device of the content provider (e.g., a call computing device supporting the agent). When a customer initiates a telephone call, the data processing system may identify the customer's caller ID and create an encrypted caller ID data format. The data processing system may store the encrypted caller ID data format in a log or other database maintained by the data processing system. In some implementations, the data processing system can use hashing techniques to facilitate encrypting the caller ID. The encrypted caller ID stored in the memory may correspond to a device identifier of the device. The data processing system may tag the caller ID with the origin of the query, such as a logged in search, an unregistered search, content, and so forth. Thereafter, the data processing system can receive voice call entry data uploaded by the content provider, including one or more of: caller ID, call start time with time zone information, call duration (e.g., in seconds), or phone number of the content provider device receiving and making the call. The system may then perform a lookup using the regenerated encrypted caller ID as a lookup key to match the internally stored encrypted caller ID with the call data uploaded by the advertiser.
In an illustrative example, a voice call entry may include data fields with the following values: start _ time: 2015-01-2000: 09: 00; time _ zone: us/los angeles; call _ duration: 30 seconds; device _ identifier: 1234. the data processing system may convert the call start time to a time zone independent timestamp (e.g., coordinated universal time "UTC" or greenwich mean time "GMT"). The data processing system may generate queries having respective ranges for the call time and the call duration. The data processing system may then use the query with the range to perform a lookup in a log entry data structure to identify a log entry that matches the voice call entry. In some cases, the data processing system may solve the daylight savings time problem by using logic to extend the call start time to include multiple timestamps. In some cases, the data processing system may identify a connection between multiple valid click identifiers and then use logic to break the connection.
In some implementations, the data processing system selects and provides the call content item for display with the web page. The call content item may include a supplemental content item (e.g., image, multimedia, video, text) in the form of a link included in or next to the search results (e.g., primary content) by the search engine (e.g., via a content selector). In some cases, the call content item may include a supplemental content item (e.g., an article or multimedia stream) in the form of a link in or next to the primary content provided by the content publisher. The content item may comprise a link or button to a telephone number. The data processing system may select, assign, generate, provide, or otherwise designate a telephone number to facilitate providing the tracking data to the content provider. The number may be a virtual phone number dynamically assigned, provided, assigned, or generated for the content item in response to interaction with the content item. The user may interact with the content item by selecting or clicking a call button that calls the content item to receive the virtual phone number. The user may then dial the provided number. The data processing system then receives the call and identifies a tracking value associated with the call and the content item. For example, the data processing system may bind, link, or otherwise associate the virtual phone number with an impression of the content item. The data processing system may then access an impression log for the content item, which may include keywords for the content item, websites displaying the content item, time of day, content networks, or search queries matching the content item.
In another exemplary embodiment, a data processing system receives a search query input into a search engine. In response to the search query, the data processing system provides search results and further selects and provides supplemental content items matching the search query for display with the search results. The supplemental content item may display a virtual phone number that a user interested in the supplemental content may call. The supplemental content item may display the virtual phone number in response to receiving an indication of interest in the supplemental content item (e.g., clicking on or selecting the supplemental content item or otherwise interacting with the supplemental content item). The user may call a party associated with the supplemental content item using a number provided via the supplemental content item.
The data processing system can be configured to use the virtual phone number. A virtual phone number may refer to a phone number that has no directly associated physical phone line. The virtual phone number may refer to a phone number that is not static, as the phone number may not be directly associated with the device. These virtual phone numbers can be programmed to forward incoming calls to one of the preset phone numbers selected by the content provider; which is fixed, mobile or VoIP. The virtual phone number can work like a gateway between a traditional call (PSTN) and VoIP. Subscribers to the virtual phone number can use their existing numbers without purchasing additional hardware. The virtual phone number can be set to forward calls to different phone numbers depending on the time of day and day of the week.
The data processing system can be further configured to utilize the content item to use the virtual phone number to track calls made to the content provider. For example, with a call extension content item or a call only content item, a virtual phone number (or content forward number) can facilitate receiving and tracking phone calls generated from the content item. To this end, the data processing system can assign, select, or otherwise provide a virtual phone number to be displayed with the content item of the content provider. When a potential customer calls the virtual phone number, the data processing system receives the call and routes the call to the corresponding content provider. The content provider may then obtain information about the call generated by the content item. In some cases, the data processing system may maintain the anonymity of the customer by providing the transit number as the caller identification number instead of the customer's number.
In some implementations, when the data processing system assigns a virtual phone number to a content item, the data processing system can record information about the content item or content item information. When the data processing system receives a call, the data processing system may look up the recorded information from the virtual number record and record information about the content item along with the call information. Thus, in some implementations, the data processing system may indirectly rely on the virtual number to link the phone call to the originating content item without using the virtual number to look up the log.
FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for synchronizing data via a network. The system 100 can provide a content selection infrastructure. The system 100 can include a data processing system 120 in communication with one or more of the content provider 125, the content publisher 115, or the computing device 110 via the network 105. The network 105 can include: computer networks such as the internet, local area networks, wide area networks, metropolitan area networks, or other area networks, intranets, satellite networks, and other communication networks such as voice or data mobile telephone networks. The network 105 can be used to access information resources, such as web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource identifiers, which can be displayed on at least one computing device 110, such as a laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, personal digital assistant, smart phone, or portable computer. For example, via the network 105, a user of the computing device 110 can access a web page provided by at least one web site operator or content publisher 115. In this example, a web browser of the computing device 110 can access a web server of the web site operator or content publisher 115 to retrieve web pages for display on a monitor of the computing device 110. The web site operator or content publisher 115 generally includes an entity that operates a web page. In one embodiment, the web site operator or content publisher 115 includes at least one web page server that communicates with the network 105 to make web pages available to the computing device 110.
The network 105 may be any type or form of network and may include any of the following: point-to-point networks, broadcast networks, wide area networks, local area networks, telecommunications networks, data communication networks, computer networks, ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks, SONET (synchronous optical network) networks, SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) networks, wireless networks and wired networks. The network 105 may include a wireless link, such as an infrared channel or satellite band. The topology of the network 105 may include a bus network topology, a star network topology, or a ring network topology. The network may include a mobile telephone network using any protocol or protocols for communicating between mobile devices, including advanced mobile phone protocol ("AMPS"), time division multiple access ("TDMA"), code division multiple access ("CDMA"), global system for mobile communications ("GSM"), general packet radio service ("GPRS"), or universal mobile telecommunications system ("UMTS"). Different types of data may be communicated via different protocols, or the same type of data may be communicated via different protocols.
The system 100 can include at least one data processing system 120. The data processing system 120 can include at least one logic device, such as a computing device having a processor in communication via the network 105, for example, in communication with the computing device 110, the web site operator or content publisher computing device 115 (or content publisher 115), and at least one content provider computing device 125 (or provider device 125 or content provider 125). The data processing system 120 can include at least one server. For example, the data processing system 120 can include a plurality of servers located in at least one data center. The data processing system 120 can include multiple, logically grouped servers and facilitate distributed computing techniques. The logical group of servers may be referred to as a server farm or a machine farm. Servers can also be geographically dispersed. The machine farm can be managed as a single entity, or the machine farm can include multiple machine farms. The servers within each machine farm can be heterogeneous — one or more of the servers or machines can operate according to one or more types of operating system platforms.
The servers in the machine farm can be stored in a high density rack system along with associated storage systems and located in an enterprise data center. For example, integrating servers in this manner may improve system manageability, data security, physical security of the system, and system performance by locating the servers and high-performance storage systems in a localized high-performance network. Centralizing the servers and storage systems and coupling them with advanced system management tools allows for more efficient use of server resources.
The data processing system 120 can include a content placement system having at least one server. The data processing system 120 can include at least one content selector 130, at least one virtual number engine 135, at least one tracker 140, at least one provider interface 145, at least one matching engine 150, and at least one data repository 155. The content selector 130, virtual number engine 135, tracker 140, provider interface 145, and matching engine 150 can include at least one processing unit or other logic device, such as a programmable logic array engine, or module configured to communicate with a database repository or database 155. Content selector 130, virtual number engine 135, tracker 140, provider interface 145, matching engine 150, and data repository 155 can be separate components, a single component, or part of data processing system 120. System 100, such as a data processing system, and its components may include hardware elements, such as one or more processors, logic devices, or circuits.
The data processing system 120 is able to obtain anonymous computer network activity information associated with a plurality of computing devices 110. The user of the computing device 110 can positively authorize the data processing system 120 to obtain network activity information corresponding to the user's computing device 110. For example, the data processing system 120 can prompt a user of the computing device 110 to agree to obtain one or more types of network activity information. The identity of the user of the computing device 110 can remain anonymous and the computing device 110 can be associated with a unique identifier (e.g., a unique identifier of the user or computing device provided by the data processing system or user of the computing device). The data processing system can associate each observation with a corresponding unique identifier.
For the context in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about a user or may utilize personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features may collect personal information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social behavior or activity, the user's preferences, or the user's current location), or whether or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. Further, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, such that certain information about the user is removed when generating the parameters (e.g., geographic parameters). For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that no identifying information of the user can be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized where geographic information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state hierarchy) such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how the user collects information and how the content server uses the information.
The data processing system 120 can receive a request for content. The request may include a query, such as a search query entered into a search engine 130 of the data processing system. The entered query may include text, characters, or symbols. The data processing system 120 may receive the input query from the computing device 110 via the network 105. The input query may include audio, such as terms spoken by a user of the computing device 110 and input into a search engine of the data processing system via the network 105 and interface. The request may include or be associated with information that facilitates selection of content in response to the request. The information may include, for example, contextual (contextual) information about the electronic document, web page, electronic application, or link on which the selected content is to be displayed. The data processing system 120 may provide an interface that displays an input text box, button, drop down menu, or another plug-in through which a user of the client can select or otherwise indicate a category of search.
In response to a search query or other request for content (e.g., a supplemental content item), the data processing system 120 (e.g., via the content selector 130) can identify, select, or otherwise obtain content to be provided or presented via the requesting computing device 110 or some other computing device 110 associated with the request for content. In some implementations, the data processing system 120 may not identify, select, or otherwise obtain content in response to receiving any requests. The content may include, for example, text, characters, symbols, images, video, audio, or multimedia content. The content may include a phone number, a virtual phone number, or a call extension. The content items may include supplemental content items in the form of links provided by the content provider and included by the data processing system (e.g., via a content selector) for display with the search results page. The content item may include a link or button to a telephone number that facilitates providing the reporting data to the content provider. Where the content item includes a virtual phone number or a call extension, the content item may be referred to as a call content item. The request for content can include a request for, for example, an online article, a promotion, a coupon, or a product description. The data processing system 120 can receive requests from computing devices, such as computing device 110. For example, the data processing system 120 can receive the request via an application executing on the computing device 110, such as a mobile application executing on a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone or tablet computer). In some cases, the data processing system 120 may not receive a separate request for content and, instead, select and provide content (e.g., supplemental content items) in response to a search query or with search results. In some instances, the web page may request content from the data processing system 120 in response to a user of the mobile device 110 accessing the web page (e.g., via the mobile device 110).
The request for content can include information that facilitates selection of the content. For example, the data processing system 120 may request information from the computing device 110 in order to identify content or content selections. The data processing system 120 may request or obtain information in response to receiving a request for content from the computing device 110. The information may include information about the content being displayed on the computing device 110 (e.g., content bit size or location) or about available resources of the computing device 110 to display or otherwise manipulate the content.
The data processing system 120 may identify a plurality of content items (e.g., a first candidate content item and a second candidate content item) that are responsive to a request for content or are additional candidate items for display on an online document (e.g., a web page). The data processing system may initiate or utilize an online process to select one or more of the plurality of content items for display on the online document.
The data processing system 120 may include a content selector 130. The content selector 130 may analyze, parse, or otherwise process the subject matter of the candidate content item to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate content item corresponds to a web page. The content selector 130 may use image processing techniques, character recognition techniques, or database lookups to identify, parse, or identify terms, characters, text, symbols, or images of candidate content items. The candidate content item may include metadata indicating the subject matter of the candidate content item, in which case the content selector 130 may process the metadata to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate content item corresponds to a web page or search query.
The content provider may provide additional indicators when setting up a content campaign that includes content items. The content provider may provide information at the content campaign or content cohort level that the content selector 130 may identify by performing a lookup using the information about the candidate content items. For example, the candidate content items may include unique identifiers that may map to content groups, content campaigns, or content providers. The content selector 130 may determine based on information stored in the data repository 155 about the content offering.
The data processing system 120 may use various techniques to select content. For example, the data processing system 120 may select content from recommendations or directions from the partner content selection network. In some implementations, content may not be selected using keywords or matching techniques, but rather based on recommendations or directions.
The data processing system 120 may include a virtual number engine 135. The virtual number engine 135 can be designed and constructed to identify a unique virtual phone number (e.g., a unique transit number). The virtual number engine 135 may provide the unique virtual phone number for display with the selected content item displayed with the web page on the client computing device 110. The virtual number may be unique in that it uniquely corresponds to the device or call agent of the content provider. The virtual number may be unique in that it uniquely maps to the device of the content provider or the call agent. The virtual number engine 135 can provide a link to a unique virtual phone number that, when selected by a user of the computing device 110, causes the computing device 110 to initiate a communication channel with the data processing system 120. For example, selecting a link provided by the virtual number engine 135 via the computing device 110 can initiate a telephone call to the data processing system 120.
In some implementations, in response to receiving an indication of interest in the content item, the data processing system 120 can provide a virtual phone number for display with the content item on the web page. For example, the data processing system 120 can display the content item on a web page in a button, drop down menu, icon, flip icon, or other user interface widget (widget). When a user interacts with a user interface widget (e.g., clicks or selects a button), the data processing system can receive an indication of the user's selection.
In response to receiving the indication of the user selection, the data processing system 120 can identify, select, generate, or otherwise assign a virtual phone number to the content item. The data processing system 120 may access a pool or repository of available virtual phone numbers. The virtual phone number may have been assigned to a content provider associated with the content item. The virtual phone number may be assigned to a content campaign or group of content that includes the content item. The virtual phone number may be a toll-free "800" number, a toll-charged number such as a "900" number, a local number, or a long distance number.
The data processing system may determine that the virtual phone number is an available virtual phone number if the virtual phone number is not currently assigned to another content item or content provider. For example, due to the limited number of virtual phone numbers and the costs associated with purchasing phone numbers, the virtual number engine 135 may be configured with one or more policies that facilitate reusing or reclaiming virtual phone numbers. The virtual number engine 135 may reuse a virtual number if the number is not provided for display for a certain time interval or duration (e.g., 2 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.). The data processing system may use the same virtual number for different provider devices. The data processing system may determine which provider device to forward the call to based on the caller ID and the virtual phone number of the caller. For example, the data processing system may form a tuple based on the caller ID (or device identifier) and the virtual phone number. The tuple can map to a unique static identifier of a provider device of the content provider. The data processing system may maintain the tuple as a unique tuple. Thus, the data processing system may reuse the virtual phone number with a second device identifier of a second device different from the first device and generate a second unique tuple based on the second identifier and the virtual phone number of the second provider device mapped to the second content provider. By preserving tuple mapping, the data processing system can reuse virtual phone numbers, thereby reducing the number of virtual phone numbers maintained by the data processing system.
The content item may be provided to the virtual phone number via a user interface. An example of a user interface provided by a data processing system is shown in FIG. 2. A user may initiate a telephone call corresponding to a virtual telephone number provided or otherwise communicated via the user interface.
The data processing system 120 may include a tracker 140. The tracker 140 may be designed and constructed to receive, obtain, determine, or otherwise identify tracking data, such as content item impression data or log entry data, and store the data in one or more databases or data repositories 155 of data structures, such as a content item impression data structure 160 or a log entry data structure 165. The tracking data may include information associated with the content item, a selection of the content item, or an impression of the content item. For example, the tracking data may include content selection criteria that are used to select content items for display with or on a web page. The content selection criteria may include keywords, terms, phrases, geographic locations, device types, and the like. The tracker 140 may obtain tracking data from or via the content selector 130, the content provider 125, or the user's computing device 110. In some cases, the content selector 130 may store the tracking data in an impression log or data structure, and the tracker 140 may obtain the tracking data from the impression data structure.
The tracker 140 may detect, identify, determine, or otherwise obtain log entry data. The log entry data may include voice call information associated with the content item impression. The voice call information may include, for example, a start time of the voice call, a device identifier of the device initiating the voice call (e.g., a caller ID of the computing device 110 calling a virtual phone number provided by the call content item), and a voice call duration. The data processing system 120 can detect a start time of a voice call in response to receiving the call. The data processing system 120 may include a counter, timer, clock, or other timing device configured to generate a timestamp in response to receiving the call. In some cases, the data processing system 120 generates timestamps in time zones. The data processing system 120 can generate a timestamp in a default time zone such as UTC or GMT. The data processing system 120 may generate the time stamp in a predetermined format, including for example, a date and time and including a number of seconds, as follows: < YYYY-MM-DD > < HH: MM: SS >, wherein YYYY corresponds to a four digit year; MM corresponds to the month of the two-digit number; HH corresponds to a two-digit 24-hour format of hours; MM corresponds to two-digit minutes and SS corresponds to two-digit seconds. For example, the time stamp may be: 2015-01-2000:09:00. In some cases, the data processing system 120 can generate a timestamp in a time zone corresponding to the location of the computing device 110, or the location of the content provider 125 that provided the content item that caused the phone call. For example, the data processing system 120 can determine the location information established by the content provider 125 from the content account of the content item. In some cases, the content item may include location information (e.g., an address of a restaurant).
The data processing system 120 can determine the duration of the voice call. The data processing system 120 can monitor the call after bridging the call between the computing device and the provider device of the content provider. The data processing system 120 can monitor the call to detect termination of the call in response to one or more parties dropping the call, ending the call, disconnecting the call, or otherwise exiting the voice call. The data processing system 120 may determine a second timestamp corresponding to the call termination via a timer/counter/clock of the data processing system 120. The data processing system 120 can determine the call duration by determining the difference between the termination timestamp and the start timestamp. In some cases, the data processing system 120 may start or start a stop watch or counter in response to initiating a call and stop the counter or stop watch in response to termination of the call. The data processing system 120 may then determine the call duration based on the value of the counter. The format of the duration may be, for example, HH MM SS.
For example, the log entry data structure 165 stored in the data repository may include the following information shown in Table 1. The log entry data structure 165 may include a tabular format or other data format for storing, maintaining, organizing, or otherwise manipulating log entries for voice calls received by the data processing system 120.
Device identifier | Starting time | Duration of time | Virtual telephone number |
1234ABC | 2015-01-20 00:09:00 | 00:15:34 | 800-555-4567 |
1235DEF | 2015-01-20 00:15:00 | 00:12:10 | 800-555-7890 |
1235GHI | 2015-01-20 00:18:00 | 00:25:45 | 800-555-7890 |
1234ABC | 2015-01-21 00:7:00 | 00:07:34 | 800-555-4567 |
Table 1: illustrative examples of Log entry data structures
The tracker 140 may be configured to obtain and store log entries in response to receiving a selection of a content item from the user's computing device 110 or a phone call from the computing device 110. The tracker 140 may be configured to obtain and store content item impression records in response to providing the content item, receiving a selection of the content item from the user's computing device 110, or receiving a phone call from the computing device 110. The selection includes a click on the content item. In some cases, a selection may refer to a selection of a phone number link (e.g., link 220). For example, the tracker 140 may not store log entry data in response to a selection of the link 230, but the tracker 140 may store log entry data in response to receiving a selection of the phone number link 220 (or a request for a phone number) or a phone call. The data processing system 120 may be configured to distinguish between a selection of a URL 330 and a selection or request for a telephone number via the telephone number link 220.
The content item impression data structure 160 can be stored in the data repository 155. The content item impression data structure 160 can include a table format or other data format for storing, maintaining, organizing, or manipulating impression records. An impression record may refer to an instance of a content item or a supplemental content item displayed on a web page. The impression may include information related to the web page on which the content item is displayed (e.g., a uniform resource locator of the web page, a location/position of the content location, keywords of the web page), a search query entered into a search engine by a user that results in the content item being selected, keywords of the content item and/or keywords of the web page or search query that results in the content item being selected for display (e.g., via a broad match, a phrase match, or an exact match, or other measure of relevance or similarity), a timestamp associated with the impression, a geographic location of the computing device 110 on which the content item is displayed, or a type of device.
The data processing system 120 may store the content item impression record in the content item impression data structure in a temporary manner and remove or delete the impression record after some duration (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.). The data processing system 120 may remove impression records in response to an event, condition, or trigger. For example, the data processing system 120 may delete the impression record in response to a request to delete impression history information, or after a certain interval or duration of time after the call associated with the impression is terminated.
The data processing system 120 (e.g., via the tracker 140) can generate a link between the tracking data stored in the impression data structure and the virtual phone number stored in the database. The link may include a pointer or other association mechanism between the tracking data and the virtual phone number. In some cases, the tracker 140 may update the impression record in the impression data structure with the mapped virtual phone number. In some cases, generating the link may refer to the data processing system 120 generating a second data structure or data record or entry that includes the tracking data and the virtual phone number. For example, the tracker 140 may create a tracking link data structure that provides entries with tracking data associated with corresponding virtual phone numbers. The data structure may further include information related to the impression record or the computing device 110.
The content item impression data structure 165 may include the following fields shown in table 2:
table 2: illustrative examples of content item impression data structures
One or more values, fields, or entries of the log entry data structure may be stored using an anonymous hashing technique or an encryption technique. In some implementations, the data processing system 120 can remove the link between the trace data and the virtual phone number based on the condition. The conditions may include: for example, a request for a virtual phone number is received but a call to the number is not received for the duration of time (2 hours, 4 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, a week, etc.) for which the number is provided; a certain number of calls (e.g., 2 calls, 3 calls, 5 calls, etc.) to the number are received.
The data processing system 120 (e.g., via the tracker 140 or the virtual number engine 135) can provide the first virtual phone number via a web page. The computing device 110 may include calling capabilities and be able to initiate a call (or other telecommunications channel) to a virtual phone number by dialing the number or selecting an interactive link to the number that initiates the call process of the device 110. In some implementations, the user can initiate a call to the virtual phone number from a device other than the device 110 on which the web page and phone number are displayed. For example, a user may view a web page with supplemental content items and a phone number from a desktop computer, laptop computer, or tablet computer, and then call the number from a landline phone or cellular phone. Since the data processing system 120 can assign a virtual phone number to the selection of the content item and link the virtual phone number with the tracking data of the content item, the user can call the virtual phone number from a different device and the data processing system 120 can still access the corresponding tracking data.
The data processing system 120 (e.g., via the virtual number engine 135 or tracker 140) can receive a call from a client device to initiate a first communication channel via a first virtual phone number. For example, the client device may dial a first virtual phone number to initiate a telecommunications channel, and the data processing system 120 may receive an indication of initiation of telecommunications (e.g., ringing). The data processing system 120 may perform one or more functions upon receiving a call (or an indication thereof).
In response to receiving the call, the data processing system 120 can perform a lookup in the database using the first virtual phone number to identify a second number corresponding to the content provider and to identify content item impression data. For example, a first virtual phone number may be used to call the data processing system 120 and further used to access the linked content item impression data and identify a second number of the provider device. The second number may be used to call the content provider (or its customer service representative or proxy device). In some cases, the content provider may provide the second number when setting up the content campaign, and the second number may be stored in a database of the data processing system 120.
Upon identifying the second number, the data processing system 120 can use the second number to establish a second communication channel between the client device and the content provider device. The data processing system 120 can dial the second number and the content provider can receive the call. The content provider (or customer service representative) may answer the call. The data processing system 120 can fuse or bridge the first call with the second call to create a second communication channel connecting the user with a customer service representative of the content provider. In some cases, the data processing system 120 includes a bridging module configured to bridge the call. The bridging module can include hardware or software configured to bridge the call. The bridge module may be configured with packet routing or relay technology to facilitate communication between the computing device originating the call and the provider device receiving the call.
The data processing system 120 includes a provider interface 145 designed and constructed to receive voice call entries from the content provider 125. The voice call entry may be in the form of a voice call entry data structure. Provider interface 145 may provide a graphical user interface that includes an input text box, button, file browser, or other input mechanism to allow a content provider to upload, feed, or transmit data files that include voice call entry information. In some cases, provider interface 145 may include an application programming interface configured to receive data feeds or stream data, in real time or in response to content provider 125 recording or detecting or otherwise making data available to data processing system 120. In some cases, the provider interface 145 may be configured to upload voice call entries periodically, upload voice call entries in batches, or feed voice call entries in real-time. Provider interface 145 may be configured to use one or more network protocols, such as a secure communication protocol (e.g., an encrypted communication channel that may require authentication credentials).
The content provider 125 may generate, record, store, or maintain the voice call entry in a format. In some cases, content provider 125 records one or more values for one or more fields in the same format as data processing system 120 used for the corresponding fields. In some cases, the format used by the content provider 125 may be different from the format used by the data processing system 120. In this case, the data processing system 120 can convert the format of the fields provided by the content provider 125 into a format consistent with the log entry data maintained by the data processing system 120. For example, the start time in the voice call entry may be in a different time zone than the time zone of the log entry in the data processing system. The provider interface 145 can determine the time zone of the start time in the voice call entry and convert the time zone to the same time zone for the log entry. For example, a voice call entry may include a field for time zone information. The time zone information may indicate a geographic location or time zone using a time zone identifier such as pacific standard time ("PST") or pacific daylight savings time ("PDT"). The data processing system can access a time zone conversion data structure to determine a time offset for converting the start time in the voice call entry to the same time zone used in the log entry.
The format of the device identifier may be predetermined by the data processing system 120 or specified by the data processing system 120. The format of the device identifier may be an e.164 format (e.g., +15555551234) with a preceding "+" sign. The data processing system 120 may allow one or more formats of device identifiers, such as: "5555551234", "(555) 555 minus 1234". The data processing system may use a library of phone numbers to resolve the device identifier. If the data processing system 120 is unable to resolve the number, the data processing system 120 may report an error to the content provider via the provider interface 145. The data processing system 120 can exclude the erroneous voice call entry from further processing.
The start time format may include one or more of the following, for example:
(1) complete date plus hour and minute:
YYYY-MM-DDThh: mmTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
(2) Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
YYYY-MM-DDThh: MM. sTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
(3) Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and fractions of seconds
YYYY-MM-DDThh: MM: ss.sTZD (e.g. 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)
Wherein:
YYYY-four digit years
Month of two digits (01 ═ january, etc.)
Two digit date (01 to 31)
hh two-digit hours (00 to 23) (am/pm not allowed)
Two-digit minutes (00 to 59)
ss two-digit seconds (00 to 59)
s-one or more numbers representing the fractional part of a second
TZD ═ time zone indicator (Z or + hh: mm or-hh: mm)
Time may be represented by UTC (coordinated universal time), with a UTC indicator ("Z"). Time may be expressed in terms of local time and time zone offsets of hours and minutes. A time zone offset of "+ hh: mm" indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone that is "hh" hours and "mm" minutes ahead of UTC. Mm indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone that is "hh" hours and "mm" minutes later than UTC.
The voice call entry may include one or more of the following fields: a device identifier of a device originating the voice call; 2) a call start time with time zone information; 3) a duration of the call; 4) converting tags (e.g., purchases, subscriptions, or surveys); 5) switching time; 6) conversion values (e.g., prices or other items associated with the conversion); or 7) converting currency (e.g., U.S. dollars). In some cases, the voice call entry data structure may include three fields: device identifier, start time and duration as shown in table 3. Table 3 shows a voice call entry data structure provided by provider _ a shown in table 2.
Device identifier | Starting time | Duration of time | Time zone |
1234ABC | 2015-01-20 00:08:57 | 00:14:34 | Los Angeles,California |
1235DEF | 2015-01-20 00:15:30 | 00:13:10 | Los Angeles,California |
Table 3: an illustrative example of a voice call entry data structure provided by a content provider.
In some cases, the voice call entry data structure may include additional fields, such as a fourth field indicating a conversion tag or a fifth field indicating a conversion amount or value, as shown in table 4 below:
table 4: illustrative examples of voice call entry data structures with additional fields
For example, a potential customer may enter a search query "best cheap television". The data processing system 120 may return the search results and also select a supplemental content Item, such as a supplemental content Item having a content Item ID "Item _1," and store this information in a content Item impression data structure, such as the data structure shown in Table 2. The data processing system 120 may provide the virtual phone number 800-555-4567 for the content item. The potential customer may call the virtual phone number and the data processing system 120 may bridge the call to a provider device of the content provider 125 (e.g., an online electronic retail store). The data processing system 120 may detect parameters or values associated with the voice call, such as a device identifier and a start time of the client device originating the call, and store this information in a log entry, such as the data structure shown in table 1.
The data processing system 120 may include a matching engine 150, the matching engine 150 being designed and constructed to match, associate, filter, or otherwise identify log entries stored in the log entry data structure 165 that correspond to voice call entries provided by the content provider 125. The matching engine 150 can determine that a difference exists between one or more values of one or more fields in a log entry of the data processing system and one or more values of one or more fields in a voice call entry provided by a content provider. To account for these differences, the matching engine 150 may generate ranges based on thresholds. For example, matching engine 150 may identify one or more log entries corresponding to one or more voice call entries by matching a device identifier included in the voice call entry with a device identifier indicated in the log entry. As shown in tables 1 and 2, device identifiers 1234ABC correspond to two entries in each data structure; the device identifiers 1235DEF and 1235GHI each correspond to an entry in each data structure.
Thereafter, the data processing system 120 can use additional fields associated with the voice call entry and the log entry to identify the particular voice call. For example, the matching engine 150 may determine that the start time stored in the log entry for the device identifier is within a predetermined threshold of the start time stored in the log entry for the device identifier. The matching engine 150 may retrieve the predetermined threshold from the data repository 155. The predetermined threshold may be, for example, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or another threshold that facilitates accurate matching of log entries to voice call entries. In some cases, the data processing system 120 may determine that the duration stored in the voice call entry for the device identifier is within a predetermined threshold of the duration stored in the log entry for the device identifier. The matching engine 150 may retrieve a predetermined threshold for the duration of the threshold that is the same as or different from the threshold for the start time. For example, the predetermined duration threshold may be, for example, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or another threshold that facilitates accurately matching log entries to voice call entries.
The data processing system 120 can use the predetermined threshold to generate a query for the voice call entry. For example, the data processing system 120 may generate a match query for the first voice call entry in Table 3, including the device identifier 1234ABC and the start time 2015-01-2000:08:57, as follows: all log entries that include the device identifier 1234ABC and have a start time of 2015-01-2000:08:57 of plus or minus 30 seconds are queried. The data processing system may identify the first log entry stored in the log entry data structure of table 1 as satisfying the matching query because it has the same device identifier and the start time 2015-01-2000: 09:00 is within 30 seconds of the start time of the corresponding voice call entry.
In some cases, the data processing system 120 may generate a match query that determines a match based on the start time and the duration, as follows: the query includes all log entries that include the device identifier 1234ABC and have a start time of 2015-01-2000:08:57 plus or minus 30 seconds and a duration of 00:14:34 plus or minus 5 minutes. The data processing system may identify the first log entry stored in the log entry data structure in table 1 as satisfying the matching query because it has the same device identifier, start time 2015-01-2000: 09:00 within 30 seconds of the start time of the corresponding voice call entry, and duration 00:15:34 within 5 minutes of the duration of the corresponding voice call entry.
Once the data processing system 120 identifies a matching log entry, the data processing system 120 can retrieve the virtual phone number of the log entry (e.g., 800-. For example, the first entry shown in table 2 is the content item impression record for virtual phone number 800-. The data processing system may update the content item impression record using additional information provided by the content provider. For example, the data processing system 120 may update the content item impression record to include a conversion tag or conversion value (or any other field or value) provided by the content provider via the voice call entry data structure. In some cases, the matching engine 150 may generate different data structures, such as a report data structure, that may be used to generate reports for content providers.
The data processing system may generate the report using information provided by the content provider via the voice call entry and content item impression information maintained by the data processing system 120. The report may bind, link, or otherwise associate two or more advertisement impressions, clicks, selections, phone calls, or conversions. The data processing system may perform the association using a voice call entry received from the content provider via the data file. The report may include a dynamic or interactive report provided by the provider interface 145 of the data processing system 120. The report may include a chart, a graph, a pie chart, a bar chart, a histogram, a table, a spreadsheet, a contextual report, or an image. The report may contain performance information such as click-through rate, conversion rate, cost-per-click, or return on investment. For example, a content provider may bid $ 0.2 to win a content Item auction that results in content Item _1 being provided to device identifier 1234 ABC. The data processing system 120 may determine that a bid of 0.2 results in a conversion of $ 800. The data processing system 120 may further identify all such bids and costs associated with the content Item _1 (or content campaign Camp _ a) and aggregate these values to generate a return on investment for calling the content campaign. For example, the data processing system 120 may identify all voice call entries for content providers that match log entries and filter the matching entries based on content item IDs or campaign IDs to generate reports for particular content items or campaigns. In some cases, the report may be for a content account or a group of content.
The data processing system 120 (e.g., via the matching engine 150) can adjust or fine tune the threshold for generating queries having ranges. For example, if the data processing system does not identify any matching queries or identifies less than 3 matching queries, the data processing system 120 may increase the threshold or range. If the data processing system 120 receives too many matching queries (e.g., more than 2, more than 3, more than 4, or more than 5), the data processing system 120 may lower the threshold or range. In some cases, the data processing system 120 may be specific to the content provider and adjust the threshold based on the historical matching performance of the content provider. For example, content provider a may provide start time data that is typically within 10 seconds of the start time of the log entry, while provider B may provide start time data with a large variance, such as 2 minute increments. Thus, data processing system 120 may use a larger threshold for provider B than provider a. The data processing system may store the predetermined threshold in the data repository 155. The data processing system may continue to evaluate the history matching performance to fine tune or adjust the threshold. The data processing system may update the predetermined threshold value stored in the data repository 155. For example, the data repository 155 may include a threshold data structure.
In some cases, matching engine 150 may identify multiple log entries that match a single voice call entry. The data processing system 120 can identify multiple log entries that match a single voice call entry because the multiple log entries can have start times that fall within a predetermined threshold or range of start times of the voice call entries. In response to identifying multiple matching entries, the matching engine 150 may initiate a tie-breaking mechanism to select the matching log entry that is closest in start time to the voice call entry. For example, the matching engine 150 may determine a first time difference between the start time of the first matching log entry and the start time of the voice call entry. The matching engine 150 may determine a second time difference between the start time of the second matching log entry and the start time of the voice call entry. The matching engine 150 may determine the absolute value of the first time difference and the second time difference. The matching engine 150 may determine the minimum of the absolute value of the first time difference and the absolute value of the second time difference. The data processing system 120 can select the log entry corresponding to the smallest time difference as the matching log entry and use the log entry to identify or retrieve the content item impression data and generate a report.
In some cases, the matching may be based on a content item impression time of the content item as stored in the content item impression data structure. For example, the data processing system 120 may not identify the virtual phone number and use the start time or other information stored in the content item impression record, such as the content provider ID, to directly associate the voice call entry with the content item impression record.
For example, the matching engine 150 may consider daylight savings time changes in the united states. In the united states, two replicates per hour are used during the change in summer time in fall. If the content provider uploads a transition with a call start time without marking that time with daylight savings time information, the data processing system may generate a query with a threshold that may cover two possible start times. For example, the threshold for this query may be increased by hours from the otherwise threshold. Thus, even if the content provider does not mark the start time with daylight savings time information, the matching engine 150 can automatically consider transitions that occur during daylight savings time changes.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a user interface 200 that facilitates providing call context via a computer network, according to an embodiment. The user interface 200 may include a page displayed by an application executing on a computing device, such as a web page rendered by a web browser. The web page may be an interface to a search engine 205 and include a search query input box 210. In response to search query 210, search engine 205 provides search results 225. The data processing system (e.g., via the content selector) can further provide a content item 215, such as a supplemental content item. The content item 215 may include a link included in the search results by the search engine (or content selector). The content item 215 may include a link and button for a click on the phone number 220 and a web address pointing to a target web page or landing web page. The user may click on the telephone link 220, which may facilitate providing the log entry data and the content item impression data, and the data processing system may provide the virtual telephone number 230 in response to receiving the selection. The virtual phone number 230 may be a pop-up window, replacing the link 220, displayed adjacent to the content item, and sent to the user via a notification, an alert, an SMS text message, or an email.
Still referring to fig. 2, according to some embodiments, the example user interface 200 provides a virtual number 220 to the content item 215. The user interface includes a search engine user interface 205 or a search engine results page 205. The search engine 205 includes an input text box 210 in which the user enters a search query, such as "taxi". Search engine 205 may provide search results 225 (e.g., search result 1, etc.). In response to the search query, the data processing system (e.g., via the content selector 130) may select content items and provide them for display alongside the search results in response to the search query 210. The data processing system may establish, generate, or otherwise identify a unique content impression identifier for a content item impression. Content item impression may refer to the presentation of a content item via a computing device. Content item impression may refer to displaying a content item, playing a content item, transmitting a content item to a computing device, or selecting a content item to provide to a computing device. In some cases, the data processing system may generate the content impression identifier in response to an interaction with the content item, such as in response to a click or selection of the content item. The content item impression identifier may include or be based on one or more parameters or fields, such as a process identifier or an IP address identifier associated with the content item or content item impression. In this example, the supplemental content item 215 may relate to a taxi service provider. The supplemental content item may include a web link 235 to a taxi provider's website. The supplemental content item 215 may also include a link 220 to access the virtual number. The user may select link 220. In response to receiving a selection of the link, the data processing system (e.g., via the virtual number engine 230) may display the virtual phone number 230. The virtual phone number 230 may be implemented via a pop-up window, by replacing the text 220, by directing the user to another web site. In some cases, selecting link 220 may cause the user's device to call a virtual phone number. For example, the data processing system 120 may receive the selection, provide the virtual phone number to the user's device, and instruct the user's device to call the virtual phone number further.
When the data processing system 120 receives a selection of a supplemental content item 215, a link 220, or other request for a phone number corresponding to the supplemental content item 215, the data processing system may access a database storing a mapping of content items to virtual phone numbers to map the selected content item or content item impression identifier to a first virtual phone number. The database may be stored in the data repository 155 and include a mapping of several content items, content groups, or content campaigns to virtual phone numbers. The database may include a mapping of content providers to virtual phone numbers. In some implementations, the database can dynamically assign virtual phone numbers and then store a mapping of the dynamically generated/assigned virtual phone numbers to content providers, content campaigns, content groups, or content items in the database.
The data processing system 120 can perform a lookup in a database to map the content item to a virtual phone number. The data processing system 120 may perform a lookup using a unique identifier of a content item (e.g., a content item impression identifier), a content campaign, a group of content, or a content provider to map the content item to a virtual phone number. For example, the data processing system 120 receives a selection of the telephone number link 230. Selecting telephone number link 230 initiates a request for a virtual telephone number from data processing system 120. The request for the virtual phone number 120 may include information about the content item 215, such as a unique identifier of the content item or content provider. In some cases, the request may include a URL of a web page displaying the content item or a link to the destination page 230, in which case the data processing system 120 may access the identified web page to map the content item to the virtual phone number. Accordingly, the data processing system 120 may perform a lookup in the database using an identifier or other indicator related to the content item 215 provided or associated with the request for a virtual phone number (via the selection link 220) to map the content item to the virtual phone number.
FIG. 3 shows a diagram of a method of synchronizing data via a computer network, according to an embodiment. Method 300 may be performed via one or more of the systems, components, or interfaces shown in fig. 1, 2, or 4, including, for example, a data processing system, a virtual number engine, a tracker, a content selector, a provider interface, a matching engine, or a data repository. Briefly, in some embodiments, the method 300 includes, at 310, a data processing system receiving a voice call entry. At 315, the data processing system accesses a log data structure that stores a plurality of log entries. At 320, the data processing system parses the log data structure to identify a log entry of the plurality of log entries. At 325, the data processing system matches the device identifier of the voice call entry with the device identifier of the log entry. At 330, the data processing system determines that a predetermined threshold of the respective start time or duration of the log entry is met. At 335, the data processing system retrieves the virtual phone number from the log entry. At 340, the data processing system performs a lookup to determine a content item impression identifier. At 345, the data processing system stores the data provided via the voice call entry in a data structure corresponding to the content item impression identifier.
In more detail, the method 300 includes, at 310, the data processing system receiving a voice call entry. The content provider may create a voice call entry and provide the voice call entry to the data processing system. The data processing system may receive one or more voice call entries. A data processing system may receive a data file, upload, or feed including one or more voice call entries. In some cases, the voice call entry may be pushed to a data processing system. In some cases, the data processing system may extract the voice call entry from a database or memory accessed via a network and established by the content provider. In some cases, the data processing system may receive the voice call entry in real-time; such as storing, recording, or generating a voice call entry in response to the content provider.
The data processing system may receive the voice call entry via a communication channel established using the content account identifier. For example, the communication channel may be a secure communication channel established by a content provider logged into a provider interface provided by the data processing system. To log into the provider interface, the content provider may transmit authentication credentials including, for example, a content account identifier, a username, a password, a security code, a fingerprint, a biometric code, a code that is text-sent to the content provider, and so forth. In some cases, a data processing system may be configured with multi-factor authentication.
The voice call entry may include one or more fields having one or more values in one or more formats. For example, the first field may identify a device identifier of the device originating the voice call. The second field may identify a start time of the voice call. The third field may identify the duration of the voice call. The fourth field may contain a conversion label. The fifth field may contain a conversion value. The voice call entry may include a table or data structure format as shown in table 3. The data processing system may convert the values in the fields from one format to another, which may be more helpful in identifying matching entries or generating reports. For example, the start time in the voice call entry can be in a first time zone, while the start time stored in the log entry of the data processing system can be in a second time zone. The voice call entry may indicate the time zone (e.g., the second field may identify a start time and a time zone). The data processing system can convert the start time in the time zone to a default time zone that is different from the time zone. The default time zone may be a time zone used by the data processing system for log entries. The default time zone may be UTC or GMT, or some other default time zone.
At 315, the data processing system accesses a log data structure that stores a plurality of log entries. The data processing system may maintain the log data structure in a memory of the data processing system. The log data structure may store a plurality of log entries corresponding to voice calls received by the data processing system. The data processing system may maintain a log data structure by storing in a data repository and be configured to access the log data structure to identify log entries. The data processing system may update the log data structure with a new log entry for the voice call received by the data processing system. Receiving a voice call may refer to the data processing system receiving a voice call from a potential client computing device and then forwarding or bridging the call to the provider device of the content provider. The data processing system may update the log data structure based on a time interval, such as in response to receiving a voice call in real time; every day; every hour; in batch mode, in response to a condition, event, or request.
In some cases, the log data structure may be encrypted in a data repository. The data processing system may be configured with authentication credentials or security tokens that permit or authorize the data processing system to access the log data structure.
The log data structure may maintain log entries using a file structure format. For example, the log data structure may organize log entries in a relational database. The data processing system may organize the log data structure or log entries in the log data structure in a manner that facilitates performing search queries, looking up, or otherwise parsing, identifying, and retrieving log entries from the log data structure. For example, the log entries may be organized based on a virtual phone number, a date received, a start time, or a duration.
At 320, the data processing system parses the log data structure to identify a log entry of the plurality of log entries. The data processing system can parse the log data structure to identify a first log entry of the data structure. In some cases, the data processing system may parse the data structure using a query that includes or is based on one or more of a device identifier, a start time, and a duration. In some cases, the data processing system may parse the log data structure to identify log entries by performing additional processes, such as matching and comparing to thresholds. For example, parsing the log data structure may include matching a device identifier of the voice call entry with a device identifier of the log entry. Parsing the log data structure may also include determining that a start time or duration stored in the log entry is within a predetermined threshold of a corresponding start time or duration stored in the voice call entry.
In some cases, the data processing system filters the log entries to identify one or more log entries corresponding to the content provider's content account identifier. For example, a data processing system may maintain a data repository that includes log entries in a log data structure for multiple content providers. By pre-filtering log entries prior to executing a query, the data processing system may more efficiently identify matching queries by using fewer computing resources, such as processor clock cycles, memory, temporary memory, or network bandwidth. The data processing system may reduce the latency of search results by pre-filtering the log data structure based on the content provider account identifier. Thus, the data processing system can more efficiently identify matching log entries by executing queries on a filtered log data structure that is filtered based on content account identifiers.
At 325, the data processing system matches the device identifier of the voice call entry with the device identifier of the log entry. In some cases, the data processing system may perform a one-to-one mapping between the device identifier of the voice call entry and the device identifier of the log entry to determine whether there is a match. Matching may refer to exact matching. In some cases, the data processing system may filter the wrong terms or formats to identify characteristics of the device identifier (e.g., ordered alphanumeric characters, and filter out or ignore punctuation marks or formats such as dashes "-", slashes "/", periods "-", or capitalization). For example, the data processing system may convert the format of the device identifier in the voice call entry to the format of the device identifier stored in the log entry and determine a match if the device identifications of the same format match exactly.
In some cases, the device identifier may be stored in the log entry using an encryption protocol. The device identifier may be stored in the log using an encrypted caller ID hash data format. The encryption protocol may include a hash encryption technique. The data processing system may perform decryption techniques to determine the device identifier. The decryption technique may include a reverse hashing technique that determines the device identifier. After decrypting the stored encrypted caller ID, the data processing system may compare the device identifier indicated by the encrypted device identifier of the stored log entry with the device identifier of the voice call entry. Thus, the device identifiers in the log entries may be stored or encrypted in one or more formats, and when a match is performed, the data processing system may decrypt the stored device identifiers or otherwise perform a format conversion to determine the match.
At 330, the data processing system determines that a predetermined threshold for the respective start time or duration of the log entry is met. In response to matching the device identifier, the data processing system may determine that at least one of a start time or a duration of the voice call entry satisfies a predetermined threshold of a corresponding start time or duration of the log entry. The log entry may be stored in the data processing system and include information about calls received by the data processing system that were generated by the content item impression. The data processing system may access a log entry data structure to identify one or more log entries corresponding to the voice call entry by matching a device identifier included in the voice call entry with a device identifier indicated in the log entry.
The data processing system may determine a matching log entry by further determining that at least one of a start time or a duration of the voice call entry is within a predetermined threshold of a corresponding start time or duration of the log entry. For example, the data processing system may determine a range threshold for a start time or a range threshold for a duration and generate a query having the range threshold. The query may identify log entries of the data processing system that include the same device identifier provided in the voice call entry and a start time that falls within a range of the start time of the voice call entry. The query may identify log entries of the data processing system that include the same device identifier provided in the voice call entry, a start time that falls within a range of start times of the voice call entry, and a duration of the voice call entry that falls within the range.
For example, the data processing system may identify a start time range for the start time of the voice call entry based on a predetermined time threshold. The data processing system may retrieve the predetermined time threshold and generate a voice call entry starting time range as follows: start _ time _ range [ voice _ call _ entry _ start _ time-predetermined _ threshold, voice _ call _ entry _ start _ time + predetermined _ threshold ]. The data processing system can identify a duration range for the duration of the voice call entry based on a duration predetermined threshold. The data processing system may retrieve the predetermined duration threshold and generate the duration range for the voice call entry as follows: duration _ range [ [ voice _ call _ entry _ duration-predetermined _ duration _ threshold ], voice _ call _ entry _ duration + predetermined _ duration _ threshold ]. The data processing system may generate a query having a first term including a device identifier, a second term including a start time range, and a third term including a duration range. For example, the query may be: { device _ identifier; start _ time _ range; duration _ range }. The data processing system may use the query to perform a lookup or search in the log data structure to identify matching log entries.
The data processing system may adjust the threshold based on historical matching performance. The data processing system may adjust the threshold based on historical matching effectiveness of the content account identifier. For example, if the threshold used by the data processing system results in too many or too few log entries matching the voice call entry, the data processing system may adjust the threshold. For example, if the threshold results in more than 5 matching log entries, the data processing system may lower the threshold. The data processing system may increase the threshold if the threshold results in 0, 1, 2, or 3 matching entries.
In some cases, the historical matching effectiveness may indicate a matching success rate. If a matching log entry is found, the data processing system may consider the match to be successful. The data processing system may determine a match success rate based on the number of successful matches divided by the number of voice call entries received by the content provider. The data processing system may determine a match success rate based on the number of successful matches divided by the number of search queries executed by the data processing system. The data processing system may compare the match success rate to a match threshold to determine whether to increase or decrease the predetermined range threshold. The match threshold may be, for example, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 90%, 95% or 99%, 100%, or some other percentage that facilitates fine-tuning the predetermined range threshold. The data processing system may increment or decrement the range threshold at predetermined intervals (e.g., 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.).
In the illustrative example, the data processing system determines that the match success rate is 9%. The data processing system may compare the match success rate to a match threshold, which may be 90%. A 90% match threshold may indicate that the data processing system is configured to identify matching log entries for 90% of the voice call entries provided by the content provider. In response to determining that the match success rate 9% is less than or equal to (e.g., does not meet) the match threshold 90%, the data processing system may increase the range threshold to at least one of the start time and the duration of the query to identify additional log entries. The data processing system may then rerun or re-execute the query with the new range of updates. The data processing system may continue to update the query and re-execute the query on the same data set until a match threshold is met (e.g., the match success rate equals or exceeds the match threshold).
At 335, the data processing system retrieves the virtual phone number from the log entry. The data processing system may retrieve the virtual phone number from the log entry in response to determining that the predetermined threshold is met. The data processing system may dynamically assign the virtual phone number to a content item of the content provider. In response to interaction with the content provider's content item, the data processing system may have provided the virtual phone number to the device having the device identifier of the log entry.
The data processing system may have previously provided the virtual phone number of the content item to the device. For example, the data processing system may receive a request for content for display via a device having the device identifier. The data processing system may select the content item in response to the request (e.g., based on content selection criteria, keywords, search terms, topics, or locations). The data processing system may provide the selected content item for display using the device having the device identifier. The data processing system may create a content item impression identifier and assign the ID to a content item impression. The data processing system may create a content item impression record for the content item impression ID. The data processing system may receive an indication of an interaction with the content item. For example, the interaction may be in the form of a button or link that clicks or selects the content item. In response to receiving the indication, the data processing system may provide the virtual phone number to the content item and provide the virtual phone number to the device having the device identifier.
The data processing system may receive a voice call to the provisioned virtual phone number. The voice call may indicate the device identifier and the configured virtual phone number. For example, the data processing system may determine the device identifier via caller ID. The data processing system may determine the provisioned virtual phone number because this is the phone number via which the data processing system receives the call. In response to receiving the call, the data processing system may detect a start time of the voice call. The start time may be a start time detected or determined by the data processing system. The start time may be in a default time zone. The data processing system may store the start time of the voice call in a log entry. The data processing system may further detect or determine that the voice call has ended or terminated, or that the device with the device identifier has dropped the call (e.g., hung up). The data processing system may store the duration of the call based on when the call terminated in the log entry.
In some implementations, the data processing system can use the record information about the content item itself to match the received call with the original content item. When the data processing system assigns a virtual phone number to a content item, the data processing system may record information about the content item. When the data processing system receives a call, the data processing system may look up the recorded information from the virtual number record and write information about the content item into the log along with the call information. Thus, in some implementations, the data processing system may indirectly rely on the virtual number to link the phone call to the originating content item without using the virtual number to look up the log. For example, when the data processing system receives a voice call to a provided virtual number, the data processing system may identify the content item impression identifier.
At 340, the data processing system performs a lookup to determine a content item impression identifier. The data processing system may perform a lookup in a content item impression data structure using the identified virtual phone number to determine a content item impression identifier, the content item impression identifier identifying an impression of a content item that resulted in configuration of the virtual phone number to the content item.
At 345, the data processing system stores the data provided via the voice call entry in a data structure corresponding to the content item impression identifier. In some cases, the data processing system uses the information provided in the voice call entry to update a data structure corresponding to the content item impression. The data processing system may update the content item impression data structure or a different data structure corresponding to the content item impression to attribute the voice call to the identified content item impression. The data processing system may further attribute data or information about the voice call entry to the content entry impression, such as a conversion type, a conversion tag, or a conversion value.
For example, the data processing system may parse or identify one or more fields of the voice call entry. The data processing system may identify a fourth field in the voice call entry that identifies a conversion label for the voice call assigned by the content provider. The conversion label may include, for example, a purchase, a subscription, or a survey. The data processing system may identify a fifth field in the voice call entry to identify a conversion value for the voice call assigned by the content provider. The converted values may include a numeric value, a string, a rating (e.g., A, B, C, D or F), a category (e.g., high, medium, low), or a scale (e.g., 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest value and 10 is the highest value, or 1 is the highest value and 10 is the lowest value). For example, the conversion value may be $800 or "high".
In some cases, the data processing system may identify a plurality of log entries that match a voice call entry or satisfy a query having a threshold range. For example, the second log entry may satisfy a start time range and a duration range. To determine a single matching entry, the data processing system may compare the start times of the two matching log entries to identify the log entry having the start time closest to the start time of the voice call entry. In some cases, the data processing may compare the durations of two matching log entries to determine the log entry having a duration closest to the duration of the voice call entry. For example, if the start times of two matching entries are the same, the data processing system may make a further comparison based on the duration to identify the log entry having a duration that is closest to the duration provided in the voice call entry.
In one embodiment, a data processing system determines a second log entry maintained in memory of the data processing system that corresponds to a voice call entry by matching a device identifier included in the voice call entry with a second device identifier indicated in a second log entry and determining that a start time of the voice call entry is within a predetermined threshold of a corresponding second start time of the second log entry. The second device identifier may be the same as the first device identifier. For example, the data processing system may use a query that includes a device identifier such that the log entry matches the unique device identifier. However, in some cases, the device identification in the log entry may not be unique, in which case the data processing system may identify multiple log entries having the same device identification. In some cases, the device identifier may be partially lost or corrupted, in which case the data processing system may identify multiple log entries that match the device identifier provided in the voice call entry.
The data processing system can determine a first difference between a start time of the first log entry and a start time (or corresponding duration) of the voice call in the voice call entry. The data processing system may determine a second difference between a second start time of the second log entry and a second start time (or corresponding duration) of the voice call in the voice call entry. The data processing system may select the first log entry as the matching entry based on a comparison (e.g., a smaller difference) of the first difference and the second difference. The data processing system may then use the matching entry to identify the virtual phone number.

The processes, systems, and methods described herein can be implemented by computing system 400 in response to processor 410 executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 415. Such instructions can be read into main memory 415 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 425. Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 415 causes the computing system 400 to perform the illustrative processes described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory 415. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the illustrative embodiments. Thus, implementations are not limited to the specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
Although an example computing system has been described in fig. 4, the embodiments and functional operations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, e.g., one or more circuits of computer program instructions, encoded on a computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium can be or be included in a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Further, while the computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, the computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. The computer storage media can also be or be included in one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
The operations described in this specification may be performed by data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
The term "data processing apparatus" or "computing device" encompasses various apparatuses, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or a plurality of programmable processors, computers, systems on a chip, or combinations of the foregoing. An apparatus can comprise special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment may implement a variety of different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing, and grid computing infrastructures.
A computer program (also known as a program, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally, a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processing unit for implementing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such a device. Moreover, the computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device, e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive, to name a few. Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having: a display device, such as a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to a user; and a keyboard and a pointing device, such as a mouse or a trackball, by which a user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can also be used to provide for interaction with the user; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, such as visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and can receive any form of input from the user, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
In embodiments of the invention, the supplemental content items may take any convenient form and may be content including images, text, and the like. In some implementations, the content can be advertisements or other sponsored content.
As described above, the data processing system 120 may identify a plurality of content items (e.g., a first candidate content item and a second candidate content item) in response to a request for content, or otherwise as other candidates for display on an online document (e.g., a web page). The data processing system may initiate or utilize an online auction process to select one or more of the plurality of content items for display on the online document. The auction system may determine two or more bids for content items to be displayed in the online document. The auction system may run bids through the auction process to determine one or more winning bids. The content item corresponding to the bid-for may be selected for display on or with the online document.
In some implementations, the data processing system can initiate a call to the content provider and then bridge two portions of the call (e.g., bridge the customer's call to the data processing system with the data processing system's call to the content provider). In some implementations, the data processing system can forward the call to the content provider. The content provider may determine during or after the call that a conversion (e.g., purchase of a good or service) occurred via the call. The content provider may provide the conversion information to the data processing system. The data processing system may identify content item impression data or tracking data corresponding to calls made via the virtual phone number and update the content item impression record or data using the conversion information to generate the performance report.
In another illustrative embodiment, a data processing system receives a search query input into a search engine. The data processing system provides search results in response to the search query and further selects and provides call advertisements for display with the search results that match the search query. The call advertisement may display the virtual phone number of the advertiser. The call advertisement may display the virtual phone number in response to receiving an indication of interest in the call advertisement (e.g., clicking or selecting or otherwise interacting with the call advertisement). The user may call an advertiser associated with the call advertisement using a number provided via the call advertisement. The content provider may determine, during or after the call, a transition that occurs via the call, such as purchasing a good or service. The content provider may provide the conversion information to the data processing system. The data processing system may identify content item impression data or tracking data corresponding to calls made via the virtual phone number and update the content item impression record or data using the conversion information to generate the performance report.
In embodiments where the encrypted caller ID stored in memory corresponds to a device identifier of the device, later, the data processing system may receive a voice call entry comprising conversion data uploaded by the content provider comprising one or more of: 1) a caller ID; 2) a call start time with time zone information; 3) call duration (e.g., in seconds); 4) tags, such as conversion tags (e.g., purchase, subscription, or survey); 5) switching time; 6) tag values, such as conversion values (e.g., prices or other items associated with the conversion); 7) converting currency (e.g., U.S. dollars); or 8) the phone number of the content provider device that received and placed the call. The system may then perform a lookup using the regenerated encrypted caller ID as a lookup key to match the internally stored encrypted caller ID with the call data uploaded by the advertiser.
The data processing system may parse a fourth field in the voice call entry to identify a conversion label for the voice call. The conversion labels may be assigned by the content provider. The data processing system may update a data structure corresponding to the content item impression to attribute the conversion label to the identified content item impression. The conversion label may include at least one of a purchase, a subscription, or a survey. The data processing system may parse a fifth field in the voice call entry to identify a conversion value for the voice call, i.e., a conversion value assigned by the content provider. The data processing system may update a data structure corresponding to the content item impression to attribute the conversion value to the identified content item impression.
