- Curved lens with embedded light guide 200 comprises curved lens 210 , incoupler 211 , light guide 212 (e.g., a volume of optically transparent material), and outcoupler 213 .
- Exit pupil replication (such as by exit pupil expander 130 from FIG. 1 ) is not illustrated in FIG. 2A to reduce clutter.

- Second exit pupil 240 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 210 at second interface location 243 to form second refracted exit pupil 241 which may impinge on target 260 ; due to the difference in curvature of curved lens 210 between first interface location 233 and second interface location 243 , first refracted exit pupil 231 and second refracted exit pupil 241 do not exit lens 210 at the same angle.
- Second propagating light 242 impinges on outcoupler 213 .

- outcoupler 213 comprises a diffractive element, therefore outcoupler 213 has a second order diffraction, where the second order diffraction is in the opposite direction to the light impinging on outcoupler 213 due to the lack of optical power present in outcoupler 213 .
- the first order diffraction has a first diffraction efficiency (first order DE), where the first order DE is the amount of light diffracted in the first order direction relative to the total amount of light impinging on outcoupler 213 (typically expressed as a percentage).

- Fourth exit pupil 270 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 210 to form fourth refracted exit pupil 271 which may impinge on target 260 .
- Initial second order light 272 may have the same angle as first propagating light 232 and guided light 221 and may therefore impinge on outcoupler 213 at the same locations on outcoupler 213 as first propagating light 232 and guided light 221 .
- Secondary second order light 282 totally internally reflects within lightguide 212 to impinge on outcoupler 213 .
- Outcoupler 213 couples a portion of secondary second order light 282 out of lightguide 212 to form fifth exit pupil 280 ; the remainder of secondary second order light 282 totally internally reflects within lightguide 212 to form tertiary second order light 292 .
- Fifth exit pupil 280 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 210 to form fifth refracted exit pupil 281 which may impinge on target 260 .
- initial second order light 272 outcoupled by outcoupler 213 may overlap with another exit pupil (e.g. first exit pupil 230 , second exit pupil 240 , etc.) that is outcoupled by outcoupler 213 to impinge on target 260 , therefore initial second order light 272 may, in some implementations, not be readily observed or distinguished from first order light outcoupled by outcoupler 213 .
- another exit pupil e.g. first exit pupil 230 , second exit pupil 240 , etc.
- FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a curved lens with embedded light guide 300 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- Curved lens with embedded light guide 300 comprises curved lens 310 , incoupler 311 , light guide 312 , and outcoupler 313 .
- Exit pupil replication (such as by exit pupil expander 130 from FIG. 1 ) is not shown in FIG. 3 to reduce clutter.
- Incident light 320 impinges on curved lens 310 , is refracted at the interface between the air and curved lens 310 , and then impinges on incoupler 311 which couples at least a portion of incident light 320 into light guide 312 to form guided light 321 .
- Guided light 321 propagates through light guide 312 via TIR.
- Guided light 321 impinges on outcoupler 313 .
- outcoupler 313 comprises a diffractive element with a first optical power.
- Outcoupler 313 couples a portion of guided light 321 out of lightguide 312 to form first exit pupil 330 ; the remainder of guided light 321 is totally internally reflected within lightguide 312 to form first propagating light 332 .
- First exit pupil 330 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 310 at first interface location 333 to form first refracted exit pupil 331 which exits curved lens 311 at a first angle to impinge on target 360 .
- Target 360 may comprise an eye of a user; target 360 may comprise a camera.
- First propagating light 332 impinges on outcoupler 313 .
- Outcoupler 313 couples a portion of first propagating light 332 out of lightguide 312 to form second exit pupil 340 ; the remainder of first propagating light 332 is totally-internally reflected within lightguide 312 to form second propagating light 342 .
- Second exit pupil 340 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 310 at second interface location 343 to form second refracted exit pupil 341 which impinges on target 360 ; the difference in curvature of curved lens 311 between first interface location 333 and second interface location 343 is compensated for by the optical power present in outcoupler 313 so that first refracted exit pupil 331 and second refracted exit pupil 341 exit curved lens 311 at substantially the same angle (i.e., within +/ ⁇ 10%).
- Second propagating light 342 impinges on outcoupler 313 .
- Outcoupler 313 couples a portion of second propagating light 342 out of lightguide 312 to form third exit pupil 350 .
- a person of skill in the art will appreciate that remaining portions of light not outcoupled by outcoupler 313 could continue to propagate through light guide 312 , with a respective portion of said remaining portions of light being outcoupled by outcoupler 313 to form additional exit pupils.
- Third exit pupil 350 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 310 at third interface location 353 to form third refracted exit pupil 351 which impinges on target 360 ; the difference in curvature of curved lens 311 between first interface location 333 , second interface location 343 , and third interface location 353 , is compensated for by the optical power present in outcoupler 313 so that third exit pupil 251 exits curved lens 311 at the same angle as first refracted exit pupil 231 and second refracted exit pupil 241 .
- Second order diffraction of second propagating light 342 creates initial second order light 372 .
- Initial second order light 372 propagates through light guide 312 in a direction opposite to second propagating light 342 (as well as first propagating light 332 and guided light 321 ).
- Initial second order light 372 impinges on outcoupler 313 and outcoupler 313 outcouples a portion of initial second order light 372 out of lightguide 312 to form first second order exit pupil 370 .
- First second order exit pupil 370 impinges on the interface between the air and curved lens 310 at fourth interface location 373 to form refracted second order exit pupil 371 which impinges on target 360 .
- the angle at which initial second order light 372 propagates through light guide 312 is not equal to the angle at which second propagating light 342 impinges on outcoupler 312 due to the optical power of outcoupler 313 , therefore fourth interface location 373 may not overlap with first interface location 333 , second interface location 343 , and/or third interface location 353 .
- Refracted second order exit pupil 371 may impinge on target 360 at a location that may not overlap with any other exit pupil, therefore refracted second order exit pupil 371 may be readily observable and distinguishable from any exit pupils arising from first order diffraction of light by outcoupler 313 .
- Additional, non-overlapping exit pupils arising from second order diffraction may be referred to as ghost images. ghost images may cause a degradation in display quality when a curved lens with embedded light guide is employed as a part of a WHUD.
- each exit pupil outcoupled by outcoupler 313 via first order diffraction may also give rise to second order light that may propagate through light guide 312 to create multiple second order exit pupils, therefore second order diffraction may create a significant number of ghost images unless the efficiency of second order diffraction by outcoupler 313 is very low compared to the efficiency of first order diffraction by outcoupler 313 .
- the efficiency of first order and second order diffraction by outcoupler 313 may be controlled by controlling the physical structures comprising outcoupler 313 . If outcoupler 313 comprises a hologram the physical structures of outcoupler 313 may be controlled via control over the conditions/parameters used to record said hologram. If outcoupler 313 comprises a SRG (surface relief grating), the physical structures of outcoupler 313 may be controlled during grating fabrication.
- outcoupler 313 may have a positive optical power to compensate for the negative optical power applied to light exiting curved lens 310 via said concave surface.
- outcoupler 313 may have a negative or a more complex optical power, respectively, to compensate for the optical power applied by the curvature of curved lens 310 .
- FIG. 4 is a is a cross-sectional view of a portion of a SRG outcoupler 400 .
- SRG outcoupler 400 comprises set of ridges 401 , wherein set of ridges 401 comprises a grating period 410 , a duty cycle 420 , and a modulation height 430 .
- Set of ridges 401 comprises material of a first refractive index, the space between each ridge comprising set of ridges 401 comprises a second material with a second refractive index; the second material may be air.
- Grating period 410 comprises the distance between one edge of a given ridge and same edge of the immediately adjacent ridge; grating period 410 may be constant throughout SRG outcoupler 400 or grating period 410 may vary across SRG outcoupler 400 .
- Duty cycle 420 comprises the fraction of the surface of SRG outcoupler 400 made up of ridges and is typically expressed as a percentage; when duty cycle 420 is high there are very small gaps between each ridge comprising set of ridges 401 and when duty cycle 420 is low there are very large gaps between each ridge comprising set of ridges 401 .
- Modulation height 430 comprises the height of the ridges comprising set of ridges 401 .
- the efficiency of the first order diffraction efficiency of SRG outcoupler 400 varies as grating period 410 , duty cycle 420 , and modulation height 430 vary.
- the efficiency of the second order diffraction efficiency of SRG outcoupler 400 varies as grating period 410 , duty cycle 420 , and modulation height 430 vary.
- a typical SRG is fabricated with values for grating period 410 , duty cycle 420 , and modulation height 430 which achieve maximum efficiency for first order diffraction, however said values for grating period 410 , duty cycle 420 , and modulation height 430 may also cause unacceptably high second order diffraction efficiency.
- values for grating period 410 , duty cycle 420 , and modulation height 430 for SRG outcouplers are chosen not to maximize first order DE, but to achieve a desired minimum first order DE while minimizing second order DE. Additionally, it is desirable to vary first order DE across SRG outcoupler to achieve a constant intensity of the light comprising each EP outcoupled by a SRG outcoupler.
- the intensity of an EP outcoupled by outcoupler 313 at a given location on outcoupler 313 may depend on the first order DE and the intensity of light at said location on outcoupler 313 .
- the intensity of light decreases as a function of propagation distance along outcoupler 313 due to the outcoupling of a portion of the propagating light with each impingement of said light on outcoupler 313 ; if first order DE is constant across outcoupler 313 then the intensity of light outcoupled by outcoupler 313 will decrease as a function of propagation distance.
- the intensity of light in EPs outcoupled by outcoupler 313 may be held constant if first order DE increases as a function of propagation distance along outcoupler 313 .
- first order DE increases as a function of propagation distance along outcoupler 313 .
- the first order DE may be increased as a function of propagation distance by varying duty cycle 420 and modulation height 430 as a function of propagation distance.

- FIG. 5B depicts multiple lines, with each line corresponding to a different wavelength and incident angle on the SRG. Comparing FIG. 5B to FIG. 5A , a person of skill in the art will appreciate that there are ranges of modulation height for which the first order DE is significantly higher than the second order DE, and vice versa.
- FIG. 6A is a third graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.
- FIG. 6A shows the diffraction efficiency (in %) on the Y axis as a function of duty cycle (in %) on the X axis.
- First order diffraction efficiency is depicted as solid lines while second order diffraction efficiency is depicted as dashed lines, where each diffraction order is depicted for red (R), green (G), and blue (B), wavelengths of light.
- FIG. 6A shows that first order DE is greatest at duty cycles near 40%, varying with wavelength, and that first order DE decreases continuously at duty cycles greater than, or less than, near 40%.
- FIG. 6A shows that second order DE is greatest at a duty cycle between 40 and 60%, varying with wavelength, however second order DE does not decrease continuously as duty cycle increases or decreases from the 40-60% range. Second order DE reaches respective minima at 15-30% and at 65-85% before increasing again as a function of distance from the maximum.
- FIG. 6B is a fourth graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers, focusing on the minimum in the 65-85% duty cycle range.
- FIG. 6B shows the diffraction efficiency (in %) on the Y axis as a function of duty cycle (in %) on the X axis.
- First order diffraction efficiency is depicted as solid lines while second order diffraction efficiency is depicted as dashed lines, where each diffraction order is depicted for red (R), green (G), and blue (B), wavelengths of light.
- FIG. 6B depicts data substantively similar to the data depicted in FIG. 6A , with the range of values of duty cycle limited to 65-95% and with DE depicted on a logarithmic scale.
- FIG. 6B shows that the minimum value of second order DE may depend on wavelength, and that a duty cycle value of approximately 75% minimizes second order diffraction efficiency for red, green, and blue light while keeping first order diffraction efficiency for red, green, and blue light well above minimum.
- FIG. 6C is a fifth graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.
- FIG. 6C shows the ratio of second order diffraction efficiency divided by first order diffraction efficiency (R+2/R+1) (a unitless ratio) on the Y axis as a function of duty cycle (in %) on the X axis.
- R+2/R+1 is depicted as dashed lines, while for the sake of comparison first order diffraction efficiency is depicted as solid lines, each value is depicted for red (R), green (G), and blue (B), wavelengths of light.
- FIG. 6C shows that a duty cycle value of approximately 75% minimizes second order diffraction efficiency for red, green, and blue light while the first order diffraction efficiency is above at least 0.1% for red, green, and blue wavelengths of light.
- FIG. 7A is another graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.
- FIG. 7A shows second order DE (OC DE R+2 ) (in %) on the Y axis as a function of first order DE (OC DE R+1 ) (in %) on the X axis for red wavelengths of light for various combinations of duty cycle and modulation height.

- FIG. 7AC shows second order DE (OC DE R+2 ) (in %) on the Y axis as a function of first order DE (OC DE R+1 ) (in %) on the X axis for blue wavelengths of light for various combinations of duty cycle and modulation height.
- FIG. 7A , FIG. 7B , and FIG. 7C show that there exists a wide range of available values for second order DE and first order DE as modulation height and duty cycle are varied.
- an outcoupler is typically designed to maximize first order DE for each wavelength; however, as illustrated herein the maximum available values of first order DE for each depicted wavelength of light show unacceptably high values for second order DE that can result in undesirable artifacts such as ghost images.
- a combination of modulation height and duty cycle may be chosen that yields a moderately lower value for first order DE (i.e., sub-maximum) while providing a significant reduction in second order DE. That is, the undesirable effects of high second order DE may be mitigated by deliberately reducing the first order DE of an outcoupler.
- Grating period 410 may be in a range that is limited by the wavelength or wavelengths of light that will be outcoupled by SRG outcoupler 400 , where grating period 410 cannot be less than half of the longest wavelength of light, nor greater than double the shortest wavelength of light.
- SRG outcoupler 400 may outcouple three wavelengths of light with wavelengths of about 450 nm, about 520 nm, and about 640 nm.
- Grating period 410 may be in a range of 320 nm to 900 nm, with a preferred range of 320 to 450 nm to decrease variation in diffraction efficiency as a function of wavelength.
- Modulation height 430 may be in a range of 20 to 100 nm.
- Duty cycle 420 may be in a range of 15 to 30%; in the alternative duty cycle 420 may be in a range of 65 to 95%.
- first order DE So long as second order diffraction is held sufficiently low as to achieve negligible ghost image formation, a higher first order DE is typically preferred, however the conventional approach of maximizing first order DE may not only lead to ghost image formation due to second order diffraction, but also may not provide sufficient variability in first order DE to achieve constant exit pupil intensity by varying first order DE as a function of propagation distance through SRG outcoupler 400 .
- FIG. 5A , FIG. 5B , FIG. 5C , FIG. 6A , FIG. 6B , FIG. 6C , FIG. 7A , FIG. 7B , and FIG. 7C may be employed to determine values for modulation height and duty cycle for a process to manufacture an outcoupler for use in a WHUD.

Abstract
Description
- The present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to laser projectors and particularly relate to focusing the laser light output by laser projectors.
- A head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head. A wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. The “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, however, users also care a lot about aesthetics. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date employ large display components and, as a result, most wearable heads-up displays presented to date are considerably bulkier and less stylish than conventional eyeglass frames.
- A challenge in the design of wearable heads-up displays is to minimize the bulk of the face-worn apparatus will still providing displayed content with sufficient visual quality. There is a need in the art for wearable heads-up displays of more aesthetically-appealing design that are capable of providing high-quality images to the user without limiting the user's ability to see their external environment.

Outcoupler 213 couples a portion of guided light 221 out oflightguide 212 to formfirst exit pupil 230; the remainder of guided light 221 totally-internally reflects withinlightguide 212 to form first propagatinglight 232.First exit pupil 230 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 210 atfirst interface location 233 to form first refractedexit pupil 231 which impinges on target 260. Target 260 may comprise an eye of a user; target 260 may comprise a camera. - First propagating
light 232 impinges onoutcoupler 213.Outcoupler 213 couples a portion of first propagating light 232 out oflightguide 212 to formsecond exit pupil 240; the remainder of first propagating light 232 totally-internally reflects withinlightguide 212 to form second propagatinglight 242.Second exit pupil 240 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 210 atsecond interface location 243 to form second refractedexit pupil 241 which may impinge on target 260; due to the difference in curvature ofcurved lens 210 betweenfirst interface location 233 andsecond interface location 243, first refractedexit pupil 231 and second refractedexit pupil 241 do not exitlens 210 at the same angle. - Second propagating light 242 impinges on
outcoupler 213.Outcoupler 213 couples a portion of second propagating light 242 out oflightguide 212 to formthird exit pupil 250. A person of skill in the art will appreciate that remaining portions of light not outcoupled byoutcoupler 213 could continue to propagate throughlightguide 212, with respective portions of said remaining portions of light being outcoupled byoutcoupler 213 to form additional exit pupils.Third exit pupil 250 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 210 atthird interface location 253 to form third refractedexit pupil 251 which may or may not impinge on target 260; due to the difference in curvature ofcurved lens 211 betweenfirst interface location 233,second interface location 243, andthird interface location 253,third exit pupil 251 does not exitcurved lens 211 at the same angle as first refractedexit pupil 231 or second refractedexit pupil 241. In accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods, first refractedexit pupil 231, second refractedexit pupil 241, and third refractedexit pupil 251 could exitcurved lens 211 with the same angle ifoutcoupler 213 applied an optical power to at least first propagatinglight 232 and second propagatinglight 242. - The process of outcoupling a portion of light impinging on
outcoupler 213 to form an exit pupil (e.g.first exit pupil 230,second exit pupil 240, and third exit pupil 250) occurs, at least in part, due to first order diffraction of light byoutcoupler 213.Outcoupler 213 comprises a diffractive element, therefore outcoupler 213 has a second order diffraction, where the second order diffraction is in the opposite direction to the light impinging onoutcoupler 213 due to the lack of optical power present inoutcoupler 213. The first order diffraction has a first diffraction efficiency (first order DE), where the first order DE is the amount of light diffracted in the first order direction relative to the total amount of light impinging on outcoupler 213 (typically expressed as a percentage). The second order DE is the amount of light diffracted in the second order direction relative to the total amount of light impinging on outcoupler 213 (typically expressed as a percentage). -
FIG. 2B is another cross-sectional view of curved lens with embeddedlight guide 200 fromFIG. 2A .Incident light 220, guidedlight 221,first exit pupil 230, first refractedexit pupil 231, first propagatinglight 232,second exit pupil 240, second refractedexit pupil 241, second propagatinglight 242,third exit pupil 250, and third refractedexit pupil 251 have all been omitted fromFIG. 2B to reduce clutter. - The incidence of second propagating light 242 (see
FIG. 2A , not shown inFIG. 2B to reduce clutter) onoutcoupler 213 creates initialsecond order light 272. Initialsecond order light 272 propagates in a direction opposite to second propagatinglight 242. Initialsecond order light 272 totally internally reflects withinlightguide 212 to impinge onoutcoupler 213.Outcoupler 213 couples a portion of initialsecond order light 272 out oflightguide 212 to formfourth exit pupil 270; the remainder of initialsecond order light 272 totally internally reflects withinlightguide 212 to form secondarysecond order light 282.Fourth exit pupil 270 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 210 to form fourth refractedexit pupil 271 which may impinge on target 260. Initialsecond order light 272 may have the same angle as first propagatinglight 232 and guidedlight 221 and may therefore impinge onoutcoupler 213 at the same locations onoutcoupler 213 as first propagatinglight 232 and guidedlight 221. - Secondary
second order light 282 totally internally reflects withinlightguide 212 to impinge onoutcoupler 213.Outcoupler 213 couples a portion of secondarysecond order light 282 out oflightguide 212 to formfifth exit pupil 280; the remainder of secondarysecond order light 282 totally internally reflects withinlightguide 212 to form tertiarysecond order light 292.Fifth exit pupil 280 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 210 to form fifth refractedexit pupil 281 which may impinge on target 260. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that remaining portions of second order light not outcoupled by
outcoupler 213 could continue to propagate throughlightguide 212, with respective portions of said remaining portions of second order light being outcoupled byoutcoupler 213 to form additional exit pupils - Each portion of initial
second order light 272 outcoupled byoutcoupler 213 may overlap with another exit pupil (e.g.first exit pupil 230,second exit pupil 240, etc.) that is outcoupled byoutcoupler 213 to impinge on target 260, therefore initialsecond order light 272 may, in some implementations, not be readily observed or distinguished from first order light outcoupled byoutcoupler 213. -
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a curved lens with embeddedlight guide 300 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Curved lens with embeddedlight guide 300 comprisescurved lens 310,incoupler 311,light guide 312, andoutcoupler 313. Exit pupil replication (such as byexit pupil expander 130 fromFIG. 1 ) is not shown inFIG. 3 to reduce clutter.Incident light 320 impinges oncurved lens 310, is refracted at the interface between the air andcurved lens 310, and then impinges onincoupler 311 which couples at least a portion of incident light 320 intolight guide 312 to form guidedlight 321. Guided light 321 propagates throughlight guide 312 via TIR. Guided light 321 impinges onoutcoupler 313. - In accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods,
outcoupler 313 comprises a diffractive element with a first optical power.Outcoupler 313 couples a portion of guided light 321 out oflightguide 312 to formfirst exit pupil 330; the remainder of guided light 321 is totally internally reflected withinlightguide 312 to form first propagatinglight 332.First exit pupil 330 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 310 atfirst interface location 333 to form first refractedexit pupil 331 which exitscurved lens 311 at a first angle to impinge ontarget 360.Target 360 may comprise an eye of a user;target 360 may comprise a camera. - First propagating
light 332 impinges onoutcoupler 313.Outcoupler 313 couples a portion of first propagating light 332 out oflightguide 312 to formsecond exit pupil 340; the remainder of first propagatinglight 332 is totally-internally reflected withinlightguide 312 to form second propagatinglight 342.Second exit pupil 340 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 310 atsecond interface location 343 to form second refractedexit pupil 341 which impinges ontarget 360; the difference in curvature ofcurved lens 311 betweenfirst interface location 333 andsecond interface location 343 is compensated for by the optical power present inoutcoupler 313 so that first refractedexit pupil 331 and second refractedexit pupil 341 exit curvedlens 311 at substantially the same angle (i.e., within +/−10%). - Second propagating light 342 impinges on
outcoupler 313.Outcoupler 313 couples a portion of second propagating light 342 out oflightguide 312 to formthird exit pupil 350. A person of skill in the art will appreciate that remaining portions of light not outcoupled byoutcoupler 313 could continue to propagate throughlight guide 312, with a respective portion of said remaining portions of light being outcoupled byoutcoupler 313 to form additional exit pupils.Third exit pupil 350 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 310 atthird interface location 353 to form third refractedexit pupil 351 which impinges ontarget 360; the difference in curvature ofcurved lens 311 betweenfirst interface location 333,second interface location 343, andthird interface location 353, is compensated for by the optical power present inoutcoupler 313 so thatthird exit pupil 251 exitscurved lens 311 at the same angle as first refractedexit pupil 231 and second refractedexit pupil 241. - The process of outcoupling a portion of light impinging on
outcoupler 313 to form an exit pupil gives rise to second order diffraction similar in some ways to the second order diffraction discussed in the description ofFIG. 2B . Second order diffraction of second propagatinglight 342 creates initialsecond order light 372. Initialsecond order light 372 propagates throughlight guide 312 in a direction opposite to second propagating light 342 (as well as first propagatinglight 332 and guided light 321). Initialsecond order light 372 impinges onoutcoupler 313 andoutcoupler 313 outcouples a portion of initialsecond order light 372 out oflightguide 312 to form first secondorder exit pupil 370. First secondorder exit pupil 370 impinges on the interface between the air andcurved lens 310 atfourth interface location 373 to form refracted secondorder exit pupil 371 which impinges ontarget 360. - The angle at which initial
second order light 372 propagates throughlight guide 312 is not equal to the angle at which second propagatinglight 342 impinges onoutcoupler 312 due to the optical power ofoutcoupler 313, thereforefourth interface location 373 may not overlap withfirst interface location 333,second interface location 343, and/orthird interface location 353. Refracted secondorder exit pupil 371 may impinge ontarget 360 at a location that may not overlap with any other exit pupil, therefore refracted secondorder exit pupil 371 may be readily observable and distinguishable from any exit pupils arising from first order diffraction of light byoutcoupler 313. Additional, non-overlapping exit pupils arising from second order diffraction may be referred to as ghost images. Ghost images may cause a degradation in display quality when a curved lens with embedded light guide is employed as a part of a WHUD. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that each exit pupil outcoupled by
outcoupler 313 via first order diffraction may also give rise to second order light that may propagate throughlight guide 312 to create multiple second order exit pupils, therefore second order diffraction may create a significant number of ghost images unless the efficiency of second order diffraction byoutcoupler 313 is very low compared to the efficiency of first order diffraction byoutcoupler 313. The efficiency of first order and second order diffraction byoutcoupler 313 may be controlled by controlling the physicalstructures comprising outcoupler 313. Ifoutcoupler 313 comprises a hologram the physical structures ofoutcoupler 313 may be controlled via control over the conditions/parameters used to record said hologram. Ifoutcoupler 313 comprises a SRG (surface relief grating), the physical structures ofoutcoupler 313 may be controlled during grating fabrication. - The optical path shown in
FIG. 3 depictscurved lens 310 with a concave surface betweenoutcoupler 313 andtarget 360, therefore outcoupler 313 may have a positive optical power to compensate for the negative optical power applied to light exitingcurved lens 310 via said concave surface. A person of skill in the art will appreciate that the surface betweenoutcoupler 313 andtarget 360 may be convex, or may possess prescription curvature, in which case outcoupler 313 may have a negative or a more complex optical power, respectively, to compensate for the optical power applied by the curvature ofcurved lens 310. -
FIG. 4 is a is a cross-sectional view of a portion of aSRG outcoupler 400.SRG outcoupler 400 comprises set ofridges 401, wherein set ofridges 401 comprises agrating period 410, aduty cycle 420, and amodulation height 430. Set ofridges 401 comprises material of a first refractive index, the space between each ridge comprising set ofridges 401 comprises a second material with a second refractive index; the second material may be air. -
Grating period 410 comprises the distance between one edge of a given ridge and same edge of the immediately adjacent ridge; gratingperiod 410 may be constant throughout SRG outcoupler 400 orgrating period 410 may vary acrossSRG outcoupler 400.Duty cycle 420 comprises the fraction of the surface of SRG outcoupler 400 made up of ridges and is typically expressed as a percentage; whenduty cycle 420 is high there are very small gaps between each ridge comprising set ofridges 401 and whenduty cycle 420 is low there are very large gaps between each ridge comprising set ofridges 401.Modulation height 430 comprises the height of the ridges comprising set ofridges 401. The efficiency of the first order diffraction efficiency of SRG outcoupler 400 varies asgrating period 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 vary. The efficiency of the second order diffraction efficiency of SRG outcoupler 400 varies asgrating period 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 vary. A typical SRG is fabricated with values for gratingperiod 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 which achieve maximum efficiency for first order diffraction, however said values for gratingperiod 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 may also cause unacceptably high second order diffraction efficiency. Therefore, in the present systems, devices, and methods, values for gratingperiod 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 for SRG outcouplers are chosen not to maximize first order DE, but to achieve a desired minimum first order DE while minimizing second order DE. Additionally, it is desirable to vary first order DE across SRG outcoupler to achieve a constant intensity of the light comprising each EP outcoupled by a SRG outcoupler. - When a SRG outcoupler is part of a light guide assembly (e.g. if a SRG outcoupler comprises
outcoupler 313 in curved lens with embedded light guide 300), the intensity of an EP outcoupled byoutcoupler 313 at a given location onoutcoupler 313 may depend on the first order DE and the intensity of light at said location onoutcoupler 313. The intensity of light decreases as a function of propagation distance alongoutcoupler 313 due to the outcoupling of a portion of the propagating light with each impingement of said light onoutcoupler 313; if first order DE is constant acrossoutcoupler 313 then the intensity of light outcoupled byoutcoupler 313 will decrease as a function of propagation distance. The intensity of light in EPs outcoupled byoutcoupler 313 may be held constant if first order DE increases as a function of propagation distance alongoutcoupler 313. As constant EP intensity is a desirable property for WHUDs, it is desirable to have the first order DE increase as a function of propagation distance foroutcoupler 313. In accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods, the first order DE may be increased as a function of propagation distance by varyingduty cycle 420 andmodulation height 430 as a function of propagation distance. -
FIG. 5A is a first graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers, such as SRG outcouplers having similar form (but various geometric/parametric properties) to SRG outcoupler 400 ofFIG. 4 .FIG. 5A shows the first order diffraction efficiency (in %) on the Y axis as a function of modulation height in nanometers (nm) on the X axis.FIG. 5A shows that first order diffraction efficiency increases dramatically from 5-40 nm, with much less of an increase in first order DE (and even a potential decrease in first order DE) above 40 nm.FIG. 5A depicts multiple lines, with each line corresponding to a different wavelength and incident angle on the SRG. -
FIG. 5B is a second graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.FIG. 5B shows the second order diffraction efficiency (in %) on the Y axis as a function of modulation height in nanometers (nm) on the X axis.FIG. 5B shows that second order diffraction efficiency increases dramatically from 5-60 nm, with a continuous, albeit less extreme, increase in second order DE above 60 nm.FIG. 5B depicts multiple lines, with each line corresponding to a different wavelength and incident angle on the SRG. ComparingFIG. 5B toFIG. 5A , a person of skill in the art will appreciate that there are ranges of modulation height for which the first order DE is significantly higher than the second order DE, and vice versa. -
FIG. 6A is a third graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.FIG. 6A shows the diffraction efficiency (in %) on the Y axis as a function of duty cycle (in %) on the X axis. First order diffraction efficiency is depicted as solid lines while second order diffraction efficiency is depicted as dashed lines, where each diffraction order is depicted for red (R), green (G), and blue (B), wavelengths of light. -
FIG. 6A shows that first order DE is greatest at duty cycles near 40%, varying with wavelength, and that first order DE decreases continuously at duty cycles greater than, or less than, near 40%.FIG. 6A shows that second order DE is greatest at a duty cycle between 40 and 60%, varying with wavelength, however second order DE does not decrease continuously as duty cycle increases or decreases from the 40-60% range. Second order DE reaches respective minima at 15-30% and at 65-85% before increasing again as a function of distance from the maximum. In accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods, there exist values for duty cycle at which second order DE may be minimized without simultaneously minimizing first order DE. -
FIG. 6B is a fourth graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers, focusing on the minimum in the 65-85% duty cycle range.FIG. 6B shows the diffraction efficiency (in %) on the Y axis as a function of duty cycle (in %) on the X axis. First order diffraction efficiency is depicted as solid lines while second order diffraction efficiency is depicted as dashed lines, where each diffraction order is depicted for red (R), green (G), and blue (B), wavelengths of light.FIG. 6B depicts data substantively similar to the data depicted inFIG. 6A , with the range of values of duty cycle limited to 65-95% and with DE depicted on a logarithmic scale. -
FIG. 6B shows that the minimum value of second order DE may depend on wavelength, and that a duty cycle value of approximately 75% minimizes second order diffraction efficiency for red, green, and blue light while keeping first order diffraction efficiency for red, green, and blue light well above minimum. -
FIG. 6C is a fifth graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.FIG. 6C shows the ratio of second order diffraction efficiency divided by first order diffraction efficiency (R+2/R+1) (a unitless ratio) on the Y axis as a function of duty cycle (in %) on the X axis. (R+2/R+1) is depicted as dashed lines, while for the sake of comparison first order diffraction efficiency is depicted as solid lines, each value is depicted for red (R), green (G), and blue (B), wavelengths of light. -
FIG. 6C shows that a duty cycle value of approximately 75% minimizes second order diffraction efficiency for red, green, and blue light while the first order diffraction efficiency is above at least 0.1% for red, green, and blue wavelengths of light. -
FIG. 7A is another graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.FIG. 7A shows second order DE (OC DER+2) (in %) on the Y axis as a function of first order DE (OC DER+1) (in %) on the X axis for red wavelengths of light for various combinations of duty cycle and modulation height. -
FIG. 7B is another graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.FIG. 7B shows second order DE (OC DER+2) (in %) on the Y axis as a function of first order DE (OC DER+1) (in %) on the X axis for green wavelengths of light for various combinations of duty cycle and modulation height. -
FIG. 7C is another graph of data obtained for SRG outcouplers.FIG. 7AC shows second order DE (OC DER+2) (in %) on the Y axis as a function of first order DE (OC DER+1) (in %) on the X axis for blue wavelengths of light for various combinations of duty cycle and modulation height. -
FIG. 7A ,FIG. 7B , andFIG. 7C show that there exists a wide range of available values for second order DE and first order DE as modulation height and duty cycle are varied. In conventional lightguide design an outcoupler is typically designed to maximize first order DE for each wavelength; however, as illustrated herein the maximum available values of first order DE for each depicted wavelength of light show unacceptably high values for second order DE that can result in undesirable artifacts such as ghost images. In accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods, a combination of modulation height and duty cycle may be chosen that yields a moderately lower value for first order DE (i.e., sub-maximum) while providing a significant reduction in second order DE. That is, the undesirable effects of high second order DE may be mitigated by deliberately reducing the first order DE of an outcoupler. - Returning to
FIG. 4 , and considering the data presented above, a range of values for gratingperiod 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 may therefore be chosen to minimize second order diffraction while still achieving an acceptable amount of first order diffraction.Grating period 410 may be in a range that is limited by the wavelength or wavelengths of light that will be outcoupled bySRG outcoupler 400, wheregrating period 410 cannot be less than half of the longest wavelength of light, nor greater than double the shortest wavelength of light. - In a first implementation, SRG outcoupler 400 may outcouple three wavelengths of light with wavelengths of about 450 nm, about 520 nm, and about 640 nm. A person of skill in the art will appreciate that precise wavelengths may vary in different implementations or even in different scenarios for the same implementation; therefore, the term “about” is used to here to allow some variability within +/−10%.
Grating period 410 may be in a range of 320 nm to 900 nm, with a preferred range of 320 to 450 nm to decrease variation in diffraction efficiency as a function of wavelength.Modulation height 430 may be in a range of 20 to 100 nm.Duty cycle 420 may be in a range of 15 to 30%; in thealternative duty cycle 420 may be in a range of 65 to 95%. A first preferred range of modulation height of 50 to 100 nm and a first preferred range of duty cycle of 67 to 77% yield a value of first order diffraction efficiency greater than 0.1% with a significant reduction in second order diffraction efficiency. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that the data presented above allows for additional implementations with values for
modulation height 430 andduty cycle 420 that yield a first order DE that is at least a factor of 10 greater than the second order DE, thereby providing sufficiently high first order DE to outcouple light from a light guide as part of a WHUD while minimizing ghost image formation due to second order diffraction. So long as second order diffraction is held sufficiently low as to achieve negligible ghost image formation, a higher first order DE is typically preferred, however the conventional approach of maximizing first order DE may not only lead to ghost image formation due to second order diffraction, but also may not provide sufficient variability in first order DE to achieve constant exit pupil intensity by varying first order DE as a function of propagation distance throughSRG outcoupler 400. Thus, while conventional lightguide design teaches controllinggrating period 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 in order to maximize first order DE of an outcoupler (and thereby maximize the amount of light outcoupled by the outcoupler), the present systems, devices, and methods teach controllinggrating period 410,duty cycle 420, andmodulation height 430 in order to minimize (or at least, target a sufficiently low value for) second order DE of an outcoupler while still achieving a sufficiently high first order DE in order to minimize/reduce adverse effects such as ghost images while still achieving sufficient outcoupling. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that the data presented in
FIG. 5A ,FIG. 5B ,FIG. 5C ,FIG. 6A ,FIG. 6B ,FIG. 6C ,FIG. 7A ,FIG. 7B , andFIG. 7C , may be employed to determine values for modulation height and duty cycle for a process to manufacture an outcoupler for use in a WHUD. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that the various embodiments for exit pupil expansion in a curved lens with embedded light guide described herein may be applied in non-WHUD applications.
