- the server 110 can be configured to identify a plurality of words in the universal resource locator.
- the server 110 can be configured to insert space or whitespace between at least two of the plurality of words.
- the space can be in addition to a single space character between a plurality of words.
- the space can be between words which otherwise do not have a space character between them in the URL.
- the server 110 can be configured to generate display data including the result having the plurality of words and the inserted space therebetween.
- the keywords located in a text of the universal resource locator has whitespace inserted between the keywords.
- the whitespace between the keywords is not a space character because inserting a space character does not allow the URL to be copied or pasted.
- several characters, strings, etc. are separated instead of inserting whitespace.
- the results may include HTML.
- the results are displayed in any markup language.
- the HTML tag that creates the whitespace is inserted between the keywords by the server 110 before the webpage is sent to the client 102 .
- the results may be displayed with at least 0.01 em of whitespace between the keywords. In some implementations, the results may be displayed with at least 0.1 em of whitespace between the keywords.
- the results may be displayed with at least 0.25 em of whitespace between keywords.
- One em is equivalent to the vertical space needed for any given letter in a font, regardless of the horizontal space that occupies it.
- the default font size of a web browser may be 16 px. For example, then 1 em is equal to 16 px; 0.5 em is equal to 8 pxm, 5 em is equal to 80 px.
- an italics tag with a right margin of 0.25 em can be used to insert additional whitespace.
- span tag may be used.
- a div tag may be used.
- the height of the font may be greater than 0.25 em. The height of the font may correlate to any font used in a web browser.
- the results may be displayed with at least 4 pixels of whitespace between the keywords, or in alternative embodiments with at least 0.25 pixel, 0.5 pixel, 1 pixel, at least 2 pixels, less than 6 pixels, etc.
- the results may be displayed with at least 4 pixels of whitespace between the keywords, or in alternative embodiments with at least 0.25 pixel, 0.5 pixel, 1 pixel, at least 2 pixels, less than 6 pixels, etc.
- the server device 110 provides a web page with information relating to the key word that is to be parsed (e.g., the keyword or keywords to parse, a desired visual setting to emphasize the keyword or keywords on the screen such as bolding or adding whitespace, etc.).
- the web page may receive the information and may be configured to add, for example, pixels of whitespace between the keywords.
- the web page may automatically add a set number of pixels (e.g., 4 pixels), or may use the information from server device 110 to determine an optimal number of whitespace pixels to insert between keywords.
- the server device 110 may provide the web page with a desired number of whitespace pixels to insert between keywords, or may determine an optimal number of whitespace pixels (e.g., if the server device 110 knows display information related to the web page, the server device 110 may be able to determine an optimal setting).
- the whitespace is inserted using a computer language that expresses the presentation of documents, such as structured document.
- the computer language may be a style sheet language, such as Cascade Style Sheet (CSS) markup enhanced tags.
- CCS Cascade Style Sheet
- the whitespace is inserted based on spacing identified in the query request. For example, if the user enters “apple orchard,” then the whitespace of the selectable link may be similarly spaced.
- the search engine, parsing processor or other hardware/software implementations may insert whitespace based on proper nomenclature of terms. For example, Google's spell correction has some knowledge of the proper spacing of terms. The proper nomenclature of terms may be determined by looking for high co-ocurrence of related terms. Then, segmentation may occur to increase the total co-occurrence by selecting a sequence with spaces that match.
- FIG. 2 a flow diagram of a method 200 in accordance with a described implementation is shown.
- the method 200 is provided by way of example, as there are a number of ways to carry out the methods according to the present disclosure.

- the query can be received by or accessed by server 110 connected to the network 108 .
- the query can include a plurality of keywords.
- the query can include at least one image and keywords based on the image.
- Block 202 is followed by block 204 , in which keywords are determined for the query by parsing the query based on parsing criteria.
- the parsing processor 118 can use one or more criteria to determine the parsing criteria.
- the parsing criteria may be parsing the characters in the string into a combination of tokens.
- the parsing criteria may be based on dictionaries, context-free grammar, attribute grammar, S-attributed grammar, etc.
- the keywords may be determined by searching for spaces in the search string and separating the words of the search string based on the spaces which are found.
- Block 204 is followed by block 206 , in which a plurality of words is identified in the universal resource locator.
- the plurality of words may include symbols, numbers, etc.
- Block 206 is followed by block 208 , in which a space is inserted between at least two of the plurality of words.
- Block 208 is followed by block 210 , in which display data is generated including a result having the plurality of words and inserted space therebetween.
- multiple results are generated.
- the result is generated by a search performed by the search engine 120 in conjunction with the parsing processor 118 .
- the parsing processor 118 can pass the parsed query to the search engine to generate the result.
- the whitespace 300 is provided by an additional amount of HTML, i.e., a tag is inserted between letters, characters, strings, sentences, numbers, etc.
- Whitespace is used to indicate spacing between textual and/or graphical characters, and includes spacing of other colors besides white.

- a component boundary e.g., potential leading slash/periods in the domain name
- a bolded term that is not at a component boundary e.g., periods and colons in the domain name
- the universal resource locator in the results includes a hyperlink or selectable link with whitespace 300 between the keywords.
