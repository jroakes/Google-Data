Fig. 4 be show wherein by document identifier identifier 420 use feature database 330 (its also can as input to document
Identifier 420 can use) classification and store one or more non-classified documents 410 system 400 block diagram.
Non-classified document 410 is obtained as input by document identifier 420.Non-classified document 410 can be many
It is different types of, being explained such as the document on the set 310 from document.It can not divided in a number of different manners
The document 410 of class.In some embodiments, the set of non-classified document 410 from the document associated with user is obtained, all
Such as it is stored in the equipment that user possesses or is stored in using the account (such as email account) associated with user
At server.
In one example, non-classified document 410 is the annex of email message.In this example, do not divided
The document 410 of class can include accessing being stored in one or more email messages at e-mail server, and with
The email account that (for example, being possessed by user or by user's major control) and user are associated is associated.Accessed
Message can be the message received via the agreement of such as smtp protocol at e-mail server, and wherein user is identified as
The recipient of message.Component software can monitor the message received at e-mail server, and by e-mail attachment
The position that can be accessed by document identifier 420 is sent to, to be stored as non-classified document 410, until they are known by document
Other device 420 is obtained and handled.In some embodiments, email message is transmitted together with e-mail attachment so that message
The content of itself can be used for annex of classifying.Therefore, system 400 can automatically process email message and/or Email
Annex, without starting assorting process by user.
In another example, non-classified document 410 is photo.In this example, obtaining non-classified document 410 can be with
Including accessing the photo associated with user.Photo can be stored at the equipment associated with user, or be stored in
A part for the set of the photo at the storage system based on cloud in the position that user is associated.Software group can such as be passed through
Part monitors the set of photo, and the photo newly added can be sent to the position that can be accessed by document identifier 420, with
Stored as non-classified document 410, until they are obtained and handled by document identifier 420.Therefore, system 400 can be certainly
The dynamic new image for capturing or storing of processing, without starting assorting process by user.
Document identifier 420 extracts feature from non-classified document 410.This can be with the institute of feature classifiers 320
The mode of description is completed.Document identifier 420 is then using feature database 330 by the way that the feature extracted and characteristic information are entered
Whether row relatively determines each subject document in subject document corresponding to a known document class in known document type
Type.For example, document identifier 420 can select subject document from non-classified document 410, one is extracted from subject document
Or multiple features, and by the feature for the one or more extractions extracted from subject document and the spy that is stored in feature database 330
Reference breath is compared.The known technology of such as machine learning and/or mode-matching technique can be used to compare to perform this.Should
Result of the comparison can be the identification of one or more of the known document type relevant with subject document known document type.
In one embodiment, for subject document on each determination fraction in several known document types,
Wherein each fraction representation subject document corresponds to the probability of particular document type (that is, the document for belonging to same type).Can
To select a known document type in known document type based on the fraction.For selecting one in known document type
One simple examples of the algorithm of individual known document type simply choose top ranked known document type.It can be used
Its algorithm selects a known document type in known document type.
In some embodiments, make on whether result is considered as effective or invalid determination.So really
Surely it can be carried out based on one or more single tests.Test can determine top ranked Doctype as one
Whether fraction exceedes threshold value.If the fraction of top ranked Doctype is no more than threshold value, result is confirmed as nothing
Effect.Another such test can determine whether two top ranked Doctypes are differed less than threshold value (for example, more than error
Amount).If two top ranked Doctype differences are less than threshold value, result is confirmed as invalid.If process is produced
Effective result, then subject document is associated with known document type.This association can be carried out automatically, without selection known document
User's input of type.Then document identifier 420 makes subject document associated with known document type.If the process is not produced
Raw effective result, then document identifier 420 will not be automatically associated with known Doctype by subject document.In some realities
Apply in mode, document identifier 420 then can point out user by from list select known document type in one
Know Doctype or manually subject document is classified by creating new Doctype.
After subject document is associated with known document type, document identifier 420 makes subject document and known document
Type is stored in association.In one example, storing subject document in association with known document includes turning subject document
Document storage system 430 is moved on to be deposited in the way of allowing to position based on its Doctype with searching motif document
Storage.In one embodiment, document identifier 420 make to store automatically at document storage system 430 subject document by and nothing
User is needed to input.In another embodiment, document identifier 420 causes whether should deposit to user's display inquiry user's the document
Store up the interface at document storage system 430.
An example for storing subject document in association with its Doctype includes subject document being stored in only including
In private storage locations at the document storage system 430 of document from identical document type.Private storage locations can be
Only store the file of the hierarchical storage structure of the document from single Doctype.Non-layered storage system can also be used
The document of identical known document type is stored together.For example, such system can store the Doctype of identification document
Subject document metadata.Document storage system 430 can use the metadata to define and display is only included and come from
The set or measured set based on file of the document of single specified Doctype.
In one embodiment, document storage system 430 is cloud storage system, and it is by the text of each known document type
Shelves are stored in associated and the only document comprising the corresponding known document type associated with the subject document to user special
With in storage location.Private storage locations can be by giving user the user at least in part to the control of private storage locations
Account is associated with user.It is supplied to the control of user to include setting access control special to refuse or authorize other people to access
The ability of storage location.
System 400 can apply to the document of many types.In one embodiment, it is known that one in Doctype
Known document type corresponds to sales check, and feature database 330 is included for determining whether subject document is that sales check has
Characteristic of division from sales check.
As an example, user can email message in itself in or with such as image file format, word
Processing document file format or application individual document show that the form of file format (such as PDF document form) is received as annex
One or more email messages comprising sales check.These documents are handled by document identifier 420, and are such as passed through
The copy of document is created at document storage system 430, any document for being identified as sales check is stored in document storage
At system 430.Although the feature that the example provided in the past is all paid close attention in document indicates that document is the situation of known type in itself,
It is to be understood that handling the feature in email message to determine that the annex of email message corresponds to known document
Type, is classified based on the feature in email message to annex in this case, then can be stored in annex
At document storage system 430.
As another example, user can shoot the photo of one or more sales checks using camera, and these are shone
Piece is stored in the also set of the image including other types of image.These images processed as described above of document identifier 420.
For the purpose of tagsort, it is possible to use optical character identification text is recognized and extracted from image.Document identifier 420
When it is determined that at least some in document are sales checks, those documents are made to be stored at document storage system 430.
