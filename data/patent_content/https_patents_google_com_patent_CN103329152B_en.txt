Say, user identifier 610 shows the user identifier associated with sharer S1 and consumer V1 in arranging.User identifier 610
It can represent the user identifier of the user account of social media application program.
Database 605 is also comprising expression by the user that user identifier 610 identifies with being identified by relation destination identifier 620
User between relation characteristic relation value 630.The relation property represented in database 605 is relationship strength value 632
And relation object offset 634.Relationship strength value 632 can represent to arrange the user of interior identification and in relation target in user identifier 610
Identifier 620 arranges the relative populations of the common relation between the user of interior identification.The relation that relationship strength value 632 is shown in arranging
Intensity level is " layer 0 ", " layer 1 ", " layer 2 " (is represented) without value by line.Relation object offset 634 can be represented in user identifier 610
The type of the user of identification and the relation between the user that relation destination identifier 620 arranges interior identification in row.In relationship type
The relation object offset that value 634 is shown in arranging is " family ", " acquaintance ", " business " or (is represented without value by line).
For example, as demonstrated in Figure 6 B, sharer S1 and consumer V1 has relation, and the relation has " layer 2 "
Relationship strength value (being showed in row 632) and there is " family " relation object offset (being showed in row 634).Can by sharer S1 with
Relation between consumer V1 be characterized as " relation of layer 2 " be because sharer S1 and consumer V1 also with two co-users (use
Family V2 and user V4) there is relation.Specifically, sharer S1 and user V4 has relation and consumer V1 also has with user V4
There is relation.In addition, sharer S1 with user V2 is with relation and consumer V1 is also with user V2 with relation.This and sharer S1
Between user V2 " relation of layer 1 " is contrasted, described, and " relation of layer 1 " is because sharer S1 and user V2 through so characterization
There is common relation with a user (consumer V1).

In presentation of sharer's content subset for inclusion in consumer V1.The content selector can be configured with based in row 634
" acquaintance " the relation object offset that is shown and select the different sharing person content subset associated with sharer S1 for inclusion in
In the presentation of user V2.
In certain embodiments, the relation not being connected directly with sharer S1 can be used and defined to be directed to consumer V1 through fixed
System is presented.For example, interacting between consumer V1 and user V3 may be notified that the customization of the presentation of consumer V1.Therefore, may be used
Using the relation between consumer V1 and user V3 and can be associated with the relation between consumer V1 and user V3 be in present worth
Presented to be directed to consumer V1 customizations.
In certain embodiments, the relation being connected directly with sharer S1 (or target of social networks) can be known as subtracting
Weak relation.The relation being connected directly with sharer S1 can be known as level-one relation.For example, can be by sharer S1 and consumption
Relation between person V1, V2, V4 and V5 is known as level-one relation.S1 and discord S1 can be connected directly but with having with sharer S1
Relation between the user that the user of level-one relation is connected directly is known as degree relationship.For example, can by S1 and user V3 it
Between relation be known as degree relationship because consumer V1 is directly related with sharer S1, and consumer V3 and consumer V1 are direct
It is related, but consumer V3 is not connected directly with sharer S1.In certain embodiments, can be used with higher level relation (for example, three
Level relation) associated presentation is defined to be directed to consumer in present worth.
In certain embodiments, can be defined when the change of social networks 600 occurs on the pass in the social networks
The information of system.For example, when defining new relation between a user and sharer S1, can define and the table in database
Show the information of (by relationship module) on the new relation.
