Definitions
- Implementations of the present disclosure relate to content delivery, and more specifically, to media playback on a device.
- the Internet allows people to obtain information, connect with others and share information with each other.
- Common Internet destinations include news websites, content sharing platforms, social networking websites, and the like.
- Many websites and platforms include a content sharing aspect that allows users to view, upload, and share media items, such as video content, image content, audio content, and so on. Users can consume the media items from their user devices.
- a method includes providing, by an application executed by a processing device, a playback of a media item that includes a video portion and an audio portion.
- the method further includes receiving, by the application, a first message during the playback of the media item.
- the method further includes in response to the first message, stopping the playback of the video portion of the media item while continuing to provide the audio portion of the media item.
- the method further includes receiving, by the application, a second message while providing the audio portion of the media item.
- the method further includes in response to the second message, resuming the playback of the video portion of the media item in synchronization with the audio portion being provided.
- Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features.
- the method can include providing the playback of the media item, receiving a request to playback the media item, and reserving one or more resources associated with the playback of the media item in response to the request.
- the method can further include stopping the playback of the video portion of the media item and releasing at least one of the one or more resources.
- the one or more resources can include at least one of: a memory, a video decoder, or a video player. Releasing at least one of the one or more resources can include at least one of:
- the first message can be at least one of: an indication that the application can have entered a background state on a mobile device, an indication that a display of the mobile device can be powered off, or an indication that a second application can have entered a foreground state on the mobile device.
- the second message can be an indication that the application can have entered a foreground state on the mobile device.
- the presentation of the video portion of the media item can be resumed without interrupting the presentation of the audio portion.
- the video portion can be initially presented at a first quality and wherein resuming the presentation of the video portion of the media item can include presenting the video portion at a second quality.
- the method can include presenting, via a graphical user interface, a message that the presentation of the video portion is to resume.
- the method can include receiving the video portion and the audio portion from different sources.
- the method can include receiving the video portion and the audio portion of the media item as a single file.
- the method can further include separating the video portion and the audio portion into separate files.
- computing devices for performing the operations of the above described implementations are also disclosed.
- a computer readable storage media stores methods for performing the operations of the above described implementations.
- Figure 1 illustrates an example system architecture, in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure.
- Figure 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for providing efficient media application backgrounding on a client device, according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- Figure 3 illustrates two example timelines for providing efficient media application backgrounding on a client device, according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- Figure 4 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system, according to some implementations.
- a media application on the client device can play the streamed media items on the client device using a media player.
- a user may desire to operate another feature or other application on the client device such that the audio portion of the video continues to play while the video portion is no longer displayed on the client device. For example, the user may wish to use other applications or turn the client device screen off while the audio portion continues to play.
- the user can minimize, close or otherwise cause the media application to enter a background state.
- a background state can refer to a state, in which an application continues to run while no longer being visible and an application in the background state can refer to a "backgrounded" application.
- a conventional client device can background a media application that is playing a video, the media application usually continues to run and process audio and video data (e.g., download, decode, cache) in spite of the video not being visible on-screen.
- conventional client devices typically also hold on to system resources, such as memory (for buffering data), network sockets and video decoders.
- system resources such as memory (for buffering data), network sockets and video decoders.
- some conventional devices can receive media items in non-multiplexed formats, where synchronized video and audio portions of a video are delivered separately. During playback, the client device generally renders the synchronized video and audio streams simultaneously.
- Conventional systems usually do not operate differently when the media application is backgrounded, which may cause an unnecessary consumption of resources.
- Mobile devices typically have a limited number of resources, which means that conventional approaches can prevent another application from using the resources.
- Implementations of the present disclosure address the above deficiencies of conventional systems by providing a mechanism for controlling independent playback of a video portion of a media item and an audio portion of the media item.
- An application on a client device provides playback of a media item that includes a video portion and an audio portion. At any time, the application can stop playback of the video portion of the media item while continuing to provide the audio portion. Later, the application can resume playback of the video portion in synchronization with the audio portion that is being provided.
- Techniques described herein can reduce the cost of operating an application in background mode. While the application is not presenting the video portion, the application can stop downloading the video portion, pause decoding any downloaded video data and clear any associated memory. By releasing these and other resources, network and battery consumption of the client device can be reduced as a result. Users often do not desire to download video they do not intend to watch, as it uses data and bandwidth. Further, the audio portion can be seamlessly provided throughout the application transitioning from foreground to background and back to foreground.
- portions of the media item can include audio, video, subtitle data, a stream of overlaid data, annotations, advertisements, comments, metadata, information about the content of the media item (e.g., actors, related movies, music tracks, facial recognition, and the like). Any of the portions can be handled using the techniques described herein.
- Figure 1 illustrates an example system architecture 100, in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure, for independently providing a playback of a media item that includes a video portion and an audio portion.

- processing logic comprises hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device to perform hardware simulation), or a combination thereof.
- the methods of this disclosure are depicted and described as a series of acts. However, acts in accordance with this disclosure can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methods in accordance with the disclosed subject matter.
- method 200 may be performed by an application, such as the media player 112 or the media item playback manager 114, or a combination thereof, as further described in conjunction with Figure 1.
- method 200 begins at block 202 when processing logic receives a request to playback a media item having a video portion and an audio portion.
- the request can be received as user input, such as via a touch screen of a client device.
- the processing logic reserves one or more resources associated with the playback of the media item in response to the request.
- the one or more resources can be, for example, a memory, a buffer, a video decoder, network socket, or a video player.
- the processing logic receives the media item from one or more sources.
- the processing logic presents the media item, which can include providing a playback of the media item via a display of the client device.
- the processing logic receives a first message during the playback of the media item.
- the processing logic stops the playback of the video portion of the media item while continuing to provide the audio portion of the media item.
- the processing logic releases at least one of the one or more resources associated with the playback of the media item. For example, when releasing the at least one of the one or more resources, the processing logic can include at least one of:
- the processing logic receives a second message while providing the audio portion of the media item.
- the second message is an indication that an application executed by the processing logic has entered a foreground state on the client device.
- the processing logic reacquires the released resource(s).
- the processing logic resumes the playback of the video portion of the media item in synchronization with the audio portion being provided. In implementations, the processing logic resumes presentation of the video portion of the media item without interrupting the presentation of the audio portion.
- the processing logic presents the video portion initially at a first quality level or bitrate and when resuming the presentation of the video portion of the media item, the processing logic presents the video portion at a second quality level or bitrate.
- the second quality can be higher than the first quality due to improved network resources.
- Figure 3 illustrates two example timelines 302, 304 for providing efficient media application backgrounding on a client device, according to some implementations of the disclosure. Intervals and events are used to illustrate activities. Length or dimensions of the intervals are not indicative of a particular time or duration, nor are they indicative of any time or duration relative to each other. Any interval can be any amount or duration of time.
- an application on a client device plays both an audio portion and a video portion of a media item during interval 306.
- the application receives a first message and, in response to the message, stops playback of the video portion while continuing to playback the audio portion, as described herein.
- the application releases video resources and by the end of interval 312, the video resources are released.
- the application receives a second message.
- the application acquires video resources during interval 316. Once the video resources are acquired, the application can resume playback of the video portion of the media item while continuing to playback the audio portion during interval 306.
- the second example further includes a joining window 320 which is an allowable duration for the application to acquire video resources and to begin playing the video portion in synchronization with the audio portion.
- the duration of the joining window 320 can be a predetermined amount of time (e.g., five seconds).
- the duration of the joining window 320 can be dynamic and can depend on any variable pertaining to the media item.
- a duration of the joining window 320 can be a remaining duration of an audio data packet that is currently being played.
- the client device can render a prompt to indicate to a user that the video is loading, buffering, etc.
- the prompt can include a thumbnail, a spinner, a message, and the like.
- the prompt can be displayed until the video portion resumes.
- the client device can resume the video portion at a lower quality or bitrate for fast resume and can dynamically adjust the video quality or bitrate. If the video portion is not played or resumed within the joining window 320, then the application can pause the audio (e.g., for duration of interval 322) until the video portion is ready for playback.
