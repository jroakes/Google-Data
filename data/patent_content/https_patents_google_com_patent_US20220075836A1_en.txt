Abstract
Description
- Digital maps are widely used to provide information related to geographical regions of interest, including information about roads, traffic, buildings, landmarks, retail or grocery stores, and the like. Interactive maps often allow a user, for example, to access the digital map of a selected region to search for places, such as restaurants, local businesses, shops, theaters, etc. Where users do not have an exact address for the place they would like to search, they can search by name. However, sometimes a user may not be able to remember the name of a place, in addition to not knowing the address, which can create an obstacle for searching and require the user to try numerous other searches and look through many results.
- The present disclosure provides a system and method for searching for particular locations using contextual information that may be specific to a user.

FIG. 1 depicts a detailed block diagram of anexample computing device 100. Thecomputing device 100 may be any device that can perform a computational operation or computational analysis. Suitable examples of thecomputing device 100 include desktop computers, laptop computers, PDA, personal computer, tablets, portable devices, such as smart phones, mobile phones, wearable devices and the like. In one example, thecomputing device 100 utilized herein is a smart phone. However, thecomputing device 100 described herein is not limited in this regard. - In one example, the
computing device 100 has multiple components embedded therein. Each component may be in direct or indirect communication to each other. In the example depicted inFIG. 1 , thecomputing device 100 includes one ormore controllers 116 configured to be in electrical communication with a user interface 132, amemory 114, aGPS receiver circuitry 118, atransmitter circuitry 106 and areceiver circuitry 108. The one ormore controller 116 can be any suitable processors, such as a microprocessor. Alternatively, thecontroller 116 can be dedicated components such as an application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) or other hardware-based processor. Although not necessary, one or more ofcomputing devices 100 may include specialized hardware components to perform specific computing processes, such as geographic coordination reading, data retrieval and access, street image recognition, GPS related searches and positioning, geographic location encoding, etc. - An
antenna 102 may be disposed in thecomputing device 100 configured to receive and transmit Radio Frequency (RF) signals, WiFi signals, Bluetooth signals, GPS signals or any suitable electrical signals. A receive/transmit (Rx/Tx)switch 104 selectively couples theantenna 102 to thetransmitter circuitry 106 andreceiver circuitry 108. Thereceiver circuitry 108 demodulates and decodes the electrical signals received from anetwork 110 to derive information therefrom. Thenetwork 110 may be further communicated with adatabase server 112 so as to provide information requested or inquired by thecomputing device 100. Thenetwork 110 provides connectivity between thecomputing device 100 and thedatabase server 112. Thenetwork 110 may utilize standard communications protocols, such as internet, Ethernet, WiFi, satellite communications, HTTP and protocols that are proprietary to one or more companies, and various combinations of the foregoing. For example, thenetwork 110 may be wired or wireless local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), cellular communication network. Thedatabase server 112 may also be a computing device which also includes at least one processor, a receiver/transmitter, an interconnection interface and a memory that may store, send and/or generate information, data, software applications, map data, content, or interactive applications to thecomputing device 100. Thus, during operation, thedatabase server 112 may execute operations including receiving requests from thecomputing device 100, such as a device that a user is interacting with, through thenetwork 110. Subsequently, thedatabase server 112 may then process, respond and provide the requested content, interaction, map data, or information through thenetwork 110 to thecomputing device 100. - In one example, the
receiver circuitry 108 is coupled to thecontroller 116 via anelectrical connection 160. Thereceiver circuitry 108 provides the decoded electrical signals information to thecontroller 116. Thecontroller 116 also provides information to thetransmitter circuitry 106 for encoding and modulating information into electrical signals. Accordingly, thecontroller 116 is coupled to thetransmitter circuitry 106 via anelectrical connection 162. Thetransmitter circuitry 106 communicates the electrical signals to theantenna 102 for transmission to thedatabase server 112 through thenetwork 100. - In one example when the
computing device 100 includes a GPS-enabled implementation, anantenna 120 is coupled toGPS receiver circuitry 118 for receiving GPS signals. TheGPS receiver circuitry 118 demodulates and decodes the GPS signals to extract GPS location information therefrom. The GPS location information indicates the location of thecomputing device 100. TheGPS receiver circuitry 118 provides the decoded GPS location information to thecontroller 116. As such, theGPS receiver circuitry 118 is coupled to thecontroller 116 via anelectrical connection 164. It is noted that the present disclosure is not limited to GPS based methods for determining a location of thecomputing device 100. Other methods for determining a location of the computing device can be used herein. It is noted that when a GPS receiver circuitry is not utilized or present in thecomputing device 100, the receive/transmit (Rx/Tx)switch 104 along with thetransmitter circuitry 106 and thereceiver circuitry 108 may also function similar to the GPS receiver circuitry to provide the geographic information/location of thecomputing device 100. - In one example, the
controller 116 stores the decoded electrical signal information and the decoded GPS location information in thememory 114 of thecomputing device 100. Accordingly, thememory 114 is connected to and accessible by thecontroller 116 through anelectrical connection 166. Thememory 114 of thecomputing device 100 may store information accessible by the one or more of thecontrollers 116 or processors, such as includinginstructions 122 that can be executed by the one ormore controller 116. In one example, thememory 114 is a computer-readable storage medium comprising theinstructions 122, which are executable computer instructions, for performing operations or commands input to thecomputing device 100. Thememory 114 can also includeapplications 126 andsettings 130, which are settings of operations and communications among different servers or modules and so on, that can be retrieved, manipulated, processed, executed, interacted or stored by thecontroller 116. In one example, thememory 114 may be a volatile memory and/or a non-volatile memory or any non-transitory type capable of storing information accessible by the controller/processor, such as a hard-drive, memory card, RAM, DVD, CD-ROM, a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, write-capable and read-only memories. Thememory 114 can also have stored therein ofsoftware applications 126, for example, a map application that in communication with the map application, for implementing the methods of embodiments of the present disclosure that may be utilized in thecomputing device 100. - Various implementations may be utilized to provide geographic location information and semantic query configurations to be written into the
memory 114. Examples of different modules that may be stored in thememory 114 are further described below with reference toFIG. 2 . In one example, a user may directly provide information or a query by direct input to a user interface 132 on thecomputing device 100. Similarly, other methods of establishing the position or configurations of thecomputing device 100 may be employed. Thecomputing device 100 may be or may not be GPS-enabled or even include communication features such as provided byantenna switch 104, although theexample computing device 100 depicted inFIG. 1 would include these features. - In one example, the
software applications 126 stored in thememory 114 may include, but are not limited to, software applications operative to perform the various methods, features and functions described herein. Furthermore, thesettings 130 may also be configured or stored in thememory 114 that allow the user to repetitively use thesesettings 130 for a user customized preference when interacting with asemantic query engine 124 in thecontroller 116. For example, a user may formulate his/her semantic query and customize contextual information to be saved in thememory 114. Accordingly, such information may be saved for repetitive uses when needed. It is noted that thesettings 130 in thememory 114 may be in electrical communication with thesemantic query engine 124 configured in thecontroller 116, or referred as a processor, so as to enable the operation of thesettings 130 being performed in thesemantic query engine 124 by thecontroller 116 when needed. - As depicted in
FIG. 1 , one or more sets ofinstructions 122 may be stored, completely or partially, within thecontroller 116, and executed by thecomputing device 100. Alternatively, one or more of the instructions may be stored in theapplications 126 or other modules in thememory 114. In this regard, thememory 114 and thecontroller 116 can constitute machine-readable media. The term “machine-readable media”, as used here, refers to a single non-transient medium or multiple non-transient media that store the one or more sets ofinstructions 122. The term “machine-readable media”, as used here, also refers to any medium configured to store, encode or carry the set ofinstructions 122 for execution by thecomputing device 100 and that cause thecomputing device 100 to perform one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure. - The
semantic query engine 124 may be configured in thecontroller 116 that allows users to input semantic query in thecomputing device 100. Thesemantic query engine 124 may receive and process semantic queries from the user in a natural language form. The semantic query may be analyzed, processed or mapped by the modules set in thememory 114. For example, the semantic query may include a personal specific context, such as by referring to a place the user had been at a previous event, a place to which the user has plans to go, a place the user passes on a traveled route, a place that the user's friend said they went, etc. That context may be analyzed, compared and/or mapped by the modules set in thememory 114 to identify particular events or activities associated with the user that fits the semantic query input from the user. For example, a query such as “the Cuban restaurant I pass on my way to work” may be analyzed and compared to stored map/navigation information regarding the user's work location or the roads taken, and to identify any Cuban restaurants along that route. Thesemantic query engine 124 communicates with thesoftware applications 126 andsettings 130 in thememory 114, and/or from thedatabase servers 112. In one example, thedatabase servers 112 include at least amap application 204 and auser profile storage 202 saved in amemory 165 in thedatabase servers 112, which will be described in greater detail with reference toFIG. 3 . Thememory 165 may be similar to thememory 114, configured to store data and information, such as the digital map with street view, two-dimensional view, three-dimensional view, or the like. At least oneprocessor 167, similar to thecontroller 116, may be utilized in thedatabase servers 112 configured to execute instructions from thememory 165. - The
map application 204 may include geographic information, such as the digital map with street view, two-dimensional view, three-dimensional view, or the like, that may be explorable and searchable by the user. Themap application 204 may be periodically updated by a map provider or by the user. Theuser profile storage 202 may be similar to the user profile and/or privacy module 224 in thememory 114, as shown inFIG. 2 . When authorized by the user, theuser profile storage 202 may store information specific to the user, such as preferences, routines, or the like so as to provide customized information to the user. Any personally identifiable information is scrubbed or encrypted or otherwise protected to protect the user's identity and privacy. Accessing the data associated with the user will also require authorization from the user. In one example, the user may adjust a privacy setting to allow the computing device to access the personal information. - The
processor 167, similar to thecontroller 116, may be utilized in thedatabase servers 112 configured to execute command and instructions from thedatacenter 214 and/or thememory 165. Aclient 219, such as a customer, a consumer, an end user and the like, may access and interact with thedatabase server 112 through one or more of thecomputing devices 100 - As illustrated in
FIG. 1 , components of thesemantic query engine 124 may be executed on thecomputing device 100. In some implementations, one or more components of thesemantic query engine 124 may be executed on thedatabase server 112. - The
controller 116 is also connected to the user interface 132. The user interface 132 includesinput devices 134,output devices 136, and software routines or other user interface (not shown inFIG. 1 ) configured to allow a user to interact with and control thesoftware applications 126 and theinstruction 122 installed on thecomputing device 100. In one example, thesoftware applications 126 may, for example, provide for the use of other positioning technologies in addition to or instead of GPS, such as, but not limited to other satellite-based positioning systems or other techniques such as IP geolocation, or the like. Such input andoutput devices display screen 150, aspeaker 152, akeypad 142, amicrophone 144, atouch screen 140, a haptic output 154 and so on. It is noted that thedisplay screen 150 and thetouch screen 140 as described herein may refer to the same object to provide multiple functionalities. For example, thedisplay screen 150 may not only display content but also provides a touch-activated interface, referred to as atouch screen 140, that allows the user to input commands and to actively interact therewith. The input andoutput devices - In one example, the user may input audio or textual semantic query through the
input devices 134, such as themicrophone 144 of the user interface 132. Audio input may be converted into textual information by thecontroller 116 for analysis. Identifiers from the semantic query may be selected and analyzed by thecontroller 116. The identifiers may be associated with information saved in thememory 114 in thecomputing device 100 or in thememory 165 in thedatabase servers 112. Such information may include, for example, calendar events, messages, social media posts, navigation history, and the like. Such information may be used to identify one or more results responsive to the user's query. For example, a calendar entry titled “Tom's birthday party” may include the name and/or address of a pub, which may be returned in response to a semantic query of “the place where we went for Tom's birthday.” In some examples, the information may be used to search for additional information. For example, a calendar entry that only included the name of the pub may be used to search the web for the address, operating hours, an image, reviews, etc. associated with the pub. It is noted that other user interface platforms, such as personal assistance applications, social media applications, or photo viewing applications or the like, may be utilized for semantic query input. -
FIG. 2 depicts a block diagram of thememory 114 ofFIG. 1 according to aspects of the disclosure. Several modules may be included in thesettings 130 orsoftware applications 126 in thememory 114. The modules included in thesettings 130 of thememory 114 are executable components. In the example depicted inFIG. 2 , thesettings 130 include a naturallanguage processing module 201, acontext analysis module 203, aphoto module 206, acalendar module 208, amap module 210, amessage module 212, acontact module 214, anemail module 216, arecommendation module 218, anevent module 220, asocial media module 222, a user profile and/or privacy module 224 andother modules 226. It should be understood that these are merely examples, and that the semantic query processing may be performed with fewer or different or additional modules. It is noted that the modules in thememory 114 may also be configured in thememory 165 in thedatabase servers 112 so that thecontroller 116 of thecomputing device 100 may retrieve the information therefrom through thenetwork 110. - In some examples, the natural
language processing module 201, when executed by thecontroller 116 or processor in thecomputing device 100, causes thecontroller 116 to process the semantic query in natural language form. The natural language as input by the user is processed by the naturallanguage processing module 201 and output to thecontext analysis module 203 for analysis. Thecontext analysis module 203, when executed by thecontroller 116 or processor in thecomputing device 100, causes thecontroller 116 to process the text to identify, extract or analyze the contextual information. For example, thecontroller 116 or processor may search for parameters or semantic identifiers that refer to user specific activities, timeline, or the like. Parameters may include, for example, location, time value, persons, activity or event types and the like. Semantic identifiers may include specific key words that fit such parameters, such as proper names, dates, event titles, etc. For example, the semantic query input by the user, such as “where is the restaurant I ate at on my last birthday”, may be analyzed to identify the parameters and semantic identifiers “I”, “restaurant” and/or “last birthday” so as to conduct a search related to a past event associated with the user on or near a date saved in memory as the user's birthday. - The
photo module 206, when executed by thecontroller 116 or the processor in thecomputing device 100, causes thecontroller 116 to process a photo album saved in the memory for photo information retrieval. Thecalendar module 208, when executed by thecontroller 116 or processor in thecomputing device 100, causes thecontroller 116 to search and select a timestamp when the associated search parameters fit the semantic query. The access or gathering of the data from thephoto module 206 and/orcalendar module 208 will require authorization from the user. For example, the user may adjust a privacy setting to allow the computing device to access the personal information. - The
map module 210, when executed by thecontroller 116 or the processor in thecomputing device 100, causes thecontroller 116 to determine a location of thecomputing device 100 or the location where the past or future event associated with the semantic query occurred. Themap module 210 may provide geographic information in a digital map and output the query results from the semantic query input by the user in the digital map. In some examples, themap module 210 may utilize a GPS feature, such as theGPS circuitry 118 ofFIG. 1 , to identify the locations or places associated with the events and/or the user. Such event information, including the events, timelines and/or places, may then be output in a presentation module, such as thedisplay screen 150 in thecomputing device 100. It is noted that the event information may be output in a digital map, in a photo album from thephoto module 206 and/or other service applications utilized in thecomputing device 100. - The
contact module 214 causes thecontroller 116 to provide contact information saved by the user to be output in thecomputing device 100. Theemail module 216 causes thecontroller 116 to access the email database in theemail module 216 associated with the user saved in thecomputing device 100. The access or gathering of the data from thecontact module 214 will require authorization from the user. For example, the user may adjust a privacy setting to allow the computing device to access the personal information. Therecommendation module 218 causes thecontroller 116 to provide relevance of a user's activity associated with the user's query and compute a recommendation score that may rank a closeness of correlation of each of the corresponding query results to the semantic query. - The
event module 220 causes thecontroller 116 to provide information of the prior or future activities associated with the user saved in thecomputing device 100. Thesocial media module 222 causes thecontroller 116 to access the applications or information from the social media database that may identify the user's social acquaintance, activities, locations, timestamps, or the like. The user profile and/or privacy module 224 causes thecontroller 116 to access a user specific profile that includes user's habits, preferences, or behaviors so as to provide customized information to the user based on the individual's needs. The access or gathering of the data associated with the users will require authorization from the user. For example, the user may adjust a privacy setting to allow the computing device to access the personal information. -
FIG. 3 is a pictorial diagram illustrating example communications between thecomputing device 100 and thedatabase server 122 vianetwork 110. As discussed above, thedatabase server 112 may include at least themap application 204 and also theuser profile storage 202 saved in amemory 165 in thedatabase servers 112. As shown in this example, any number ofclient computing devices database server 112 in performing semantic queries. The client device may be adesktop computer 100 a, alaptop 100 b, aportable device 100 c, atablet 100 d, or any other device capable of communication over a network and performing computational operations. -
FIG. 4A illustrates an example of determining a confidence value for a natural language input. During operation, a user may input a semantic query in a natural language form in thecomputing device 100. Once received, thecontext analysis module 203 may analyze the input and identify key terms and phrases, such as by utilizing the settings from the naturallanguage processing module 202. For example, when a semantic query “Navigate to the restaurant we go to with Victor for work dinners” is input, as depicted inFIG. 4A , the naturallanguage processing module 202 and/or thecontext analysis module 203 may analyze the user specific information from the semantic query to further define the user intent. The naturallanguage processing module 202 and/or thecontext analysis module 203 may be able to determine and understand the semantic identifiers, such as “restaurant”, “Victor” and “work dinner”, as shown in thecircles FIG. 4A , by semantic interpretation. - In order to determine relevance of a piece of text to a place visited, a signal of a level of confidence may be determined. Text extraction confidence and a place correlation confidence may be used to determine the level of confidence. For example, a
term extraction confidence 410 of certain terms and/or semantic identifiers, such as “restaurant”, Victor” and/or “work dinner” are generated. Theextraction confidence 410 indicates the confidence level that the correct information that has been derived from the text. According to some examples, theextraction confidence 410 may be used to determine aninput string confidence 412 for the input string, such as by combining multiple term extraction confidence values. - In addition to the extraction confidence, a place correlation confidence may also be determined. The place correlation confidence may indicate how closely a piece of text corresponds to a particular place visited. For example, the term “work dinner” extracted from the text would give an indication that there is or was a work dinner, but specific location is not provided. Thus, based on the GPS information or other relevant information, one or more possible candidate visited places may be searched and found. These possible candidate visited places may be scored in terms of how well they match the type of place, such as the relevance of a work dinner to a visited location of a restaurant, a cafeteria, or a food stand.
- It is noted that other computational approaches may be utilized to determine the extraction confidence, the place correlation confidence and other levels of confidence. For example, the confidence levels may be determined using one or more neural networks that compute embeddings. The one or more neural networks may then estimate how likely the query corresponds to the place through a distance function, such as cosine similarity, of the embeddings on the neural networks. This approach may be trained, configured or learned offline and utilized at runtime.
- The extracted identifiers may be used to access data in the computing device and to identify information corresponding to the query. For example, in one example depicted in
FIG. 4B , when accessing the data in the computing device, acalendar event 420 from thecalendar module 208 may be identified based on the terms and/or semantic identifiers, such as “restaurant”, “Victor” and/or “work dinner,” from the semantic query. Thecalendar event 420 may include information of awork dinner 421 at alocation 422 of a “restaurant” indicating where the “work dinner” occurred. In this example, another term and/or semantic identifier “Victor” 423 is also found in thecalendar event 420, thus the level of place correlation confidence and/or event correlation confidence may be relatively high. Thus, a high recommendation score may be generated based on the high level of place correlation confidence. - It is noted that the information and the accessed data from the calendar event or other relevant event sources may be cached. For example, a minimal representation of the place may be extracted through a batch job that correlates the user specific information from different sources to the place. The correlation could be made readily available at runtime. By doing so, a query or look-up to the calendar event or other event sources may be eliminated.
- As another example, illustrated in
FIG. 4C , aphoto 424 from aphoto module 206 may be identified based on the extracted terms. Thephoto 424 may have a high level of correlation with the semantic query. An image recognition technique may be utilized to identify and extract information of the scene, venues, or people from the image of thephoto 424. For example, the image recognition technique may extract and recognize from the image in thephoto 424 including a friend “Victor” having a meal with the user. Image recognition may also identify attributes in the background which may indicate that the photo was taken at a particular location, such as a sign indicating “Casey's Restaurant.” Image recognition models may be trained to detect certain features, such as text, objects, places, etc. Such detection is often performed by machine learning and may include deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and/or recurrent neural networks (RNN). Alternatively or additionally, metadata for thephoto 424 may be compared with the extracted search terms. For example, timestamps, image tags, image capture location, or other types of metadata may be stored in association with thephoto 424. Such metadata may be analyzed to determine a result responsive to the input query. For example, the extracted term “Victor” may be identified in the metadata, and the timestamp may correspond to a time people commonly eat dinner. Thus, thephoto 424 may be identified as being taken at the location the user is referring to in the semantic query. Therefore, other information in the metadata, such as the image capture location, may be used to generate a search result. - According to some examples, the query results with the recommendation scores may be output to allow the user to select, accept or deny recommended results.
- In some examples, an order in which the data is accessed by the
computing device 100 may be configured such that some types of data have a higher priority, that data is accessed in a predetermined order, etc. For example, access of data from thecalendar module 208 may weigh higher than access of data from themessage module 212. In some examples, the order and/or priority of the data access may be configured or set based on the type of request, the preference or personal habits of the user, or other factors. For example, configuring the order of data access based on user specific activities or routines may improve the accuracy of the query results to best fit the user's intent. For example, when a user prefers using text messages more often than a calendar to set his/her personal affairs, data access from themessage module 212 may be set to weigh higher than the data from thecalendar module 208. - After the query results are obtained and populated in the computing device, the user may select an intended and/or target query result that best fits his/her search intent. Such selected query result may then be saved in the user profile and privacy module 224, as shown in
FIG. 2 , or theuser profile storage 202 of thedatabase server 112, as shown inFIG. 1 . When sufficient information regarding the user's selection and preference is detected or saved, a user pattern, user habit, or user routine may be established and built in the computing device, or by a machine learning algorithm, so as to provide customized and specific information that is particularly useful to the user as needed. For example, a user may prefer to purchase his/her morning coffee at a coffee shop on a road with less traffic to his/her workplace, rather than at a coffee shop on a busy street. Thus, such user habit or pattern may be set and saved in the computing device to facilitate user's utilization of the computing device. In one example, when the user inputs “navigate to the morning coffee shop I go to on the way to work,” a query result may be populated based on the user's preference or pattern setting to meet the user's intended search. The information and/or query results as saved may be associated with user's preference or habits, including “favorite” restaurants, events, “anniversary” routines, “commute” preference, “work” activities, “family” “birthdays”, and the like, utilizing proper semantic identifiers as an index for machine learning and user specific database establishment. -
FIG. 5A-5D depict an example of a semantic query input in a map application configured in thecomputing device 100. In the example depicted inFIG. 5A , a semantic query “Navigate to the restaurant we go to with Victor for work dinners” is input in asearch box 502 in adigital map 504 in thecomputing device 100. The semantic query may be input in a natural language form using text, audio, or the like. Thedigital map 504 ofFIG. 5A is depicted in map view with the structures, buildings, infrastructures shown in a top two-dimensional view. - After the semantic query is input in the
digital map 504 in thecomputing device 100, a computational algorithm is performed in response to the semantic query. One or more query results 510, 514, 516 may then be populated in thedigital map 504 with a corresponding event location displayed in the digital map, as shown inFIG. 5B , for user's exploration and review. Ashow list icon 506 may also be generated in thedigital map 504. When the user interacts with theicon 506, the query results 510, 514, 516 may be listed as a break-down list 522 in a textual form, as further depicted inFIG. 5C . The user may select one of the query results 510, 514, 516 that best fits his/her searching intent so that thecomputing device 100 may provide navigation in thedigital map 504 to the user for travel to the intended destination. - According to some examples, the break-
down list 522, as depicted inFIG. 5C , further itemizes each of the query results 510, 514, 516 with recommendation scores or other related information so as to assist the user selecting an intended query result. For example, the firsttextual query result 520, which may include detailed textual information corresponding to themap query result 510 depicted inFIG. 5B , further depicts the recommendation score and other associated information so as to assist the user determining an accurate query result that fits his/her intended search. In the example depicted inFIG. 5C , the firsttextual query result 520 provides a relatively high recommendation score of 99 with other information associated with the semantic query. For example, the person visited with is listed as “Victor” which matches the semantic query input by the user. The event is also categorized as “work dinner” which also matches the semantic query. Other associated information, such as times of visits, timestamps, and the like, may also be provided so as to help the user determine the search result that fits his/her search intent. - In some examples, the one or more query results may be populated along with an event photo, event video, or other relevant information. For example, the
query result 520 may be displayed alongside a picture of the user and Victor at the place. - According to further examples, the first
textual query result 520 may be shown in thedigital map 504 by interacting with thequery result 510, as depicted inFIG. 5D , without population of the break-down list 522. All query results 510, 514, 516 shown in thedigital map 504 are selectable to further populate the recommendation scores or other associated information. - By computationally analyzing multiple correlations and factors, an overall high confidence level of the search results may be generated to provide a relatively accurate query result list that fits the user's intended search. Furthermore, the recommendation score is also generated based on the evaluation of the overall confidence level including correlations of the multiple factors, such as location, event and timestamps. As such, a recommendation score with a relatively high confidence level may be obtained. Thus, a delightful user experience may be obtained based on the accurate query results utilized and depicted in the
digital map 504 of thecomputing device 100. -
FIG. 6 depicts a flow diagram illustrating anexample method 600 of performing a semantic query. Such method may be performed by operations utilizing acomputing device 100, such as thecomputing device - It should be understood that the operations involved in the following methods need not be performed in the precise order described. Rather, various operations may be handled in a different order or simultaneously, and operations may be added or omitted.
- In
block 602, a semantic query may be received by thecomputing device 100. The semantic query may be input by a user of thecomputing device 100. In one example, the semantic query may refer to user specific context associated with the user regarding certain historical or future events. In one example, the semantic query is input to a digital map of a map application launched in thecomputing device 100. - In
block 604, based on the semantic query, data related to the user is accessed to perform a search in response to the semantic query. For example, calendar entries, photos, videos, messages, and other content and associated metadata may be accessed. The associated metadata may include timestamps, location information, image recognition information, etc. - In
block 606, information in the accessed data that correlates with the user specific context is identified. The information may include, for example, location information, time, proper names of people or places, etc. - In
block 608, based on the identified information, one or more query results may be determined by the computing device. For example, all places potentially matching the semantic query may be determined using the identified information. Moreover, the places may be ranked based on how closely they match the query. - In
block 610, the query results are provided in response to the query. For example, the query results may be populated in a digital map. - In
block 612, based on the query results, a recommendation score indicative of the correlation of each query result related to the identified information may be provided in the computing device. Accordingly, the user may select a query result that best matches his/her query intent. In some examples, the user may initiate further actions based on a selected query result. For example, the user may interact with a particular query result to initiate navigation to the place, to call the place, to visit the website of the place, etc. - The present disclosure provides a computing device for providing search results to users based on semantic queries from the users. The semantic queries may be input in a natural language form and interpreted by the computing device. The semantic queries may include user specific context. In this regard, the user may utilize the computing device to recall certain personal specific information previously processed in the computing device and output such information in the computing device with a recommendation score indicative of a confidence level of correlation of the query results.
