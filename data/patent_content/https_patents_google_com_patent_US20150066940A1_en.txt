Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to providing relevant online content.
- Online content may be available regarding any number of disparate topics. For example, a first website on the Internet may be devoted to the migratory habits of bats and a second website may be devoted to automotive repair.
- a user must proactively seek out online content of interest to the user. For example, an Internet user may utilize a search engine to search for webpages devoted to automotive repair. The user may then navigate between the webpages in the search results until the user finds the webpage that most closely matches the user's interests.
- One implementation is a computerized method for selecting content for a user identifier.
- the method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, data indicative of an online action associated with the user identifier.
- the method also includes identifying, by the processing circuit, a topic associated with the online action.
- the method further includes determining, by the processing circuit, an opinion regarding the topic based on the online action.
- the method also includes generating, by the processing circuit, a strength score for the topic based in part on the opinion.
- the method yet further includes selecting content for the user identifier based in part on whether the content corresponds to the topic and further based in part on the strength score for the topic.
- Another implementation is a system for selecting content for a user identifier.
- the system includes a processing circuit operable to receive data indicative of an online action associated with the user identifier.
- the processing circuit is also operable to identify a topic associated with the online action and to determine an opinion regarding the topic based on the online action.
- the processing circuit is further operable to generate a strength score for the topic based in part on the opinion.
- the processing circuit is also operable to select content for the user identifier based in part on whether the content corresponds to the topic and further based in part on the strength score for the topic.
- a further implementation is a computer-readable storage medium having machine instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations.
- the operations include receiving data indicative of text associated with a user identifier and performing text analysis on the text to identify a topic keyword and a disposition keyword in the text.
- the operations also include determining a weighting value based on the disposition keyword and generating a strength score for the topic based in part on the weighting value.
- the operations further include selecting an advertisement for the user identifier based in part on whether the advertisement corresponds to the topic and further based in part on the strength score for the topic.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an electronic display showing an example webpage having third-party content
- FIG. 3 is an example illustration of a third-party content being included on a webpage
- FIG. 4 is an example illustration of an electronic display showing an example webpage allowing users to express their online opinions
- FIG. 5 is an example process for selecting relevant content
- FIG. 6 is an example illustration of an expressed opinion being used to select relevant content.
- a user may opt in to receiving content that may be of interest to the user.
- a user may allow certain information about the user's online behavior to be stored and analyzed, to determine topics that may be of interest to the user. For example, history data regarding webpages visited by the user, comments or other content uploaded by a user, and other online actions may be analyzed to determine topics of interest to the user.
- the user may be provided with an opportunity to control which programs or features collect such information, the types of information that may be collected (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), and/or how third-party content may be selected by a content selection service and presented to the user.
- Certain data such as a user identifier, may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters) used by the content selection service to select third-party content.
- a user identifier may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information about its corresponding user can be determined from it.
- a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined.
- location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content selection service.
- an interest of a user may be identified by analyzing the online opinions expressed by the user about a particular topic. For example, golf may be identified as an interest of a user that favorably rates a set of golf clubs.
- a user may express an online opinion in any number of different ways.
- text written by a user may be analyzed to identify a user's interests. For example, an online article, blog entry, comment, or similar text from the user may be analyzed to discern the user's interests.
- a user's interactions via a social networking system may be analyzed to identify potential interests of the user, if the user so allows.
- a social networking system refers to any computerized platform that allows a user to create a profile and associate the profile with that of other users whom the user deems as social connections. For example, a user may associate her profile with that of her friends, family, co-workers, classmates, or the like. Actions performed by the user within the social networking system may also be analyzed to identify the user's interests. For example, groups joined by the user, content recommended by the user to other users, ratings provided by the user, and similar actions may be analyzed to identify the interests of the user. In some implementations, the user may elect not to allow actions regarding certain social networking groups to be analyzed (e.g., the user may allow an opinion expressed in a public group to be analyzed, while keeping opinions expressed in other groups to remain unanalyzed for purposes of selecting content).
- a website owner may participate in an advertising or other content selection network, in some implementations. Participating in an such a network may allow any number of different forms of third-party content to be presented with a webpage of the website.
- the webpage may be modified to cause a user's device to retrieve content from a server of the content network (e.g., from a different source than that of the website).
- the retrieved third-party content may then be displayed as being part of the webpage or in conjunction with the display of the webpage (e.g., in another browser tab, in a pop-up window, etc.).
- an advertisement may be retrieved and displayed when the webpage is loaded.
- Different third-party content may be selected by the server of the content network.
- the webpage may display a first advertisement to a first user and a second advertisement to a second user.
- a first advertisement to a first user
- a second advertisement to a second user.
- different advertisers can place different advertisements on a particular webpage, without the website operator having to modify the code of the webpage each time a new advertisement is to be displayed.
- third-party content provided by a content network may be selected based on whether the third-party content is deemed to be relevant to a particular user identifier.
- the selection of third-party content may take into account a user identifier. For example, a user identifier associated with visiting a website of an online retailer may be associated with an interest in knowing when the retailer is running a sale. The user identifier may then be used to select an advertisement for such a sale, regardless of the content of the webpage being visited by the user identifier. For example, assume that a user identifier is used to visit the website of an online retailer of golf clubs and then later used to visit a webpage devoted to finance.
- the user identifier may be associated with an interest in golf, based on the visit to the retailer's website.
- an advertisement for a sale on golf clubs may be provided to the client device, even though the financial webpage is unrelated to golf.

- content selection server 104 may use client identifier 310 to identify an interest category for a user identifier.
- content selection server 104 may be configured to run an advertisement auction in which advertisers compete to provide an advertisement on the requested webpage. For example, if travel is an identified interest category for the user identifier, an advertiser that sells airline tickets may bid in such an auction to advertise to the user identifier.
- client 102 may display third-party content 312 with the retrieved webpage on electronic display 116 .
- content selection server 104 may instead select third-party content already stored on client 102 and provide an indication of the selection to client 102 .
- client 102 may retrieve the pre-stored third-party content from memory 114 and display the advertisement with the displayed webpage.
- content selection server 104 may be configured to identify one or more interest categories based in part on online opinions associated with a user identifier.
- an online opinion refers to any online indication of a user's disposition towards a certain topic or set of topics. For example, a user may positively rate an article devoted to Judo or share the article with one or more of his friends. These actions may be treated as the user expressing a positive opinion about the sport of Judo.
- the user may express an opinion textually (e.g., via a public status feed, online article, comment, instant message, or the like). In such a case, the text may be analyzed to identify one or more topics and the user's disposition towards the topics.
- some or all of the interests may be identified by another entity and provided to content selection server 104 .
- a social networking system may identify one or more interest categories for a user identifier and provide data regarding these interest categories to content selection server 104 . Such identified interests may then be used by content selection server 104 to select relevant third-party content for client 102 .

- a user identifier may be associated with an interest category relating to automobiles, products from the Quartz Motor Company, and/or a particular product, such as the Armadillo, based on comment 422 being positively rated.
- the strength of an opinion may also be assessed.
- a user that positively rates a comment about the Armadillo may not feel as strongly about the product than if the user shared image 436 with a friend.
- text analysis or image recognition may be employed to identify topics of webpage 406 on which a user opined.
- image recognition may be used on image 436 to identify that the image is of an automobile.
- process 500 enables relevant content to be selected, based on one or more online opinions associated with a user identifier.
- Process 500 may be implemented by any number of computing devices.
- process 500 may be implemented by a content selection server, such as content selection server 104 shown in FIG. 1 .
- process 500 may be implemented by a content selection server working in conjunction with one or more content sources (e.g., a social networking server, another web server, etc.).
- content sources e.g., a social networking server, another web server, etc.
- Process 500 may include receiving an indication of an online action associated with a user identifier (block 502 ).
- an online action refers to any action performed by a user operating a client device that causes data to be transmitted from the device to one or more servers via a network.
- Example actions include sending text (e.g., an online article, a comment, an email, an instant message, etc.), uploading a file (e.g., an image, video, etc.) to the server, rating online content, sharing online content, and joining a social networking group.
- An indication of such actions may include, but is not limited to, input data received via a user interface device corresponding to a request to perform the action, data associated with performing the action (e.g., text data corresponding to an online comment, an image to be shared with a social connection, etc.), confirmation data that the action has been performed, or the like.
- Process 500 may include identifying one or more topics associated with the action (block 504 ).
- a topic may be a single category or may be part of a hierarchy of topics.
- the topic of baseball may be a stand-alone topic category or may be part of a hierarchy of topics, such as Entertainment>Sports>Baseball, where baseball is a sub-category of the topic of sports.
- text analysis and/or image recognition may be used to determine a topic associated with the online action.
- text analysis may be used to determine a topic within the text of a webpage visited by the user identifier or within entered text (e.g., within an instant message, comment, email, uploaded text document, etc.).
- a statistical measure of the frequency of a term within a body of text may be used to determine a topic of the text. For example, a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) score may be assigned to words within a body of text and used to determine whether the text pertains to a certain topic.
- image recognition may be used to identify a topic of a digital image (e.g., an image on a webpage visited by the user identifier, an image shared with a social connection, an uploaded image, etc.). For example, an uploaded image of an automobile may be analyzed using image recognition to identify the topic of automobiles. In some cases, the image recognition may employ facial recognition.
- a topic may be self-reported by a webpage.
- a topic of a webpage may be explicitly identified within a meta tag of a webpage, identified as part of an advertisement request, or using a similar mechanism.
- Process 500 may include determining an opinion regarding an identified topic (block 506 ).
- an opinion regarding a topic may be positive or negative.
- the opinion regarding a topic may be determined based solely on the type of online action. For example, joining a social networking group, rating up online content, or sharing online content may correspond with a positive opinion of a topic. In another example, leaving a social networking group or rating down online content may correspond with a negative opinion of a topic.
- text analysis may be used to identify one or more disposition words within text (e.g., within the text of a webpage, within text entered by the user, etc.). For example, the words “like,” “love,” “hate,” “dislike,” etc.
- the opinion may be determined using both identified text words and the online action. For example, a user may join a social networking group devoted to protesting a certain corporation. In such a case, text associated with the group may be analyzed to determine that the user has a positive opinion of the networking group itself, but a negative opinion of the corporation. In further implementations, a textual opinion posted without the user logging into a profile may also be analyzed. For example, a user may post an online comment without logging into a profile. In such a case, the comment may still be associated with a user identifier, such as a cookie, and analyzed to determine an opinion.
- a user identifier such as a cookie
- Process 500 may include determining the strength of an opinion (block 508 ).
- the strength of how positively or negatively a user views a topic may be determined. For example, a user may be weakly interested in baseball and strongly interested in bowling.
- the strength of an opinion regarding a topic may be determined based on the type of online action from which the opinion is determined.
- a weighting may be applied to different action types to denote the strength of the opinion. For example, the following weights may be applied to different types of actions:
- w sharing is a weight for sharing content with another user
- w commenting is a weight for commenting on a topic
- w joining is a weight for joining a social networking group devoted to a topic
- w rating is a weight for rating content associated with a topic.
- a user that feels strongly about a particular topic may share content related to the topic with other users, such as the user's social connections.
- a user that only positively rates content related to the topic may have only a weak opinion regarding the topic.
- action weights may have positive or negative values, based on whether the user has a positive or negative opinion regarding the topic. Action weights may also be ordered in any number of different ways and may include weights for any number of different types of actions.
- word weights may be applied to potential words within the text. For example, words such as “love” or “hate” regarding a particular topic may receive higher weights than that of the words “like” or “dislike.”
- an action weight may be combined a word weight to produce an overall weight for the opinion.
- a user posts a comment about a topic that includes the word “love.”
- an action weight, w commenting may be adjusted upward.
- the user joins a social networking group named, “People that hate the new Armadillo.” Since the word “hate” is used, an action weight, w joining may be adjusted to be even more negative regarding the topic of the group.
- an overall opinion may be determined by analyzing any number of different online actions regarding a particular topic.
- a strength score may be determined by aggregating the various action and/or word weights regarding the topic.
- S topic may be determined by analyzing n number of actions regarding the topic as follows:
- weight action (i) is the action weight for the ith online action performed regarding the topic. For example, a user may post ten comments regarding a topic, join two social networking groups regarding the topic, and share an article about the topic with a social connection. In such a case, different actions may be analyzed to determine a strength score for the user's opening regarding the topic.
- Process 500 may include selecting content for the user identifier based on the opinion (block 510 ).
- an advertisement may be selected based on a user identifier being associated with a positive opinion of a topic. For example, an opinion of golf may be determined to be highly positive. In such a case, an advertisement from an online retailer of golf equipment may be selected to be provided to the user identifier (e.g., in response to receiving a third-party content request or the like). Such an advertisement may be provided as part of a webpage devoted to the topic or may be provided as part of an unrelated webpage. For example, assume that the user identifier is associated with a strongly positive opinion of golf and later associated with a visit to a webpage related to the latest weather forecast.
- a golf-related advertisement may be selected to be displayed in conjunction with the weather-related webpage.
- an identified opinion may be used to select or recommend other forms of content to the user identifier.
- the latest scores for a golf tournament may be provided automatically (e.g., without further user action) to a user identifier associated with a strong interest in golf.
- comment 434 posted by user 420 to webpage 406 in FIG. 4 may be analyzed to determine an opinion of the user regarding a particular topic. If the user's opening is favorable to the topic, the user's opinion may then be used to generate a set of one or more topics that may be of interest to the user. Content, such as an advertisement 614 , may also be selected based on an identified interest of user 420 .
- user 420 may be associated with a user identifier 606 .
- User identifier 606 may be any form of unique data usable by the system to represent user 420 .
- User identifier 606 may be, for example, a client identifier, a unique identifier associated with one or more client identifiers, and/or login data for a social networking service.
- user identifier 606 may include a screen name/password for user 420 , one or more client identifiers for devices operated by user 420 , biometric data for user 420 , or similar data usable to attribute a particular online action to a specific user identifier.
- the action may include such identification information to associate the action with user identifier 606 .
- user 420 may be represented in the system by user identifier 606 and may post comment 434 . Comment 434 may then be associated by the system with user identifier 606 .
- Comment 434 may be textually analyzed to determine one or more topics present within the text.
- the text of comment 434 may be parsed by a server to identify various keywords in the text. Such keywords may be matched to defined topical categories, to determine that comment 434 relates to a particular topic.
- the text of comment 434 may be analyzed to identify keyword 602 , “Armadillo,” a particular model of automobile.
- Keyword 602 may be itself by a topic of interest or may be mapped to a topic 608 .
- “Armadillo” may itself be an identified topic or may be mapped to the topic category of Vehicles>Automobile.
- keyword 602 may be used to identify a number of topic categories within a hierarchy.
- topic 608 may be the top category of “Vehicles,” the sub-category of “Automobiles,” or a combination of topics along a hierarchy.
- a strength score 610 may be determined for topic 608 based on the type of performed action (e.g., posting comment 434 ) and/or based on the strength of the language within comment 434 .
- strength score 610 may be determined based on a weighting value associated with the action of posting a comment. In some implementations, such a weighting value may also based on the words within comment 434 .
- a disposition keyword 604 may be identified in comment 434 . Keyword 604 may be used to determine the user's opinion regarding topic 608 and/or the strength of the opinion. For example, the word “love” may indicate that the user has a strongly positive opinion of topic 608 .
- a weighting value corresponding to a user posting a strongly positive comment about topic 608 may be used to determine strength score 610 or may itself be used as strength score 610 .
- strength score 610 may be based on any number of actions regarding topic 608 (e.g., joining a social networking group related to topic 608 , rating up content related to topic 608 , etc.).
- one or more identified interests 612 may be determined for user identifier 606 .
- Identified interests 612 may include, for example, topics in which user 420 views positively. Online actions associated with user identifier 606 may be analyzed to identify any number of topics and to determine strength scores for those topics. For example, strength score 610 may indicate that user 420 views topic 608 highly favorably. In such a case, topic 608 may be included in identified interests 612 .
- a limit may be imposed on the number of topics included in identified interests 612 . Therefore, which topics are included in identified interests 612 may also be based on their corresponding strength scores. In other words, only the topics in which user 420 views most favorably may be included in identified interests 612 . For example, identified interests 612 may include the top five or fewer topics that user 420 views most favorably.
- Identified interests 612 may be used to select advertisement 614 , according to various implementations.
- a content request from a client device operated by user 420 may be sent to a content selection server.
- a request may include a client identifier or other form of data used by the server to determine that the request is associated with user identifier 606 .
- the content selection server may select content 614 based in part on whether the content is related to a topic in identified interests 612 .
- the content selection server may conduct an advertisement auction in which different advertisers compete to provide relevant advertisements to user 420 . In such a case, the advertisers may specify which user interest categories in which they wish to bid.
- an online retailer of golf equipment may opt to bid in advertisement auctions involving user identifiers associated with an interest category of golf.
- the content selection server may select content 614 based on identified interests 612 and without first receiving a content request (i.e., the content selection server may “push” content 614 to a client device associated with user identifier 606 ).

Abstract
Systems and methods for providing relevant online content may include evaluating an action performed by a user identifier to determine the user's opinion regarding a topic. Content related to the topic may be selected and provided to an electronic device associated with the user identifier.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to providing relevant online content.
- Online content may be available regarding any number of disparate topics. For example, a first website on the Internet may be devoted to the migratory habits of bats and a second website may be devoted to automotive repair. In many cases, a user must proactively seek out online content of interest to the user. For example, an Internet user may utilize a search engine to search for webpages devoted to automotive repair. The user may then navigate between the webpages in the search results until the user finds the webpage that most closely matches the user's interests.
- Implementations of the systems and methods for providing relevant online content are described herein. One implementation is a computerized method for selecting content for a user identifier. The method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, data indicative of an online action associated with the user identifier. The method also includes identifying, by the processing circuit, a topic associated with the online action. The method further includes determining, by the processing circuit, an opinion regarding the topic based on the online action. The method also includes generating, by the processing circuit, a strength score for the topic based in part on the opinion. The method yet further includes selecting content for the user identifier based in part on whether the content corresponds to the topic and further based in part on the strength score for the topic.
- Another implementation is a system for selecting content for a user identifier. The system includes a processing circuit operable to receive data indicative of an online action associated with the user identifier. The processing circuit is also operable to identify a topic associated with the online action and to determine an opinion regarding the topic based on the online action. The processing circuit is further operable to generate a strength score for the topic based in part on the opinion. The processing circuit is also operable to select content for the user identifier based in part on whether the content corresponds to the topic and further based in part on the strength score for the topic.
- A further implementation is a computer-readable storage medium having machine instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations. The operations include receiving data indicative of text associated with a user identifier and performing text analysis on the text to identify a topic keyword and a disposition keyword in the text. The operations also include determining a weighting value based on the disposition keyword and generating a strength score for the topic based in part on the weighting value. The operations further include selecting an advertisement for the user identifier based in part on whether the advertisement corresponds to the topic and further based in part on the strength score for the topic.
- These implementations are mentioned not to limit or define the scope of this disclosure, but to provide examples of implementations to aid in understanding thereof.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims, in which:

- According to some aspects of the present disclosure, a user may opt in to receiving content that may be of interest to the user. In various implementations, a user may allow certain information about the user's online behavior to be stored and analyzed, to determine topics that may be of interest to the user. For example, history data regarding webpages visited by the user, comments or other content uploaded by a user, and other online actions may be analyzed to determine topics of interest to the user. For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about a user, or may make use of personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control which programs or features collect such information, the types of information that may be collected (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), and/or how third-party content may be selected by a content selection service and presented to the user. Certain data, such as a user identifier, may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters) used by the content selection service to select third-party content. For example, a user identifier may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information about its corresponding user can be determined from it. In another example, a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content selection service.
- In various implementations, an interest of a user may be identified by analyzing the online opinions expressed by the user about a particular topic. For example, golf may be identified as an interest of a user that favorably rates a set of golf clubs. A user may express an online opinion in any number of different ways. In one implementation, text written by a user may be analyzed to identify a user's interests. For example, an online article, blog entry, comment, or similar text from the user may be analyzed to discern the user's interests. In one implementation, a user's interactions via a social networking system may be analyzed to identify potential interests of the user, if the user so allows. In general, a social networking system refers to any computerized platform that allows a user to create a profile and associate the profile with that of other users whom the user deems as social connections. For example, a user may associate her profile with that of her friends, family, co-workers, classmates, or the like. Actions performed by the user within the social networking system may also be analyzed to identify the user's interests. For example, groups joined by the user, content recommended by the user to other users, ratings provided by the user, and similar actions may be analyzed to identify the interests of the user. In some implementations, the user may elect not to allow actions regarding certain social networking groups to be analyzed (e.g., the user may allow an opinion expressed in a public group to be analyzed, while keeping opinions expressed in other groups to remain unanalyzed for purposes of selecting content).
- A website owner may participate in an advertising or other content selection network, in some implementations. Participating in an such a network may allow any number of different forms of third-party content to be presented with a webpage of the website. For example, the webpage may be modified to cause a user's device to retrieve content from a server of the content network (e.g., from a different source than that of the website). The retrieved third-party content may then be displayed as being part of the webpage or in conjunction with the display of the webpage (e.g., in another browser tab, in a pop-up window, etc.). For example, an advertisement may be retrieved and displayed when the webpage is loaded. Different third-party content may be selected by the server of the content network. For example, the webpage may display a first advertisement to a first user and a second advertisement to a second user. In this way, different advertisers can place different advertisements on a particular webpage, without the website operator having to modify the code of the webpage each time a new advertisement is to be displayed.
- In some implementations, third-party content provided by a content network may be selected based on whether the third-party content is deemed to be relevant to a particular user identifier. Rather than selecting an advertisement to be provided on a webpage based on the content of the webpage itself, the selection of third-party content may take into account a user identifier. For example, a user identifier associated with visiting a website of an online retailer may be associated with an interest in knowing when the retailer is running a sale. The user identifier may then be used to select an advertisement for such a sale, regardless of the content of the webpage being visited by the user identifier. For example, assume that a user identifier is used to visit the website of an online retailer of golf clubs and then later used to visit a webpage devoted to finance. The user identifier may be associated with an interest in golf, based on the visit to the retailer's website. When the user identifier is used to later visit the financial webpage, an advertisement for a sale on golf clubs may be provided to the client device, even though the financial webpage is unrelated to golf.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation is shown.System 100 includes aclient 102 which communicates with other computing devices via anetwork 106.Client 102 may execute a web browser or other application to retrieve content from other devices overnetwork 106. For example,client 102 may communicate with any number ofcontent sources 108, 110 (e.g., a first content source through nth content source).Content sources client 102. In some implementations,computer system 100 may also include acontent selection server 104 that provides third-party content to other devices incomputer system 100. For example,content source 108 may provide webpage data toclient 102 that causesclient 102 to retrieve an advertisement or other form of third-party content fromcontent selection server 104. In this way, the same webpage fromcontent source 108 may display any number of different advertisements provided bycontent selection server 104. In another example,client 102 may execute a non-browser application (e.g., a game, a stand-alone social networking application, etc.) that receives advertisements or other third-party content fromcontent selection server 104. -
Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information betweenclient 102,content sources content selection server 104. For example,network 106 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks.Network 106 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data withinnetwork 106.Network 106 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example,client 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices innetwork 106. -
Client 102 may be of any number of different types of user electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, combinations thereof, etc.).Client 102 is shown to include aprocessor 112 and amemory 114, i.e., a processing circuit.Memory 114 may store machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112cause processor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, HTML, XML, Python and Visual Basic. -
Client 102 may include one or more user interface devices. A user interface device may be any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a monitor connected toclient 102, a speaker connected toclient 102, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client 102 may include anelectronic display 116, which displays webpages and other electronic documents received fromcontent sources content selection server 104. -
Content sources client 102. For example,content sources client 102,content sources circuits having processors memories processors content source 108 may include instructions such as web server software, FTP serving software, and other types of software that causecontent source 108 to provide content vianetwork 106. - In some implementations, one or more of
content sources client 104 may create a user profile oncontent source 110 and associate it with other user profiles belonging to the user's social connections. In such a case,content source 110 may allow users of the social networking system to upload content (e.g., images, text, video, etc.), share content with social connections, join groups devoted to certain topics (e.g., a group devoted to parasailing, a group including a user's classmates, etc.), rate content (e.g., positively rate an image uploaded by another user, etc.), or any other action associated with a social networking system. In one implementation, some or all of the functions of a social networking system may be extended to other content sources. For example, assume thatcontent source 110 hosts a social networking website and thatcontent source 108 hosts another website. In such a case, the website served bycontent source 108 may be modified to allow users of the social networking site ofcontent source 110 to perform social networking-related actions relating to the content of content source 108 (e.g., rating the content, sharing the content with social connections, commenting on the content, etc.). - According to various implementations,
content sources client 102 that causeclient 102 to retrieve an advertisement or other form of third-party content fromcontent selection server 104. For example,content sources client 102 that includes one or more content tags. In general, a content tag may be any piece of webpage code associated with placing an advertisement into a webpage. A content tag may define a slot on a webpage for an advertisement or other form of third-party content, a slot for an out of page advertisement (e.g., an interstitial advertisement slot), whether third-party content should be loaded asynchronously or synchronously, whether the loading of third-party content should be disabled on the webpage, whether third-party content that loaded unsuccessfully should be refreshed, the network location of a server that provides third-party content (e.g., content selection server 104), a network location (e.g., a URL) associated with clicking on an advertisement, how third-party content is to be rendered on a display, one or more advertising keywords used to retrieve an advertisement, and other functions associated with providing an advertisement or other form of third-party content on a webpage. For example,content source 108 may provide webpage data that causesclient 102 to retrieve an advertisement fromcontent selection server 104. In another implementation, the advertisement may be provided bycontent selection server 104 tocontent source 108 and provided as part of the webpage data sent toclient 102. In a further implementation,client 102 may independently request third-party content fromcontent selection server 104 orcontent selection server 104 may push third-party content toclient 104 without first receiving such a request (e.g., as part of a game or other non-browser application). - Similar to
content sources content selection server 104 may be one or more electronic devices connected to network 106 that select third-party content to be provided byclient 102 to a user.Content selection server 104 may be computer servers (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or a combination of servers (e.g., a data center, a cloud computing platform, etc.).Content selection server 104 may include a processing circuit including aprocessor 120 and amemory 122 that stores program instructions executable byprocessor 120. For example, the processing circuit ofcontent selection server 104 may be configured to provide an advertisement toclient 102 whenclient 102 visits webpages served bycontent sources content selection server 104 may be configured to select third-party content, such as advertisements, forclient 102 based in part on potential interests of the user ofclient 102. - A user of
client 102 may elect to allowcontent selection server 104 and/orcontent sources client 102. For example, the user may elect to allowcontent selection server 104 to select content that may be more relevant to him or her. In various implementations, a user identifier may be used to represent the user insystem 100 and associated with the stored history data. In some implementations, a client identifier (e.g., a cookie, an IP address, a device ID, a username and/or password, etc.) may be used bycontent selection server 104, and/orcontent sources client 102. In such a case, the user identifier may be the client identifier itself or may be associated with such a client identifier. In some implementations, a user identifier may be associated with multiple client identifiers. For example, the user ofclient 102 may accesscontent sources content selection server 104 using a number of different devices (e.g., a mobile phone, a home computer, etc.). The client identifiers for the various devices may be associated with a user identifier for the user. A user identifier and/or client identifier may also be anonymized, such that no personally-identifiable information about the user is available via analysis of the identifier. - A user identifier may be associated with one or more interest categories, based on the history data associated with the user identifier. For example, if the user identifier is associated with visiting a webpage devoted to baseball, the user identifier may be associated with the interest category of baseball. In various implementations,
content selection server 104 and/orcontent sources client 102. - Various online actions associated with a user identifier may be analyzed by
content selection server 104 and/or bycontent source content selection server 104 may analyze ratings, comments, suggestions, social connections, groups, etc. to identify one or more interest categories. In other implementations,content sources content selection server 104. In further implementations, the identified interests may be limited to only the strongest interests. For example, the user ofclient 102 may be an avid golfer, but only mildly interested in baseball. In such a case,content selection server 104 may provide golf-related advertisements toclient 102 and not provide baseball-related advertisement toclient 102. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an illustration is shown ofelectronic display 116 displaying anexample webpage 206 having anadvertisement 218.Electronic display 116 is in electronic communication withprocessor 112 which causes visual indicia to be displayed onelectronic display 116. For example,processor 112 may execute a web browser or other application stored inmemory 114 ofclient 102 to display indicia of content received byclient 102 vianetwork 106. In various implementations,electronic display 116 may be located inside or outside of the same housing as that ofprocessor 112 and/ormemory 114. For example,electronic display 116 may be an external display, such as a computer monitor, television set, or any other stand-alone form of electronic display. In other examples,electronic display 116 may be integrated into the housing of a laptop computer, mobile device, or other form of computing device having an integrated display. - As shown,
processor 112 may execute a web browser application and provide display data toelectronic display 116. In one implementation, the web browser application may operate by receiving input of a uniform resource locator (URL) via afield 202 from an input device (e.g., a pointing device, a keyboard, a touchscreen, etc.). For example, the URL, http://www.example.org/weather.html, may be entered intofield 202.Processor 112 may use the entered URL to request data from a content source having a network address that corresponds to the entered URL. In response to the request, the content source may return webpage data and/or other data toclient 102 which may be used byclient 102 to cause visual indicia to be displayed byelectronic display 116. - In general, webpage data may include text, hyperlinks, layout information, and other data that may be used to provide the framework for the visual layout of displayed
webpage 206. In some implementations, webpage data may be one or more files of webpage code written in a markup language, such as the hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible HTML (XHTML), extensible markup language (XML), or any other markup language. For example, the webpage data inFIG. 2 may include a file, “weather.html” provided by the website, “www.example.org.” The webpage data may include data that specifies where indicia such astext 208 appears onwebpage 206. In some implementations, the webpage data may also include additional URL information used by the client device to retrieve additional indicia displayed onwebpage 206. For example, the file, “weather.html,” may also include one or more instructions used byprocessor 112 to retrieve images 210-216 from the content source. In another example, the webpage data may include one or more content tags that causeprocessor 112 to retrieve one or more advertisements from an advertisement server, such ascontent selection server 104. - The web browser displayed on
electronic display 116 may include a number of navigational controls associated withwebpage 206. For example, the web browser may include the ability to go back or forward to other webpages using inputs 204 (e.g., a back button, a forward button, etc.). The web browser may also include one ormore scroll bars 220, 230, which can be used to display parts ofwebpage 206 that are currently off-screen. For example,webpage 206 may be formatted to be larger than the screen ofelectronic display 116. In such a case, the one ormore scroll bars 220, 230 may be used to change the vertical and/or horizontal position ofwebpage 206 onelectronic display 116. -
Webpage 206 may include text, images, or other forms of indicia to convey information to a user ofclient 102. For example,text 208 may indicate thatwebpage 206 provides information about the weather forecast for Freeport, Me. Similarly, images 210-216 may provide information about the latest weather forecast. For example,image 210 may indicate that the weather is predicted to be sunny on Monday, whileimage 212 may indicate that snow is predicted for Tuesday. Any combination of text, images, and/or other files may be used bywebpage 206 to convey information to a user. For example, the weather forecast for Tuesday may be conveyed via text, instead of viaimage 212. - In one implementation,
webpage 206 may includeadvertisement 218 which is selected bycontent selection server 104. For example, one or more content tags may be embedded into the webpage code located in the file “weather.html” and/or in other files ofwebpage 206. In other words, “weather.html” may include a content tag that specifies that an advertisement field is to be located at the position ofadvertisement 218. Another content tag may causeprocessor 112 to request an advertisement fromcontent selection server 104, whenwebpage 206 is loaded. Such a request may include one or more keywords, a client identifier forclient 102, or other data used bycontent selection server 104 to select an advertisement to provide toclient 102. In this way, any number of different advertisements may be placed in the location ofadvertisement 218 onwebpage 206. In other words, one user that requestswebpage 206 may be presented withadvertisement 218 and a second user that requestswebpage 206 may be presented with a different advertisement. - In some implementations,
advertisement 218 may be selected based in part on its relevancy to the user identifier associated with the request forwebpage 206. For example,advertisement 218 may be selected using a client identifier provided tocontent selection server 104 whenclient 102 requests an advertisement. Such an identifier may be associated with one or more interest categories. In various implementations, an interest category may be indentified based in part on one or more online opinions expressed by the user ofclient 102. For example, assume that the user ofclient 102 commented on a particular brand or model of automobile, rated a particular automobile, joined a social networking group devoted to an automobile manufacturer, or expressed some other form of online opinion about an automobile or automobile manufacturer. In such a case, the expressed opinion may be used to identify the general category of automobiles, a certain type of automobile (e.g., convertibles, 4×4 trucks, etc.), a particular manufacturer of automobiles, a certain model of automobile, etc. as an interest category for the user identifier. In some implementations,advertisement 218 may be selected based on an interest category associated with a user identifier. For example,advertisement 218 may be selected bycontent selection server 104 to be placed onwebpage 206 based on the interest category of automobiles associated with the user identifier. -
FIG. 3 is an example illustration of a third-party content 312 being selected for display with a webpage bycontent selection server 104. As shown,client 102 may send awebpage request 302 to a content source vianetwork 106, such ascontent source 108. For example,webpage request 302 may be a request that conforms to the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), such as the following: -
GET /weather.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.org
Such a request may include the name of the file to be retrieved, weather.html, as well as the network location of the file, www.example.org. In some cases, a network location may be an IP address or may be a domain name that resolves to an IP address ofcontent source 108. In some implementations, a client identifier, such as a cookie associated withcontent source 108, may be included withwebpage request 302 to identifyclient 102 tocontent source 108. - In response to receiving
webpage request 302,content source 108 may returnwebpage data 304, such as the requested file, “weather.html.”Webpage data 304 may be configured to causeclient 102 to display a webpage onelectronic display 116 when opened by a web browser application. In some cases,webpage data 304 may include code that causesclient 102 to request additional content to be displayed with the displayed webpage. For example,webpage data 304 may include an HTML image tag of the form: - <img src=“Monday_forecast.jpg”>
- Such code may cause
client 102 to request the image file “Monday_forecast.jpg,” fromcontent source 108. - In some implementations,
webpage data 304 may includecontent tag 306 configured to causeclient 102 to retrieve an advertisement or other form of third-party content fromcontent selection server 104. In some cases,content tag 306 may be an HTML image tag that includes the network location ofcontent selection server 104. In other cases,content tag 306 may be implemented using a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript. For example,content tag 306 may be of the form: -
<script type= ‘text/javascript’> AdNetwork_RetrieveAd(“argument”) </script>
where AdNetwork_RetrieveAd is a script function that causesclient 102 to send a third-party content request 308 tocontent selection server 104. In some cases, the argument of the script function may include the network address ofcontent selection server 104, the referring webpage, and/or additional information that may be used bycontent selection server 104 to select an advertisement to be included on the webpage. - Third-
party content request 308 may include aclient identifier 310, used bycontent selection server 104 to identifyclient 102. In various implementations,client identifier 310 may be an HTTP cookie previously set bycontent selection server 104 onclient 102, the IP address ofclient 102, a unique device identifier forclient 102, login credentials, other forms of identification information, or combinations thereof. For example,content selection server 104 may set a cookie that includes a unique string of characters onclient 102 when an advertisement is first returned toclient 102 bycontent selection server 104. Such a cookie may be included in subsequent advertisement requests send to contentselection server 104 byclient 102.Client identifier 310 may be associated with a user identifier or may be used bycontent selection server 104 as a user identifier, according to various implementations. - In response to receiving third-
party content request 308,content selection server 104 may select third-party content 312 to be returned toclient 102 and displayed with the webpage requested fromcontent source 108.Content selection server 104 may select third-party content 312 based onclient identifier 310, in some implementations. In some implementations,content selection server 104 may useclient identifier 310 to identify an interest category for a user identifier. In various implementations,content selection server 104 may be configured to run an advertisement auction in which advertisers compete to provide an advertisement on the requested webpage. For example, if travel is an identified interest category for the user identifier, an advertiser that sells airline tickets may bid in such an auction to advertise to the user identifier. In response to receiving third-party content 312,client 102 may display third-party content 312 with the retrieved webpage onelectronic display 116. In other implementations,content selection server 104 may instead select third-party content already stored onclient 102 and provide an indication of the selection toclient 102. In response,client 102 may retrieve the pre-stored third-party content frommemory 114 and display the advertisement with the displayed webpage. - In some implementations,
content selection server 104 may be configured to identify one or more interest categories based in part on online opinions associated with a user identifier. In general, an online opinion refers to any online indication of a user's disposition towards a certain topic or set of topics. For example, a user may positively rate an article devoted to Judo or share the article with one or more of his friends. These actions may be treated as the user expressing a positive opinion about the sport of Judo. In another example, the user may express an opinion textually (e.g., via a public status feed, online article, comment, instant message, or the like). In such a case, the text may be analyzed to identify one or more topics and the user's disposition towards the topics. In other implementations, some or all of the interests may be identified by another entity and provided tocontent selection server 104. For example, a social networking system may identify one or more interest categories for a user identifier and provide data regarding these interest categories tocontent selection server 104. Such identified interests may then be used bycontent selection server 104 to select relevant third-party content forclient 102. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , an illustration 400 is shown ofelectronic display 116 displayingexample webpage 406. As shown, the web browser application shown inFIG. 2 or another application may receive webpage data located at the URL, http://www.socialnetwork.test/QMC.html, and use the webpage data to displaywebpage 406. In some implementations,webpage 406 may be part of a social networking website. For example,webpage 406 may be a social networking group devoted to the Quartz Motor Company. In other implementations, some or all of the functions described with regard towebpage 406 may be provided within another stand-alone application (e.g., a social networking application for a mobile device, an email program, etc.) and/or by a webpage that incorporates social networking functions (e.g., a fan page that allows users to rate content on the webpage, a webpage that includes a function that allows users to recommend the webpage to others, etc.). -
Webpage 406 may be configured to receive input from a user interface device. In response, theapplication displaying webpage 406 may causeclient 102 to transmit data to a remote device vianetwork 106. For example,client 102 may transmit data to the content source that provides webpage 406 (e.g.,content source 108 or 110) and/or to another server located onnetwork 106. In some implementations, input received viawebpage 406 may be stored locally (e.g., inmemory 114 of client 102). -
Webpage 406 may be configured to allow a user to interact with his or her user profile of a social networking system. For example, assume that the user ofclient 102 has logged into their social networking profile. In such a case,webpage 406 may include anidentifier 408 that conveys that the user, “Jane Doe,” has logged into her profile.Webpage 406 may also include other profile-related inputs. For example,webpage 406 may include apreferences input 412 configured to receive preferences associated with the user's profile. Example preferences include the display size, shape, color, font, etc., ofwebpage 406, demographics and/or other personally-identifiable information about the user, security preferences relating to how information about the user is shared with others, and other similar preferences. In some cases,webpage 406 may include alogout input 412, configured to allow the user to log out of their social networking profile. - In one implementation,
webpage 406 may include aninput 414 configured to allow the user ofclient 102 to join the social networking group. For example, selection ofinput 414 by a user logged into his or her social networking profile may cause a join request to be transmitted to a server of the social networking system. In response to receiving such a request, the server may associate the profile of the user ofclient 102 with that of the social networking group and/or other members of the group. For example,users -
Webpage 406 may include aninput 404 configured to allow a user to post a comment towebpage 406. Comments may include text, a hyperlink, and/or an uploaded or linked file (e.g., an image file, a video file, etc.). For example,user 416 may post acomment 422 devoted to the newest model of automobile from Quartz Motor Company, the Armadillo.Comment 422 may include animage 436 of the Armadillo, in one example. Input 404 may be available to all users, users that are members of the social networking group, or only those members authorized by an administrator of the social networking group to post comments, according to various implementations.Webpage 406 may include some or all of the comments posted to the social networking group. In some implementations, a comment entered viawebpage 406 may be displayed as part of another webpage (e.g., a profile webpage foruser 416 or the like). In further implementations,webpage 406 may includeinput 432 configured to allow a user to reply to a posted comment. For example,user 420 may post areply 434 to comment 422. - In various implementations, a user may rate content on
webpage 406. Example content onwebpage 406 that may be rated include comments, images, videos,webpage 406 itself, etc. For example, a user may positively ratecomment 422 viarating input 428, negatively ratecomment 422 viarating input 430, post a reply to comment 422 viainput 432, or perform other actions. Ratings may be on a binary scale or a sliding scale (e.g., on a scale from one to ten, on a scale of A-F, etc.). Ratings may also be positive and/or negative. In some implementations,webpage 406 may includeindication 424 and/orindication 426 configured to provide an aggregated count of positive and negative ratings, respectively. For example,indications comment 422, an average positive or negative rating forcomment 422, an aggregate positive or negative score forcomment 422, or the like. - Users of
webpage 406 may share content onwebpage 406 and/or the webpage itself with other users. For example,webpage 406 may include aninput 438 configured to allow a user to shareimage 436 with other users. In other words,input 438 may be used to recommend content to another user, such as a social connection. In one implementation,input 438 may be configured to causeimage 436 or other recommended content to be sent to another user. For example, selection ofinput 438 may causeimage 436 to be sent to one or more selected users, certain social connections of the user, or all social connections of the user. In another implementation, selection ofinput 438 may cause a link to image 436 or towebpage 406 to be sent to one or more other users. In this way, a user may recommend online content to other users. - In various implementations, user
actions regarding webpage 406 may be associated with a user identifier and analyzed to determine an opinion regarding one or more topics. Actions that may be analyzed may include, but are not limited to, joining the social networking group ofwebpage 406, rating content onwebpage 406, sharing content fromwebpage 406 with other users, providing content to webpage 406 (e.g., by uploading an image or other file, entering a comment, etc.), or other actions associated with a social networking system. For example, a user identifier may be associated with an interest category relating to automobiles, products from the Quartz Motor Company, and/or a particular product, such as the Armadillo, based oncomment 422 being positively rated. In some implementations, the strength of an opinion may also be assessed. For example, a user that positively rates a comment about the Armadillo may not feel as strongly about the product than if the user sharedimage 436 with a friend. In various implementations, text analysis or image recognition may be employed to identify topics ofwebpage 406 on which a user opined. For example, image recognition may be used onimage 436 to identify that the image is of an automobile. - Referring now to
FIG. 5 , anexample process 500 for selecting relevant content is shown. In general,process 500 enables relevant content to be selected, based on one or more online opinions associated with a user identifier.Process 500 may be implemented by any number of computing devices. For example,process 500 may be implemented by a content selection server, such ascontent selection server 104 shown inFIG. 1 . In another example,process 500 may be implemented by a content selection server working in conjunction with one or more content sources (e.g., a social networking server, another web server, etc.). -
Process 500 may include receiving an indication of an online action associated with a user identifier (block 502). In general, an online action refers to any action performed by a user operating a client device that causes data to be transmitted from the device to one or more servers via a network. Example actions include sending text (e.g., an online article, a comment, an email, an instant message, etc.), uploading a file (e.g., an image, video, etc.) to the server, rating online content, sharing online content, and joining a social networking group. An indication of such actions may include, but is not limited to, input data received via a user interface device corresponding to a request to perform the action, data associated with performing the action (e.g., text data corresponding to an online comment, an image to be shared with a social connection, etc.), confirmation data that the action has been performed, or the like. -
Process 500 may include identifying one or more topics associated with the action (block 504). A topic may be a single category or may be part of a hierarchy of topics. For example, the topic of baseball may be a stand-alone topic category or may be part of a hierarchy of topics, such as Entertainment>Sports>Baseball, where baseball is a sub-category of the topic of sports. In some implementations, text analysis and/or image recognition may be used to determine a topic associated with the online action. In one example, text analysis may be used to determine a topic within the text of a webpage visited by the user identifier or within entered text (e.g., within an instant message, comment, email, uploaded text document, etc.). In one implementation, a statistical measure of the frequency of a term within a body of text may be used to determine a topic of the text. For example, a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) score may be assigned to words within a body of text and used to determine whether the text pertains to a certain topic. In one implementation, image recognition may be used to identify a topic of a digital image (e.g., an image on a webpage visited by the user identifier, an image shared with a social connection, an uploaded image, etc.). For example, an uploaded image of an automobile may be analyzed using image recognition to identify the topic of automobiles. In some cases, the image recognition may employ facial recognition. For example, an image of a famous baseball player may be analyzed to determine that the image relates to the topic of baseball. In further implementations, a topic may be self-reported by a webpage. For example, a topic of a webpage may be explicitly identified within a meta tag of a webpage, identified as part of an advertisement request, or using a similar mechanism. -
Process 500 may include determining an opinion regarding an identified topic (block 506). In general, an opinion regarding a topic may be positive or negative. In some cases, the opinion regarding a topic may be determined based solely on the type of online action. For example, joining a social networking group, rating up online content, or sharing online content may correspond with a positive opinion of a topic. In another example, leaving a social networking group or rating down online content may correspond with a negative opinion of a topic. In some implementations, text analysis may be used to identify one or more disposition words within text (e.g., within the text of a webpage, within text entered by the user, etc.). For example, the words “like,” “love,” “hate,” “dislike,” etc. may be identified within the text to determine an opinion regarding the topic. In some cases, the opinion may be determined using both identified text words and the online action. For example, a user may join a social networking group devoted to protesting a certain corporation. In such a case, text associated with the group may be analyzed to determine that the user has a positive opinion of the networking group itself, but a negative opinion of the corporation. In further implementations, a textual opinion posted without the user logging into a profile may also be analyzed. For example, a user may post an online comment without logging into a profile. In such a case, the comment may still be associated with a user identifier, such as a cookie, and analyzed to determine an opinion. -
Process 500 may include determining the strength of an opinion (block 508). In various implementations, the strength of how positively or negatively a user views a topic may be determined. For example, a user may be weakly interested in baseball and strongly interested in bowling. In one implementation, the strength of an opinion regarding a topic may be determined based on the type of online action from which the opinion is determined. A weighting may be applied to different action types to denote the strength of the opinion. For example, the following weights may be applied to different types of actions: - wsharing>wcommenting>wjoining>wrating
- where wsharing is a weight for sharing content with another user, wcommenting is a weight for commenting on a topic, wjoining is a weight for joining a social networking group devoted to a topic, and wrating is a weight for rating content associated with a topic. In other words, a user that feels strongly about a particular topic may share content related to the topic with other users, such as the user's social connections. A user that only positively rates content related to the topic, however, may have only a weak opinion regarding the topic. In some implementations, action weights may have positive or negative values, based on whether the user has a positive or negative opinion regarding the topic. Action weights may also be ordered in any number of different ways and may include weights for any number of different types of actions.
- In cases in which text analysis is used, different word weights may be applied to potential words within the text. For example, words such as “love” or “hate” regarding a particular topic may receive higher weights than that of the words “like” or “dislike.” In some implementations, an action weight may be combined a word weight to produce an overall weight for the opinion. In one example, assume that a user posts a comment about a topic that includes the word “love.” In such a case, an action weight, wcommenting may be adjusted upward. In another example, assume that the user joins a social networking group named, “People that hate the new Armadillo.” Since the word “hate” is used, an action weight, wjoining may be adjusted to be even more negative regarding the topic of the group.
- In some implementations, an overall opinion may be determined by analyzing any number of different online actions regarding a particular topic. Such a strength score may be determined by aggregating the various action and/or word weights regarding the topic. For example, a strength score (Stopic) may be determined by analyzing n number of actions regarding the topic as follows:
-
- where weightaction(i) is the action weight for the ith online action performed regarding the topic. For example, a user may post ten comments regarding a topic, join two social networking groups regarding the topic, and share an article about the topic with a social connection. In such a case, different actions may be analyzed to determine a strength score for the user's opining regarding the topic.
-
Process 500 may include selecting content for the user identifier based on the opinion (block 510). In one implementation, an advertisement may be selected based on a user identifier being associated with a positive opinion of a topic. For example, an opinion of golf may be determined to be highly positive. In such a case, an advertisement from an online retailer of golf equipment may be selected to be provided to the user identifier (e.g., in response to receiving a third-party content request or the like). Such an advertisement may be provided as part of a webpage devoted to the topic or may be provided as part of an unrelated webpage. For example, assume that the user identifier is associated with a strongly positive opinion of golf and later associated with a visit to a webpage related to the latest weather forecast. In such a case, a golf-related advertisement may be selected to be displayed in conjunction with the weather-related webpage. In further implementations, an identified opinion may be used to select or recommend other forms of content to the user identifier. For example, the latest scores for a golf tournament may be provided automatically (e.g., without further user action) to a user identifier associated with a strong interest in golf. - Referring now to
FIG. 6 , anexample illustration 600 of an expressed opinion being used to select relevant content is shown. In the example shown, comment 434 posted byuser 420 towebpage 406 inFIG. 4 may be analyzed to determine an opinion of the user regarding a particular topic. If the user's opining is favorable to the topic, the user's opinion may then be used to generate a set of one or more topics that may be of interest to the user. Content, such as anadvertisement 614, may also be selected based on an identified interest ofuser 420. - In one implementation,
user 420 may be associated with auser identifier 606.User identifier 606 may be any form of unique data usable by the system to representuser 420.User identifier 606 may be, for example, a client identifier, a unique identifier associated with one or more client identifiers, and/or login data for a social networking service. For example,user identifier 606 may include a screen name/password foruser 420, one or more client identifiers for devices operated byuser 420, biometric data foruser 420, or similar data usable to attribute a particular online action to a specific user identifier. Whenuser 420 performs an online action, the action may include such identification information to associate the action withuser identifier 606. For example,user 420 may be represented in the system byuser identifier 606 and may postcomment 434.Comment 434 may then be associated by the system withuser identifier 606. -
Comment 434 may be textually analyzed to determine one or more topics present within the text. For example, the text ofcomment 434 may be parsed by a server to identify various keywords in the text. Such keywords may be matched to defined topical categories, to determine thatcomment 434 relates to a particular topic. For example, the text ofcomment 434 may be analyzed to identifykeyword 602, “Armadillo,” a particular model of automobile.Keyword 602 may be itself by a topic of interest or may be mapped to atopic 608. For example, “Armadillo” may itself be an identified topic or may be mapped to the topic category of Vehicles>Automobile. In some implementations,keyword 602 may be used to identify a number of topic categories within a hierarchy. For example,topic 608 may be the top category of “Vehicles,” the sub-category of “Automobiles,” or a combination of topics along a hierarchy. - A
strength score 610 may be determined fortopic 608 based on the type of performed action (e.g., posting comment 434) and/or based on the strength of the language withincomment 434. For example,strength score 610 may be determined based on a weighting value associated with the action of posting a comment. In some implementations, such a weighting value may also based on the words withincomment 434. Similar to the identification oftopical keyword 602 using text analysis, adisposition keyword 604 may be identified incomment 434.Keyword 604 may be used to determine the user'sopinion regarding topic 608 and/or the strength of the opinion. For example, the word “love” may indicate that the user has a strongly positive opinion oftopic 608. In such a case, a weighting value corresponding to a user posting a strongly positive comment abouttopic 608 may be used to determine strength score 610 or may itself be used asstrength score 610. In some implementations,strength score 610 may be based on any number of actions regarding topic 608 (e.g., joining a social networking group related totopic 608, rating up content related totopic 608, etc.). - In one implementation, one or more identified
interests 612 may be determined foruser identifier 606.Identified interests 612 may include, for example, topics in whichuser 420 views positively. Online actions associated withuser identifier 606 may be analyzed to identify any number of topics and to determine strength scores for those topics. For example,strength score 610 may indicate thatuser 420views topic 608 highly favorably. In such a case,topic 608 may be included in identifiedinterests 612. In some implementations, a limit may be imposed on the number of topics included in identifiedinterests 612. Therefore, which topics are included in identifiedinterests 612 may also be based on their corresponding strength scores. In other words, only the topics in whichuser 420 views most favorably may be included in identifiedinterests 612. For example, identifiedinterests 612 may include the top five or fewer topics thatuser 420 views most favorably. -
Identified interests 612 may be used to selectadvertisement 614, according to various implementations. For example, a content request from a client device operated byuser 420 may be sent to a content selection server. Such a request may include a client identifier or other form of data used by the server to determine that the request is associated withuser identifier 606. In such a case, the content selection server may selectcontent 614 based in part on whether the content is related to a topic in identifiedinterests 612. In some implementations, the content selection server may conduct an advertisement auction in which different advertisers compete to provide relevant advertisements touser 420. In such a case, the advertisers may specify which user interest categories in which they wish to bid. For example, an online retailer of golf equipment may opt to bid in advertisement auctions involving user identifiers associated with an interest category of golf. In further implementations, the content selection server may selectcontent 614 based on identifiedinterests 612 and without first receiving a content request (i.e., the content selection server may “push”content 614 to a client device associated with user identifier 606). - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
