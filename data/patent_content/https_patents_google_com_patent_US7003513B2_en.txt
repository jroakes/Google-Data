Definitions
- the present invention relates in general to the field of document based information retrieval in the intranet and the internet domain, and in particular to a method and system for re-ranking an existing ranked result set of documents.
- a first approach is to structure raw data before a search is started. Structuring the raw data in advance can be done by introducing a set of taxonomies (like “cars”, “health”, “computers” etc.) and assigning each retrieved document into one or more of those categories. This can be performed in advance, e.g. by an administrator.
- the user Before a search is started, the user has to preselect one or more categories and thereby reduce the possible amount of returned information. Only the information stored in the selected categories is returned. A simple way to accomplish this is for example having several different indexes for the search engine. The user can then select either one or more indexes as a basis for the search.
- the drawback of the above described approach is that extra effort is necessary for preparing the raw data by defining the taxonomy set and by assigning each document into one or more categories (or indexes). Since the information most often is of a dynamic nature, an update of new information or categories (or both) has to be done on a regular basis. Further, there is a certain chance that some information is lost because of a wrong assignment to categories or a missing selection by the user.
- a second approach is to structure a search result after having finished the search. Structuring the result of a search is either based on the input the user made when he started the search with some query terms, or an attempt is made to dynamically find similiarities inside of the documents and group (cluster) them together.
- the second approach can be implemented by way of clustering the results which means finding “categories” dynamically by looking for similiarities inside of the returned documents. This can be achieved according to several different criteria, for example by scanning for lexical affinities (anyhow related expressions) and bundling those documents that have a certain similiarity. Thereby the total set of returned documents is split into several non-overlapping clusters that contain documents which are assumed to deal with the same or similiar context.
- the drawback of the above second approach is that the search engine has no idea which context the user is really looking for. Moreover, the clustering of the documents is performed on the basis of word tuples (a set of search terms) that occur with a certain relation to each other in the documents. Ambiguous terms can cause some documents to be scattered all over the clusters, although from the user point of view they deal with the same context. To find those documents the user has to open and read lots of uninteresting information.
- An alternative way to implement the second approach is to sort the returned documents in a descending order, derived by some comparable criterion. This method is commonly known as “Ranking”.
- the appearance of the search terms in each of the documents is a measurement for the importance of the individual document. All values are normalized so the higher the rank value is, the more importance is assumed.
- Still another way to implement the second approach is refining the search by adding more precise search terms known as “Narrow Query”.
- the user starts the search process with an initial query and examines some of the returned documents. For each document he assigns a relevance value that reflects if the appropriate document is of high or low value.
- the search engine scans the marked documents for terms that occur with a high frequency and uses those terms to synthesize a new query. This new query favors the high frequent terms of the documents with a high relevance and excludes the terms of the documents with a low relevance.
- An object of the present invention therefore is to provide an information retrieval method and system which presents only the desired information without wasting a user's time with opening and reading documents of no value.
- Another object is to provide a method and a system for ranking information comprised of a set of documents which presents the desired information on top of a ranking hierarchy.
- Still another object is to minimize the possibility of user errors, in particular with respect to generating search queries.
- the present invention accomplishes the foregoing objectives by gathering context information from the documents, generating at least one rank criterion from the context information and re-ranking the documents, based on the at least one rank criterion.
- the concept underlying the present invention is a post search improvement, particularly a human feedback to improve search results. It is emphasized hereby that the proposed re-ranking is only based on the results of a first search procedure.
- the criterion for re-ranking hereby consists of terms themselves found in the documents. These terms contain information which can provide feedback to the context of the underlying documents. These terms, designated as “context terms” in the following, are used in a weighting formula in order to separate documents with a matching context from documents with a dismatching context.
- ambiguity of search terms which causes unwanted information to be returned is solved by means of context information which is used to filter documents with unwanted context.
- a context weighting can be performed on a client data processing system, wherein no iterative and time consuming access to a search engine is necessary.
- lexical affinities to be evaluated as a criterion for re-ranking, is only exemplary and can be accomplished also by other means that are able to provide a notion of context.
- a suitable approach could be to use “features” that have been extracted from the documents or to simply create “word statistics”. “Features” are names of people, places, companies etc. and can be presented as a context indication very similar to lexical affinities. Especially when several extracted features are grouped and weighted together, the context definition would be very precise. “Word statistics” describe the frequency a given word is occuring within a given document.
- Both information can also be created by the search engine and transferred to the client together with the result set.
- the number of unnecessarily opened documents is hereby essentially reduced since an appropriate weighting of the context terms allows to precise the right context for the desired information.
- FIG. 1 is a combined block and flow diagram depicting a search process with weighted context feedback by lexical affinities, in accordance with the present invention
- FIG. 2 is a screenshot of a possible implementation of the method according to the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram depicting an embodiment of the re-ranking mechanism proposed by the present invention.
- FIG. 1 a combined block and flow diagram is depicted which shows a typical search with weighted context feedback by lexical affinities.
- the scenario described in the following assumes that it is accepted to start a search with rather unprecise search terms and to try to structure the huge amount of returned data according to context information.
- a user 100 starts a search by entering search term(s).
- the search term(s) is (are) transferred to a search engine 110 which generates a result set 120 ranked by the search term(s).
- the search engine 110 in parallel, automatically retrieves context information 130 from returned result set 120 which is related 140 to the original set of documents.
- the context information in a preferred embodiment, is based on lexical affinities which will be discussed in more detail later.
- the search engine 110 presents (displays) 150 the context information 130 to the user 100 and asks for a feedback.
- the user 100 performs a weighting 160 of the presented context information 130 in a range from “important” to “non-important”.
- the result set 120 is then re-ranked 170 with the user-weighted context information 180 to increase the “rank distance” of important and non-important documents.
- the re-ranking is performed by utilizing a context ranking formula which is described in more detail below.
- the documents that are now on top of the list represent the desired information.
- the re-ranking can be performed iteratively wherein the ranked set of documents ranked by the user-weighted context information 180 is treated as a new set 190 with different weightings, based on the original set, and re-ranked again performing the predescribed steps.
- the underlying re-ranking algorithm is based on an adaptation of the prementioned Fagin's and Wimmers' formula.
- the way to generate context information is the extraction of “lexical affinities”. This method produces pairs of terms that are found in a certain relation within the documents. If one, for example, is searching for the term “display”, that term could occur together with the terms “window” or “show” or “computer” or various other combinations. Each combination is an indication for the context the documents are dealing with.
- x 1 , . . . , xm be the terms that represent the context information.
- the function f(x 1 , . . . , xm) is then the ranking function that returns a rank value for a given document with respect to the terms x 1 , . . . , xm.
- Equation (1) we had to calculate the ranking value for each document m times, i.e. f(x 1 ), f(x 1 , x 2 ), f(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ), . . . , f(x 1 , . . . , xm), since the expressions ( ⁇ n ⁇ n+1) in equation (1) would all become non-equal to zero.
- equation (1) can be simplified into: a ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a - ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a + 1 ) ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , x2 , ... ⁇ , xa ) + ( a + b ) ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a + b - ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a + b + 1 ) ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , x2 , ... ⁇ , xa + b ) + ( a + b + c ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ c ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , x2 , ... ⁇ , xa + b + c ) . ( 7 )
- equation (2) one can substitute equation (8) with: a ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ b ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , ... ⁇ , xa ) + 0.5 ⁇ ( a + b ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ b ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , ... ⁇ , xa + b ) + 0.5 ⁇ ( a + b + c ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ b ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , ... ⁇ , xa + b + c ) ( 9 ) and according to equation (5) one finally obtains: [ 2 ⁇ a ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , ... ⁇ , xa ) + ( a + b ) ⁇ f ⁇ ( x1 , ... ⁇ , xa + b ) + ( a + b + c ) ⁇ f
- Equation (10) calculates the relevance of a document with respect to the context terms x 1 , . . . , xm when a, b and c are the number of terms that have been assigned a high (a), medium (b) and low (c) relevance and f(x 1 , . . . , xa), f(x 1 , . . . , xa+b) and f(x 1 , . . . , xa+b+c) are the partial relevance functions of this document with respect to a subset of context terms.
- a first way is to feed back the weighting information to the Text Search Engine and calculate the new rank value for all documents of the result set. This reveales some major problems as it is currently not possible to call a ranking function with new parameters (the context terms) on the basis of a prior search, because the statistics of these new parameters are not available. Only the original search terms, that are known during the search process, are complemented by the statistics information of the search indexes and could then be used for a ranking.
- the new ranking algorithm is based on the “absolute” ranking of the prior search that was derived from the query terms only. Depending on the occurrence of the context terms in a given document and their importance for the user a new rank value is calculated:
- This new ranking equation (11) is used together with the adaptation of Fagin's and Wimmer's weighted ranking equation (10) and results in a new rank value for each document.
- the desired effect is a change in the result set order.
- Those documents that contain the preferred context terms will appear on top of the list since their new rank value is higher than before.
- the documents that contain only the context terms that got a low relevance from the user will be pushed to the end of the list since their rank value is lowered.
- FIG. 2 depicts a screenshot of a possible implementation of this method.
- the right side of this screenshot shows the result of a search in a table format.
- the documents are sorted top-down.
- the left column with the header title “Importance” holds three graphical buttons on each line
- the right column with the header title “Context” holds the pairs of lexical affinities on each line.
- the table is scrollable upward and downward to display all the context information and the corresponding weighting.
- the right column is filled with all context information that could be extracted from all documents of the result set, the weighting of the individual context information in the left column is all set to medium.
- FIG. 3 shows the mechanism that leads to a new ranking value “Rd_new” for each document “d” contained in a result set.
- the number of iterations per individual document depends on the number of discrete ranking levels that are offered to the user.
- the initial value of “Rd_new” For each document it is started with its “absolute” rank value of the unweighted result set “Rd” and set the initial value of “Rd_new” equal to “0”, in step 300 .
- a next iteration 350 one performs a similar calculation for all the lexical affinities that have been rated “high” and “medium”, and finally a third iteration 360 takes into account all the “high”, “medium” and “low” rated lexical affinities.
- the last step is a normalization of the new rank value “Rd_new”.
- document should be understood in its broadest sense and means an arbitrary allied amount of information contained in files (as per the Windows operating system usage), documents (as per the MacOS operating system usage), pages (as per the web phraseology usage), and other records, entries or terminology used to describe a unit of a data base, a unit of a file system or a unit of another data collection type, whether or not such units are related or relational.
