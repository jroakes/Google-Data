Embodiment
Fig. 1 is the synoptic diagram that is used for the content based on web is organized in the system 100 of web notebook.Usually, as the user of system 100 during from webpage 114a-114g chosen content, system 100 is organized in notebook 116a-116d in the notebook database 118.Notebook manager 120 comprises assembly to allow to create, revise and manage notebook and user capture notebook etc.As shown, system 100 uses the notebook of trustship to arrange, that is, at least very major part of notebook information is stored on one or more central servers rather than is stored in each user's computer place in the notebook of described trustship is arranged.In other embodiment, system can have different layout (for example, distributed arrangement).
The content that such compilation is crossed may be more useful than the link of self webpage that points to the retailer to the reader, because notebook allows to consult information and need not navigate between each page at the single page.In addition, under regular situation, even link may not can with the viewer directly take to related content-link lead to zone in the webpage-because the viewer may be noted by its information dispersion of seeing around related content.By cliping and pasting the part of web page contents, the notebook author can only provide for the needed information of its purpose.
Notebook 116a-116d typically navigates to each webpage by the user and clips and pastes contents fragment and create from some webpages.As described below, then the content of being cliped and pasted is pasted or drop in (in every way-artificial and automatically) web notebook.Though be shown as webpage 114a-114g, document can show as the form of the document of any suitable network-accessible, such as other document with the SGML creation.The example of possible form like this comprises SGML, XML, TeX and XHTML, only enumerates a little.
Connecting line illustrates corresponding between the content that obtains from webpage 114a-114g and the web notebook 116a-116d.For example, like the user of good-looking food can browse website, and can select photo illustrate together from those websites with the notebook page the user such as website, dining room 114a or the like.Equally, the user who creates notebook 116b may be the fan of zabaglione, thereby can clip and paste content so that the combination page in the best dining room (at least according to this user) that illustrates in this zone to be provided from the various Italian restaurant webpages in the zone.For example, page 114c can be the website that is used for high-end Italian restaurant, and it has the exquisite picture of showing food.Create the user of notebook 116b may be with the part of the page (for example, menu and address) be placed in its notebook that has added explanation " Italian restaurant ", and (notebook 116a's) another user may be placed on another part (for example, the photo of exquisite thin pancake volume) on the notebook that adds explanation " food fashion ".
Each frame of broken lines among the figure is represented to be caught the content from webpage 114a-114g among the notebook 116a-116d by the user of system.Frame illustrates with the rectangle consistent with the many standard methods that are used for content choice, although content can be selected in any suitable manner by the user.Can catch such content in every way.For example, the user can drag the content in the mouse leap webpage in a well-known manner, perhaps computer system can be given tacit consent to and selects (for example to have the specific markers label, heading label) content and selection automatically or semi-automatically are (for example, select this content, check and approve the right of cliping and pasting content but give the user) this content.Especially, for example, the notebook author can be the artist who seeks the drawing inspiration, and can dispose notebook and should be used for only selecting image to be used to clip and paste notebook.In such a case, clip and paste order, can select and clip and paste all images on the page whenever this user carries out; Give this user option at that time then to abandon some figures or notebook can be turned back to after a while and delete any figure that it does not want to clip and paste notebook.
As another example, the user may only look to drawing up outline in the web notebook, and this user can dispose notebook and uses and to make any selection only clip and paste exercise question or title (if perhaps current non-selected content then clip and paste all exercise questions and title) from the content of a group selection.After browsing a plurality of websites and chosen content, this user can check notebook then, find the control in interested title or exercise question and the application of use notebook to turn back to corresponding webpage to collect additional content.
In addition, system can the search and webpage author be placed on the customized label of cliping and pasting with guidance on the page, for example, and beginning and terminal " general introduction " label of the information of the content of the mark summary page.And standard can define such special tags in every way, is used for the website of particular type of for example finance and economics, travelling or the like such as " vertically ", perhaps is used for other purposes.Allow so self-defined system that can allow of label can be extended to more purposes, therefore more useful to the operator of the user of system 100 and system 100.
Information except that the data of being cliped and pasted can manifest in notebook 116a-116d.For example, the user can use the control in the notebook Application and Development to add its own off-the-shelf title, subtitle, note and text to notebook.The user also can add metadata to notebook, described metadata such as the rank that the identification of notebook type, the user who creates notebook, the user that can visit notebook and permission are visited (for example, notebook waits to be disclosed, special-purpose still semi-over (for example, addressable) from the user account of a little identification).
Can be in notebook 116a-116d with various forms of information stores.For example, can store HTML or other marker code self, and various cliping and pasting simply can be placed in the document in turn.As an alternative, can store separately and clip and paste or take down notes, and also can point to and clip and paste or take down notes by the placeholder in the notebook.
Also can store the metadata relevant with the particular items in the notebook.Metadata can comprise from it clips and pastes the URL of data, time/date that data is cliped and pasted, in content by the designator of the inner capacities the webpage before cliping and pasting and afterwards (for example, make someone can turn back to after a while webpage and definite data from the page where, even data self changes in the meantime), the information relevant (for example, the specific webpage of search query word, Search Results, result that sensing is associated with notebook or notebook clauses and subclauses or particular result link or the like) with corresponding search inquiry.
Although notebook can be stored on the subscriber computer such as terminal 122 locally, be illustrated this its and be stored on the mandatory system.Form storing notebook 116a-116d with trustship can provide a plurality of advantages.For example, the document of trustship can be used to the public.Also can be along with the information in " source " webpage changes in real time or the approaching document that upgrades trustship in real time.The document of trustship can by the user from the machine of a plurality of networkings-such as on the airport, the machine of Internet bar etc. visits.
In addition, can carry out on the notebook of one group of trustship in suitable environment than the function more function that is not allowed under the situation of middle ground storing notebook such as the mandatory system of notebook manager 120, described mandatory system can the hardware of function (for example server) and the combination of software be formed in greater detail by being used to carry out below.For example, the content that manager 120 can be configured to search among the notebook 116a-116d thinks that other user returns Search Results, perhaps can analyze content in the notebook and discern designator popular or activity recently about notebook to obtain epidemic recently designator.
Manager 120 in mandatory system can consider that also the connection in the notebook improves the routine search result.For example, under third party user carries out situation to the search of " Italian restaurant " or similar notion, can promote search rank or the score value of page 114a, 114e and 114f with respect to other page, because in the notebook that adds explanation " Italian restaurant ", quoted the described page.Lifting can take place under the situation of following hypothesis: the user who creates notebook 116b attempts definite grouping of data; Personal choice the title or the subtitle of accurate description; And the described page is so definite by true individual, and described true individual is enough wise, forms the web notebook so that it is relevant with this word and form described web notebook by the expansion to search terms.
In one embodiment, each notebook can be used as independent marking document and is stored, and perhaps each notes file of can be used as independent tab file or other kind is stored.Such option can be used as alternative or combination provides.One or more notebook index can point to notes or notebook to allow tissue and the navigation to notebook.For example, index can comprise table, and described table comprises a plurality of URL that are associated with the specific user, makes when the user capture system, and the link of pointing to each notebook can be shown.Equally, the user can search index to find information about each other users.Index for example can be stored together with the out of Memory relevant with user and/or notebook.
If the notebook author selects to share its content, then the notebook content also can be shared.Sharing can be disclosedly to make any approved user of system can see notebook, perhaps it can be less disclosed, only (for example make to one group of approved user, friend or friend's friend) provide visit, described one group of approved user such as the part to system has community network or one group of user of certain access rights.In addition, visit can be configured, and makes other users can have read-only authority, note or note authority or whole editing authority.In some embodiments, access control can by with notebook with have only by login process just addressable particular user account be associated and provide.
Specific global search that also can execution index.For example, such as by rating system or by the visit notebook number of users, which notebook is system 100 can store with is subjected to most other users to welcome relevant information.Measure as deriving from, system 100 also can follow the tracks of some notebook author's popularity.The tabulation that system 100 can generate popular notebook or popular notebook author then is used for other people and watches.In addition, tabulation can be limited to particular topic, such as most popular notebook in the particular category (for example, dining room notebook).Can on can be, illustrate about such tabulation of notebook and other analytical information by the user accessing web page of attempting to browse the notebook in the notebook database 118.
Notebook manager 120 illustrates the example system (it can be the subsystem of bigger system) that can be used to create, manage, analyze and send the web notebook.The notebook that the inquiry that the assembly of notebook manager 120 allows its content that notebook is stored in the notebook database 118, the user is submitted to for various users to add these notebooks, search and user to provide is complementary, transmit the notebook of being asked and be used for to user's demonstration and other suitable function.
Notebook manager 120 is by interface 126 and telex network, and described user is such as the user at terminal 122 places.Although for clear and not shown, being arranged in can be in known manner between terminal 122 and interface 126 such as the various communications components in the network of LAN, WAN or the Internet.Interface 126 can be or comprise for example one or more web servers.
Clauses and subclauses in notebook or notebook outline document also can comprise the pointer that points to the webpage outside the notebook database 118.For example, be used to store from during the information of the webpage that changes, using such pointer as time passes when notebook.In one example, such information can be included in certain regional Current Temperatures, the position of described zone shown in the notebook that is exclusively used in travelling.
Because notebook only uses the part of the content in the webpage usually, so when web-page change, may have challenge aspect the suitable content in location.For example, if the notebook author clips and pastes paragraph from the centre of the page, and edit the data (perhaps changing this paragraph itself) that this page significantly changes each aspect of the paragraph of being cliped and pasted after a while, then locate this paragraph automatically so that this paragraph that allows to upgrade in the notebook may be difficult in changing.
A plurality of technology can be used to the content that assists in ensuring that each visit is identical, even the value that is associated with this content changes.For example, the position of content in webpage (for example can be determined, by determine the quantity of character, word or byte that this content occurs in the page, perhaps by with respect to position such as another object of specific label), as the label of beginning of tag content and end can be determined the same.If label appears in the revision page with this label and is calculated in identical or contiguous position, the position that manifests in the parent page, then system can suppose to have located suitable content in the revision page.In addition, the label of each aspect that also can memory contents, and the position of the content of change is checked in the position that can contrast label.Described label may especially be fit to such determining such as the label of link label, because can indicate web page authors to be intended to the anchor point of the page that focuses onto speculatively.
If above-mentionedly determine not produce sufficiently high degree of confidence (its can according to showing that selecting is that the points-scoring system that all suitable designators are counted is determined) and come permission system 100 to determine suitable content in the positioning webpage, then can carry out other and determine.For example, system 100 can store some relevant with page tolerance-such as total size of the page, quantity, the quantity of image in the page and the quantity and the type of other object in the position and the page of word in the page when content is cliped and pasted at first.These tolerance and the revision page can be compared to determine the page makes and can not locate the content of charging to notebook with enough degree of confidence whether having changed so more.
When can locating content, then system 100 can be for the various candidates of content recognition (such as comparing by the keyword in other content in the notebook relatively and with the keyword in the webpage that has changed) and by being that any tolerance of page stores will be revised the page and particular candidate and compare for each candidate and produce score value at system.As simplifying example, if the notebook exercise question for " model racing car " and have only a paragraph to mention thing about automobile or model, can suppose that then this paragraph is related content (and may be any title that this paragraph exists) in the webpage that has changed.The content that is included in the notebook can be the alternating content with highest score then.If do not identify such content, then can provide suitable message, such as requiring the user from a plurality of candidates, to select the message or the error message of suitable content to the viewer of notebook.
Now turn back to the assembly of notebook manager 120, notebook renderer 130 can be used the information that is stored in User Information Database 132 when the notebook of preparing to be used for to transmit to the user.For example, User Information Database 132 can be stored the authorization information about the user.In such embodiment, when the user asked to visit notebook, notebook renderer 130 can determine whether this user can visit this notebook such as the visit information that is stored in by inspection in the User Information Database 132.
User Information Database 132 also can be stored the out of Memory of the proper handling that is used for notebook manager 120.For example, database 132 can comprise the information that is used to organize notebook, such as describing notebook and being oriented to clauses and subclauses in the notebook or the table of the pointer of the document of notes.And, database 132 can storage and notebook and the relevant metadata of notebook clauses and subclauses, comprises the author of notebook, the time that clauses and subclauses are added to notebook, the source of clauses and subclauses, size and management notebook and needed other relevant information of notebook clauses and subclauses of clauses and subclauses.
In response to the inquiry from the user, notebook renderer 130 can use search engine 128 to obtain information.For example, search engine 128 can be the form with the standard search engine, and described standard search engine is all to carry out the search engine of rank according to the backlink relation of document to document in this way, and can search for the information among the notebook 116a-116d.User inquiring can be the form with search terms, and described search terms goes for the content library in the database 118.For example, the user can search for and comprise and spend a holiday all notebooks of relevant content of Hawaii, and search engine 128 can be searched the designator of such content, such as word " Hawaiian (Hawaiian) " and " vacation (spending a holiday) ", related words such as " lei (garland) " and " leisure (leisure) " and the link of pointing to the page that comprises such word.Equally, the user can search for the information about the patent attorney, and can provide the link of pointing to notebook 116d to described user in response.If such user has selected this link, then can present corresponding notebook to this user then.Content in notebook 116d can comprise the hyperlink that is directed to webpage 114g, if make that the user has selected such link, then can provide the demonstration of this webpage to this user.
Also search engine 128 can be used to be different from the purpose of searching for notebook.For example, notebook manager 120 can be submitted to inquiry and suitable parameter (for example pointing to the pointer of particular index) the standard search engine and can receive Search Results from universal search engine.By this way, tissue can be regulated the operation of universal search engine to comprise the search relevant with the web notebook.
Notebook assembler 124a can leading subscriber notebook, and can add, edit or delete content in the notebook.For example, submitting to evaluator 124b to determine that message (such as the HTTP request from notebook author or other user's computer) relates under the situation of the content of selecting from webpage, can be delivered to content assembler 124a with the metadata of resolving with content from request.Metadata for example can be used to determine user's identity, and definite content user's notebook that should be added to.Notebook assembler 124a can obtain the current version of notebook from notebook database 118 then, and new content can be appended in the notebook.Notebook assembler 124a also can upgrade the database (it can be stored for example in user profile 132) of the metadata relevant with notebook and the notebook after upgrading can be saved in the database 118.
The notebook of notebook analyzer 134 in can accessing database 118 provides the information relevant with notebook with user or keeper to system 100.Notebook analyzer 134 can be programmed to be useful on and obtain notebook information, analyzes this information and generate various processes and further feature about the report of this information.For example, notebook analyzer 134 can make the index that is used for making up the content in the database 118 by search engine 128, to allow that database 118 is carried out more effective search.As another example, notebook analyzer 134 can discern between the different notebooks and notebook and webpage between link, and can allow to shine upon the document analyzed or the relation in the webpage.
By these assemblies, notebook manager 120 can create new notebook, the existing notebook of editor, combination from the information of each notebook, the notebook that allows the user to watch other users to create, allow the user stride a plurality of notebooks search, allow the systematic analysis notebook with such as provide search to notebook, to the web content carry out more effective search with to the easier navigation of notebook and allow the generation report relevant with the notebook data with notebook.In some embodiments, notebook manager 120 can be carried out than all such functions function still less.
Fig. 2 shows the synoptic diagram of the example information stream between the assembly in the web notebook system 200.System 200 comprises the various computing equipments or the computing system of communicating by letter by such as the network 212 of the Internet.Information service provides information stores that device 202 will be relevant with notebook in notebook database 210, and notebook database 210 can be by 204 visits of notebook manager.Notebook manager 204 can be identical or similar with the notebook manager 120 shown in Fig. 1 in some embodiments.Notebook manager 204 is by other component communication in interface 208 and the system 200, and it can be for example one or more web servers and other associated component.
The supplier of frame (rack) server 218 expression web page contents is such as the company that presents its webpage, commercial content supplier or other web content provider.Although a kind of content of common form is to use the webpage such as the variant of the SGML of HTML, can provide various forms of contents.
Also show the terminal that is used for two kinds of users.Terminal 214 expressions can be by passing through the individual employed computing machine of compilation from the disclosed web notebook of the information creating of various webpages.Terminal 216 expressions can be by the individual employed computing machine of searching about the information of web notebook.
The arrow of the band letter among the figure is illustrated in the information flow of the instantiation procedure that is used for creating and consult the notebook content.Process can be from being labeled as the arrow of A.At that time, can use terminal 214 to come browsing web.For example, the user of terminal 214 may be interested in New Zealand and Zelanian sight spot.This user may just spend a holiday from New Zealand and return, and may wish to create the notebook that is summarised in the information when spending a holiday.In arrow A, the individual obtains content from the webpage that is stored on the rack server 218, such as the URL that is used for the dining room of Auckland by input.Rack server 218 can be to provide the webpage that is associated with this dining room in response.
The arrow that is labeled as B is represented to begin the communication that takes place as the user when webpage is selected information.For example, the user can be by clicking and drag in terms of content outstanding content from webpage.This action can make the process of analyzing selected content begin, and this can cause system 200 to provide the title of the notebook in the user's that should be placed into from this content the notebook to the user.For example, if the webpage that the user is just consulting has the title of " New Zealand ", and one in user's the notebook has similar title, then notebook manager 204 can infer that this user is intended to information is cliped and pasted New Zealand's notebook, and can present the icon that this notebook of expression is selected as the acquiescence that is used for selected content.As an alternative, terminal 214 self can be carried out such deduction, perhaps can just selected content be placed in current any notebook movable on terminal 214.In such alternative situation, provide communicating by letter of device 202 with information service shown in the B with not needing to mark.In analytic process, can use the information beyond title or the exercise question, any other content in note, image, metadata or the user's notebook that provides such as the user.
The arrow that is labeled as C is represented to add content to notebook.For example, if the user selects notebook manager 204 selected notebooks, then notebook manager 204 can be saved in selected content this notebook in the notebook database 210.As an alternative, can preserve selected content by the application that runs on the terminal 214 at first, and when user's selection is transferred to the action of notebook database 210 with selected content, such as when the user when the end of browsing session is selected to preserve action, selected content can be transferred to notebook database 210.As an alternative, terminal 214 can send and the relevant information of pointer of pointing to content to be added to manager 204, and manager 204 can directly obtain this information from rack server 218.
Content is under by the situation on the webpage of regular update, and the notebook manager can be after a while to rack server 218 request contents, shown in the arrow that is labeled as Cx.In this case, link or pointer can be stored in the notebook at first, and at reasonable time such as periodically or the request that notebook manager 204 can send what be new when the user asks to check notebook.
The arrow that is labeled as D is represented the request of the user of terminal 216 to information.This user may be to perhaps other web content be interested in the web notebook, and may just carry out commonly browsing and searching for.Request can be for example at the searching request of the notebook in the notebook database 210 or contain from the content of world wide web (www) and the more common searching request of the content in the notebook database 210.Searching request can adopt conventionally form, by this user's inputted search word and described search terms is submitted to the search engine (not shown) with the HTTP request mode.The tabulation of Search Results can be provided to the user with the form of the hyperlink of pointing to matching content and additional information in response.
The user that the arrow that is labeled as E is represented terminal 216 is to the selection from the web notebook of Search Results.Such selection (for example selecting to be directed to the hyperlink of notebook) makes information service provide device 202 to return the html document of describing this notebook.Terminal 216 shows the document to the user then.The notebook document can comprise the content that user or other users obtain from various webpages, and also can comprise sensing from the hyperlink of webpage of acquisition content.
The user that the arrow that is labeled as F is represented terminal 216 is to the selection of the hyperlink of the content that is used for the web notebook.Such as description, hyperlink is directed to the original web page that is stored in rack server 218 places, described rack server 218 returns the html document of this original web page to terminal 216.As an alternative, can device 202 place's cache web pages be provided and this webpage is provided from here in information service.The user can navigate back then notebook, add user's oneself notebook to or carry out other appropriate functional from webpage or from the notebook chosen content.
By this way, system 200 provides to the user of terminal 214 and creates and provide the chance that comprises original contents and also have the web notebook of the content that obtains from other webpage.System 200 (for example HTML) document that the web notebook can be served as a mark provides, and described marking document removes the outer sum total that also comprises the marker code of cliping and pasting from each provenance of the content (for example, title and exercise question) of directly adding notebook to.As an alternative, can be fully when the request of sending notebook or partly make up notebook in real time, such as by notebook being stored as a plurality of pointers, and before distributing notebook, follow pointer to obtain content in response to request.System 200 also makes the user such as the user of terminal 216 can search for and consult such web notebook, thus obtain than be dispersed on a plurality of different web pages information more relatively or more suitably formatted information.
Fig. 3 shows the process flow diagram of the action that can carry out for web notebook captured information.Operation 300 can be carried out by the user, and described user uses the notebook Application and Development to come chosen content to be used for being included in one or more web notebooks new or preexist.For example, the user can join and visits a plurality of websites comprise with the information of cliping and pasting part correlation of interested particular topic that is used for the web notebook and information.
As an alternative, the notebook Application and Development can automatically perform operation 300 based on the theme demand of user's input.As an example, the notebook Application and Development can find automatically and outstanding webpage in the extraction relevant with particular topic.For example, the user may wish to add more information to the web notebook of previous establishment that detailed description is for example iced the theme of river in Henan Province woods.If the user selects to allow automatic search, then the extracts of the information in the notebook Application and Development web document that can attempt automatically ice cream theme and user may be wished to add is complementary, such as address, perhaps be used to make by oneself ice-cream recipe-the spitting image of " I ' m Feeling lucky (fortune the is pretty good) " option that is used for that notebook generates near user's Baskin Robbins.
When the user was provided with first anchor point by pointer is placed on the web document, operation 300 began with step 302.Anchor point is set begins selection course,, only enumerate a few examples such as html page, image, audio files, film or text selecting to catch available any resource in the document.Can be for example according to depressing signal (left side button is downward) or first anchor point being set from mouse by other suitable mechanism.
Then, in step 304, the user is provided with second anchor point and gives prominence to selection to data.For example, the user can be placed on pointer on the image, and first anchor point is set, and drags to the end of needed image, second anchor point is set then catches this image (for example, outstanding selection to data).For example can be after selecting first anchor point by release the mouse button or by user's one section time enough that hovers setting to second takes place on a point.Determining if the user moved subsequently once more, then can to reset definite under second the situation before release the mouse button or other input mechanism by such hovering.
Running on web notebook on the user's computer uses and can allow the user needn't find independent menu and click or import a plurality of thumps thereon and finish under the situation of selection operation and only catch this data content fully by outstanding data content.After receiving first and second anchor points, application can be at cursor or second anchor point next door or close cursor or the automatic display icon of second anchor point.The user can click on icon then and finish selection operation.
It can be the browser extension moved of the browser on being installed in user's computer or the part of plug-in unit that the Web notebook is used.Application also can be configured to communicate by letter with remote server, is used for storage and managing web notebook such as sending a message to remote server.Message can adopt the form of the request of HTTP for example, and can comprise the message that selected content is sent to remote server and also will the metadata relevant with content sends to remote server.
(for example finish outstanding operation, after discharging, perhaps pointer or cursor have hovered the time enough section on a position after such as the button on the sensing equipment of mouse) time pointer or the residing position of cursor near and in the content area at browser demonstration notebook relevant icon selection is finished easily for the user.The user can clickable icon duplicate or clip and paste the image that is used for notebook, and will cursor move to menu-such as the menu near page edge.In addition, clip and paste action-for example by making icon be exclusively used in notebook, only illustrate at icon under the situation of single option-user can more easily select icon and needn't navigate by a plurality of selections.
As an alternative, the icon that shows automatically can present option to the user and be used to keep, abandons, revises or add new extracts of information or the like.For example, the user may wish to see all results with the recipe that is used for chicken cubes in chilly sauce, and only browses fast by outstanding and click and determine which recipe is cliped and pasted and kept and which recipe is dropped.Do not need a large number of users alternately such as find menu or open another the outside application with event memory, just can clip and paste outstanding recipe.
Each selection from webpage can be made up of the code that is created in the image, sound or the text that present on the webpage, such as retrtieval (for example, HTML code or the like).When the user used the web notebook tools to give prominence to and selects clauses and subclauses, code can be the actual entities that is captured and is created again on clipbook.As shown in step 306, the user can select to copy to Clipboard selecting-and it can be the operating system clipbook or be exclusively used in the clipbook that notebook is used.Clipbook can comprise a plurality of clauses and subclauses (or selection) of various medium types and clauses and subclauses can be transferred in the specific web notebook.Under webpage comprises situation about quoting to other content, can copy to Clipboard or can clip and paste actual content with quoting.
If set in advance (for example identification) content wait the notebook (step 308) cliped and pasted, then can be, and can store with this and clip and paste relevant metadata (step 312) with the notebook (step 310) of content replication to this setting.Can know in advance that such as when the user selects in advance or opened notebook, notebook is " set " under the content of the being cliped and pasted situation with the notebook that is placed into using.The specific title that is used for these clauses and subclauses of the end of set notebook-may provide with the user for example, the HTML code of duplicating from target web only can be provided.For metadata, can store the URL that is used for webpage, make the later viewer of notebook this webpage that can easily navigate back.
Similarly, can determine and store other metadata, as mentioned above.For example, catching metadata can comprise from comprising the webpage acquisition data of selection, such as html tag, keyword, restrict access, time and date stamp, backlink, user data, search criterion or the like.As an example, metadata can comprise the indication that specific web notebook will be shared with other users now.Also can in each notebook, share metadata, as the mode that the notebook content link is arrived together.For example, the linked contents in the notebook can be linked to first notebook second notebook and increase the possibility that finds the content all relevant with two notebooks in when search.
Metadata can be write notebook with standard entries, perhaps as only when the user selects to show the option of hidden text visual hidden text write.As an alternative, the user can be the independent file or the clauses and subclauses of all metadata configurations of being caught in notebook.Metadata can be captured and preserve the time quantum of user's appointment.For example, after 30 days, the user can select to empty the independent elements data of notebook, places metadata on the acquiescence notebook of the data do not belong to other existing notebook such as being collected in the user.
Under the situation of the notebook that does not have setting at present, application can for example be determined the notebook that content should be placed into by the content of analyzing existing notebook.For example, the user may clip and paste the relevant selection of life with the lucky match of supermodel Himachal occasion, and determines selected text is placed among patent attorney supermodel's notebook 116d based on the related subject of " supermodel " in the notebook.As an alternative, the user can select selected text artificially is placed in the selected or new web notebook.For example, the user can be chosen as lucky match Himachal occasion and select to create new notebook.Application can be consulted such as the database in external database on the remote server and be obtained selected information and the information of getting up such as other theme contact of the theme in user's the available notebook.
Can finish selecting and the automatic analysis of web notebook with several different methods.Each method can be carried out to calculate and be used for determining selected text and the similarity (step 314) between the content of each notebook that presents in the user's computer system.Can make according to webpage first of content collection is determined, and can make according to each notebook second of independent content collection is determined.For example, the content collection can comprise the material particular of whole webpage or webpage, comprises the html tag such as exercise question and heading label, and perhaps the content collection can comprise the actual selection to text.The content collection also can comprise particular topic or the position of keyword to determine that placement is selected in the webpage.In addition, can give specific theme or keyword weight so that the placement decision is easier.The content of analyzed notebook can comprise the content of cliping and pasting; Take passages or take passages part; The notebook exercise question; The textual entry of the title that the user provides, note or free-format; Metadata or the like.
For example, the link structure of use web can calculate one group of vector and catch the relative importance of selection about particular topic.Higher weight can be given to have with selected theme the keyword of powerful relation.For example, the web notebook is used the exercise question that higher weights can be given the title in notebook exercise question or the notebook.In addition, higher weight can be given the most current notebook clauses and subclauses in each notebook.And system can allow the user to give each notebook with keyword as metadata, and for purpose relatively can be exclusively or mainly use these keywords.Also can at the search engine that uses the web notebook, use keyword.For example, search engine can comprise the module of the existing web notebook on the computer system of search subscriber and the Search Results that returns is limited in these themes.
In step 314, the web notebook is used to carry out to the distance (according to weighting) of selected candidate's notebook selected text codes for possible correlativity and is calculated.In some embodiments,, calculate and the weighting score value, and in step 316, the web notebook is used can determine whether this score value is enough for each relevant selection.
If score value is enough, then can be in step 318 with copying codes to the highest notebook of scoring.When code is copied to the notebook of specific scoring, can in step 320, be used for when determining suitable notebook theme, using future by storing metadata.Yet, if using, the web notebook determines that score value is not enough, in step 322, can carry out the process that the backlink in the selected webpage is compared with the backlink in the notebook.
If relevant backlink theme exists, then can promote the weight that is used to mate webpage.Otherwise, can reduce the weight that is used for irrelevant backlink theme, thereby reduce the overall score value of webpage.In step 324, can calculate score value for each relevant backlink.If score value is enough, then use can be with copying codes to the notebook of the highest scoring and calculating and write metadata and be used for following use for the web notebook.
After the analysis of finishing web notebook and selection, the web notebook is used and can be determined iteratively whether particular note originally should be set to be used for the acquiescence notebook of new content based on analysis result.Each method can use weight to determine score value according to existing web notebook as particular keywords or theme.If the weight of selected text and particular note originally have sufficiently high correlativity, this notebook then can be set in step 318 and selected text is copied to this notebook.
Code can be copied to the web notebook automatically or select icon to duplicate by the user, if present the notebook of suggestion to the user such as system.As an alternative, the user can come chosen content and it is dragged to notebook (such as by dragging to the exercise question of the notebook in the notebook tabulation) with cursor.Can be in notebook, and content can it equally manifests on webpage fully with content replication, perhaps can to text or marker code is made amendment and only the part of replicating code take passages.For example, the user may only wish to duplicate URL(uniform resource locator) (URL), and does not duplicate exercise question or other content relevant with webpage.
In step 326, the Web notebook is used can determine that the notebook relevant with selected content is not present in the user's computer system, and can therefore present the notebook of acquiescence to the user.In some cases, the user may not wish content is placed in the notebook of acquiescence, and the option that can refuse to do like this.Other option also can be provided.Whether for example, can present the inquiry user to the user wishes the clauses and subclauses slavish copying is write title or only fully deleted the screen of clauses and subclauses for this particular items in notebook, before adding particular items to the web notebook.The user can walk around top any or all of option.
As an alternative, can to the user present the user have to its tabulation of all notebooks of editing authority or system determine with selected in have correlativity to a certain degree all notebooks tabulation and allow the user select selected content notebook to be placed into.Can be to present the tabulation of web notebook to the user according to the order of level, described level and rank score value, user capture statistic and/or alphabetically relevant have only been enumerated some examples.
In some cases, because outlier may be correlated with on date after a while, so the user may wish this outlier (for example, content and incoherent of the content of other in notebook) is placed in the specific notebook.As example, when a row textbook that will be to be bought was put together, exercise question may be uncorrelated mutually, but user's purpose may be a local tabulation of creating essential books.In step 328, the user can obtain selection after selecting needed content and selecting notebook.Then, in step 330, code (selection) can be copied in the selected notebook.Reproduction process can perhaps be provided for storing other option of selection acquiescently with selecting to append to the end of notebook to the user.In addition, can provide simultaneously and will select to append to the option of a plurality of notebooks to the user.When code is copied to particular note this time, can be in step 332 with metadata store to notebook, be used for followingly when determining suitable notebook theme, using.
Fig. 4 A-4B shows and is used for the simplification screenshotss of chosen content with the mechanism that is included in the web notebook.Can in following surfing window 402, show the web notebook.Can be in the browser in the user's computer system 404 displaying contents.The user can consult and clip and paste various contents then and described content is kept in the specific web notebook of following demonstration in the surfing window 402.Various media content can be caught and comprise to the Web notebook, and the link that comprises image, sound, metadata and return original document (for example, URL).Selected and clip and paste along with the content of being caught, can in following surfing window 402, add and show the content of being caught.
The web notebook can be followed surfing window 402 to realize as plug-in unit.For example, the service that provides of this plug-in unit can comprise access control, client monitors or file system access.Usually, plug-in unit can require to install particular code with operation, and this particular code can be used to expansion or order computer system function then after being mounted.For example, the function of browser 404 can follow the web notebook plug-in unit of surfing window 402 and other notebook function to expand by providing.Browser 404 can provide the method that is registered to browser for web notebook plug-in unit, and is identified for the agreement of swap data.For example use the AJAX technology can generate and move application.
The example that is illustrated in figures 4A and 4 B has been described embedded control 406 ("+" symbol).Also can use other facility to represent.In conventional operation, the application that is used for embedded control can be at running background, the action of monitoring user but not always not as seen.Yet, can provide order to come the part that show or hide uses or make application activating or inactivation to the user.
Embedded control 406 can carry out selecting the back to manifest the user in browser window on the webpage.Embedded control 406 can be close to selected element to be manifested, thereby allows the user easily to select control 406.In some embodiments, embedded control 406 can only be enumerated a few examples, and distinguish mutually with web page background by with runic, translucent, flicker, manifest as button that obviously is different from background or the icon that is depicted as visually variation.
In some embodiments, also embedded control 406 can be placed on selected text between two parties.As an alternative or additionally, can place watermark on all selected contents and embedded control icons 406 can be placed in the choice watermark or the shadow region on or near the edge of watermark.For example, watermark can be similar to the received text selection and manifest, but can be plotted as the transparent translucent frame that surrounds selected content.
The Web notebook is used and also can be comprised child control, and described child control can be selected embedded control 406 or the pointer or manifest during with some alternate manners and this widget interaction of hovering the user on embedded control 406.As shown in Fig. 4 B, the user can use pointer 408 to hover on the embedded control 406 and trigger " add to note (adding notes to) " child control 410, so that it manifests immediately following original "+" embedded control 406.The user can select " adding notes to " control 410 to add selection to the web notebook then.In some embodiments, the web notebook is used can not need to select " adding notes to " embedded control 410.For example, the user can give prominence to text selecting 412 and only click the notebook that "+" control 406 adds outstanding selection to the user.
As an alternative, the web notebook is used and can be tabulated to user's Show Options.For example, this tabulation can comprise and be used to organize the content of selection, add notes, will select send e-mails another user's option or the option that content and previous notes of pasting are merged before pasting notebook.In addition, use the assistant who can be used as order, described order is normally available by right click after making one's options in browser.Material is cliped and pasted the web notebook can be provided together in company with such right click or other menu, and method although it is so may make to use and lose some above-mentioned functions.
Before being cliped and pasted in the notebook, content can provide other option easily to the user.For example, can give user's the following option: selected text-converted is become audio files; Perhaps note is added in note added to and treats the metadata that is stored together with the notebook clauses and subclauses; For clauses and subclauses are added title; Modification is from the image (comprising the modification in the browser) of content; Carry out the purchase relevant or be established to the connection (for example, forming the relation of introduction) of the tissue that the content that provides such sells for the product that is collected in the notebook with content.For last example, in an application, the user can form and (for example comprise some classification, projection TV, 6.1 amplifiers, front projection TV, LCD TV and plasm TV) in the web notebook of summary paragraph of comment of Voice ﹠ Video device, make the user can browse comment and can select the control in the notebook to receive more detailed information to be brought to original comment.Notebook also can be directed to the user some retailer, makes the user can easily buy product and notebook author and can (for example, suppose disclosed notebook) and receive procuration to be used as the exchange of collecting important information for the user.
Except the control and child control of following surfing window 402 external appearances, can also exist can be to the intrinsic control of notebook executable operations available in the computer system.Intrinsic control can be positioned at follow within the surfing window 402 or on.Arrow 414 is examples of intrinsic control, and the notebook clauses and subclauses can be expanded or shrink to this arrow when the user selects arrow 414.For example, when the user selected arrow control 414, " Kohler Faucets (tap is reined in by section) " title can be expanded with the section that multiple style is shown and rein in tap, such as in the handle of tank tap handle-user-selected each as the clauses and subclauses in the notebook.As an alternative, can select arrow control 414 to come extension header so that text and other content in these clauses and subclauses of particular note also to be shown.By this way, the user of application can easily consult the data that is added to notebook, and outlining in detail with permission of hidden information checked better in relatively little following in the surfing window then.
