Augmenting can include adding a text advertisement sponsored by the one or more related entities. Augmenting can include determining a format for content to be added and adding the one or more content items in accordance with the determined format.
- the first entity can be a brand.
- Combined content items can be automatically created using content from a search result associated with a brand and a content item (e.g., advertisement) associated with the same brand. Users can be presented with a combined content item that may be more interesting because the content item includes content from different sources.
- the combined content item can also be augmented with other information, such as information (e.g., content) from retailers, suppliers, or other content sponsors that are associated with the brand or entity.
- retailer information can be turned into actionable links that users can use to access brand-related or entity-related content provided by the other content sponsors.

- the first search result can be associated with a first entity.
- a first eligible content item (that is associated with the first entity) can be identified based on the search results for presentation along with the search results.
- a combined content item can be identified that is a combination of the first search result and the first eligible content item and that is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query.
- the combined content item can be augmented.
- one or more entities related to the first entity can be identified, and one or more content items can be identified from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities. At least one of the identified one or more content items can be selected for use in augmenting the combined content item. The selected at least one identified one or more content items can be added in whole or part to the combined content item or used as the basis for content that is augmented (e.g., actionable links).
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the content management system 110 in response to a request for content (e.g., a search query 116 ), can provide a combined content item 133 , e.g., as a first search result among the search results 118 .
- the content management system 110 can create the combined content item 133 , for example, by combining a top one of the search results 118 with one of the eligible content items 131 that is associated with a same brand as the top one of the search results 118 .
- a content item associated with a same entity i.e., not necessarily same brand
- the content management system 110 can include plural engines.
- a content identification engine 121 can evaluate terms and phrases in query (e.g., the search query 116 ) received by the content management system 110 to identify content responsive to the request.
- the content can include at least one eligible content item (e.g., from a data store of eligible content items 131 , including advertisements) and search results (e.g., search results 118 ) that are responsive to the query.
- the content identification engine 121 can also identify a first search result in a top set of search results that is associated with a brand. As an example, there can be several search results, and some search results can be associated with a specific brand.
- the content identification engine 121 can select a top, or best matching, search result.
- the at least one eligible content item that is identified can include content items that are identified for delivery along with the search results 118 that are responsive to the search query 116 .
- An entity/brand determination engine 122 can determine when at least one of the eligible content items identified by the content identification engine 121 is associated with a same entity/brand as the entity/brand associated with the first (e.g., top) search result of the search results.
- the eligible content items 131 can be advertisements for Example Brand shoes, which can be the same brand that is associated with a top one of the search results 118 .
- a content item combination engine 123 can combine a first search result and one of the determined at least one eligible content items into a combined content item. For example, to create the combined content item 133 , the content item combination engine 123 can combine an identified one (e.g., a top-ranked one) of the search results 118 associated with Example Brand with one of the eligible content items 131 that is also associated with the brand (e.g., an advertisement for Example Brand shoes).
- an identified one e.g., a top-ranked one
- a request handler 124 can handle requests for content received by the content management system 110 , and in response to each request, provide one or more content items to the requestor.
- the request for content can be a request to fill a content item slot on a web page displayed in a browser on the user device 106 .
- the request handler 124 can provide a content item, e.g., a shoe advertisement having characteristics that match the characteristics of an advertisement slot on the user device 106 .
- a search system 112 can provide initial search results 118 in response to received search queries 116 .
- the request handler 124 can combine one of the search results and one or more content items in response to the received search query 116 to produce integrated search results 119 .
- the integrated search results 119 can include, for example, the combined content item 133 created by the content item combination engine 123 .
- the combining can occur at the content management system 110 .
- the combining can occur at the user device 106 , e.g., in a browser.
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110 , stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102 , generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination thereof.
- a data store of eligible content items 131 can include content items (e.g., advertisements) that can be selected by the content management system 110 in response to a content item request, such as a search query 116 .
- a data store of brands 132 can include information about brands that can be used (e.g., by the entity/brand determination engine 122 ) to determine if different content items are associated with the same brand.
- the information can include, for example, the name of the brand and any other brand-related indicators, such as brand owner information (e.g., addresses, URLs, phone numbers), model numbers, model names, and other brand-unique and/or brand-identifying information.
- a data store of entities 133 can include information that can be used to identify one or more entities associated with a content item.
- the entities 133 can also include information that can be used to identify entities that are related to another entity.
- the information in the entities 133 can include, for example, associated with each entity: entity name(s), terms (e.g., brands, models and other terms), location information (e.g., a physical address), uniform resource locators (URLs), sponsors (e.g., content sponsors, retailers), and other entity-related information.
- a list of related entities can be stored in association with a given entity that is an entry in the entities 133 .
- Related entities can be determined in numerous ways.
- a given entity can specify related entities.
- related entities can be determined, such as by evaluating received data, such as data related to delivery of content (e.g., ads). Other methods can be used.
- content sponsors 108 can be provided with an interface for defining settings for creating combined content items. For example, content sponsors 108 can specify whether or not they want their content items to be combined with a search result and presented to the user as a combined content item. Other settings are possible, such as settings that define the style and/or content of combined content items.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language

- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can, for example, access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a webpage title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the webpage, and the URL of the webpage.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other webpages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- one or more entries from the search results 118 can be combined with one or more eligible content items to create integrated search result 119 .
- the integrated search result 119 can then be delivered responsive to the received query 116 .
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection or other interaction with) of their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- conversions may be more likely to occur, for example, when a user is presented with a content item that is a combined content item containing content from a search result and content from an advertisement that is related to the search based on being associated with the same brand. For example, the user may be more likely to click on or otherwise interact with a search result if the search result contains advertisement information and other interesting features that may entice the user to interact with the search result in some way.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 2A shows an example system 200 for creating a combined content item using information from a content item associated with a same brand. While the example discussed refers to same brand, the system can be used for creating combined content items for other entities.
- the content management system 110 can provide a combined content item 202 to be presented as a search result entry 204 a along with other search results 204 .
- the combined content item 202 can include content from a first search result 214 a (responsive to the search query 206 ) that is combined with content from a content item 216 a (also selected based at least in part on the search query 206 ).
- a more detailed example follows using an example sequence of stages 1-5.
- the content management system 110 can receive a search query 206 (e.g., “shoes”) from the user device 106 .
- the search query 206 can be received by the request handler 124 .
- the search query 206 can include one or more terms or phrases and can be entered, for example, by a user 208 in a query control 210 on a web page 212 .
- Other sources of the search query 206 are possible, and the search query 206 can include other selection criteria, e.g., based on the user's location, interests, device type, and/or other criteria.
- the content identification engine 121 can identify search results 214 that are responsive to the search query 206 .
- the identified search results 214 can be obtained, for example, using an index such as described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the identified search results 214 can include the first search result 214 a , e.g., that is associated with Example Brand shoes.
- the identified search results 214 can also include other search results that may be associated with the same brand, other different brands, or no brand at all. Some search results can be associated with multiple brands.
- the content identification engine 121 can also identify eligible content items 216 , such as advertisements or other sponsored content, that are to be presented with the search results 214 and that are selected, based at least in part, on the search query 206 .
- the identification can also be based on the search query 206 and other information and/or signals (e.g., the user's current location) that are received from the user device 106 or otherwise derived.
- the eligible content items 216 that are identified can include, for example, a content item 216 a that is one of at least one advertisement for Example Brand shoes.
- the eligible content items 216 can also include, for example, other advertisements for brands that are different from Example Brand.
- the entity/brand determination engine 122 can determine ( 218 ), when at least one of the eligible content items 216 is associated with a same brand as the brand associated with the first search result 214 a .
- the determination 218 can be made, for example, using brand information accessed from brands 132 .
- the entity/brand determination engine 122 can make a determination as to whether one or more of the eligible content items 216 is associated with a same brand (e.g., Example Brand shoes) as the first search result 214 a .
- the entity/brand determination engine 122 can determine that content item 216 a , e.g., an advertisement for Example Brand shoes, is associated with Example Brand shoes.
- determining that a search result (or content item) is associated with a brand can include using one or more terms, text or other information from the search result (or content item) to look up corresponding brand names in the brands 132 .
- the first search result and one of the determined at least one eligible content items are combined into a combined content item, and the combined content item is provided as a search result responsive to the request ( 310 ).
- the content item combination engine 123 can create the combined content item 202 (e.g., a single unit presentable with search results) that is a combination of the first search result 214 a and the content item 216 a , both of which are associated with the same brand (e.g., Example Brand shoes).
- a different (e.g., non-first) search result can be combined with the at least one eligible content items into a combined content item.
- different factors can be used to decide what information to include in a combined content item.
- content sponsors 108 may have preferences and/or priorities as to which features of content items are to be included, e.g., images, location information, user reviews, and other information.
- the content selected to create the combined content item can depend, at least in part, on the device type of the user associated with the query (e.g., search query 206 ), e.g., so as to produce a combined content item that is fully viewable on the screen of whatever device the user currently has.
- the request handler 124 can provide the combined content item 202 to the user device 106 in response to the received search query 206 .
- the combined content item 202 can be displayed, for example, as the search result entry 204 a , e.g., the first search result among the search results 204 .
- FIG. 2B shows an example combined content item.
- the content management system 110 in response to the search query 206 (e.g., “shoes”) entered in the query control 210 , the content management system 110 has provided the search result entry 204 a as the first entry among the search results 204 .
- Search results 204 also include other search results 204 b .

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. Search results responsive to a query are identified including a first search result in a top set of search results, the first search result associated with a first entity. A first eligible content item is identified for presentation along with the search results, the first eligible content item associated with the first entity. A combined content item is identified that is a combination of the first search result and first eligible content item and is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query. The combined content item is augmented including: identifying entities related to the first entity, identifying content items that are associated with the related entities, selecting at least one identified content item, and using content from the selected content items to augment the combined content item.
Description
This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/943,281, filed on Jul. 16, 2013, the disclosure of which is considered part of and is incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.
This specification relates to information presentation.
The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results.
Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content. The content can be provided to a user device such as a personal computer (PC), a smartphone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or some other user device.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes receiving a search query. The method further includes identifying search results responsive to the query including a first search result in a top set of search results wherein the first search result is associated with a first entity. The method further includes identifying a first eligible content item based on the search results for presentation along with the search results, the first eligible content item being associated with the first entity. The method further includes identifying a combined content item that is a combination of the first search result and the first eligible content item and is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query. The method further includes augmenting the combined content item including: identifying one or more entities related to the first entity, identifying one or more content items from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities, selecting at least one of the identified one or more content items based on a selection criteria, and using content from the selected at least one identified one or more content items to augment the combined content item.

Identifying one or more content items from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities can include identifying one or more content items that are sponsored by the one or more identified related entities. Selecting can include conducting an auction and using selection criteria that includes performance information related to either the one or more related entities or the identified one or more content items. Augmenting can include adding a link to a landing page associated with the one or more content items. Augmenting can include adding a text advertisement sponsored by the one or more related entities. Augmenting can include determining a format for content to be added and adding the one or more content items in accordance with the determined format.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: receive a search query; identify search results responsive to the query including a first search result in a top set of search results wherein the first search result is associated with a first entity; identify a first eligible content item based on the search results for presentation along with the search results, the first eligible content item being associated with the first entity; identify a combined content item that is a combination of the first search result and the first eligible content item and is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query; and augment the combined content item including: identifying one or more entities related to the first entity, identifying one or more content items from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities; selecting at least one of the identified one or more content items based on a selection criteria; and using content from the selected at least one identified one or more content items to augment the combined content item.

The system includes a content identification engine that evaluates terms and phrases in a received query to identify content responsive to the request. The system further includes an entity/brand determination engine that determines when at least one of the eligible content items identified by the content identification engine is associated with a same entity/brand as an entity/brand associated with a first search result of the search results. The system further includes a content item combination engine that combines the first search result and one of the determined at least one eligible content items into a combined content item. The system further includes a request handler that handles requests for content received by the content management system. The system further includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: receive a search query; identify search results responsive to the query including a first search result in a top set of search results wherein the first search result is associated with a first entity; identify a first eligible content item based on the search results for presentation along with the search results, the first eligible content item being associated with the first entity; identify a combined content item that is a combination of the first search result and the first eligible content item and is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query; and augment the combined content item including: identifying one or more entities related to the first entity, identifying one or more content items from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities; selecting at least one of the identified one or more content items based on a selection criteria; and using content from the selected at least one identified one or more content items to augment the combined content item.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Augmenting can include adding a link to a landing page associated with the one or more content items. Augmenting can include adding a text advertisement sponsored by the one or more related entities. Augmenting can include determining a format for content to be added and adding the one or more content items in accordance with the determined format. The first entity can be a brand.
Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Combined content items (e.g., a combined search result entry) can be automatically created using content from a search result associated with a brand and a content item (e.g., advertisement) associated with the same brand. Users can be presented with a combined content item that may be more interesting because the content item includes content from different sources. The combined content item can also be augmented with other information, such as information (e.g., content) from retailers, suppliers, or other content sponsors that are associated with the brand or entity. In some implementations, retailer information can be turned into actionable links that users can use to access brand-related or entity-related content provided by the other content sponsors.
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
This document describes systems, methods, computer program products and mechanisms for creating a combined content item that combines content from a search result and a content item that are both associated with the same entity (e.g., brand, sponsor or other entity). For example, the search result can be one of (e.g., the first or top search result in) search results that are provided in response to a query. The content item (e.g., an advertisement) can be selected (based on being associated with the same brand) from one or more eligible content items that are also identified, based at least in part, on a received query. The combined content item that is created can be presented with the search results, e.g. as the first search result.
In some implementations, combined content items can incorporate content from content sponsors of related entities. The related entities can be related, for example, to an entity associated with a content item that matches selection criteria associated with a received request. In an example, in response to a received search query, search results responsive to the query can be identified, including identifying a first search result in a top set of search results. The first search result can be associated with a first entity. A first eligible content item (that is associated with the first entity) can be identified based on the search results for presentation along with the search results. A combined content item can be identified that is a combination of the first search result and the first eligible content item and that is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query. The combined content item can be augmented. For example, one or more entities related to the first entity can be identified, and one or more content items can be identified from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities. At least one of the identified one or more content items can be selected for use in augmenting the combined content item. The selected at least one identified one or more content items can be added in whole or part to the combined content item or used as the basis for content that is augmented (e.g., actionable links).
In some implementations, in response to a request for content (e.g., a search query 116), the content management system 110 can provide a combined content item 133, e.g., as a first search result among the search results 118. The content management system 110 can create the combined content item 133, for example, by combining a top one of the search results 118 with one of the eligible content items 131 that is associated with a same brand as the top one of the search results 118. In some implementations, a content item associated with a same entity (i.e., not necessarily same brand) can be combined with a search result that is associated with the same respective entity. A more detailed description as to how the combined content item 133 is created is included below.
The content management system 110 can include plural engines. A content identification engine 121, for example, can evaluate terms and phrases in query (e.g., the search query 116) received by the content management system 110 to identify content responsive to the request. The content can include at least one eligible content item (e.g., from a data store of eligible content items 131, including advertisements) and search results (e.g., search results 118) that are responsive to the query. In some implementations, the content identification engine 121 can also identify a first search result in a top set of search results that is associated with a brand. As an example, there can be several search results, and some search results can be associated with a specific brand. From the top search results that are associated with the brand and that may be ranked highest as being responsive to the search query 116, for example, the content identification engine 121 can select a top, or best matching, search result. The at least one eligible content item that is identified can include content items that are identified for delivery along with the search results 118 that are responsive to the search query 116.
An entity/brand determination engine 122, for example, can determine when at least one of the eligible content items identified by the content identification engine 121 is associated with a same entity/brand as the entity/brand associated with the first (e.g., top) search result of the search results. For example, one or more of the eligible content items 131 can be advertisements for Example Brand shoes, which can be the same brand that is associated with a top one of the search results 118.
A content item combination engine 123, for example, can combine a first search result and one of the determined at least one eligible content items into a combined content item. For example, to create the combined content item 133, the content item combination engine 123 can combine an identified one (e.g., a top-ranked one) of the search results 118 associated with Example Brand with one of the eligible content items 131 that is also associated with the brand (e.g., an advertisement for Example Brand shoes).
A request handler 124, for example, can handle requests for content received by the content management system 110, and in response to each request, provide one or more content items to the requestor. For example, the request for content can be a request to fill a content item slot on a web page displayed in a browser on the user device 106. In response to the request for content, the request handler 124 can provide a content item, e.g., a shoe advertisement having characteristics that match the characteristics of an advertisement slot on the user device 106. A search system 112 can provide initial search results 118 in response to received search queries 116. The request handler 124, for example, can combine one of the search results and one or more content items in response to the received search query 116 to produce integrated search results 119. The integrated search results 119 can include, for example, the combined content item 133 created by the content item combination engine 123. In some implementations, the combining can occur at the content management system 110. In some implementations, the combining can occur at the user device 106, e.g., in a browser.
The environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination thereof. A data store of eligible content items 131, for example, can include content items (e.g., advertisements) that can be selected by the content management system 110 in response to a content item request, such as a search query 116. A data store of brands 132, for example, can include information about brands that can be used (e.g., by the entity/brand determination engine 122) to determine if different content items are associated with the same brand. The information can include, for example, the name of the brand and any other brand-related indicators, such as brand owner information (e.g., addresses, URLs, phone numbers), model numbers, model names, and other brand-unique and/or brand-identifying information. A data store of entities 133, for example, can include information that can be used to identify one or more entities associated with a content item. The entities 133 can also include information that can be used to identify entities that are related to another entity. The information in the entities 133 can include, for example, associated with each entity: entity name(s), terms (e.g., brands, models and other terms), location information (e.g., a physical address), uniform resource locators (URLs), sponsors (e.g., content sponsors, retailers), and other entity-related information. In some implementations, a list of related entities can be stored in association with a given entity that is an entry in the entities 133. Related entities can be determined in numerous ways. In some implementations, a given entity can specify related entities. In some implementations, related entities can be determined, such as by evaluating received data, such as data related to delivery of content (e.g., ads). Other methods can be used.
In some implementations, content sponsors 108 can be provided with an interface for defining settings for creating combined content items. For example, content sponsors 108 can specify whether or not they want their content items to be combined with a search result and presented to the user as a combined content item. Other settings are possible, such as settings that define the style and/or content of combined content items.
A website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
A resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102. A resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts).
A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
A user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104. In turn, data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106. The data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114.
When a resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by a user device 106, the content management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110.
For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116.
Based at least in part on data included in the request, the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals.
The content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection or other interaction with) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
In some implementations, conversions may be more likely to occur, for example, when a user is presented with a content item that is a combined content item containing content from a search result and content from an advertisement that is related to the search based on being associated with the same brand. For example, the user may be more likely to click on or otherwise interact with a search result if the search result contains advertisement information and other interesting features that may entice the user to interact with the search result in some way.
For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
At stage 1, the content management system 110, for example, can receive a search query 206 (e.g., “shoes”) from the user device 106. In some implementations, the search query 206 can be received by the request handler 124. The search query 206 can include one or more terms or phrases and can be entered, for example, by a user 208 in a query control 210 on a web page 212. Other sources of the search query 206 are possible, and the search query 206 can include other selection criteria, e.g., based on the user's location, interests, device type, and/or other criteria.
At stage 2, the content identification engine 121, for example, can identify search results 214 that are responsive to the search query 206. The identified search results 214 can be obtained, for example, using an index such as described above with reference to FIG. 1 . The identified search results 214 can include the first search result 214 a, e.g., that is associated with Example Brand shoes. The identified search results 214 can also include other search results that may be associated with the same brand, other different brands, or no brand at all. Some search results can be associated with multiple brands.
At stage 3, the content identification engine 121, for example, can also identify eligible content items 216, such as advertisements or other sponsored content, that are to be presented with the search results 214 and that are selected, based at least in part, on the search query 206. The identification can also be based on the search query 206 and other information and/or signals (e.g., the user's current location) that are received from the user device 106 or otherwise derived. The eligible content items 216 that are identified can include, for example, a content item 216 a that is one of at least one advertisement for Example Brand shoes. The eligible content items 216 can also include, for example, other advertisements for brands that are different from Example Brand.
At stage 4, the entity/brand determination engine 122, for example, can determine (218), when at least one of the eligible content items 216 is associated with a same brand as the brand associated with the first search result 214 a. The determination 218 can be made, for example, using brand information accessed from brands 132. The entity/brand determination engine 122, for example, can make a determination as to whether one or more of the eligible content items 216 is associated with a same brand (e.g., Example Brand shoes) as the first search result 214 a. For example, the entity/brand determination engine 122 can determine that content item 216 a, e.g., an advertisement for Example Brand shoes, is associated with Example Brand shoes. In some implementations, determining that a search result (or content item) is associated with a brand can include using one or more terms, text or other information from the search result (or content item) to look up corresponding brand names in the brands 132.
At stage 5, the first search result and one of the determined at least one eligible content items are combined into a combined content item, and the combined content item is provided as a search result responsive to the request (310). For example, the content item combination engine 123 can create the combined content item 202 (e.g., a single unit presentable with search results) that is a combination of the first search result 214 a and the content item 216 a, both of which are associated with the same brand (e.g., Example Brand shoes). In some implementations, a different (e.g., non-first) search result can be combined with the at least one eligible content items into a combined content item.
In some implementations, different factors can be used to decide what information to include in a combined content item. For example, content sponsors 108 may have preferences and/or priorities as to which features of content items are to be included, e.g., images, location information, user reviews, and other information. In some implementations, the content selected to create the combined content item can depend, at least in part, on the device type of the user associated with the query (e.g., search query 206), e.g., so as to produce a combined content item that is fully viewable on the screen of whatever device the user currently has.
The request handler 124, for example, can provide the combined content item 202 to the user device 106 in response to the received search query 206. The combined content item 202 can be displayed, for example, as the search result entry 204 a, e.g., the first search result among the search results 204.
In the example shown, the search result entry 204 a is a combined content item that includes, from the content item 216 a, an advertisement image 220, a visual URL 222, text 224, the landing page link 226, a map 227, a physical address 228, business hours 229, review information 230, controls 232 (e.g., for obtaining map directions or writing a review), and retailer information 234. Other types and formats of content can be included in a combined content item, including, for example, audio, video, animation, content obtained from social networks, and other content.
A search query is received (302). For example, the request handler 124 can receive the search query 206 (e.g., “shoes”) from the user device 106. The search query 206, for example, can be entered by the user 208 in a query control 210 on the web page 212.
Search results responsive to the query are identified, including identifying a first search result in a top set of search results that is associated with a brand (304). For example, the content identification engine 121 can identify search results 214 that are responsive to terms and phrases in the search query 206. The identified search results 214 can be obtained, for example, using an index, such as described above with reference to FIG. 1 . The identified search results 214 can include the first search result 214 a, e.g., that is associated with Example Brand shoes. The identified search results 214 can also include other search results that may be associated with the same brand, other different brands, or no brand at all. In some implementations, the first search result (e.g., first search result 214 a) that is identified can be the top search result, e.g., the first entry of the search results 118 that are responsive to the query 116. In some implementations, the first search result can be a search results entry that is not the top result (e.g., a second result, or a different result on a same page).
Based at least in part on the query, one or more eligible content items are identified for delivery along with the search results responsive to the query (306). As an example, the content identification engine 121 can identify eligible content items 216, such as advertisements or other sponsored content, that are to be presented with the search results 214 and that are selected, at least based in part, on the search query 206. The advertisements can include, for example, at least one advertisement for Example Brand shoes and other advertisements for brands that are different from Example Brand.
A determination is made when at least one of the eligible content items is associated with a same brand as the brand associated with the first search result (308). The entity/brand determination engine 122, for example, can make a determination as to whether one or more of the eligible content items 216 is associated with a same brand (e.g., Example Brand shoes) as the first search result 214 a. For example, the entity/brand determination engine 122 can determine that content item 216 a, e.g., an advertisement for Example Brand shoes, is associated with Example Brand shoes. There can be other brand-related matches between the eligible content items 216 and other ones of the search results 214.
In some implementations, determining when the at least one of the eligible content items is associated with a same brand can include determining that one content item is sponsored by an owner of the brand. For example, the entity/brand determination engine 122 can determine that the content item 216 a (e.g., the advertisement for Example Brand shoes) is owned, e.g., by Example Brand Inc., who may also be the content sponsor 108 for the Example Brand shoes advertisement.
In some implementations, determining when at least one of the eligible content items is associated with a same brand can include determining that one eligible content item is associated with a retailer associated with the brand. For example, one or more of the content item 216 a (e.g., the advertisement for Example Brand shoes) and the first search result 214 a can be associated with the same retailer, e.g., a retailer that corresponds to retailer information 234 a.
The first search result and one of the determined at least one eligible content items are combined into a combined content item, and the combined content item is provided as a search result responsive to the request (310). For example, the content item combination engine 123 can create the combined content item 202 (e.g., a single unit presentable with search results) that is a combination of the first search result 214 a and the content item 216 a that are both associated with the same Example Brand shoes brand.
In some implementations, combining includes combining a visual universal resource locator (VisURL), a title, text from the determined one eligible content item, or a link to a landing page from the determined one eligible content item into the combined content item. For example, the combined content item 202 that is created by the content item combination engine 123 can include the visual URL 222, text 224 and a landing page link 226. The combined content item 202 can also include content 204 c, which can include some or all of the first search result 214 a. In some implementations, there can be some overlap of content in the first search result 214 a and the content item 216 a, such as the same link to a same landing page. In some implementations, duplicative information is not included in a combined content item.
In some implementations, combining can include combining other information associated with the brand in the combination content item. For example, the combined content item 202 can also include a map 227 to one or more retail locations associated with brand retail presence, retailer information 234 associated with the brand and that can provide actionable links for retailers of, or associated with, the brand (e.g., Example Brand shoes). Other information can also be included, such as a physical address 228, business hours 229, and rating information 230.
In some implementations, combining can include designating content from the at least one eligible content item that is included in the combined content item as sponsored content. For example, the content item combination engine 123 can specify that the combined content item 202 be sponsored content that is included with the search results 204.
In some implementations, combined content items can be presented in a way that indicates at least a partial sponsorship. For example, combined content items can be presented for display using a special font, a special block, a different background, or some other visual different from other content items.
In some implementations, the process 300 can further include monetizing interactions with material that is included from the at least one eligible content item that is included in the combined content item based on user interactions with the material. For example, once the combined content item 202 is provided as the search result entry 204 a, the content management system 110 can monetize the search result entry 204 a as if it is the same content item 202. In some implementations, the monetization can occur at a different rate (e.g., a special combined content item rate) than a standard rate that would apply to the content item 216 a.
A search query is received (322). For example, the request handler 124 can receive the search query 206 (e.g., “shoes”) from the user device 106. The search query 206, for example, can be entered by the user 208 in a query control 210 on the web page 212.
Search results responsive to the query are identified including a first search result in a top set of search results (324). The first search result can be associated with a first entity (e.g., a brand). As an example, the content identification engine 121 can identify search results 214 that are responsive to terms and phrases in the search query 206. The identified search results 214 can be obtained, for example, using an index, such as described above with reference to FIG. 1 . The identified search results 214 can include the first search result 214 a, e.g., that is associated with Example Brand shoes. The identified search results 214 can also include other search results that may be associated with the same brand, other different brands, or no brand at all. In some implementations, the first search result 214 a that is identified can be the top search result among a top set of search results 118 (e.g., displayed on a first page) that are responsive to the query 116. In some implementations, the first search result can be a search results entry that is not the top result (e.g., a second search results entry, or a different search results entry on a same page).
A first eligible content item is identified based on the search results for presentation along with the search results (326). The first eligible content item is associated with the first entity. As an example, the content identification engine 121 can identify eligible content items 216, such as advertisements or other sponsored content, that are selected, at least based in part, on the search query 206. From the eligible content items 216, the content identification engine 121 can identify the content item 216 a that is to be presented with the search results 214. The advertisements can include, for example, at least one advertisement related to the Example Brand shoes entity and other advertisements for brands that may or may not be the same as Example Brand.
In some implementations, the first eligible content item can be sponsored by an owner of the brand. For example, the owner of the brand Example Brand Shoes can be the content sponsor 108 associated with the content item 216 a.
A combined content item is identified that is a combination of the first search result and the first eligible content item and is to be presented as a search result responsive to the query (328). As an example, the content item combination engine 123 can create the combined content item 202 (e.g., a single unit presentable with search results) using the first search result 214 a and the content item 216 a.
The combined content item is augmented (330). For example, the content item combination engine 123 can augment the combined content item 202 using content from the at least one other content item, as described in the following stages.
One or more entities related to the first entity are identified (332). As an example, the entity/brand determination engine 122 can identify other entities 133 that are related to the entity associated with Example Brand shoes. The related entities can include, for example, entities that are commercially related to the brand, such as retailers for the brand (e.g., brick-and-mortar or online stores that sell Example Brand shoes).
In some implementations, identifying one or more related entities can include using a graph of related entities to determine one or more commercially related entities. For example, the entity/brand determination engine 122 can use one or more graphs that identify relationships among entities. Separate nodes in the graph(s), for example, can be used to represent entities. Edges on the graph(s), for example, can represent relationships between nodes, e.g., indicating that two entities are related. Other information on the nodes and edges of the graph(s) can be used, e.g., to indicate the strength of the relationships of for other purposes. Other structures besides graphs can also be used. In some implementations, knowledge graphs or other mechanisms can be used to associate various ones of products, entities, brands and other items of interest.
One or more content items are identified from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities (334). For example, the content identification engine 121 can identify one or more eligible content items 131 that are associated with the related entities.
In some implementations, identifying one or more content items from an inventory of content items that are associated with the one or more identified related entities can include identifying one or more content items that are sponsored by the one or more identified related entities. For example, the content identification engine 121 can identify eligible content items 216 that are sponsored by retailers of Example Brand shoes.
At least one of the identified one or more content items is selected based on a selection criteria (336). For example, the content identification engine 121 can identify a particular one of the eligible content items 216 using selection criteria, e.g., selecting the content item 216 b that is a content item related to a retailer of Example Brand shoes. Selection criteria can be the same as used when selecting the eligible content items 214 or can be different, such as to favor particular entity relationships over others (e.g., a preferred related entity).
In some implementations, selecting can include conducting an auction and using selection criteria that includes performance information related to either the one or more related entities or the identified one or more content items. For example, an auction can be used that can, for example, result in the selection of a content item related to a retailer of Example Brand shoes over other content items, e.g., based on click-through rates or other performance-related information associated with the content item.
Content from the selected at least one identified one or more content items is used to augment the combined content item (338). For example, the content item combination engine 123 can add content from the Example Brand retailer advertisement to the combined content item 202.
In some implementations, augmenting can include adding a link to a landing page associated with the one or more content items. As an example, the content item combination engine 123 can add retailer information 234, which can include clickable links to landing pages or other web pages of various retailers of Example Brand shoes.
In some implementations, augmenting can include adding a text advertisement sponsored by the one or more related entities. As an example, the content item combination engine 123 can add various ones of the components 204 c, 224, 228, 229, 230 and 222 or other advertisement text from the content item 216 b.
In some implementations, augmenting can include determining a format for content to be added and adding the content in accordance with the determined format. For example, the content item combination engine 123 can use format information that identifies how added content is to appear in the search result entry 204 a.
