Definitions
- This application relates generally to systems and methods for scoring associated with information matching, and more particularly to scoring of matches between unstructured information and structured information.
- Web sites for sharing of digital media have become commonplace.
- the web sites may be accessed to upload music and video files, and to find music and video files to download, listen to or view, as authorized.
- users of such web sites provide descriptive terms for the music and video files when uploading the files to the web sites.
- the descriptive terms can facilitate appropriately categorizing and storing of the uploaded files, for example.
- the descriptive terms can be as varied as the users who think them up. For example, one user might describe an uploaded music or video file in terms of a full title and artist name, while another user might describe an uploaded file in terms of a partial title and a venue where a live performance took place, and so on. Because the descriptive terms can be free-form and may not occur in any particular pattern, the descriptive terms may be considered “unstructured.”
- databases that store media files are typically highly organized and structured, to facilitate efficient storing, searching and retrieval of data.
- a database might organize music or video files according to fixed, pre-defined patterns. For example, a particular database might use a particular indexing system or systems with strict rules about how files are to be described. Such a database may be thought of as “structured.”
- Correctly identifying newly-uploaded files can assist in storing the files within a structured database in such a way that efficiencies in database space utilization, search and data retrieval can be realized. For example, accurately matching unstructured descriptive terms corresponding to a newly-uploaded file to organizing information or predefined field in a structured database can open up possibilities for clustering groups of files which all match the same reference. This can make database navigation and data retrieval more efficient, and can promote more efficient content identification.
- This specification relates generally to systems and methods for scoring of information matching, and more particularly to scoring of matches of unstructured information against a database of structured information.
- the systems and methods can assign a score to structured reference data based on matching of unstructured descriptive information with the structured reference data.
- the systems and methods can take into account the structured nature of the reference data in assigning the score. This can facilitate increased confidence in the information matching, and consequently, improved database organization and content identification.

- FIG. 2 illustrates interaction of the scoring system with associated data
- FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate examples of methodologies in accordance with embodiments of the scoring system
- FIG. 5 illustrates additional components associated with the scoring system in accordance with embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 6 illustrates another example methodology in accordance with embodiments of the scoring system
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example schematic block diagram for a computing environment in accordance with the subject specification.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example block diagram of a computer operable to execute the disclosed embodiments.
- Embodiments of systems for scoring information matching can include a matching component and a scoring component.
- the matching component can apply unstructured descriptive information, such as free-form descriptive terms associated with a media item, to a structured reference database to select a set of candidate reference items for scoring.
- the structured reference database more specifically, can include a plurality of reference items including structured descriptive information, and the set of candidate reference items can be one or more of the reference items including structured descriptive information that matches one or more aspects of the unstructured descriptive information.
- the scoring component can assign a score to one or more (e.g., each) of the candidate reference items based on one or more predetermined criteria.
- the one or more predetermined criteria can include, for example: a degree or extent to which an element of the structured descriptive information is discriminative (as expressed, e.g., by a weighting factor assigned to an element); a length or number of matching terms between the structured descriptive information and the unstructured descriptive information; and an occurrence of a same sequence or ordering of matching terms between the structured descriptive information and the unstructured descriptive information.
- the one or more scores produced by the scoring component can be useful in a number of ways.
- the scores can be used to facilitate identification of candidate reference items that likely represent “false positives” produced by the matching component—that is, that correspond to instances where the matching component selects a candidate reference item from the reference database even though the probability is low that the candidate item is a correct match for the unstructured descriptive information.
- the scores can have an advantageous sifting or winnowing effect on the candidate reference items produced by the matching component. More specifically, based on their scores candidate reference items corresponding to false positives can be eliminated from the overall pool of candidate reference items, and operations can go forward with a higher confidence that candidate reference items remaining in the pool are correctly matched with the unstructured descriptive information.
- the scoring component can promote efficiencies by creating possibilities for clustering same or similar data files, facilitating improved database navigation, searching and file retrieval, and lowering the burden in subsequent processing of files for content identification. That is, by more accurately categorizing and grouping files based on operations of the scoring component, subsequent examination of files to identify their actual content can be made easier, which among other things can also promote the improved database operations described in the foregoing.
- component as used herein, and the variously-labeled component blocks as shown in the drawings, are not intended to suggest that a labeled component is necessarily discrete and separate from another labeled component.
- the labeled components can be dispersed or intermixed.
- a particular label for a component rather than indicating any limitation on its capabilities, should be understood as a categorization that generally describes one or a group of structures, capabilities, features or operations associated with the component. However, the structures, capabilities, features or operations may be shared with other components, or may cooperate with other components for combined effects.
- the components can be operative within a network, such as the Internet.
- a network such as the Internet.
- Network implementations facilitating embodiments of the components are described in more detail further on, with reference to FIGS. 7 and 8 .
- a scoring system 100 can include a matching component 101 and a scoring component 102 that can communicate with each other.
- the matching component 101 can apply unstructured descriptive information, such as the free-form, user-supplied descriptive terms described in the preceding, to a reference database 103 .
- the unstructured descriptive information may also be referred to herein as “unstructured metadata.”
- the reference database 103 can include a plurality of reference data items.
- the reference data items can include digital media files, for example, whose content is already known and which are already organized (e.g., sorted, categorized, identified, classified, grouped, clustered) according to a known, existing system, such as an indexing system.
- the known information about the reference data items may, thus, be considered structured descriptive information, also referred to herein as “structured metadata.”
- the matching component 101 can apply unstructured metadata to the reference database 103 to try to match the unstructured metadata with structured metadata in the reference database 103 .
- the meaning of “match” or “matching” in this context can include various aspects of determining a similarity or correspondence between things.
- “matching” can refer to comparing elements or aspects of the unstructured metadata with elements or aspects of the structured metadata, and using predefined objective criteria to determine a similarity or correspondence between the compared elements or aspects.
- a “match” need not refer only to things that are exact counterparts or duplicates of each other, although such counterparts are also matches.
- the predefined objective criteria referred to in the preceding need not require, in order to determine that given metadata elements or aspects match, that the given metadata elements or aspects be exactly the same in their content, or in their sequence, or that the given metadata elements or aspects exactly meet any other requirements; this could be unduly restrictive and exclude true matches in terms of the actual content of those things that the metadata elements or aspects describe.
- the predefined objective criteria can be inclusive in an effort to ensure that true matches are not excluded. Accordingly, the matching component 101 can, based on the applied unstructured metadata, return results that include false positives among true matches.
- the matching component 101 can return, as a result of matching of the unstructured metadata to the structured metadata, a set of “candidate” reference data items from the reference database 103 , where the set of reference data items are candidates in the sense that they will undergo further processing by the scoring component 102 to evaluate the likelihood that they are true matches.
- the scoring system 100 can receive as input unstructured metadata 201 .
- a source of the unstructured metadata 201 can include, for example, a network-based media hosting and delivery system 250 , such as a music and/or video sharing web site and associated components (e.g., servers and communication equipment).
- a network-based media hosting and delivery system 250 such as a music and/or video sharing web site and associated components (e.g., servers and communication equipment).
- users of such web sites can upload digital music and video files, and when doing so, provide free-form descriptive information, for example in the form of typed text entered via an interface, about the uploaded files.
- the free-form descriptive information can be stored on a storage device either temporarily or for an indefinite duration.
- the scoring system 100 can further include a communication component 203 , and receive the unstructured metadata 201 via the communication component 203 .
- the communication component 203 can include components to facilitate handling and transfer of data, such as network components, I/O components, user interfaces, application programming interfaces, data read/write components, and the like.
- the communication component 203 can receive the unstructured metadata 201 and perform any needed processing or pre-processing of the unstructured metadata 201 , such as formatting, blocking, application of security measures, parsing and the like, and transfer the processed unstructured metadata 201 to the matching component 101 .
- the communication component 203 can further receive and process structured metadata 202 from the reference database 103 .
- the structured metadata can include data organized according to rules of a particular system. For example, for a reference database 103 storing digital music files, the rules could dictate that the files be organized in terms of a particular sequence and content for metadata describing each file stored. The terms could include, for example, a full artist name followed by a full composition title.
- the matching component 101 can process the unstructured metadata 201 and the structured metadata 202 to match the unstructured metadata 201 with or against the structured metadata 202 to produce or generate matches 204 .
- the matching can include operations as described previously, e.g., determining one or more aspects of similarity between the unstructured metadata 201 and the structured metadata 202 .
- the matching component 101 can compare individual terms, tokens or elements, e.g., atomic units as defined by objective standards, of the unstructured metadata 201 with individual terms, tokens or elements, e.g., atomic units, of the structured metadata 202 , and make a determination regarding similarity of the compared things. Additionally or alternatively, the matching component 101 can compare sequences of elements of the unstructured metadata 201 with sequences of elements of the structured metadata 202 , and make a determination regarding similarity of the compared things. Additionally or alternatively, the matching component 101 can make a determination regarding similarity based on some other objective standard or measure. Additionally or alternatively, the matching component 101 can make a determination regarding similarity between the unstructured metadata 201 and the structured metadata 202 based on any combination of the foregoing, with an output or result as denoted by matches 204 .
- individual terms, tokens or elements e.g., atomic units as defined by objective standards
- the matching component 101 can compare sequences of elements of the unstructured metadata
- an atomic unit can be a word or a letter, and a sequence can include a text string or a succession of words (e.g., at least two words).
- a determination regarding similarity based on an objective standard or measure can include the use of weighting factors, statistical information, and functions of the weighting factors and statistical information.
- reference item can refer to a file stored in the reference database, and any structured information describing the file.
- the structured information can correspond to structured metadata 202 described in the preceding, and may also be referred to herein as “reference metadata.”
- the structured information can include at least a portion of an entry in an index or catalog of the reference database, and can include such descriptive terms as a file name (e.g. a song or composition or video title) and an associated author name (e.g., an artist or band or creator name).
- a reference may be used herein to more completely mean “reference metadata associated with a reference item.”
- the matches 204 can include candidate reference metadata associated with candidate reference items.
- the candidate reference items can correspond, for example, to digital media files of known content stored in the reference database 103 .
- the matches 204 can be passed on for further evaluation by the scoring component 102 .
- the scoring component 102 can process the matches 204 , using operations described in more detail further on, to generate or produce or output scoring data 205 .
- the scoring data 205 can include a score assigned to one or more (e.g., each) candidate reference, where the score indicates a degree of confidence (e.g., relative to a perfect score or absolute certainty or knowledge) that the candidate reference is a true match with the unstructured metadata.
- the scoring component 102 can use statistical information, such as Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) information, associated with reference metadata in the reference database 103 .
- the IDF information can be pre-existing or can be computed.
- IDF information can be a measure of how frequently a token or term, such as a word, occurs in a corpus or collection of data. Accordingly, the IDF information can provide a measure of confidence in information searching and matching. For example, the more frequently a term occurs in a corpus of data, as signified by a correspondingly lower IDF value, the lower the confidence may be that a search result or match is a true match, because of the relatively high number of possible matches. On the other hand, the less frequently a term occurs in a corpus of data, as signified by a correspondingly lower IDF value, the higher the confidence may be that a search result or match is a true match, because of the relatively low number of possible matches.
- IDF Inverse Document Frequency
- the scoring component 102 can use IDF values for N-grams associated with the reference database 103 .
- N-gram can refer to a sequence of contiguous or consecutive terms or tokens or atomic units, however defined, in a corpus of data.
- unigram or “N-gram of size 1” can refer to a single term or token or atomic unit, e.g., a word
- bigram or “N-gram of size 2” can refer to a consecutive sequence of two terms or tokens or atomic units, e.g., two consecutive words; and so on.
- the IDF values can be structured in two inverted indices, one for unigrams and one for bigrams. Indexing can be implemented as an inverse mapping from a unigram and/or bigram to a reference in which a corresponding word or words occur, along with corresponding IDF values.
- indexing can provide information about the separation of elements in the structured metadata, such as the separation between an artist name and a song name in music metadata.
- unstructured metadata 201 may also be referred to as “probe metadata” or simply “Probe”
- structured metadata 202 may also be referred to as “reference metadata” or simply “Reference.”
- probe metadata can be matched with given reference metadata (e.g., by the matching component) in the reference database 103 , and a corresponding value can be assigned to the match.
- Operations associated with 301 can include, for example, looking up (e.g., by the matching component via the communication component) the IDF values in the two inverted indices, referred to earlier, for unigrams and bigrams in the given reference metadata, and associating each IDF value with its corresponding unigram or bigram.
- a score can be computed (e.g., by the scoring component) based on the value assigned to the match, and at 303 corresponding scoring data can be output (e.g., by the scoring component or communication component).
- component matching functions of IDF values and N-gram weights can be computed (e.g., by the matching component).
- results of the component matching functions can be weighted in a compound matching function (e.g., by the matching component), by weighting values associated with the given reference metadata, to produce a match result.
- component scoring functions of IDF values and N-gram weights can be computed (e.g., by the scoring component).
- results of the component scoring functions can be weighted in a compound scoring function (e.g., by the scoring component) to produce a score for the given reference metadata.
- A is the set of unigrams (e.g., single words) that match between M and N
- B is the set of bigrams (e.g., two consecutive words) that match between M and N.
- BigramWeight can be a bigram weight that is a pre-existing value that can be available, for example, from the reference database 103 or one or more associated databases, or that can be computed.
- TitleWeight and AuthorWeight can represent, respectively, a title weight (e.g., a weighting value assigned to reference metadata corresponding to a title associated with the reference item) and an author weight (e.g., a weighting value assigned to reference metadata corresponding to an author associated with the reference item).
- TitleWeight and AuthorWeight can represent pre-existing values that can be available, for example, from the reference database 103 or one or more associated databases, or that can be computed.
- Probe can represent probe metadata as described previously, and Reference.title and Reference.author can respectively represent reference metadata corresponding to a title associated with the reference item, and reference metadata corresponding to an author associated with the reference item.
- TitleWeight and AuthorWeight can correspond, respectively, to Reference.title and Reference.author.
- a result of 403 can correspond to the match result produced by 305 , as described previously.
- weighting as described in the foregoing is only one example of a way in which weighting can be applied.
- varying types of reference content can call for varying considerations in assigning weights to particular metadata elements, resulting in varying distributions of weighting values.
- the structured metadata can comprise any number of elements or fields, each of which can be assigned a weight depending on the appropriate considerations, and that the number of elements or fields is not limited to two (e.g., title and author) as in the foregoing example.
- U represents the unigrams included in X
- B represents the bigrams included in X.
- ReferenceWeight can represent a weight assigned to Reference (e.g., the reference or structured metadata 202 ), and can be a pre-existing value that can be available, for example, from the reference database 103 or one or more associated databases, or that can be computed.
- the unstructured metadata 201 is the text string “boom boom”; the text string may have been generated, for example, by a licensed user uploading a video to a media hosting and delivery system such as system 250 .
- IDF values for unigrams and bigrams in the reference database 103 are as follows:
- the scoring data 205 (represented by the result 0.52 in the preceding example) generated by the scoring systems and methodologies described in the foregoing can be useful, for example, in content identification.
- Content identification can involve examining a file, e.g., a digital media file, to determine (for example by melody matching, in the case of music media) the file's actual content.
- increased efficiency in content identification can facilitate, among other things, improved database navigation, searching and file retrieval.
- the scoring data 205 and the matches 204 can be processed, for example, by a filtering component 501 .
- the filtering component 501 can apply predetermined criteria to the scoring data 205 to thin the field of candidate reference items represented by the matches 204 .
- the predetermined criteria can specify one or more threshold scores that a candidate reference item must meet in order to be considered for further processing.
- a filtered set of matches 502 can be output by the filtering component 501 , where the filtered set of matches 502 is smaller than the full set of matches 204 .
- a content identification component 503 can process the filtered set of matches 502 , where the filtered set of matches 502 represents a reduced workload, as compared to the full set of matches 204 .
- a reference database that includes reference metadata describing media items stored in the reference database can be accessed (e.g., by the matching component via the communication component).
- probe metadata associated with an uploaded media item can be matched (e.g., by the matching component) with the reference metadata, to obtain a set of one or more candidate references with respective one or more associated weighting values, where the candidate references correspond to one or more of the media items stored in the reference database.
- a scoring function expressed at least partly in terms of the weighting values, can be evaluated (e.g., by the scoring component) for the set of one or more candidate references, to obtain scoring data indicating a probability that a candidate reference is correctly matched with the probe metadata.
- results of the scoring function can be filtered (e.g., by a filtering component) to obtain a filtered (e.g., reduced) set of one or more candidate references.
- content identification can be performed (e.g., by a content identification component) based the filtered set of one or more candidate references.

Abstract
Description
S(X)=a summation of the IDFs of the tokens in X(which can be either unigrams [e.g., single words] or bigrams).
G(M,N)=S(A)+BigramWeight*S(B),
Match(Probe,Reference)=TitleWeight*G(Probe,Reference.title)+AuthorWeight*G(Probe,Reference.author).
F(X)=S(U)+BigramWeight*S(B),
NormalizeStructured(Reference)=TitleWeight*F(Reference.title)+AuthorWeight*F(Reference.author),
NormalizeUnstructured(Probe)=F(Probe).
Score(Probe,Reference)=Match(Probe,Reference)*(1+ReferenceWeight)/[NormalizeUnstructured(Probe)+ReferenceWeight*NormalizeStructured(Reference)],
TABLE 1 |
Score(Probe, Reference) = Match(Probe, Reference) * (1 + |
ReferenceWeight) / [ NormalizeUnstructured(Probe) + ReferenceWeight * |
NormalizeStructured(Reference)] |
where: |
Probe = unstructured collection of words (can be assumed, e.g., to |
potentially contain a title); |
Reference = structured collection of data, comprising, e.g. a title field |
and an artist name field; |
Match(Probe, Reference) = TitleWeight * G(Probe, Reference.title) + |
AuthorWeight * G(Probe, Reference.author); |
NormalizeUnstructured(Probe) = F(Probe); |
NormalizeStructured(Reference) = TitleWeight * F(Reference.title) + |
AuthorWeight * F(Reference.author); |
F(X) = S(U) + BigramWeight * S(B) - where U represents the unigrams |
(e.g., single words) included in X and B represents the bigrams made up of |
consecutive words included in X; |
G(M, N) = S(A) + BigramWeight * S(B) - where A represents the set of |
unigrams that match between M and N and B represents the set of bigrams |
of consecutive words that match between M and N; and |
S(X) = summation of the IDFs of the tokens in X (which can be either |
unigrams or bigrams). |
F(Reference.author)=(0.5+0.6+0.6)+1.5[BigramWeight]*(0.7+0.7)=3.8
F(Reference.title)=(0.8+0.8+0.8)+1.5*(0.9+0.9)=5.10
NormalizeUnstructured(Probe)=(0.8+0.8)+[BigramWeight]*(0.9)=2.95
NormalizeStructured(Reference)=0.3*AuthorWeight*3.8+1.0*TitleWeight*5.10=6.24
Match(Probe,Reference)=1.0*2.95=2.95
Score(Probe,Reference)=((5[ReferenceWeight]+1)*2.95)/(1*2.95+5*6.24)=0.52
