The embodiment of the present invention, the above TP of two of which can be executed in the wireless network with multiple transmission point (TP)
Collaboration, to serve as single transmission point.A kind of such cooperative approach that can be used in LTE embodiments is multi-point cooperative
(CoMP).CoMP allows semi-static or dynamic cooperation or transmission and reception by geographically independent multiple TP.
Four kinds of possible CoMP deployment scenarios are described now with reference to Fig. 5.First scene is with the similar of the interior CoMP in station
Cellular network.Central entity (such as TP either the entity (such as scheduler) in TP) can be controlled or be cooperateed with from its geography
The transmission of the TP of each cell of 3 cells of region or Cooperative Area (CoMP in referred to as standing).Second scene is that have height
The homogeneous network of transimission power long distance wireless dateline (RRH).RRH can be passive amplifier, or can include full letter respectively
Number processing capacity (that is, transceiver).In addition, RRH can be described as subbase station, remote antenna unit, remote radio unit (RRU) or
Person's other terms well known in the art.The geographical coverage area of RRH can be divided into one or more cells, wherein can incite somebody to action each small
Area is considered as with TP.In the second scene, central entity can cooperate with 9 cells, as baseline.According to the system of the second scene
Designer can be selected as between the 3 of potential selectable value, 19,21 cells.
Third scene is similar with low-power RRH (or low power nodes (LPN)) in macrocell coverage area
Network.Macrocell can be cell in the stations eNB, and can be considered associated with TP.In general, each low work(in third scene
The coverage area of rate RRH can be described as sub-cell, and RRH (not subregion) can be considered TP.RRH is geographically (or in sky
Between on) it is independent, and pass through the TP of macrocell controls.TP can be considered as by macrocell TP and one or more of with DAS

Data transmission.
Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 are referred again to, TP and UE can be in communication with each other under a variety of channel conditions.The embodiments described herein is not
It is limited to any specific collection of channel condition.
In order to illustrate more clearly of implicit concept, it will be assumed that each channel variation is enough to slow so that signal subspace
(it is col (H11)) and interference space (be col (H12)) transmitted from one (for example, subframe n) to next transmission (subframe n+
8) be kept substantially it is identical, to for example UE1 be allowed to send feedback to TP1 and TP2 so that TP1 and TP2 can be according to collaboration
Mode selects precoder appropriate.
Fig. 1 is referred again to, the reception signal at UE can be expressed as
(1)y1=H11P1x1+H21P2x2+n1
And the reception signal at UE2 can be expressed as
(2)y2=H22P2x2+H12P1x1+n2
Wherein
HijIt is the channel response matrix when TPi transmittings and UEj receptions；
PiIt is the pre-coding matrix (or vector) that TP I are used；
nj~σjCN (0, I) is residual common-channel interference and the noise vector at UEj；
It is variable associated with remaining common-channel interference on j-th of UE.
In some embodiments of the invention, each UE restores to send out using linear minimum mean square estimation (MMSE) receiver
The signal phasor penetrated.For UE1, such as：
Wherein GnIt is the receiving filter (space) for being applied to the received signal vector at n-th of UE.For UE2
There can be similar expression.
If UE1 uses linear MMSE filters, filter can be equally expressed as
If the one or more of UE are effectively interfered (that is, interference components H by order -121P2Efficient channel rank of matrix
1), then to use matrix inversion lemma, following result occur
(the σ when remaining common-channel interference and becoming to ignore1→ 0) following result, is obtained：
WhereinIt is h21Kernel in projection matrix.
Therefore, equation (8) is reduced, and will be received signal and is projected h21Kernel (that is, arrive the sky orthogonal with interference vector
Between), then zero forcing algorithm (ZF) is applied to and h21Orthogonal signal space.If H11P1Corresponding to single layer transmission, then ZF etc.
Imitate in spatial matched filtering, in this case spatial matched filtering be about with h21Desired signal in orthogonal signal space
Vector H11P1Component MRC.
Later stage projection operates, and can be by received signal vector representation
Therefore, the later stage MMSE SINR for being used for a layer l (equation (9)) can be expressed as
The maximum quantity for the layer that UE1 can be transmitted to from TP1 is
The pre-coding matrix of mutual information maximization had into form P by MMSE receivers1=U (:,1:vmax), U is the tenth of the twelve Earthly Branches
Matrix, the front n row correspond toEigenvector,Eigenvector to correspond to maximum n intrinsic
Value.
By finite alphabet code book, RI/PMI/CQI feedbacks can be executed, by overall ratio (on different layers) or
The total throughput maximization of person's prediction
1. for about order hypothesis (that is, the quantity of layer,UE (for example, UE1)
Best pre-coding matrix (or vector for v=1) is found, is expressed as
2.UE determines v layer the mutual information (or overall ratio of all layers of leap) of information theory, as
UE1 recommends overall ratio sum-ratevMaximized order v* as preferred RI, andAs preferred
PMI。
In the embodiment of the present invention (wherein SNR is limited), for the residual common-channel interference that not can not ignore, MMSE
Operation (equation 3) may not be broken down into the projection operation for being followed by ZF.For limited SNR (that is, not can not ignore
Residual common-channel interference), the vector of reception is projected into h21Kernel may lead to performance loss.Mean square error (MSE)
Matrix is：
It limits：
SINR associated with first layer passes through SINR after MMSE filtering1,l=1/ αl- 1 provides.It can be shown that will
Information theory mutual information (or overall ratio of all layers of leap) maximized precoder
With form P1=U1[:,1:v1]Σ1, wherein U1It is unitary matrice, the front n row areEigenvector,Eigenvector correspond to maximum n characteristic value, and v1It is the transmission rank that TP1 is UE1 selections, and Σ1It is
v1×v1Diagonal matrix.
The term " mutual information " used above can be conceptualized as：Mutual information (R) is the maximum that can carry out reliable communication
Ratio (is defined as the n bit transmission using coded-bit and receives k bit of information so that the possibility of bit error
(Pe of b bit of garbled-reception) goes to zero, while ratio k/n tends to the fixed limit less than or equal to mutual information R.Change speech
It, Pe → 0 and k/n → r<=R).Conversely, there exist such encoding scheme, which allows the error rate by disappearance,
Using b bit of n bit transfer information of coded data, as long as k/n<=R.T.
Due toSo a kind of method is selection P2=U2[:,1:v2]Σ2, wherein U2It is the tenth of the twelve Earthly Branches
Matrix, n row of the front are H21Right singular vector, H21Right singular vector correspond to the singular value (including zero of n minimum
Singular value), and v2It is by the transmission rank that TP2 is UE2 selections, and Σ2For v2×v2Diagonal matrix.
(for example, just as in LTE Rel-10) is fed back for code book, free unitary matrice can be determined by UE1
U1And U2。
The action of dl interference can be mitigated with UE in one embodiment of the invention to be summarized as follows：
Step 1：
By the way that subspace distance is measuredIt minimizes, UE1 can find order v1" closest " codebook precoding
Matrix, wherein
And C (v1) it is order v1Code book.For 1 code book of order, euclidean distance metric can replace subspace distance degree
Amount.This is constituted and P1The corresponding feedback of matrix.
Step 2：
In a comparable manner, by measuring subspace distanceIt minimizes, UE1 can determine order v2's
" closest " codebook precoding matrix, wherein
And C (v2) it is order v2Code book.This is constituted and P2The corresponding feedback of matrix.
In another embodiment of the present invention, instead of the free U of determination1, for the P of selection2, will by selection
All v1The maximized pre-coding matrix of overall ratio on a layer, UE1 can determine P1∈C(v1).It is assumed that accurate in above step 2
ThenSelect pre-coding matrix P2∈C(v2), then UE1 can determine overall ratio
It is assumed that TP2 is for each P1∈C(v1) use pre-coding matrix P2.UE1 can be selected the maximized P of overall ratio1.It is this most
Bigization can be in order v1=1,2 ..., it is executed in the different hypothesis of N.
According to an embodiment of the invention, UE1 can be reported to TPIt is right.Therefore, dynamically weaken it instead of TP2
Transmission on some PRB to eliminate just as the complexity for example in DPS/DPB, byColumn space on signaling,
TP2 can ensure to transmit due to it, and the interference seen by UE1 is orthogonal with the signal space standard that TP1 → UE1 is linked.It is possible that
TP2 cannot efficiently find user UE2 to emit, if UE1 only recommends a signaling matrixIf.However, it is possible to find
The possibility of suitable UE2 may increase, if UE1 recommends more than oneTo if.For example, about fixed before
The subspace distance measurement of justice, UE1 can send secondIt is right, whereinWithIt is and U respectively1[:,1:v1]
And U2[:,1:v2] secondary close pre-coding matrix.It is determining by the maximized precoding square of overall ratio that this allows TP1 and TP2 to combine
Battle array, also considers other needs, such as QoS, justice etc. in addition.
The example for how implementing the embodiment of the present invention will now be described.In this example, there are 4 × 2 allocating antennas, wherein
TP1 and TP2 has 4 Tx antennas respectively, and UE1 and UE2 have 2 Rx antennas respectively.In this example, for the transmission to UE2
There are order constraint, v2=1.It is linked relative to TP1 to UE1, TP2 to UE1 links reduce 3dB.Similarly, it is arrived relative to TP2
UE2 is linked, and TP1 to UE2 links reduce 6dB.In other words, about TP1 and TP2, UE1 and UE2 are Cell Edge User.
UE1 and UE2 using based on Householder matrix Rel-104 × 1 LTE and 4 × 2 code books select PMI.
In this example, UE1 is based on the code books of LTE Rel-104 × 1 recommendation order 1Matrix.TP1 existsUpper hair
Signal, and TP2 existsUpper signalling.The summation of each UE mutual informations is calculated as (also for the overall ratio of UE1 and UE2
It is, by mutual information (for UE1 and UE2) divided by 2), it is assumed that the MMSE receivers at UE1 and UE2.
In an embodiment of the present invention, the element of channel response matrix H can be determined using channel estimation.For example, TP1
The first reference signal (TP1) and the second reference signal (TP2) of UE1 receptions can be emitted with TP2.It is sent out according to periodic scheduling
Penetrate the first and second reference signals.Scheduling includes periodically with frame, subframe or about the regular hour with reference to (for example, system
Number of frames, SFN=0), the slot offset of the transmission opportunity of reference signal, scheduling (passes through radio resource control with semi-static
(RRC) message or system broadcasts) or dynamically (downlink passed through in physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) controls
Information (DCI)) mode signal to UE.First and second reference signals can be CSI-RS, CRS, DMRS, dedicated reference letter
One or more of number (DRS) or any other reference signal.Each reference signal is characterized in that T/F reuses
Pattern, the T/F reuse pattern instruction and use which of each Physical Resource Block (PRB) of subframe t easet ofasubcarriers
In transmitted reference signal.For example, emit CSI-RS from 1,2,4 or 8 antenna port, and each port occupies for CSI-
RS transmit and configure subframe 1 OFDM symbol in 12 subcarriers in one.Service TP (such as TP1) can emit
To both TP1 and TP1 and other additional related corresponding CSI-RS resource information of TP.
Although to put it more simply, above-mentioned example is expressed as to be mapped to TP1 such as the first CSI-RS, the 2nd CSI-RS is mapped to
TP2, but it is to be understood that CSI-RS can be originated from multiple TP, but single CSI-RS resource is shown as in DL subframe.As long as
Consider UE, the accurate source or multiple sources of CSI-RS are exactly obvious, and can be detected as sending out by single CSI-RS resource
The single CSI-RS sent.
Continue this example, UE1 can be configured using CSI-RS resource, and receive the CSI-RS biographies at least from TP1 and TP2
It is defeated.Based on the CSI-RS transmission received, UE1 can determine that the radio link between TP1 → UE1 and TP2 → UE1 is opposite
The separate channel matrix answered.In one embodiment, UE1 uses MMSE channel estimation methods (for example, as estimated in above-mentioned channel
In meter) determine each entry of channel matrix H corresponding with TP1 → UE1 downlink channel 11, and with TP2 → UE1
Each entry of the corresponding channel matrix H of downlink channel 12.In another embodiment, UE1 uses the side based on DFT
Method or least square (LS) method determine H11 and H12.
In another embodiment of the present invention, instead of selection (P1,P2) to the second pre-coding matrix P2, passing through P2
Different possibility realizations interference covariance matrix is averaged after, UE1 can simply choose P1。
As described above, the MMSE filters at UE1 can be expressed as
Instead of being based on P2Selective value calculate R1, UE1 also calculates desired valueIts mid-term
Prestige value passes through P2Different possibility realize.Desired value can be calculated as in the time (subframe) and/or in frequency (sub-band).
Continue an alternative embodiment of the invention, it is (more from interfering nodes that isotropism interference simulation is generally basede on hypothesis
A node) spatial white transmission.It is this to assume for precoder selection not necessarily but when interfering order to be less than full rank
Most preferably.Alternatively, TP can inquire that UE1 reports PMI/RI/CQI under different interference orders, as described below.
A. if received signal is y1=H11P1x1+H21P2x2+n1, then pass throughIt gives
Go out interference covariance matrix, it is assumed that the i.i.d. inputs at TP2.
In general, P2∈ C, whereinAnd C(v)It is the code book of order v.It therefore, can be by interference covariance meter
It is
Given full rank transmission (that is, order=N) is likely to (especially in cell edge) and not always disturbed node uses,
Instead of calculating interference covariance under the hypothesis of isotropic, limited order interference may be used in UE1, and report cause it is improved
The CQI/PMI/RI of interference simulation.TP can be that TP2 is semi-statically configured UE in calculating interference covariance matrixWhen the set of order or order that should use.In addition, TP can configure code book
Subset restriction, the codebook subset constraint specify UE which subset of C should be used for calculating interference covariance matrix.
Referring back to Fig. 1 and the flow chart with reference to Fig. 6, will now be described according to an embodiment of the invention, UE and communication network
The how interactive example of network.In step 601, TP1 is to UE1 transmittings for the CSI-RS configurations of TP2 and for the CSI-RS of TP2
Configuration.In step 602, UE1 receive for TP2 for the codebook subset constraint of CSI-RS configurations and for TP3 for
The codebook subset constraint of CSI-RS configurations.In step 603, UE1 receives the order constraint for the order constraint of TP2 and for TP3.
In step 604, UE1 receives the first CSI-RS from TP2 and the 2nd CSI-RS from TP3.In step 605, UE1 is determined
(P1, the P2) for obeying codebook subset constraint and order constraint is right.In step 606, CSI report is beamed back TP1 by UE1, the CSI report packet
It includes and (P1, P2) related information.Similarly, first or second CSI-RS can be emitted by the combination of multiple TP, but will
First CSI-RS resource and the second CSI-RS resource (that is, as the first CSI-RS and the 2nd CSI-RS) are perceived as by UE1.
