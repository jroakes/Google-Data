- Both the positive endorsement signal module 302 and the negative endorsement signal module 304 have an output coupled to the combiner logic 312 .
- the positive endorsement signal module 302 and negative endorsement signal module 304 provide these endorsements signals to the combiner logic 312 , and the combiner logic 312 use the signals to determine whether a user should be prompted to endorse a search result. For example, if a search result has a negative endorsement by other users, the combiner logic 312 may not recommend a prompt be added to the search results.
- the combiner logic 312 may reduce a threshold applied before a prompt is presented thereby accelerating positive endorsements so that there is more of a gap between unendorsed results and positively endorse results.
- the web history module 306 is software, routines and storage for identifying the web history of the user. Although not shown, the web history module 306 may be coupled to the search engine 130 , the web browser 202 , or any other source that has information about the user's browsing history.
- the web history module 306 has an output coupled to the combiner logic 312 .
- the web history module 306 provides information to the combiner logic 312 about the number of times a user has accessed a particular webpage or URL.

- this web history information is provided by the web history module 306 to the combiner logic 312 .
- the combiner logic 312 determines whether the number of times the user has visited this particular web page is above a predetermined threshold. If so, the combiner logic 312 may add an endorsement prompt to the search results. In some implementations, the combiner logic 312 may apply a time decay factor to some of the instances when the user accesses the webpage to modify whether a prompt will be generated. Other implementations, are possible. For example, in addition to a quantity of visits, a qualitative measure can also be used as a metric to determine whether to prompt a user for endorsement.
- the search result module 308 is software and routines for receiving and processing search results from the ranking engine 152 .
- the endorsement from module 156 is responsible for sending both the search results and the prompt back to the user. In some implementations this information may be filtered through the presentation engine 154 .

- the social data module 310 may retrieve information from the social network server 124 using the identity of the user that submitted the search.
- the user's social graph, prior posts, photos, and other social information can be extracted by the social data module 310 and provided to the combiner logic 312 to aid in the determination of whether an endorsement prompt should be sent along with the search results.
- the combiner logic 312 is software and routines for determining whether to add an endorsement prompt to one or more of the search results.
- the combiner logic 312 is coupled to receive inputs from the positive endorsement signal module 302 , the negative endorsement signal module 304 , the web history module 306 , the search results module 308 and the social data module 310 .
- the combiner logic 312 analyzes the information received from these modules and determines whether an endorsement prompt should be added to the search results. Some implementations of the operation of the combiner logic 312 is described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4A . For example, if the combiner logic 312 determines from the web history that a particular webpage or search result has been accessed by the user numerous times, the combiner logic 312 generates an endorsement prompt for that search result.
- the combiner logic 312 determines that a particular webpage is endorsed by some number of contacts of the user or other users in the social graph of the user, the combiner logic 312 generates an endorsement prompt for that webpage.
- the combiner logic 312 can use the positive endorsement signals, negative endorsement signals, the web history of the user, and social information about the user's social network, the user's interests, and other social information in any number of ways to determine whether to generate and present an endorsement prompt.
- the combiner logic 312 outputs the search results and prompts 128 B and sends them to the client device 104 .
- the search results and prompt are provided to the presentation engine 154 which in turn provide the search results and prompts 128 B to the client device.
- the combiner logic 312 is also coupled to receive the input and movement of the input device, for example, cursor and keystrokes from the client device 104 .
- the combiner logic 312 receives user input for example, cursor movement, keystrokes, transitions between web pages etc.
- the method 400 begins by retrieving 402 endorsement information.
- endorsement information includes whether a search result can be endorsed.
- endorsement information includes positive and negative endorsement signals from the endorsement server 112 retrieved by either the positive endorsement signal module 302 or the negative endorsement signal module 304 . Endorsement information may also include any other information from the endorsement server 112 .
- the method 400 retrieves 404 search results.
- the search results module 308 can retrieve search results from the ranking engine 152 as has been described above.
- the method 400 retrieves 406 the web history of the user and any user input.
- the web history is obtained from the web history module 306 and the user input can be received directly from the client device 104 .
- the method 400 retrieves 407 any additional information from any other sources.
- the method 400 may retrieve social information using the social data module 310 from a social network server 124 .
- the method may alternatively retrieve other types of public or authorized information , for example, preferences, interests, actions etc. from other sources , for example, profile servers, blogs, third-party sites, social networks or other sources.
- the method processes 408 the web history and user input to determine whether there is prompt behavior.
- the method determines 410 whether a prompt behavior exists based on analysis in steps 408 of the retrieved information. If there is no prompt behavior the method is complete and ends. On the other hand, if there is a prompt behavior, the method 400 provides 412 a prompt endorsement for the result.
- the prompt in the result has been sent to the client device for display to the user. Examples of prompts being displayed are shown in FIGS. 6-9 below.
- the method 420 begins by retrieving 402 endorsement information. The method continues to perform steps 402 to 408 as has been described above. Steps 402 to 408 have the same or similar functionality as has been described above with reference to FIG. 4A so that description will not be repeated here. The method 420 continues by determining 422 whether there is potential prompt behavior. “Potential” prompt behavior includes any number of behaviors or interactions by the user that may lead to the presentation of a prompt. For example, a back button click is a potential prompt behavior.
- a second example of a potential prompt behavior is detecting when a first time user of the endorsement server 112 identifies a promo for some results which have a social endorsement.
- a third example of a potential prompt behavior is if the user has shared or endorsed a URL in some social network publicly (where the user has linked his/her identity on that network with the users in the profile server 204 ).
- a fourth example of a potential prompt behavior is if the user has shared or endorsed a URL in some private space like email or a private share on a social network and the profile server 204 has been granted access to this data by the user.
- a fifth example of a potential prompt behavior if the user has shared with the profile server 204 that he/she has viewed the URL (through a reader program, or clicks on links in emails received by the user, etc.). If it is determined in step 422 that there is no a potential prompt behavior, the method ends. However, if it is determined in step 422 that there is potential prompt behavior, the method 420 continues by rendering 424 output with the potential to prompt given certain user behavior.
- the method 420 may generate a prompt in response to a back button click from a result. Then the method 420 receives user input and determines 426 whether the user behavior qualifies for an endorsement prompt. If not, the method ends. On the other hand, if the user behavior does qualify for endorsement prompt, the method 420 provides 428 a prompt for endorsement and ends.

Description
- This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/525,795, entitled “Automated Endorsement Prompting” filed on Aug. 21, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- The present disclosure relates to endorsing content. In particular, the present disclosure relates to automated endorsement prompting.
- The popularity and use of the Internet, search engines web browsers, social networks and other types of electronic communication has grown in recent years. Search engines may customize data that is presented to the user based on information the search engine knows about user. Thus, two users inputting the same query may receive different search results or search results ordered differently.
- In the context of social networks, users may be able to indicate whether they recommend or endorse a particular piece of content. Users may be able endorse a particular piece of content by activating a button or other mechanism for making a recommendation or endorsement of the content.
- In one innovative aspect, an automated endorsement prompt system includes an endorsement prompt module. The endorsement prompt module comprises an endorsement signal module for retrieving an endorsement signal from an endorsement server; a search result module for retrieving search results from a search engine; a web history module for retrieving a web history for a user; and combiner logic for providing search results and an endorsement prompt, the combiner logic generating the endorsement prompt from the endorsement signal and the web history, the combiner logic coupled to the output of the endorsement signal module to receive the endorsement signal, the search result module to receive the search results, and the output of the web history module to receive the web history.
- The present disclosure also includes a method for automatically generating endorsement prompts including the steps of: receiving a query from a user; obtaining additional information signals; obtaining a search result using the query; determining whether prompt behavior exists using the additional information; generating a prompt for an endorsement if the prompt behavior exists; and providing the search result and the prompt for presentation.
- One or more of the implementations described can also include the following features: additional information signals that include user input signals from a client device, endorsement signals from an endorsement server, a web history for the user, social data from a social network, or an identity of the user; input signals from the client device that indicate a transition from a search result page to a first web page and a return to the search result page after a predetermined amount of time; a signal indicating that an endorsement prompt was presented to the user and rejected by the user; a web history indicating that user has viewed a web page a predetermined number of times; a prompt that includes an explanation why the prompt is being presented; a prompt that includes one or more identifiers of other users that have endorsed the result; an endorsement signal module retrieves a positive endorsement signal from the endorsement server and sends the positive endorsement signal to the combiner logic; a negative endorsement signal from the endorsement server and sends the negative endorsement signal to the combiner logic; the combiner logic generates the endorsement prompt in response to a hover over input signal; and a social data module for retrieving social information from a social network and wherein the social information is used by the combiner logic to generate the endorsement prompt.
- Other aspects include corresponding systems, methods and apparatus, including computer program products.
- The systems and methods disclose below are advantageous in a number of respects. First, they provide to a system and method for soliciting confirmations about preferences of users with minimal intrusion. Second, they present endorsement prompts in context where they are most understandable to the user.

FIG. 1 illustrates an implementation of an automated endorsementprompt system 100. The automatedendorsement prompt system 100 comprises aclient device 104, anetwork 140, asearch server 114, anendorsement server 112 and asocial network server 124. Theclient device 104 is utilized by auser 102 to input aquery 110 to retrieve information from thesearch server 114. Theclient device 104 is coupled for communication with thenetwork 140 which in turn is coupled for communication with thesearch server 114, theendorsement server 112 and thesocial network server 124. - Although only a
single user 102 andclient device 104 are illustrated, any numbers of client devices 115 can be available to any number ofusers 102. Furthermore, while only onenetwork 140 is coupled to theclient device 104, theendorsement server 112, thesearch server 114, and thesocial network server 124 in practice any number ofnetworks 140 can be connected to thesystem 100. Additionally, while only oneendorsement server 112,search server 114, andsocial network server 124 is respectively shown, thesystem 100 could include one ormore endorsement servers 112,search servers 114 andsocial network servers 124. Moreover, while the present disclosure is described below primarily in the context of prompting for endorsements when search results are presented, the present disclosure is applicable to any type of online communications where automated prompting of endorsement is applicable. - The
client device 104 comprises amemory 106 and aprocessor 108. Theclient device 104, for example, may be a personal computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile phone (e.g., a smart phone) or any other computing device. - The
memory 106 stores instructions and/or data that may be executed by theprocessor 108. Thememory 106 is coupled to a bus for communication with the other components. The instructions and/or data may comprise code for performing any and/or all of the techniques described herein. Thememory 106 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, flash memory or some other memory device known in the art. - The
processor 108 comprises an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller or some other processor array to perform computations and provide electronic display signals to a display device. Theprocessor 108 is coupled to a bus for communication with the other components.Processor 108 processes data signals and may comprise various computing architectures including a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, or an architecture implementing a combination of instruction sets. Although only a single processor is shown inFIG. 1 , multiple processors may be included. Other processors, operating systems, sensors, displays and physical configurations are possible. - The
client device 104 is configured for communication with thenetwork 140. In response to user input, theclient device 104 generates and sends a search query, e.g., in the form of aquery signal 122A, to thenetwork 140. Thenetwork 140 receives and passes on thequery signal 122B to thesearch server 114. Thesearch server 114 processes thequery signal 122B as will be described in more detail below to generate search results and one or more prompts. Thesearch server 114 sends the search results andprompts 128B to thenetwork 140 which in turn sends the search results andprompts 128A to theclient device 104 for presentation to theuser 102. - Although not shown, the
client device 104 may include other endorsement prompt software or routines operable on theclient device 104 for performing some or all of the operations required for generating the user interfaces described below, processing user input to generate one or more prompts, and generating signals to take action related to the one or more prompts. For example, the endorsement prompt software or routines may be a plug-in to aweb browser 202, java script or other software or code that cooperates with the browser. - The
network 140 can be wired or wireless, and may have any number of configurations, for example, a star configuration, token ring configuration or other configurations. Furthermore, thenetwork 140 may comprise a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), and/or any other interconnected data path across which multiple devices may communicate. In some implementations, thenetwork 140 may be a peer-to-peer network. Thenetwork 140 may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In some implementations, thenetwork 140 includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data for example via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, wireless application protocol (WAP), email, etc. - The
search server 114 comprises aprocessor 116 and amemory 118. Theprocessor 116 is similar to theprocessor 108 described above; however, it may have increased computing capability. Thememory 118 is similar to thememory 106 described above; however, it may be larger in size, have faster access time, and also include volatile and nonvolatile memory types. - In some implementations, the
memory 118 stores asearch engine 130 that includes anindexing engine 120, aranking engine 152, apresentation engine 154 and anendorsement prompt module 156. Thesearch engine 130 is operable on theprocessor 116 to receive the query signal 122 and in response return search results and prompts 128. - One or more of the
search engine 130, theindexing engine 120, theranking engine 152, thepresentation engine 154 and the endorsementprompt module 156 are stored in thememory 118 and are accessible and executable by theprocessor 116. In some implementations, one or more of thesearch engine 130, theindexing engine 120, theranking engine 152, thepresentation engine 154 and the endorsementprompt module 156 store data that, when executed by theprocessor 116, causes these engines to perform the operations described below. In some implementations, one or more of thesearch engine 130, theindexing engine 120, theranking engine 152, thepresentation engine 154 and the endorsementprompt module 156 are instructions executable by theprocessor 116 to provide the functionality described below with reference toFIGS. 3-9 . - The
indexing engine 120 is software or routines for creating an index or indices for multiple sources of content. In some implementations, theindexing engine 120 indexes video data and web data. Theindexing engine 120 collects, parses and stores data to facilitate information retrieval. Theindexing engine 120 also processes search queries. Theindexing engine 120 receives a search query and returns search results from the data sources that match the terms in the search query. Theindexing engine 120 is coupled to receive a search query from thepresentation engine 154. - The
ranking engine 152 is software or routines for ranking search results based upon relevance to the search query. Theranking engine 152 is coupled to receive the search results from theindexing engine 120. Theranking engine 152 can reorder the search results based upon terms in the query as well as other factors about the user. In some implementations, theranking engine 152 is coupled for communication with the endorsementprompt module 156 to modify the ranking of the search results based on input signals from the endorsementprompt module 156. In such an implementation, the modified search results or respective rankings are output from theranking engine 152 to thepresentation engine 154. In some implementations, the reordered results or rankings of the output by theranking engine 152 are output to the endorsementprompt module 156, which further reorders the results and then provides them to thepresentation engine 154. - The
presentation engine 154 is software or routines for receiving a query signal and sending the query signal to theindexing engine 120. Thepresentation engine 154 is coupled to theindexing engine 120 to provide the query signal. Thepresentation engine 154 also receives search results from theranking engine 152. Thepresentation engine 154 formats and sends the search results via thenetwork 140 to theclient device 104. In some implementations, thepresentation engine 154 also receives prompts in addition to or as part of the search results. Thepresentation engine 154 formats and sends these prompts for presentation on theclient device 104. Some implementations of the formatting and presentation of these prompts are shown and described below with reference toFIGS. 5-9 . - The endorsement
prompt module 156 is software or routines for tracking the user interaction with web pages, generating prompts and presenting prompts. The endorsementprompt module 156 obtains information or additional information about a user's interaction with content. The content may be a search result from a search engine; a web page from a third party server; and information from a social network. In some implementations , the content may be a particular resource or identity, e.g., a domain or sub-domain of a network. The endorsementprompt module 156 is coupled to receive other types of information, for example, public information about a user social graph, public information about user interaction with the social network, user interaction with a multimedia content sharing site, or other system with which a user may interact, for example, micro-blogs, comments, votes (e.g., indicating approval of particular content), other indications of interest (e.g., that promote content for consumption by other users), playlists (e.g., for video or music content). In some implementations, users can be provided options to opt-in or opt-out of having this type of information being used. In these and other implementations, the endorsementprompt module 156 receives social information from thesocial network server 124 and endorsement information from theendorsement server 112. The endorsementprompt module 156 and its operation will be described in more detail below with reference toFIGS. 2-4 . The present disclosure will be described below in the context of search results and endorsements; however, the principles and concepts of the disclosed technologies can be applied to other types of automated generation of prompts associate with content. In some implementations, the endorsementprompt module 156 modifies the ranked and formatted search results by adding the prompts and sends them to theclient device 104. In some implementations, the endorsementprompt module 156 provides the prompts to thepresentation engine 154 that combines them with the search results and sends them to theclient device 104. - In some implementations, the
social network server 124 is coupled to thenetwork 140. Thesocial network server 124 also includes a social network software/application. Although onesocial network server 124 is shown in detail, multiplesocial network servers 124 may be present. A social graph of the social network can be used to represent relationships/connections of users of the social network, e.g., friendships, family relationships, work relationships, common interests, etc. These features are provided by one or more social networking systems, for example those included in thesystem 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph. In some examples, the social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related. Furthermore, thesocial network server 124 and social network software/application are representative of a social network and that, in some implementations, there may be multiple social networks coupled to thenetwork 140, each having its own server, application and social graph. For example, a first social network can be more directed to business networking, a second can be more directed to or centered on academics, a third can be more directed to local business, a fourth can be directed to dating and others of general interest or a specific focus. Furthermore, thesocial network server 124 may provide personalized streams of content including photos, posts, shares, and other information from a variety of sources including contacts of the user or other users in the social graph, colleagues, news sources, etc. Thesocial network server 124 is coupled to provide social information to the endorsementprompt module 156. - The
endorsement server 112 comprises a processor and a memory. Theendorsement server 112 also includes software or routines operable on the server to implement the endorsement system. In some implementations, theendorsement server 112 is a system for tracking content and indicating users who have endorsed or recommended existing content. In some implementations, users can be provided options to opt-in or opt-out of having this type of information being used, collected and shared with others. The endorsements and data may also be anonymized before being provided to others. In some implementations, the endorsement or recommendation system implemented by theendorsement server 112 is applicable to information available on the World Wide Web, content created by users of the social network, or content available over the Internet, for example, videos. Theendorsement server 112 is coupled to receive endorsements from the user, coupled to receive search results, and coupled to provide endorsement information to the endorsementprompt module 156. In some implementations, theendorsement server 112 includes the endorsementprompt module 156 that operates as will be described below to provide information to thepresentation engine 154. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , a second implementation for the automated endorsementprompt system 200 is described. As shown, the second implementation for the automated endorsementprompt system 200 comprises theclient device 104, thesearch server 114, theendorsement server 112 and thesocial network server 124. These components have the same or similar functionality as has been described above with reference toFIG. 1 , so that description will not be repeated here.FIG. 2 is provided to illustrate some implementations for automated endorsementprompt system 200. More specifically,FIG. 2 illustrates the communication paths between theclient device 104, thesearch server 114, theendorsement server 112 and thesocial network server 124. In this implementation, theuser 102 interacts with theweb browser 202 operable on theclient device 104. In some implementations, the user may log in with a user account to aprofile server 204 so the identity of the user (and other preferences or information) is known to thesearch server 114. Theclient device 104 may send a query for content and results and links are provided by thesearch server 114. In addition to the search results, the endorsementprompt module 156 operable as part of thesearch engine 130 also provides automated prompt information. The endorsementprompt module 156 is coupled to theendorsement server 112 to receive endorsement information and thesocial network server 124 to receive social information. - In some implementations, the endorsement
prompt module 156 may be allocated between thesearch server 114 and theclient device 104. In some implementations, the functionality described herein as being performed by the endorsementprompt module 156 may be distributed among one or more of thesearch server 114, theendorsement server 112, thesocial network server 124 and theprofile server 204. In some implementations, the endorsementprompt module 156 may be entirely operable as software on theclient device 104. - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , an implementation for the endorsementprompt module 156 is shown. The endorsementprompt module 156 comprises a positiveendorsement signal module 302, a negativeendorsement signal module 304, aweb history module 306, asearch result module 308, asocial data module 310 andcombiner logic 312. - The positive
endorsement signal module 302 and the negativeendorsement signal module 304 are software and routines for retrieving information from theendorsement server 112 and providing it to thecombiner logic 312. The positiveendorsement signal module 302 retrieves positive endorsements related to the search results from theendorsement server 112. A positive endorsement is any signals direct, inferred, or implied that a user approves of, is interested in, likes, supports, endorses, or appreciates content, a search result or a web site or other displayed content. Similarly, the negativeendorsement signal module 304 retrieves negative endorsements for the search results from theendorsement server 112. A negative endorsement is any signals direct, inferred, or implied that a user disapproves of, is not interested in, dislikes, does not support, endorse, or appreciate content, a search result or a web site or other displayed content. Both the positiveendorsement signal module 302 and the negativeendorsement signal module 304 have an output coupled to thecombiner logic 312. The positiveendorsement signal module 302 and negativeendorsement signal module 304 provide these endorsements signals to thecombiner logic 312, and thecombiner logic 312 use the signals to determine whether a user should be prompted to endorse a search result. For example, if a search result has a negative endorsement by other users, thecombiner logic 312 may not recommend a prompt be added to the search results. On the other hand, if the search result has a positive endorsement by other users, thecombiner logic 312 may reduce a threshold applied before a prompt is presented thereby accelerating positive endorsements so that there is more of a gap between unendorsed results and positively endorse results. These are examples of how the positive and negative endorsement signals can be used in a number of other ways by thecombiner logic 312 to determine how and when prompts are generated and presented to the user; other implementations are possible. - The
web history module 306 is software, routines and storage for identifying the web history of the user. Although not shown, theweb history module 306 may be coupled to thesearch engine 130, theweb browser 202, or any other source that has information about the user's browsing history. Theweb history module 306 has an output coupled to thecombiner logic 312. Theweb history module 306 provides information to thecombiner logic 312 about the number of times a user has accessed a particular webpage or URL. In some implementations, thecombiner logic 312 uses this information as an indication of the user's interest in a particular webpage and in response presents a prompt for endorsement. For example, if a user repeatedly goes to a particular webpage, then this web history information is provided by theweb history module 306 to thecombiner logic 312. In turn, thecombiner logic 312 determines whether the number of times the user has visited this particular web page is above a predetermined threshold. If so, thecombiner logic 312 may add an endorsement prompt to the search results. In some implementations, thecombiner logic 312 may apply a time decay factor to some of the instances when the user accesses the webpage to modify whether a prompt will be generated. Other implementations, are possible. For example, in addition to a quantity of visits, a qualitative measure can also be used as a metric to determine whether to prompt a user for endorsement. - The
search result module 308 is software and routines for receiving and processing search results from theranking engine 152. In some implementations, the endorsement frommodule 156 is responsible for sending both the search results and the prompt back to the user. In some implementations this information may be filtered through thepresentation engine 154. Thesearch result module 308 is coupled to receive ranked search results from theranking engine 152. The search resultsmodule 308 has an output coupled to thecombiner logic 312 provides the ranked search results. - The
social data module 310 is software and routines for retrieving social information from thesocial network server 124 and providing it to thecombiner logic 312. Thesocial data module 310 is coupled to query and receive information from thesocial network 124. The output of thesocial data module 310 is coupled to thecombiner logic 312. For example, thesocial data module 310 may query thesocial network server 124 to determine whether any of the contacts of the user or other users in the social graph have reviewed similar search results. Thesocial data module 310 may retrieve information from thesocial network server 124 using the identity of the user that submitted the search. The user's social graph, prior posts, photos, and other social information can be extracted by thesocial data module 310 and provided to thecombiner logic 312 to aid in the determination of whether an endorsement prompt should be sent along with the search results. - The
combiner logic 312 is software and routines for determining whether to add an endorsement prompt to one or more of the search results. Thecombiner logic 312 is coupled to receive inputs from the positiveendorsement signal module 302, the negativeendorsement signal module 304, theweb history module 306, thesearch results module 308 and thesocial data module 310. Thecombiner logic 312 analyzes the information received from these modules and determines whether an endorsement prompt should be added to the search results. Some implementations of the operation of thecombiner logic 312 is described in more detail below with reference toFIG. 4A . For example, if thecombiner logic 312 determines from the web history that a particular webpage or search result has been accessed by the user numerous times, thecombiner logic 312 generates an endorsement prompt for that search result. Likewise, if thecombiner logic 312 determines that a particular webpage is endorsed by some number of contacts of the user or other users in the social graph of the user, thecombiner logic 312 generates an endorsement prompt for that webpage. Thecombiner logic 312 can use the positive endorsement signals, negative endorsement signals, the web history of the user, and social information about the user's social network, the user's interests, and other social information in any number of ways to determine whether to generate and present an endorsement prompt. In some implementations, as shown inFIG. 3 , thecombiner logic 312 outputs the search results and prompts 128B and sends them to theclient device 104. In some implementations, the search results and prompt are provided to thepresentation engine 154 which in turn provide the search results and prompts 128B to the client device. - The
combiner logic 312 is also coupled to receive the input and movement of the input device, for example, cursor and keystrokes from theclient device 104. In some implementations, thecombiner logic 312 receives user input for example, cursor movement, keystrokes, transitions between web pages etc. In particular, if the user hovers over a search result, or transitions from one web page to another and then returns, or views a web pages for a predetermined amount of time before returning to a results page, or was presented with a prompt and did not endorse, presented with a prompt and did accept for a similar search result, and any other inputs by the user to theclient device 104 or series of inputs to theclient device 104. - Referring now to
FIG. 4A , one implementation of amethod 400 for generating and sending endorsement prompts is described. Themethod 400 begins by retrieving 402 endorsement information. In some implementations, endorsement information includes whether a search result can be endorsed. In some implementations, endorsement information includes positive and negative endorsement signals from theendorsement server 112 retrieved by either the positiveendorsement signal module 302 or the negativeendorsement signal module 304. Endorsement information may also include any other information from theendorsement server 112. Next, themethod 400 retrieves 404 search results. For example, thesearch results module 308 can retrieve search results from theranking engine 152 as has been described above. Then themethod 400 retrieves 406 the web history of the user and any user input. For example, the web history is obtained from theweb history module 306 and the user input can be received directly from theclient device 104. In an optional step, themethod 400 retrieves 407 any additional information from any other sources. For example, themethod 400 may retrieve social information using thesocial data module 310 from asocial network server 124. The method may alternatively retrieve other types of public or authorized information , for example, preferences, interests, actions etc. from other sources , for example, profile servers, blogs, third-party sites, social networks or other sources. Using the information obtained insteps 402 to 407, the method processes 408 the web history and user input to determine whether there is prompt behavior. For example, if the user has clicked a particular search results more than a predetermined number of times that action may be identified as a prompt behavior in which the prompt should be presented. Another example is if the user selects a search result, views the selected search results for a predetermined amount of time and then returns to the search result page. If such actions by the user are found instep 408, it indicates a prompt behavior which a prompt should be presented to the user. Additionally, negative endorsement signals, for example, that the user has been presented an endorsement prompt but has decided not to endorse the result are other action that are considered a prompt behavior. Next, the method determines 410 whether a prompt behavior exists based on analysis insteps 408 of the retrieved information. If there is no prompt behavior the method is complete and ends. On the other hand, if there is a prompt behavior, themethod 400 provides 412 a prompt endorsement for the result. The prompt in the result has been sent to the client device for display to the user. Examples of prompts being displayed are shown inFIGS. 6-9 below. - Referring now to
FIG. 4B , another implementation of amethod 420 for generating and sending endorsement prompts is described. Themethod 420 begins by retrieving 402 endorsement information. The method continues to performsteps 402 to 408 as has been described above.Steps 402 to 408 have the same or similar functionality as has been described above with reference toFIG. 4A so that description will not be repeated here. Themethod 420 continues by determining 422 whether there is potential prompt behavior. “Potential” prompt behavior includes any number of behaviors or interactions by the user that may lead to the presentation of a prompt. For example, a back button click is a potential prompt behavior. If the user performs a search and search results are displayed to the user, the user clicks or selects a result from the search, then the user clicks or selects a back button after some minimum visit duration, themethod 420 presents a prompt. A second example of a potential prompt behavior is detecting when a first time user of theendorsement server 112 identifies a promo for some results which have a social endorsement. A third example of a potential prompt behavior is if the user has shared or endorsed a URL in some social network publicly (where the user has linked his/her identity on that network with the users in the profile server 204). A fourth example of a potential prompt behavior is if the user has shared or endorsed a URL in some private space like email or a private share on a social network and theprofile server 204 has been granted access to this data by the user. A fifth example of a potential prompt behavior if the user has shared with theprofile server 204 that he/she has viewed the URL (through a reader program, or clicks on links in emails received by the user, etc.). If it is determined instep 422 that there is no a potential prompt behavior, the method ends. However, if it is determined instep 422 that there is potential prompt behavior, themethod 420 continues by rendering 424 output with the potential to prompt given certain user behavior. For example, themethod 420 may generate a prompt in response to a back button click from a result. Then themethod 420 receives user input and determines 426 whether the user behavior qualifies for an endorsement prompt. If not, the method ends. On the other hand, if the user behavior does qualify for endorsement prompt, themethod 420 provides 428 a prompt for endorsement and ends. - Referring now to
FIGS. 5-9 , some implementations for presenting search results, in particular with endorsement prompts are shown. -
FIG. 5 illustrates one implementation of auser interface 500 in which search results are shown in abrowser window 502. In this example, three search results are returned in response to a query for the term “Manhattan.” In this example, numerous search results are returned in response to a query for the term “Manhattan” and the top three search results are shown. Theuser interface 500 includes abrowser window 502 having a number of components including a top label, amenu bar 504, abar 506 for a search engine and input box, a side/location bar 508, and adisplay area 510. Themenu bar 504 provides menus to access browser functionality. In some implementations, thebrowser window 502 could include content from a publisher page that includes at least one endorsement button similar to the button shown inFIGS. 4-6 . Asearch result 512 can include a heading 514 (e.g., a link to a resource), anendorsement button 516, asearch button 518, aURL 520 and asnippet 522. While the present technology will be described below in the context of theendorsement button 516, theendorsement button 516 could be an action to share the content or even be a suggestion to use a share button (not shown) to share content. -
FIG. 6 illustrates a first implementation of theuser interface 600 showing an endorsement prompt 602 in abrowser window 502. In thisuser interface 600, the same three search results as shown above inFIG. 5 are presented. However, theuser interface 600 also displays the endorsement prompt 602 associated with and positioned proximate theendorsement button 604. Theuser interface 600 is presented in response to an indication of the user's interest (e.g., a quantitative or qualitative indicator of interest) in the second search result and when the user receives the second search result again either when returning to the results page ofFIG. 5 or if the second search result is part of a different results page. The endorsement prompt 602 may also be presented if the user has reviewed the second search result and then selects the back button to return to the search result page. In this implementation,endorsement prompt 602 is a box that provides additional information to the user as to why he/she is being prompted to endorse the search result. In this example, the endorsement prompt 602 box indicates that the user has visited this site four times and indicates a reason why the user may want to select theendorsement button 604. The message contained in the endorsement prompt 602 can be customized based upon the information used to generate theendorsement prompt 602. The user interface shown inFIG. 6 , is merely one example and various other callouts may be used and associated with different results and with different messages from that shown in thebrowser window 502. -
FIG. 7 illustrates a second implementation of theuser interface 700 showing an endorsement prompt 704 in abrowser window 502. Again, in thisuser interface 700, the same three search results as shown above inFIG. 5 are presented.FIG. 7 also shows acursor 702 indicating the position of the input device of theuser 102. In response to a hover over input by theuser 102, theuser interface 700 is updated to display theendorsement prompt 704. In some implementations, theendorsement prompt 704 is presented when theuser 102 hovers over the search result. In some implementations, theendorsement prompt 704 is only presented when the user hovers over theendorsement button 706 associated with the search result. This endorsement prompt 704 can be presented in response to the hover over plus a previous indication of user interest or just upon hover based on analysis of other behaviors as described above with reference toFIG. 3 . In some implementations, theendorsement prompt 704 is a box including text with a question for the user and a reason to select theendorsement button 706. Other message and information can be provided in the endorsement prompt 704 to influence the user, educate the user, inform the user or otherwise get the user to accept or reject the endorsement. -
FIG. 8 illustrates a third implementation of theuser interface 800 showing an endorsement prompt 802 in thebrowser window 502. Again, in thisuser interface 800, the same three search results as shown above inFIG. 5 are presented.FIG. 8 shows an implementation for the endorsement prompt 802 that can be used in cases where less information is known about the user and a more generic prompt is being presented to the user. For example, this may be used to suggest to the user that he/she use the endorsement system. Theendorsement prompt 802 is a box proximate the bottom of thedisplay area 510. In this case,endorsement prompt 802 indicates a search result and the number of times the user has visited that site. Other influencing factor as to why the prompt is being presented can also be indicated in the implementation of theendorsement prompt 802. -
FIG. 9 illustrates a fourth implementation of theuser interface 900 showing an endorsement prompt 902 in thebrowser window 502. Again, in thisuser interface 900, the same three search results as shown above inFIG. 5 are presented.FIG. 9 shows an implementation for the endorsement prompt 902 similar to that described above with reference toFIG. 6 . Theendorsement prompt 902 is positioned proximate theendorsement button 604 of a search result. The endorsement prompt 902 also includes information for the user about the prompt, why it is being presented, what the impact of endorsing is, etc. However in this case, theendorsement prompt 902 is a box having a first text area 904 and asecond area 906. The first text area 904 is like that described above and includes information for the user about why the prompt is being presented and other information about endorsements and their effects. In this implementation, the endorsementprompt module 156 also communicates with thesocial network server 124 to retrieve information about the user, and theendorsement server 112 to determine other users that have endorsed the search result. This information is used by the endorsementprompt module 156 to retrieve photos of other users that have endorsed the result. In some implementations, thesecond area 906 includes one or more photos of other users that have already endorsed the result. In another implementation, thesecond area 906 includes one or more photos of users that are both in the user's social graph and have endorsed the result. Various other ways that thesecond area 906 may be populated with photos, user names or other information to get the user to endorse the result. - An automated endorsement prompt system has been described is described.
