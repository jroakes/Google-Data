Definitions
- the invention relates to optical character recognition (OCR), and more particularly, to database assisted OCR for images such as street scenes.
- OCR optical character recognition
- mapping from a GPS location to a street address, and vice versa is not always very accurate. This problem can be traced to the way map data is collected.
- the GPS location of certain “anchor” street addresses along a particular street is known, but addresses in-between these anchors are interpolated. As such, significant discrepancies can sometimes be observed between the actual GPS location of an address and the interpolated location.
- the street images shown by a mapping service for a particular address could end up being shifted by as much as 100 yards or more.
- One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for assisting optical character recognition (OCR) of an image using a database.
- the method includes querying a database to identify at least one keyword corresponding to text expected to be in an image, and performing OCR of the image to determine if the keyword is present in the image.
- the image is associated with known GPS location data
- the keyword(s) can be derived from information associated with the image, such as a business name, address, street name, or other descriptive information.
- the keywords are used to assist the OCR process in identifying text in the image.
- Another embodiment of the present invention further extends the above method, by determining, in response to determining that the keyword is present in the image, an actual GPS location associated with that keyword.
- the keyword is further associated a key event captured in the image (e.g., such as a touch down in a sub-titled/closed-captioned video image).
- querying the database identifies a number of textual and non-textual expected features.
- the method may further include performing image analysis of the image to determine if non-textual expected features are present.
- the image can be, for example, one of a photograph or video frame.
- Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for assisting optical character recognition (OCR) of a street scene image using a database.
- the method includes querying a database to identify a feature expected in a street scene image of one or more street addresses, the street scene image associated with known GPS data.
- the method continues with performing OCR of the street scene image to determine if the expected feature is present in the street scene image.
- the method continues with determining an actual GPS location for a street address associated with that expected feature.
- the method may include updating the database to include the actual GPS location.
- querying the database identifies a number of textual and non-textual features.
- the method may further include performing image analysis of the street scene image to determine if non-textual expected features are present.
- Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for assisting optical character recognition (OCR) of a street scene image using a mapping system database.
- the method includes determining a target GPS location for a street scene image using known GPS data associated with that street scene image, estimating a street address of the target GPS location, and identifying a target address range based on the street address of the target GPS location.
- the method continues with querying a mapping system database to identify a business name having a street address in the target address range, and performing OCR of the street scene image to determine if key words associated with the identified business name are present.
- the method continues with determining an actual GPS location for the street address of that business name, based on the known GPS data.
- the method may include updating the mapping system database to include the actual GPS location.
- the method may include repeating the method for a number of additional target GPS locations.
- performing OCR of the street scene image to determine if key words associated with the identified business name are present further includes performing image analysis of the street scene image to determine if expected non-textual features associated with the identified business name are present.
- the street scene image can be, for example, a panoramic image that includes a plurality of street addresses. Alternatively, the street scene image (e.g., regular or panoramic) can be one street address.
- the known GPS data includes, for instance, known GPS locations for at least two locations captured in the street scene image.
- the mapping system database may include, for example, a business listings directory, and/or other digital mapping system data.
- FIG. 1 a illustrates a typical city block that includes a number of physical addresses.
- FIG. 1 b illustrates a conventional mapping system's representation of the city block shown in FIG. 1 a.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a database assisted OCR system configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the street scene image OCR module shown in FIG. 2 , configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method for assisting optical character recognition of street scene images using a mapping system database, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- OCR optical character recognition
- images such as street scenes (e.g., storefronts)
- OCR Optical character recognition
- a database query can provide useful information that can assist the OCR process.
- a query to a digital mapping database can provide information such as one or more businesses in a vicinity, the street name, and a range of possible addresses.
- this mapping information is used as prior information or constraints for an OCR engine that is interpreting the corresponding street scene.
- the result of the OCR process can also be used to refine or otherwise update the mapping system database, particularly if the GPS location and orientation where the picture was taken is known. The result is much greater accuracy of the digital map data provided to the user.
- FIG. 1 a shows a typical city block (University Ave) that includes a number of addresses, ranging from 100 to 200, and their actual locations. This range of addresses are included between two intersections, as are most city blocks. An image of the entire city block could be captured, for example, in a panoramic photograph. Other features typically found in such a city block scene, such as parked cars, curb, sidewalk, trees and planters, retaining walls, glass storefronts, signage, addresses, etc may also be included in a given city block. Note that the use of terms such as “city block” and “intersection” is not intended to exclude other streets that include a range of addresses, whether residential or commercial.
- FIG. 1 b illustrates a conventional mapping system's representation of the city block shown in FIG. 1 a .
- An underlying digital map system database e.g., Navteq
- Navteq has an actual GPS location for 100 University Ave and 200 University Ave. Assume only one side of the street is being considered.
- the addresses between 100 and 200 University Ave. are typically interpolated by dividing the city block equally.
- a first street intersection is at 100 University Ave and a second intersection is at 200.
- a second intersection is at 200.
- the GPS location of the store (or other structure) at 164 University Ave is interpolated using conventional techniques (based on its street address), it would be placed far to the left of its actual location, as shown in FIG. 1 b.
- the user may be confused or otherwise have a difficult time when attempting to actually locate 164 University Ave. This problem is exacerbated on longer streets and streets that have one or more breaks in the middle. In the latter case, it is possible that the returned map data provided to the user could send the user to the wrong section of the street. If the user does not know that the street continues after a break (e.g., to allow for a park or large campus), then that user may conclude that the target street address does not actually exist.
- a break e.g., to allow for a park or large campus
- database assisted OCR can be used to significantly improve this situation. For instance, assume a collection of images or photographs taken between 100 University Ave and 200 University Ave are available. Alternatively, assume a wide panorama image showing the entire city block between 100 and 200 University Ave is available. In any such case, a significant amount of existing database information is known about the images. For instance, a mapping database (e.g., Navteq or Google Local) would indicate that the street numbers are all even numbers ranging in numerical order between 100 and 200. Furthermore, actual street numbers are known. In addition, business names at these addresses are known, as well as the order that these businesses occur along the street.
- a mapping database e.g., Navteq or Google Local
- This existing database information can be used as a set of constraints for an OCR engine specifically trained to work on city scenes.
- a list of constraints (such as the mentioned existing database information) could be used by an OCR engine to reduce the problem to word spotting (i.e., is this word or number detected in this image?).
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and other statistical approaches can be used to provide a set of constraints, as used in OCR applications such as forms recognition.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a database assisted OCR system configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen, the system includes a street scene image OCR module 205 , a map data database 210 , and a digital mapping system 215 .
- the database assisted OCR system operates in both an off-line capacity, as well as in an on-line capacity.
- OCR results are generated by the street scene image OCR module 205 in an off-line process, and can be used to refine/update the map data in database 210 .
- This off-line process effectively improves the accuracy of map data in the database 210 , by removing errors associated with address interpolation and other techniques for estimating address locations on a given street, as previously discussed.
- the structural and functional details of the street scene image OCR module 205 are discussed in more detail with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- requests e.g., HTTP
- map data e.g., written and graphical driving directions, maps, local data, etc.
- the request can be initiated, for example, by a user engaging a web browser of a computing device to access the system.
- the digital mapping system 215 accesses the map data database 210 and integrates the relevant map data into the response to the request.
- This map data can then be served to the requestor via a network (e.g., Internet or local area network) and web browser of the requestor's computing device.
- a network e.g., Internet or local area network
- the digital mapping system 215 can be implemented with conventional or custom technology.
- the map data database 210 can also be implemented with conventional or custom technology (e.g., for storing Navteq and/or Google Local map data).
- the digital mapping system 215 and map data database 210 are implemented as described in the previously incorporated U.S. application Ser. No. 11/088,542.
- the remote client (not shown) receives the requested graphical map data, and requests any map tiles it doesn't already have displayed or cached (e.g., as explained in the previously incorporated U.S. application Ser. No. 11/051,534).
- the client draws and displays the map, along with the driving directions.
- the client side can also be used to draw (e.g., overlay) graphical driving directions, location markers, etc on the map image.
- the present invention is not intended to be limited to systems that provide tile-based maps. Rather, embodiments of the present invention can also be used with other mapping systems, such as non-tile vector-based and raster-based mapping systems. Still other embodiments of the present invention can be used to provide database assisted OCR for applications other than digital mapping systems.
- the database for assisting the OCR process would include the sub-titles for each frame of video (and other textual information, such as “laughter” or “explosion”).
- the OCR engine would be constrained, for example, to look for sub-titled dialog in the frames of video.
- the OCR process identifies the target sub-titled text, the frame and/or time associated with that text could be noted.
- Such an application might be useful, for example, in the context of a smart video playback system.
- a sports fan that has video recorded the broadcast of a game with closed-captioning enabled (to textually capture the commentary).
- a playback system configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention would include a database storing the commentary transcript of the game, or an even more refined data collection, such as a set of key event terms (e.g., “touch down,” “home run,” “goal,” “score,” “unsportsmanlike conduct,” “4 th and goal,” “punt,” “double play,” “interception,” etc).
- An OCR engine would then search for the transcript text or key event terms (or other expected features) in the frames of sub-titled video. Transcript pages or key events could then be correlated to video frames for quick reference.
- the smart video playback system could then be trained to only play frames leading up to (and just after) the frames where a significant event occurred.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the street scene image OCR module 205 shown in FIG. 2 , configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the module 205 performs database assisted OCR, the results of which can then be used to update the map data database 210 .
- the database 210 can then be accessed by, for example, the digital mapping system 215 as previously discussed. Note, however, that the street scene image OCR module 205 can be used with other applications, as will be understood in light of this disclosure. Generally, any image analysis can benefit from using database assisted OCR.
- the module 205 includes a storefront image database 305 , a business listings database 310 , an image registration module 315 , an optical character recognition (OCR) module 320 , a target address range estimator module 325 , and a target GPS calculator module 330 .
- OCR optical character recognition
- the street scene image OCR module 205 employs one or more databases of street scene images (e.g., storefront image database 305 ), together with one or more corresponding databases of business listings (e.g., business listings database 310 ) and/or map data databases (e.g., map data database 210 ).
- Each database can be structured to facilitate efficient access of data, and include various types of information.
- each street-level image e.g., digital photograph taken using a GPS-enable camera
- stored in the storefront image database 305 can be indexed by geocode, and associated with corresponding GPS coordinates.
- the business listings database 310 and map data database 210 can be structured, for example, as conventionally done.
- the illustrated databases are integrated into a single database that is accessed to assist the OCR process.
- other databases or information sets could be included, such as a conventional residential listings (e.g., white pages directory) database or other such listing service databases.
- the image databases may include multiple views and/or zoom levels of each photographed area. For instance, one storefront image can be taken from an angle as it would be seen from one direction of the street (e.g., traveling north), while another storefront image of the same address could be taken from an angle as it would be seen from the other direction of the street (e.g., traveling south). Thus, depending on the driving direction route, either image could be used.
- the storefront image database 305 can store different kinds of images.
- Mode 1 uses panoramic images, where a single panoramic image captures multiple street addresses (e.g., one city block, or a string of contiguous address locations on a street), such as shown in FIG. 1 a .
- Such panoramic pictures can be taken, for example, using a panoramic camera or a regular camera equipped with a panoramic lens.
- the GPS coordinates at every point along the picture is known or can be accurately calculated. For instance, given a panoramic picture corresponding to the block of 100 to 200 University Ave shown in FIG. 1 a , where the GPS location at either end of the block are known (e.g., based on GPS receiver data taken at same time of image capture), then the GPS coordinates can be calculated at every point along the way using linear interpolation.
- GPS coordinates can be determined for each corresponding address location in the panoramic image with reasonable accuracy (e.g., +/ ⁇ 1 to 2 meters).
- GPS coordinates of every pixel or vertical line in a panoramic image can be known.
- a differential GPS antenna on a moving vehicle can be employed, along with wheel speed sensors, inertial measurement unit, and other sensors, which together, enable a very accurate GPS coordinate to be computed for every pixel in the panorama.
- GPS coordinates at some regularly sampled points are known, sufficiently accurate GPS coordinates of locations in-between could be interpolated, as previously discussed.
- Mode 2 uses more traditional imagery, such as digital pictures taken with regular digital cameras, or any camera that generates images upon which OCR can be performed (e.g., disposable cameras).
- a single set of GPS coordinates is known for each picture, corresponding to the exact location where each picture was taken.
- Each picture corresponds to one particular street address.
- exact GPS coordinates are known for each corresponding address location on that street.
- the end pictures of a series can be associated with known GPS data, so that the GPS data for the in-between addresses can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.
- the image registration module 320 is programmed or otherwise configured to construct a mapping between images and business listings. In one embodiment, this mapping is accomplished by a combination of image segmentation using standard image-processing techniques (e.g., edge detection, etc.) and interpolation of a business's street address within the range of street addresses known to be contained in the image. Image registration can be done for the street scene images stored in the storefront image database 305 , and any other images that can be used in the OCR image analysis process (e.g., such as satellite images).
- the mapping can be implemented, for example, with a pointer or address scheme that effectively connects images from an image database to listings in the business listings database.
- a single database can be built as the image registration process is carried out, where the records of the single database are indexed by geocode and/or GPS coordinates, and each record includes image data and related business listings information.
- image processing e.g., OCR
- OCR optical character recognition
- the image registration module 315 e.g., which can access the images stored in the database 305 using a pointer or addressing scheme.
- Other embodiments can access the images directly from their respective databases.
- images associated with that range can be identified and subjected to image processing using the OCR module 320 , to determine actual GPS location data for each of the addresses detected in the images.
- the target address range provided to the OCR module 320 can be determined using the target GPS calculator module 330 and the target address range estimator module 325 .
- actual GPS location data associated with a particular image is provided to the target GPS calculator module 330 from, for example, the storefront image database 305 or the image registration module 315 .
- This actual GPS location data can be, for instance, known GPS data associated with two anchor points of an image (e.g., such as discussed with reference to 100 and 200 University Ave of FIG. 1 a ).
- the actual GPS location data can be, for instance, known GPS location data associated with each of two single address images that have a number of addresses between them.
- the target GPS location data (whether previously known or calculated by module 330 ) is then provided to the target address range estimator module 325 , which uses the target GPS location data to estimate a target address range.
- the target GPS location data can be used to identify a corresponding address in a table lookup operation (e.g., of database 305 or module 315 ).
- the business listings database 310 can be queried to return a number (e.g., 10) of addresses before that corresponding address, and a number (e.g., 10) of addresses after that corresponding address, so as to provide a range of target addresses.
- the map data database 210 can be queried to return the set of addresses before that corresponding address, and the set of addresses after that corresponding address, so as to provide the range of target addresses.
- the available databases can be queried to provide information that can be used to constrain the OCR process.
- the business listings database 310 can be queried to identify the store names at the addresses included in the target address range.
- the map data database 210 can be queried to identify the store names at the addresses included in the target address range.
- both databases 210 and 310 can be queried to identify the store names, and the results can then be cross-checked for correlation and to identify business names missing from one of the databases. Each of these results can be used an expected feature for constraining the OCR process.
- the OCR module 320 can now be applied to the storefront image or images to read the storefront signage (if any) and other readable imagery, using OCR algorithms and techniques as further improved by the present invention.
- the OCR process can be constrained based on the query results of the databases 205 and/or 310 .
- the OCR module 320 is constrained by the business names returned from the database query or queries.
- the OCR module 320 can be constrained to look for text such as “McDonalds,” “Fry's Electronics,” “H&R Block,” and “Pizza Hut.”
- the OCR module 320 can also be constrained, for example, by identifying the type of store or stores in the target address range, based on the corresponding category listings in the business listings database 310 (e.g., “bars and restaurants” or “flowers” as done in a conventional yellow pages directory). Recall that the image registration module 315 has already mapped the images to corresponding listings within the business listings database 310 , thereby facilitating this context identification for the OCR process.
- text related to that business listings category can be obtained, for example, by accessing web sites of stores in that category, and adjusting the language model used for OCR module 320 , accordingly.
- This supplemental information from the map database 210 and/or business listings database 310 , and/or websites enables the OCR module 335 to be further informed of the context in which it is operating (in addition to knowing the store names for which it is searching).
- the constrained OCR search can be carried out using a template matching technique.
- the identification templates can be bitmaps, vectors, splines, or other representations of the expected feature.
- a number of different templates can be constructed in various font types, or font sizes, or font styles.
- the expected feature has a predetermined and consistently used font style, shape, or other form (e.g., the specific font used for “McDonald's”), then this font is used for the generation of the identification templates.
- image features are compared with at least one of the identification templates. The OCR module then uses the results of the comparison to make the OCR determination.
- the image can be binarized using, for example, the Niblack approach (e.g., Wayne Niblack, An Introduction to Image Processing, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986, pp. 115-116, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference), and then running a commercial OCR package (e.g., Abbyy FineReader) with a digits-only lexicon.
- Niblack e.g., Wayne Niblack, An Introduction to Image Processing, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986, pp. 115-116, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference
- OCR package e.g., Abbyy FineReader
- Other such image processing techniques can be used as well.
- the OCR module 335 can also be programmed or otherwise configured to further analyze storefront images.
- this supplemental image analysis is carried out at both a coarse level (e.g., width, height, color histograms) and a more refined level (e.g., segmentation into facade, doors, windows, roof, architectural elements such as pillars and balconies; decorative elements such as awnings, signage, neon lights, painted designs).
- a coarse level e.g., width, height, color histograms
- a more refined level e.g., segmentation into facade, doors, windows, roof, architectural elements such as pillars and balconies; decorative elements such as awnings, signage, neon lights, painted designs.
- Standard image-processing techniques e.g., computer vision
- Standard feature extraction algorithms typically extract high level information from images, such as shapes, colors, etc.
- Pattern recognition algorithms can then be applied to classify the extracted information so as to “recognize” objects in the storefront images.
- the supplemental image analysis can be used to identify trade dress and logos.
- the image processing constraints provided from the databases 210 and/or 310 might include store names (e.g., McDonalds and Pizza Hut) as well as known trade dress and logos corresponding to those store names (e.g., Golden Arches for McDonalds and the unique-shaped red roof for Pizza Hut).
- the OCR module 320 can be looking for “McDonalds” and “Pizza Hut”, while supplemental image analysis can be looking for the Golden Arches and the unique red roof design.
- the supplemental image analysis can be programmed into the OCR module 320 , or can exist independently as a distinct module. The various types of image analysis can be carried out in parallel, if so desired.
- the OCR module 320 identifies targeted features (e.g., business names and/or other targeted text, symbols, colors, graphics, logos, etc) in the image, then the known GPS coordinate(s) associated with that image can then be assigned to the corresponding addresses determined by the target address range estimator module 325 . As such, each address captured in the image will now have actual GPS coordinates (as opposed to interpolated or otherwise estimated). This actual GPS location data can then be integrated into the map data database 210 (or other databases) to further improve its accuracy.
- targeted features e.g., business names and/or other targeted text, symbols, colors, graphics, logos, etc
- FIG. 4 illustrates a method for assisting optical character recognition of street scene images using a mapping system database, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the method can be carried out, for example, using the street scene image OCR module 205 of FIGS. 2 and 3 , although other implementations will be apparent in light of this disclosure.
- a street scene image being analyzed includes a number of address location, including two address locations having known GPS locations, with some address locations therebetween having unknown GPS locations.
- GPS target1 [
- /2]+GPS 1 ); GPS target2 [
- /2]+GPS 1 ); GPS target3 [
- the resolution of calculated target GPS locations will depend on the particular street being analyzed. In one embodiment, a GPS location is calculated for every 3 meters of the actual street.
- the method continues with .identifying 415 a target address range based on estimated street address of target GPS location (e.g., 150+/ ⁇ 20). This target address range can be used for searching in the map database (or other appropriate database) to provide OCR constraints.
- the method continues with querying 420 the map database to identify business names having a street address in target address range.
- the method continues with performing 425 OCR of the street scene image to determine if key words (and/or other descriptive features, as previously explained) associated with the identified business names are present.
- the method continues with determining 430 an actual GPS location for the street address of that particular business name (as indicated by detected the keywords). The method continues with updating 435 the map database to include the correct GPS location for the street address of that business. The method then continues with determining 440 if there are more target GPS locations to analyze. If so, then the method repeats for each particular target GPS location. If there are no more target GPS locations to analyze, then the method concludes.
- another embodiment is a method. for assisting OCR of an image using a database of expected keywords (and/or other expected data).
- the method includes querying the database (any storage facility) to identify at least one keyword corresponding to text expected to be in an image, and performing OCR of the image to determine if the keyword is present in the image.
- OCR or in addition to OCR
- image analysis may be performed to identify if expected non-textual features retrieved from the database are included in the image.
