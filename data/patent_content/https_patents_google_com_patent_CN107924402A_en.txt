Embodiment
General introduction
It is optional that search engine system provides the user of display on a user device in response to search inquiry input by user
The search query results filter selected.System receives the data for the resource collection that identification is determined in response to search inquiry, and
Keyword set is extracted from the content of resource.Keyword is handled according to candidate's selection criteria, and determines candidate query mistake
Filter set.(trim) is deleted to the candidate query filter set using difference criteria, to ensure remaining candidate
There is rational difference degree in search query results set of the query filter device representated by them.For example, in some realizations
In mode, if essentially similar from the search query results set after the filtering obtained using two candidate query filters,
Then candidate query filter is to being grouped into single candidate filters.In response to search inquiry by diversified candidate query mistake
Filter set provides together with search query results, for showing on a user device.
In the following, these features and supplementary features are more fully described.In the example being presented below, these are characterized in normal
See under the context of search engine what is described.However, these features can be applied to any system or the application of search data storage.Example
Such as, features described below can be applied to the application of the specific corpus of search application.The example of the latter is to be used to search for
Restaurant, provide the comment to restaurant and the mobile phone application in predetermined restaurant；Or alternatively, it can be applied to search for large-scale
Web corpus.
The example of operating environment
Fig. 1 there is provided the block diagram of the example context 100 for the filter commented on and described for lexical item.Such as LAN
(LAN), computer network 102 of wide area network (WAN), internet or its combination is by publisher website 104,106 and of user equipment
Search engine 110 connects.It may include thousands of publisher websites 104 and user equipment 106 in thread environment 100.
Publisher website 104 includes associating with domain and by the trust server of one or more of one or more positions
One or more resources 105.In general, website is the set of the webpage formatted with hypertext markup language (HTML), can wrap
Containing text, image, content of multimedia and programming element (for example, script).Each website 104 is safeguarded by content issuer,
Content issuer is control, manages and/or possess the entity of website 104.
Resource is can be provided and with resource address (for example, unified resource by network 102 by publisher website 104
Finger URL (URL)) any data.Resource can be html page, electronic document, image file, video file, audio file
With feeding source, this is only several examples.Resource may include embedding information (for example, metamessage and hyperlink) and/or insertion
Instruct (for example, client-side script).
User equipment 106 is under user control and can ask and receive the electronic equipment of resource by network 102.
Exemplary user equipment 106 include personal computer, mobile communication equipment and can be sent and received by network 102 data other
Equipment.User equipment 106 generally includes user's application (for example, web browser) to promote to send and receive by network 102
Data.Family can be used to show text, image, video, music and be usually located on WWW or LAN for web browser
Other information on the webpage of website and interact.
In order to promote to search for these resources 105, search engine 110 is by crawling publisher website 104 and to publisher
The resource that website 104 provides is indexed to identify resource.Resource is indexed and index data is stored in index 112.
User equipment 106 submits search inquiry to search engine 110.With including searching request and alternatively unique identifier
The form of searching request submit search inquiry, unique identifier identification submits the user equipment 106 of request.Unique identifier
Can be data from the cookie being stored at user equipment or in the case where user safeguards account to search engine 110
User account identifier or identification user equipment 106 or using the user's equipment user some other identifier accord with.
In response to searching request, search engine 110 identifies resource associated with the query using index 112.Search engine
110 identify resource in the form of search result, and search result is returned user equipment in result of page searching resource
106.Search result is the data generated by search engine 110, and the data identification resource or offer meet particular search query
Information.The extracts of text and the Resource orientation of resource that the search result of resource may include web page title, be extracted from webpage
Accord with (for example, URL of webpage).
Based on the relevant score value of resource (such as, information retrieval (" IR ") score value) identified with search result and alternatively
Each resource carries out ranking with the relevant individually ranking (for example, technorati authority score value) of other resources to search result.According to these
Score value is ranked up search result, and provides search result to user equipment according to the sequence.
In addition, in response to searching request, filter subsystem 108 is identified with identifying that the relevant search inquiry of resource filters
Device.Filter subsystem 108 identifies search inquiry filter in the form of search inquiry filter result, and in search result
Search inquiry filter result is returned into user equipment 106 in page resource.Search inquiry filter result is by filter
The data that system 108 generates, it, which can be used for the search result for meeting search inquiry being filtered into, meets search inquiry and selected
Search result set after the filtering of filter.
User equipment 106 receives the result of page searching for including search inquiry filter result, and renders the page
For being presented to user.Search result is have selected at user equipment 106 in response to user, and user equipment 106 is asked selected
The resource that the Resource Locator that search result includes is identified.The publisher of the website 104 of trustship resource is from user equipment 106
The request to resource is received, and resource is provided to the user equipment 106 of request.
Search inquiry filter is have selected at user equipment 106 in response to user, and user equipment 106 asks selected search
Search result set after the filtering that the Resource Locator that rope query filter device includes is identified.Search engine system 110 from
User equipment 106 receives the request to the subset of search result, and the user that the subset of search result is provided to request sets
Standby 106.For example, in Fig. 1, search result set { SR1 ... SRN } is tied together with filter set { F1 ... F4 } in search
Shown in fruit page 107a.However, in result of page searching 107b, user selects filter F 1 and F2 on a user device,
So as to cause the search result set after being filtered { SR1, SR3 ..., SRM }.After filtering search result set SR1,
SR3 ..., SRM } be search result { SR1...SRN } proper subclass.
In some implementations, the inquiry submitted from user equipment is stored in inquiry log 114.Inquiry log
114 define search history data, and described search historical data is included from prior searches associated with unique identifier request
Data and data related to this.The inquiry that inquiry log 114 can be used for being submitted user equipment is mapped in search result
And take the resource identified in action in response to inquiring about the user presented together with search result.In some implementations
In, data are associated with the identifier from searching request so that may have access to the search history of each identifier.Inquiry log 114
May also include selection data, search engine the selection data can be used determine the corresponding sequence of inquiry that user equipment submits,
The frequency that the action and inquiry taken in response to inquiry have been submitted.Similarly, it is possible to use selection data are every to be directed to
A specific resources determine which user has found the most useful inquiry of resource.
Filter is generated from resource content
The operation of system 100 is described with reference to following Fig. 2, Fig. 2 is the instantiation procedure for generating query filter device
Block diagram 200.For example, system 100 in response to receive the search inquiry that user is inputted and implementation procedure 200.For example, for
Realize and process 200 is realized in the data processing equipment of filter subsystem 108.
System receives the search inquiry (202) that user inputs at the user equipment of the user equipment 106 of such as Fig. 1.Search
Rope inquiry may include one or more lexical items, for example, word, numeral or symbol.In some implementations, only when search is looked into
Inquiry just calls the mistake when being classified inquiry (that is, search result highly indicates the inquiry of particular category (for example, food, entertain when))
Journey.For example, inquiry " burgers (hamburger) " can be for example with classification " dining (dining) ", " food (food) " and
One or more of " restaurants (restaurant) " relevant classified inquiry.Classified inquiry can be made a reservation for by search engine 110
Justice, or can be identified in inquiry based on intention is dominated for example derived from the content of resource response.
The system performs language material library searching, to determine in response to the resource collection (204) of the search inquiry received.Language
Material storehouse can be the set of the available resources and text found at many publisher websites, for example, the publisher website of Fig. 1
104 and resource 105.
The system identification resource response (206).Resource response is to be confirmed as according at least threshold measurement in response to receiving
Those resources of the search inquiry arrived, for example, before ranking 1000 resource.For example, in response to receiving search inquiry
" burgers ", the resource response set identified may include restaurant menu, restaurant's comment and description.
The system excavates resource response corpus, to determine associated keyword set (208).Each keyword may include
One or more words, numeral or symbol.For example, when receiving search inquiry " burgers ", dug from resource response set
The association keyword set of pick may include the available thousands of food items nearby in food menu.In some implementations,
Comment, description and other metadata can be excavated, to search most common keyword in resource response corpus.
The system generates key words material storehouse (210) by excavating.Keyword corpus includes keyword, for example, ringing
Most common keyword in resource 206 is answered (such as, to meet the frequency threshold relative to the frequency of other keywords in resource response
The keyword of value).
Keyword corpus can be filtered, to generate candidate keywords set (211) according to candidate criteria.Wait
Standard is selected to may include the inquiry that resource 206 is responded.For example, for the resource in response to inquiring about " burgers ", inquiry log
114 are handled by filter subsystem 108, are looked into identifying with other of the one or more resources of at least threshold rate selection
Ask.In the above example, for inquiring about " burgers ", the resource based on inquiry log 114 may be in response to other inquiries
" guac burgers ", " barbeque burger restaurants " etc..Equally, it also can be used and be determined and inquire about
" burgers " relevant inquiry.In other examples, candidate criteria 211 may include the search inquiry phase with being inputted by user 202
Corresponding additional keyword is inquired about in the classified search of pass.
For example, it can promote to inquire about similarity result using language model 116.Similarity can be based on stem, synonym, very
To behavioral indicator (such as, for the similar point blow mode of different lexical items).For example, lexical item " guac " can be determined and restaurant's context
Under " California style (California style) " it is similar.
Filtration system 108 can also realize that stop-word filters, and be looked into remove search that is disabled or being received with user
Inquiry and/or the relevant keyword of inquiry from resource.
By the keyword of these inquiries compared with the keyword in corpus 210, to determine which keyword should
It is dropped.For example, corpus may include lexical item " heart healthy (health of heart) ".However, this keyword can not inquired about
In, or can be but very low relative to other keywords, frequency in queries.Therefore, lexical item " health of heart " will not be selected
As candidate keywords.
System generation candidate keywords corpus (212).Candidate keywords corpus includes being given birth to according to candidate criteria 211
Into keyword set.Candidate keywords corpus can be filtered, to generate filter word according to filter criteria
Item set (213).For example, candidate keywords corpus can realize the variance filter for candidate keywords.Variance filter
Enable the system to determine that there is the filter lexical item of difference in height in the search result set representated by them.In other examples
In, candidate keywords corpus can realize that lexical item highlights filter, so as to filter out and remove be only present in it is in metadata or right
The candidate keywords in unobtrusively position in the resource response 206 answered.
The system generates filter lexical item corpus (214) using the candidate keywords corpus after filtering.Can to
Family equipment provides the filter lexical item in filter lexical item corpus.Filter lexical item can be by certain user interface or exchange format
Show on a user device, and for narrowing search inquiry, to guide user closer to their final goal.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart 300 for providing another instantiation procedure of query filter device.Process 300 can be for reality
Realized in the data processing equipment of existing filter system 108.
Filter subsystem 108 receives the data (302) for the resource collection that identification is confirmed as in response to search inquiry.
In some implementations, search inquiry can be classified inquiry.Resource collection may include to include embedding information (for example, metamessage
And hyperlink) html page, electronic document, image file, video file, audio file and feeding source.For example, user may
Input inquiry " burgers ", and filter subsystem 108 and then can receive identification html page set or electronic document
The data of set, including comment, description and other metamessages related with available food item nearby in food menu.
Filter subsystem 108 extracts the first keyword set (304) from the content of resource collection.Keyword may include
With search inquiry associated one or more word, symbol or numerals.For example, the first keyword set may include to be confirmed as ringing
The set of word, symbol or the numeral that most should often occur in the content of the resource collection of search inquiry.
Filter subsystem 108 determines candidate filters set (306) in the first keyword set.Each candidate filters
Obtained from one or more of the first keyword set keyword.Candidate key set of words is the first keyword set
Proper subclass.
For example, in some implementations, filter subsystem 108 can be by determining to inquire about from the resource in resource collection
Gather to determine the candidate key set of words in the first keyword set, wherein, each inquiry in query set is to use
Family have selected at least one inquiry in resource for it.For example, resource in the top can be with inquiring about " guac
Burgers " and " whiskey barbeque burgers " height correlations.Therefore, can be used inquiry " guac burgers " and
" whiskey barbeque burgers " are used as candidate's selection criteria.
In other implementations, filter subsystem can be by determining query set come crucial from first from the first inquiry
Set of words determines candidate filters set, wherein, each inquiry in query set is intended to relevant with the first inquiry
Inquiry.For example, user may have input search inquiry " burgers ", and filter subsystem 108 can determine that search is looked into
Inquiry " hotdog (hot dog) " is related to search inquiry " burgers " and search inquiry " hotdog " is included in candidate's selection mark
In quasi- set.In the following, process relevant inquiring is more fully described with reference to Fig. 4 to identify candidate filters.
It is determined by being removed from the first keyword set with the candidate query set from resource and/or with receiving
The inquiry incoherent keyword of relevant inquiry determine candidate filters.It can be based on accurate matching or be looked into based on meeting to be directed to
The similarity threshold of lexical item is ask, determines that keyword is related to searching keyword.For example, keyword " guacamole (avocado sauce) "
Will be related to searching keyword " guac " because the two keywords be determined to be it is similar.Again, as described above, language mould
The use of type 116 can based on stem, synonym, behavior designator and the similarity of instruction lexical item or concept other it is semantic and/
Or behavioral data finds to promote to inquire about similarity.
Filter subsystem 108 determines query filter device set (308) in candidate filters set.In some realization sides
In formula, each query filter device in query filter device set meets discrepancy threshold, and discrepancy threshold instruction is by resource set
Close application query filter obtained from filtering after properties collection and by applying another query filter device to resource collection
Obtained from properties collection after filtering meet poor threshold value.For example, candidate filters set may include keyword " guacamole "
" guac ".System can determine that, by the resource collection application query filter for search inquiry " burgers "
Properties collection obtained from " guacamole " can with by the resource collection application query for search inquiry " burgers "
Properties collection obtained from filter " guac " is similar, if they are differed.Determining to pass through application query filter
When properties collection after filtering obtained from " guacamole " and " guac " is unsatisfactory for poor threshold value, query filter device set will not
Including both query filter device " guacamole " and " guac ".
Filter subsystem 108 is provided with identifying the content results one of the content in resource collection in response to the first inquiry
Play the query filter device set (310) shown on a user device.For example, query filter device set can retouched such as with reference to figure 1
Shown in the user interface of the user interface 107a stated.User input query is may be in response to, it is special inquiry can be provided to the user
In the web browser or other application of sign, for example, being searched in user via what the addressable search engine of web browser was provided
In rope results page, to user presentation user interface.User interface includes inquiry input, one or more users may be selected to inquire about
The list (for example, SR1-SRN) of filter (for example, filter F 1-F4) and content results or search result.If input text
Inquiry, then it can be the text field to inquire about input, or if input picture is inquired about, inquiry input can be placement location,
Or inquiry input can be any other input for supporting user to be directed to given input medium interaction.In some implementations
In, each content results in content results list are the search results for identifying the corresponding resource in resource collection.In other realities
In existing mode, each content results in content results list are the content subsets that the resource in resource collection includes.
Filter subsystem 108 receives the selection (312) to one or more query filter devices from user equipment.For example,
As the user interface 107b with reference to Fig. 1 is described, filter subsystem 108 can receive identification filter F 1 and the selection of F2
Information.
Filter subsystem 108 provides the properties collection after the filtering shown on a user device, the content after the filtering
Set identifies the content results set (314) different from unfiltered content results set.Identify the filtering of content results set
Properties collection afterwards is the proper subclass of unfiltered content results set.For example, as described with reference to fig. 1, the son after filtering
System, which can determine that, has selected for query filter device F1 and F2, and in response to determine to have selected for query filter device F1 and
F2, it is possible to provide different content results list SR1'-SRM'.
In other implementations, user equipment 106 can locally filter result on a user device.For example, user sets
It is standby to receive the set (for example, N is 100) of N number of search result, and show the subset (for example, M is 10) of M search result.
When user selects certain filter, N number of filter filtering can be used to be stored in N number of search result at user equipment to change
Shown search result.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart for determining the instantiation procedure 400 of candidate filters set from keyword set.For reality
Process 400 is realized in the data processing equipment of existing filter subsystem 108.
Filter subsystem 108 determines looking into from the resource being determined in the resource collection in response to the first search inquiry
Ask set (402).Each inquiry in query set is that user have selected at least one inquiry in resource for it.
Filter subsystem 108 determines that inquiry stops lexical item (404) from query set.It is frequency that each inquiry, which stops lexical item,
Rate meets that inquiry stops the lexical item in the query set of lexical item frequency threshold.In some implementations, filter subsystem 108 can
To be calculated using the grammer from inquiry learning that is public, related or specifying for the inquiry each inquired about in query set
Stop lexical item frequency.Meeting or exceeding each inquiry of predetermined queries stopping lexical item threshold value can be considered searching the inquiry in the domain
Rope is useless, and is classified as inquiry and stops lexical item.For example, user can input inquiry " find me cheese and
Guac burgers ", and filter subsystem can extract keyword " find me ", " cheese ", " and ", " guac ".
Keyword " cheese " and " guac " occur in other food relevant searches, and for example in many feelings unrelated with food search
Under condition, do not identify that " find me " and " and " have the higher frequency of occurrences for the keyword of any types food.Therefore, filter
Device subsystem can determine that " find me " and " and " are that inquiry stops lexical item to keyword.
Filter subsystem 108 excludes inquiry from candidate filters set and stops lexical item (406).For example, continue the above
Example, filter subsystem can exclude lexical item " find me " and " and " from candidate filters set.
The system determines information lexical item (408) from query set.Each information lexical item is that the frequency in query set is small
In or equal to information lexical item threshold value lexical item.It is not reaching to or each inquiry more than predetermined information lexical item threshold value can be considered pair
Query search in the domain is available, and is classified as information lexical item.For example, the example continued the above, user can input
Inquiry " find me cheese and guac burgers ", and filter subsystem can extract keyword " find me ",
“cheese”、“and”、“guac”.In other query search, keyword " cheese " and " guac " are any than without identifying
" find me " are low with the frequency of occurrences of " and " for the keyword of typical food.Therefore, filter subsystem can determine that keyword
" cheese " and " guac " is information lexical item.
System includes the information lexical item (410) in candidate filters set.For example, the example continued the above, filter
Keyword " cheese " and " guac " can be included in candidate filters set by system.
It can be highlighted and other marks based on frequency of the keyword in keyword corpus 210 and based on the lexical item in resource
Standard, the candidate filters alternatively found to the process by Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 are graded.For example, lexical item " Guacamole " is normal
Often appear in corpus and in title division.However, lexical item " beef (beef) " can only go out although also often occurring
In the body part of present title subordinate.Therefore, lexical item " Guacamole " can have the candidate than lexical item " beef " higher to filter
Device is graded.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart for determining the instantiation procedure 500 of the query filter device set in candidate filters set.
Process 500 of realizing is used for realization in the data processing equipment of filter subsystem 108.
For each candidate filters in candidate filters set, filter subsystem is by candidate query filter application
In resource collection, to obtain the content results set (502) after corresponding filtering.For example, candidate filters set may include to wait
Query filter device " guacamole " and " guac " are selected, and filter subsystem can apply candidate query filter
Both " guacamole " and candidate query filter " guac ", to obtain the content results set after two corresponding filterings.
Filter subsystem to candidate query filter to being grouped, for the corresponding of the candidate query filter pair
Content results set after filtering meets the essentially similar similarity threshold of the content results set after the corresponding filtering of instruction
(504).For example, filter subsystem can determine that as obtained from application query filter " guacamole " it is interior after filtering
Hold results set meet or more than with by application query filter " guac " and the content results set after the filtering that obtains
Similarity threshold.Therefore, candidate query filter " guacamole " and " guac " can be grouped by filter subsystem.At some
In implementation, filter subsystem can be directed to the representational candidate query filter of candidate query filter group selection.
Filter subsystem determines the matter of candidate query filter based on position of the candidate query filter in resource
Measure score value (506).For example, the candidate query filter for appearing in the notable position (such as, in the title of resource) of resource can
To be assigned the different candidate query filter higher quality score values than occurring in the metadata from resource associations.
Filter subsystem determines query filter device set (508) from candidate filters set.Based on query filter device
Definite quality score and difference, selects query filter device set from candidate filters set.The step of as described above with Fig. 3
308 descriptions, properties collection after the corresponding filtering as obtained to resource collection application respective queries filter is each other
