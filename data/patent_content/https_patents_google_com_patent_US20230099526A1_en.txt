- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for determining a perceptual quality of video content. More particularly, example aspects are directed to determining a perceptual quality score using one or more features based on the video content and generated by a machine-learned model. For instance, a perceptual quality score may correlate to an opinion of consumers of the video content relating to their experience with the video content. Example embodiments may output a perceptual quality score for a video content item that may be used to evaluate and deliver higher quality video content to users.

- a set of frames of a video content item can be input into a feature extraction model.
- the feature extraction model may be configured to generate one or more features that encode or otherwise correspond to perceptual characteristics of the set of frames (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, PIM, NLPD, etc.).

- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for determining a perceptual quality of video content. More particularly, example aspects are directed to determining a perceptual quality score using one or more features based on the video content and generated by a machine-learned model. For instance, a perceptual quality score may correlate to an opinion of consumers of the video content relating to their experience with the video content. Example embodiments may output a perceptual quality score for a video content item that may be used to evaluate and deliver higher quality video content to users. Advantageously, embodiments of the present disclosure can provide perceptual quality scores with improved correlation to an experience of a consumer of the video content, improving the ability to predict a consumer response to video content items.
- Example embodiments according to aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a machine-learned feature extraction model that generates one or more features for input to a perceptual quality model. For example, one or more frames of a subject video content item may be input to the machine-learned feature extraction model, and the model can output one or more features based on the frames. The features may comprise, in various embodiments, spatial and/or temporal features (e.g., features based on content of the frame, features based on changes between frames, etc.). The feature extraction model may, in some embodiments, generate one or more features that effectively correspond at least in part to high-level, semantic information about the input frame or frames. In some embodiments, the feature extraction model may include a partial or complete architecture of an adapted image recognition or classification model. In some embodiments, the features may effectively correspond to aspects of interest in the input frames (e.g., identifying characteristics of elements in the frame, moving elements in frame, etc.). The features, in turn, may be used to determine a perceptual quality score. For instance, the features may be optionally further processed (e.g., combined, aggregated, binned, etc.) and input into a machine-learned perceptual quality model to determine a perceptual quality score for the subject video content item (or a portion thereof).
- Example embodiments according to aspects of the present disclosure can provide for features that, when used as an input to a perceptual quality model, promote improved perceptual quality scoring with improved correlation to consumer opinion metrics. For instance, in some embodiments, features generated according to aspects of the present disclosure can advantageously improve the ability for the perceptual quality model to predict a perceptual quality as experienced by a viewer. In some embodiments, the perceptual quality model may also provide for a similarity comparison between two video content items (e.g., a subject video content item and a reference video content item) that correlates to a perceptual similarity experienced by one or more consumers of the video content items. In one example, for instance, the perceptual quality model may offer improved correlation to user experience when using one or more features that effectively correspond to semantic visual cues in the video content frames, as a viewer may perceive the video content with heightened sensitivity to the quality with which those visual cues are displayed. In this manner, for example, systems and methods of the present disclosure can provide for more accurate prediction of a user experience.
- Example embodiments according to aspects of the present disclosure are also directed to machine-learned video content encoding codecs. For instance, the perceptual quality score may be used as an objective for training a machine-learned codec (e.g., as part of an objective function). In this manner, for example, one or more parameters of a video encoder and/or decoder may be learned to improve the perceived quality of video content as experienced by a consumer of the video content and/or to reduce data requirements for delivering content while maintaining a target perceptual quality.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a perceptual quality may correspond to a perceived clarity, definition, smoothness, and/or other user-discernable characteristics of a video content item. For instance, in one embodiment, a perceptual quality may correlate to an opinion of a consumer of video content about the experience with the video content item. The perceptual quality may correlate to, for example, the experience of viewing the video content, the presence of discernible defects or distortions in the video content, whether the video content is displayed in an appealing or pleasing manner, or other factors relating to a consumer's perceptions of the video content. In some embodiments, a perceptual quality can correlate to, for example, a Mean Opinion Score metric, such as according to ITU-T Recommendation P.1204, P.1204.1-5.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a video content item can be any set of image data configured for display of a plurality of images in sequence. For instance, a video content item can comprise a set of frames (e.g., one or more) of a video associated with instructions to display the one or more frames in a sequence on a display device. In various embodiments, the video can comprise any one or more of photographic imagery, videographic imagery, and any other kind of digital imagery, including synthesized imagery (e.g., raster or vector), textual imagery, and other symbolic or pictographic representations of information configured for display.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, video content items may be configured for a passive viewing experience, an interactive experience, or both. For example, a video content item may be a movie, periodic show, social media video, news segment, live stream, slideshow, meme, GIF, snippet, etc. that is generally viewed passively without interaction with a user or otherwise containing content subject to the direction of the user. In some embodiments, video content items may be configured for an interactive experience. For instance, a video content item may be, or include elements that are, responsive to one or more user inputs. For instance, a video content item can comprise one or more frames that were processed (e.g., drawn, generated, rendered, etc.) based at least in part on a response to an input from a user. For instance, a video content item can, in some embodiments, display interactive content in substantially real-time. In one example, a video content item can include frames from a video game subject to the user's control (e.g., being played by the user in substantially real-time).
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, the video content item may be experienced by a user by display on one or more display devices. In various embodiments, a user's experience of the video content item may vary when one display device is used as compared to when another display device is used. For instance, different display devices may use display screens having different specifications (e.g., size, brightness, gamut, contrast ratio, response time, directionality, pixel density, surface finish, etc.), may correspond to different use cases (e.g., in bright environments, on the move, at home, at a desk, etc.), and/or may be positioned differently with respect to the user (e.g., a mobile device held close to user, a large-format display device for viewing across a room, etc.). Any one or more of these differences between display devices can contribute to a different experience by a user, a different set of quality expectations held by the user, or both.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a perceptual quality may be determined for a subject video content item directly. For instance, the perceptual quality determined for a subject video content item can correlate to a user's perception of quality of the subject video content item standing alone (e.g., without a direct comparison to another video content item). In some embodiments, a perceptual quality may be determined for a subject video content item by comparison to a reference video content item. For instance, in some embodiments, a perceptual quality model can determine a perceptual similarity between a subject video content item and a reference video content item. In this manner, too, the perceptual quality determined for a subject video content item can correlate to a user's perception of quality of the subject video content item standing alone (e.g., without a direct comparison to another video content item). Additionally, in some embodiments, the perceptual quality determined for a video content item can correlate to a user's perception of similarity of the subject video content item to another video content item.
- In some embodiments, a reference video content item can be an original version of a video, and a subject video content item can be a distorted or otherwise degraded version of the video. In some embodiments, the reference video content item can also be a degraded version of the video (e.g., differently distorted than the subject video content item, such as a version encoded differently and/or with different or less degradation).
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a set of frames of a video content item can be input into a feature extraction model. In some embodiments, the feature extraction model may be configured to generate one or more features that encode or otherwise correspond to perceptual characteristics of the set of frames (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, PIM, NLPD, etc.). In some embodiments, the feature extraction model may be configured, for example, to receive a frame (e.g., image data descriptive of the frame) and generate features that incorporate or embed higher-level information about the imagery contained within the frame. In some embodiments, one or more feature values may not correspond to human-intelligible information. In some embodiments, one or more features may effectively correspond to or otherwise respond at least in part to semantic features of or in the frame. For instance, in some embodiments, a feature extraction model can effectively semantically weight input data (e.g., by generating an output feature that is more responsive to perceptual qualities relating to or affecting semantic features in the input data).
- In some embodiments, a feature extraction model can include a machine-learned model. For instance, a machine-learned feature extraction model may include a neural network (e.g., a deep neural network). In some embodiments, a machine-learned feature extraction model may include a neural network having a structure configured for use in image recognition tasks (e.g., one or more structures or model architectures of an image classifier model architecture). In some embodiments, a machine-learned feature extraction model may include an image classifier model with one or more weights that were trained—or re-trained—for determining a perceptual quality of a video content item.
- For example, in one embodiment, a feature extraction model (e.g., a machine-learned feature extraction model) can generate one or more features from a set of frames that correspond to a user's perceived experience of watching playback of the set of frames. For instance, in some embodiments, one or more features generated by the feature extraction model may effectively highlight or otherwise respond to aspects of the imagery contained in the set of frames that correspond to a likely focus of a user's attention when viewing the set of frames.
- In some embodiments, for instance, the feature extraction model can contain an adapted image classifier model architecture that generates features which effectively correspond to semantic features in the set of frames (e.g., people, faces, animals, objects, locations, landmarks, etc.), which advantageously can correspond to the aspects of the imagery about which the user may be expecting or desiring to perceive in higher quality while viewing the video content item. An adapted image classifier model architecture can include, for instance, all or part of a pre-trained image classifier (e.g., all or part of an instance of VGG-16, MobileNet, Inception v3, etc.). In some embodiments, an adapted image classifier model architecture can include, for instance, an image classifier model architecture (e.g., all or part of an instance of VGG-16, MobileNet, Inception v3, etc.) having one or more of its weights (e.g., several weights, most weights, all weights, etc.) trained or re-trained for determining a perceptual quality of a video content item. In some embodiments, one or more weights of the adapted image classifier model architecture can be re-trained for determining a perceptual quality of a video content item (e.g., tuned) after being initialized with weights pre-trained for an image classification task. In some embodiments, the adapted image classifier model architecture may have one or more of its layer outputs linearly combined according to a set of learnable weights applied to the output of each layer, with the learnable weights trained for determining a perceptual quality of a video content item according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the adapted image classifier model architecture may have one or more of its layer outputs nonlinearly combined by a machine-learned model accepting the layer outputs as inputs.
- In one example embodiment, one or more features generated by the feature extraction model can encode or otherwise represent spatial information. For instance, one or more spatial features of a frame can include information determined by reference to other portions of the frame (e.g., describing how the data in the frame changes across the frame). For instance, spatial information can include measures of noise, luminance, contrast, gamut, identity (e.g., of the scene or elements depicted), etc. In some embodiments, one or more spatial features can include values relating to, for example, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index Measure, Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index Measure, Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity, Perceptual Information Metric, Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity, Pmetric, Normalized Laplacian Pyramid Distance, etc.
- In various embodiments, in addition to (or in alternative to) spatial features, one or more features generated by the feature extraction model can encode temporal information (e.g., describing how data in the frame changes in time). For instance, the feature extraction model can generate features that track or otherwise respond to changes between a sequence of frames in the set of frames. In some examples, the frames may be adjacent (e.g., adjacent in a playback sequence), although the frames may be non-adjacent in other examples. In one embodiment, for example, the feature extraction model can generate one or more features based at least in part on a difference (e.g., a subtractive difference, etc.) determined between frames in the set of frames.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, flow data may be generated to capture or otherwise represent changes between two or more frames of the video content item. In some embodiments, flow data can comprise linear combinations of frames or portions of frames. For example, generating flow data may include, for example, taking a subtractive difference between two frames. In some examples, the flow data can comprise the resulting subtractive difference. In addition to, or in alternative to, the subtractive difference between frames, flow data can also comprise one or more rates of change between frames, including rates computed across more than two frames (e.g., second, third, and/or higher order differences), and/or other data descriptive of the change between the frames (e.g., historical rate values, maximum and minimum rate values, etc.).
- In some embodiments, a feature extraction model can generate one or more features based at least in part on a set of frames from a subject video content item and a set of frames from a reference video content item. For instance, a feature extraction model can generate a feature by comparing a subject frame set to a reference frame set. In some embodiments, a feature extraction model can generate a feature by comparing data based on or otherwise derived from a subject frame set with data based on or otherwise derived from a reference frame set. In one embodiment, for example, the feature extraction model can generate a feature by comparing flow data associated with a subject frame set with flow data associated with a reference frame set.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, one or more features generated by one or more feature extraction models may be combined. For example, the one or more features can be linearly combined, nonlinearly combined, or both. In some embodiments, one or more features are combined (e.g., linearly, nonlinearly) for input into a perceptual quality model. In some embodiments, a plurality of features may be input separately into a perceptual quality model.
- In some embodiments, one or more features can be generated for a frame or set of frames. In some embodiments, one or more features can be generated for a subportion of a frame (or a corresponding subportion of each frame of a set of frames). For instance, in some embodiments, one or more different features can be generated for each of a plurality of subportions of a frame (or a corresponding subportion of each frame of a set of frames). In some embodiments, the different features generated for different subportions may be chosen based at least in part on a likely area of attention for the user (e.g., based on saliency, semantic elements, etc.).
- In some embodiments, one or more features generated for one frame or a first frame set and one or more features generated for another frame or a second frame set may be processed (e.g., by a perceptual aggregator model) to provide an aggregate feature value for both frames or frame sets. For example, a video content item may comprise a plurality of frames that may be subdivided into a plurality of frame sets. One or more features may be generated by the feature extraction model for each of the frame sets, and the one or more features may be processed to generate an aggregate feature value for the plurality of frames. In some examples, generating an aggregate feature value with a perceptual aggregator model can comprise the processing of various statistical markers, including a mean feature value, a median feature value, an n-th percentile feature value, the values of one or more histogram bins, etc. In some examples, generating an aggregate feature value with a perceptual aggregator model can comprise linearly combining the respective feature values of the plurality of frame sets. In some examples, generating an aggregate feature value with a perceptual aggregator model can comprise nonlinearly combining the respective feature values of the plurality of frame sets. In some examples, generating an aggregate feature value can comprise inputting the respective feature values of the plurality of frame sets into a perceptual aggregator model (e.g., a machine-learned model, such as a neural network, etc.) and outputting an aggregate feature value.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a perceptual quality model can output a perceptual quality score based at least in part on one or more features generated by the perceptual quality model. For instance, an input to the perceptual quality model can comprise one or more of the features directly, and additionally, or alternatively, in some embodiments, an input can comprise an aggregate feature value or a plurality of aggregated feature values. In some embodiments, a perceptual quality model comprises a nonlinear model. In some embodiments, a perceptual quality model comprises a machine-learned model (e.g., a neural network).
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a perceptual quality score can correlate to a predicted experience of a user with the subject video content item. For instance, the perceptual quality score can, in some embodiments, correlate with a predicted opinion of the user regarding a perceptual quality of the subject video content item. In some embodiments, the perceptual quality score can be a numerical output corresponding to a predicted numerical rating by a human observer. In some embodiments, the predicted numerical rating can correspond to, for example, a Mean Opinion Score metric, such as according to ITU-T Recommendation P.1204, P.1204.1-5. In some embodiments, a perceptual quality score can be any output value having a correlation to a perceptual quality of a subject video content item, such as a similarity between the subject video content item and a reference video content item.
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, any one or several of the feature extraction model, the perceptual aggregator model, and the perceptual quality model may comprise one or more machine-learned models. In some embodiments, the machine-learned models can be trained together. In some embodiments, one or more machine-learned models can be trained separately from one or more other machine-learned models. In some embodiments, for example, a feature extraction model can comprise an adapted image classifier model. For instance, a feature extraction model can comprise one or more parameters initially trained on a first corpus of training examples (e.g., classification data for images, such as annotated or labeled images) and one or more parameters (e.g., the same parameters and/or different parameters) trained on a second corpus of training examples (e.g., perceptual quality data for video content and/or image content, such as rated or scored video and/or images).
- In some examples, a set of training data for training one or more machine-learned models according to example aspects of the present disclosure can include data associating video content and/or image content with viewer feedback (e.g., a score for content input by a viewer while or after viewing the content) regarding the perceptual quality of the content. The data can include one or more scores or values associated with the content, including, for example, an MOS or other numerical rating, natural language feedback, a preference indicator (e.g., a value indicating a selection of one content item as preferred over another content item), combinations thereof, or other indicators of an opinion regarding the perceptual quality of the content. The training data may also include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the device used to display the content to the user (e.g., manufacturer, model, screen size, screen technology, screen brightness, screen color temperature, screen gamut, screen contrast ratio, screen refresh rate, screen directionality pixel density, maximum frame rendering rate, etc.). The training data may include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the context in which the device was used (e.g., room brightness, room lighting temperature, viewing angle, viewing distance, viewing duration, solo vs. group viewing, etc.). The training data may include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the user (e.g., age, visual impairment, predicted and/or indicated interest in content, etc.). The training data may also include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the content (e.g., title, genre, duration, resolution, bit depth, bit depth of any corresponding audio recording, visual or artistic style, target distribution platform, closed captioning, description of scene depicted, etc.).
- In some embodiments, for example, training data may be used to learn one or more parameters of any one or several of the feature extraction model, the perceptual aggregator model, and the perceptual quality model. For instance, the training data may be used to learn parameters that improve the ability of the model(s) to predict a perceptual quality score that correlates to a user's opinion. In some embodiments, for example, a loss can be determined based at least in part on a difference between an actual and a predicted perceptual quality score, and any or all of the model(s) can be trained to decrease the loss.
- In some embodiments, for instance, any one or several of the feature extraction model, the perceptual aggregator model, and the perceptual quality model can be trained to predict a perceptual quality score for content, with data indicating characteristics of the display device, the display context, the user, and/or the content also being used as an input. In this manner, for example, the predicted perceptual quality score can be responsive to such characteristics (or other characteristics learned or otherwise predicted from the training data).
- In some embodiments, different instances of any one or several of the model(s) can be trained separately using various subsets of the training data. For example, in one embodiment, an instance of any one or several of the feature extraction model, the perceptual aggregator model, and the perceptual quality model can be especially trained to predict a perceptual quality score for, e.g., content being displayed on a particular type of display device (e.g., using training data associated with that type of display device), or any other particular characteristic or set of characteristics. Another instance can, for example, be trained to predict a perceptual quality score for content associated with a different characteristic or set of characteristics. In this manner, for example, the predicted perceptual quality score can be responsive to such characteristics (or other characteristics learned or otherwise predicted from the training data).
- In one example embodiment according to aspects of the present disclosure, a perceptual quality score can be used as an objective for training a machine-learned model. For example, in some embodiments, a perceptual quality score can be used as a training objective for learning one or more parameters of a machine-learned codec. For example, a machine-learned codec can be used to encode a reference video content item. The encoding can be decoded (e.g., with or without being transmitted and/or subjected to a simulated transmission) according to the codec to produce a subject video content item. In some embodiments, the codec comprises a compression algorithm for decreasing the data used or required to store, transmit, or otherwise represent the video content and/or a processing cost of rendering the video content. In some embodiments, distortion or other degradation effects can result from compression of the video content, such that the compressed video content item is a distorted version of the original. By predicting a perceptual quality score for the subject video content item according to example aspects of the present disclosure and using the score as an objective for training one or more parameters of the codec, a codec may be learned that decreases perceived and/or actual distortion or degradation resulting from the compression.
- Systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for a number of technical effects and benefits, including improvements to computing systems, devices, and technology. For example, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for improved evaluation of perceptual quality of video content items, decreasing the need for costly (e.g., in time, in energy, in resources, etc.) manual scoring of perceptual quality for video content items. Furthermore, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can enable improved user experiences by allowing video content items to be delivered which better match user expectations for a given device, in a given context, or with given content. For instance, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for video content items that can be tailored to a user, a user's device, and/or a user's context, to provide a consistent user experience that is robust to changes in such factors.
- Additionally, in a content streaming context, for example, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for a given data transmission budget to be better allocated to deliver a target perceptual quality. For example, in some embodiments, because perceptual quality scores of systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide better correlation with viewer opinion, a data transmission budget can be expended in a more impactful manner to achieve a desired quality level. Additionally, or alternatively, a data transmission budget can be reduced while maintaining a target perceptual quality by better allocating a data transmission budget to deliver video content items having a predicted perceptual quality that better corresponds to the recipient's experience. In this manner, for example, fewer computing resources and less energy may be required to deliver video content that matches or even exceeds user expectations.
- Additionally, in an interactive streaming context, for example, by improving the perceptual quality for a given data transmission budget (or, by reducing the required data budget for a target perceptual quality), systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for an improved interactive experience (e.g., lower latency, more perceived immersion, better graphics, etc.) by posing less of a burden on local processing resources for a given perceptual quality level and freeing resources for other processing tasks (e.g., processing user inputs, processing updates from other network-connected users, providing more robust network transmission, etc.).
- Additionally, for example, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for codecs (e.g., compression, lossless, etc.) with improved perceptual quality performance without requiring manual evaluation of a potentially vast search space of codec parameters. In some embodiments, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for codecs that can be tailored to provide a consistent experience for a user that is robust to changes in the user, the user's device(s), and/or the user's context.
- With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.

FIG. 3 depicts an illustration of how, in one example embodiment, temporal features may be generated for two frame sets of a subject video 104 (e.g., with comparison to a reference video 102). For instance, in one example, -
F1 temporal=f(Ref_Vid(frame_1, frame_2), Sub_Vid(frame_1, frame_2)) - and
-
F2 temporal=f(Ref_Vid(frame_2, frame_3), Sub_Vid(frame_2, frame_3)), - such that F1 temporal captures information about changes in the respective videos between
frame 1 and frame 2 (e.g., flow data) and F2 temporal captures information about changes in the respective videos betweenframe 2 and frame 3 (e.g., flow data). In some embodiments, FN temporal (e.g., a temporal feature associated with a frame set N) comprises flow data for a frame set of a reference video 102 (e.g., a reference frame set) and a frame set of a subject video 104 (e.g., a subject frame set). In some embodiments, for example, feature extraction model(s) 130 may output one or more temporal features FN temporal responsive to one or more input frame sets (e.g., a subject frame set and reference data, such as a reference frame set). -

Thus, one ormore models 420 can be stored and implemented at the user computing device 402 and/or one ormore models 440 can be stored and implemented at theserver computing system 430. - The user computing device 402 can also include one or more user input components 422 that receives user input. For example, the user input component 422 can be a touch-sensitive component (e.g., a touch-sensitive display screen or a touch pad) that is sensitive to the touch of a user input object (e.g., a finger or a stylus). The touch-sensitive component can serve to implement a virtual keyboard. Other example user input components include a microphone, a traditional keyboard, or other means by which a user can provide user input.

server computing system 430 can train themodels 420 and/or 440 via interaction with thetraining computing system 450 that is communicatively coupled (e.g., over the network 480). Thetraining computing system 450 can be separate from theserver computing system 430 or can be a portion of theserver computing system 430. - The
training computing system 450 includes one or more processors 452 and amemory 454. The one or more processors 452 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, an FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. Thememory 454 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof.

training computing system 450 can include amodel trainer 460 that trains the machine-learnedmodels 420 and/or 440 stored at the user computing device 402 and/or theserver computing system 430 using various training or learning techniques, such as, for example, backwards propagation of errors. For example, a loss function can be backpropagated through the model(s) to update one or more parameters of the model(s) (e.g., based on a gradient of the loss function). Various loss functions can be used such as mean squared error, likelihood loss, cross entropy loss, hinge loss, and/or various other loss functions. Gradient descent techniques can be used to iteratively update the parameters over a number of training iterations. - In some implementations, performing backwards propagation of errors can include performing truncated backpropagation through time. The
model trainer 460 can perform a number of generalization techniques (e.g., weight decays, dropouts, etc.) to improve the generalization capability of the models being trained. - In particular, the
model trainer 460 can train the machine-learnedmodels 420 and/or 440 based on a set oftraining data 462. Thetraining data 462 can include, for example, data associating video content and/or image content with viewer feedback (e.g., a score for content input by a viewer while or after viewing the content) regarding the perceptual quality of the content. Thetraining data 462 can include one or more scores or values associated with the content, including, for example, an MOS or other numerical rating, natural language feedback, a preference indicator (e.g., a value indicating a selection of one content item as preferred over another content item), combinations thereof, or other indicators of an opinion regarding the perceptual quality of the content. Thetraining data 462 may also include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the device used to display the content to the user (e.g., manufacturer, model, screen size, screen technology, screen brightness, screen color temperature, screen gamut, screen contrast ratio, screen refresh rate, screen directionality pixel density, maximum frame rendering rate, etc.). Thetraining data 462 may include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the context in which the device was used (e.g., room brightness, room lighting temperature, viewing angle, viewing distance, viewing duration, solo vs. group viewing, etc.). Thetraining data 462 may include, for example, data indicating one or more characteristics of the user (e.g., age, visual impairment, predicted and/or actual interest in content, etc.).

For instance, data in the
training data 462 can be collected and/or output by one or more sensors on board the user computing device 402. Thus, in such implementations, themodel 420 provided to the user computing device 402 can be trained by thetraining computing system 450 on user-specific data received from the user computing device 402. In some instances, this process can be referred to as personalizing the model. - The
model trainer 460 includes computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. Themodel trainer 460 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. For example, in some implementations, themodel trainer 460 includes program files stored on a storage device, loaded into a memory and executed by one or more processors.
