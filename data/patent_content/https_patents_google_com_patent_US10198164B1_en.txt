- the present disclosure relates generally to geographic information systems and, more particularly to interfaces for navigating imagery of geographic areas provided by geographic information systems.
- Geographic information systems provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulating of data that has been stored and indexed according to geographic coordinates of its elements.
- Geographic information systems and other services can allow a user to view geographic imagery associated with an object or location of interest. For instance, a user may request imagery associated with a particular store, location, landmark, etc.
- the geographic information system can provide geographic imagery depicting the object or location of interest in response to the request to the user.
- Geographic information systems can offer imagery of geographic regions of interest in a variety of different formats and from a variety of different view perspectives. For instance, geographic imagery can be provided as map imagery, satellite imagery, aerial imagery, interactive panoramic imagery presented from a perspective at or near ground level, and other imagery.
- Some geographic information systems provide a user interface with navigation controls for navigating cities, neighborhoods, geographic areas and other terrain in two or three dimensions. The navigation controls can enable users to tilt, pan, rotate, zoom, and activate a virtual camera to obtain views of terrain, buildings, and other objects from different perspectives at a geographic area of interest.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of displaying imagery of a geographic area.
- the method includes providing for display, by one or more computing devices, imagery of a geographic area at a first zoom level and detecting, by the one or more computing devices, a continuous zoom event.
- the method includes providing for display, by the one or more computing devices, an interface element.
- the interface element includes a plurality of geographic labels. Each geographic label is associated with a different zoom level of the imagery. Each geographic label can provide a description of a geographic area corresponding to the zoom level associated with the geographic label.
- the method further includes receiving, by the one or more computing devices, data indicative of a user interaction selecting one of the plurality of geographic labels in the interface element as a selected geographic label.
- the method includes zooming, by the one or more computing devices, the imagery of the geographic area to a second zoom level corresponding to the selected geographic label.

- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for displaying geographic imagery provided, for instance, by a geographic information system, such as a mapping service or a virtual globe application.
- a geographic information system such as a mapping service or a virtual globe application.
- Geographic information systems and other services can allow a user to navigate and view imagery of a geographic area. Users can navigate the imagery by panning, tilting, and/or zooming the imagery using various user interface tools to view the imagery from a variety of different perspectives.
- a user can zoom in and/or zoom out the imagery to a desired view of the geographic area by interacting with a zooming button or other zoom interface. Every time the user interacts with (e.g. clicks or taps) the zooming button, the imagery can zoom in or zoom out for one or more zoom levels and the scale of the imagery (e.g. map imagery) can be adjusted accordingly. In certain cases, a user may have to interact with the zoom interface multiple times to reach a desired view of the imagery. This can be a tedious experience for the user. More particularly, each time the user interacts with the zoom interface, the imagery of the geographic area for each corresponding zoom level has to be updated. This can take time as updating the imagery can require connecting to a server, requesting data objects (e.g.
- a user may have to read the imagery to find labels to determine the current viewpoint of the imagery during zooming of the imagery. For example, if the user's current viewpoint is California and the user would like to view imagery of downtown San Jose, the user may have to examine the imagery each time the imagery is zoomed to determine if there is a label on the imagery indicative of “San Jose” to confirm that the user is looking from the desired viewpoint.
- an interface for zooming map imagery that assists a user in finding a desired location quickly without requiring the fetching and rendering of unnecessary data objects for updating the imagery.
- a location selector interface element can be displayed in conjunction with the imagery when a continuous zoom event is detected.
- a continuous zoom event can occur when multiple zoom requests are received without interruption over a defined time period. For instance, a continuous zoom event can be detected when data indicative of three or more zoom requests is received over a time period of five seconds or less.
- the location selector interface element can be displayed in conjunction with a zoom interface for zooming the imagery.
- the location selector interface element can be displayed adjacent to the zoom interface.
- the location selector interface element can include a plurality of geographic labels. Each geographic label can be associated with a different zoom level of the imagery. Each geographic label can provide a description of a geographic area corresponding to the zoom level associated with the geographic label. For instance, a geographic label “California” can be descriptive of a zoom level of the imagery that allows the user to view imagery of the entire state of California. A geographic label “San Jose” can be descriptive of a zoom level of the imagery that allows the user to view imagery of San Jose.
- the plurality of geographic labels are identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element based at least in part data indicative of user intentions, such as data indicative of a current view of the imagery as well as a zoom direction associated with a user request to zoom the imagery. For instance, if a user requests to zoom in imagery from a view of the state of California to a middle part of the state, the system can identify geographic labels associated with locations in the middle part of the state for inclusion in the location selector interface element. For instance, “San Francisco,” “San Jose”, and “Oakland” can be selected for inclusion in the location selector interface element.
- a user can interact with the location selector interface element to select a desired zoom level for viewing the imagery. For instance, a user can interact with (e.g. click or tap) a geographic label to select the geographic label as a selected geographic label. In response to the user interaction, the imagery can be zoomed to the zoom level corresponding to the selected geographic label.
- the systems and methods of the present disclosure can have a technical effect of providing imagery for display on one or more computing devices such that a user can easily and quickly navigate to desired views of the imagery without having to fetch or render unnecessary data objects (e.g. image tiles) associated with other views of the imagery.

This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/041,311, filed Aug. 25, 2014, entitled “Triggering Location Selector by Continuous Zooming,” which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.
The present disclosure relates generally to geographic information systems and, more particularly to interfaces for navigating imagery of geographic areas provided by geographic information systems.
Geographic information systems provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulating of data that has been stored and indexed according to geographic coordinates of its elements. Geographic information systems and other services can allow a user to view geographic imagery associated with an object or location of interest. For instance, a user may request imagery associated with a particular store, location, landmark, etc. The geographic information system can provide geographic imagery depicting the object or location of interest in response to the request to the user.
Geographic information systems can offer imagery of geographic regions of interest in a variety of different formats and from a variety of different view perspectives. For instance, geographic imagery can be provided as map imagery, satellite imagery, aerial imagery, interactive panoramic imagery presented from a perspective at or near ground level, and other imagery. Some geographic information systems provide a user interface with navigation controls for navigating cities, neighborhoods, geographic areas and other terrain in two or three dimensions. The navigation controls can enable users to tilt, pan, rotate, zoom, and activate a virtual camera to obtain views of terrain, buildings, and other objects from different perspectives at a geographic area of interest.
Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be learned from the description, or may be learned through practice of the embodiments.
One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of displaying imagery of a geographic area. The method includes providing for display, by one or more computing devices, imagery of a geographic area at a first zoom level and detecting, by the one or more computing devices, a continuous zoom event. In response to detecting the continuous zoom event, the method includes providing for display, by the one or more computing devices, an interface element. The interface element includes a plurality of geographic labels. Each geographic label is associated with a different zoom level of the imagery. Each geographic label can provide a description of a geographic area corresponding to the zoom level associated with the geographic label. The method further includes receiving, by the one or more computing devices, data indicative of a user interaction selecting one of the plurality of geographic labels in the interface element as a selected geographic label. In response to receiving the data indicative of the user interaction with the interface element, the method includes zooming, by the one or more computing devices, the imagery of the geographic area to a second zoom level corresponding to the selected geographic label.
Other example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems, apparatus, tangible, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces, memory devices, and electronic devices for displaying imagery of a geographic area.
These and other features, aspects and advantages of various embodiments will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the present disclosure and, together with the description, serve to explain the related principles.
Detailed discussion of embodiments directed to one of ordinary skill in the art are set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, in which:
Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.
Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for displaying geographic imagery provided, for instance, by a geographic information system, such as a mapping service or a virtual globe application. Geographic information systems and other services can allow a user to navigate and view imagery of a geographic area. Users can navigate the imagery by panning, tilting, and/or zooming the imagery using various user interface tools to view the imagery from a variety of different perspectives.
For example, a user can zoom in and/or zoom out the imagery to a desired view of the geographic area by interacting with a zooming button or other zoom interface. Every time the user interacts with (e.g. clicks or taps) the zooming button, the imagery can zoom in or zoom out for one or more zoom levels and the scale of the imagery (e.g. map imagery) can be adjusted accordingly. In certain cases, a user may have to interact with the zoom interface multiple times to reach a desired view of the imagery. This can be a tedious experience for the user. More particularly, each time the user interacts with the zoom interface, the imagery of the geographic area for each corresponding zoom level has to be updated. This can take time as updating the imagery can require connecting to a server, requesting data objects (e.g. tile data objects), and rendering the data objects. In addition, a user may have to read the imagery to find labels to determine the current viewpoint of the imagery during zooming of the imagery. For example, if the user's current viewpoint is California and the user would like to view imagery of downtown San Jose, the user may have to examine the imagery each time the imagery is zoomed to determine if there is a label on the imagery indicative of “San Jose” to confirm that the user is looking from the desired viewpoint.
According to example aspects of the present disclosure, an interface is provided for zooming map imagery that assists a user in finding a desired location quickly without requiring the fetching and rendering of unnecessary data objects for updating the imagery. More particularly, a location selector interface element can be displayed in conjunction with the imagery when a continuous zoom event is detected. A continuous zoom event can occur when multiple zoom requests are received without interruption over a defined time period. For instance, a continuous zoom event can be detected when data indicative of three or more zoom requests is received over a time period of five seconds or less.
In response to the continuous zoom event, the location selector interface element can be displayed in conjunction with a zoom interface for zooming the imagery. For instance, the location selector interface element can be displayed adjacent to the zoom interface. The location selector interface element can include a plurality of geographic labels. Each geographic label can be associated with a different zoom level of the imagery. Each geographic label can provide a description of a geographic area corresponding to the zoom level associated with the geographic label. For instance, a geographic label “California” can be descriptive of a zoom level of the imagery that allows the user to view imagery of the entire state of California. A geographic label “San Jose” can be descriptive of a zoom level of the imagery that allows the user to view imagery of San Jose.
According to particular aspects of the present disclosure, the plurality of geographic labels are identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element based at least in part data indicative of user intentions, such as data indicative of a current view of the imagery as well as a zoom direction associated with a user request to zoom the imagery. For instance, if a user requests to zoom in imagery from a view of the state of California to a middle part of the state, the system can identify geographic labels associated with locations in the middle part of the state for inclusion in the location selector interface element. For instance, “San Francisco,” “San Jose”, and “Oakland” can be selected for inclusion in the location selector interface element.
A user can interact with the location selector interface element to select a desired zoom level for viewing the imagery. For instance, a user can interact with (e.g. click or tap) a geographic label to select the geographic label as a selected geographic label. In response to the user interaction, the imagery can be zoomed to the zoom level corresponding to the selected geographic label. In this way, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can have a technical effect of providing imagery for display on one or more computing devices such that a user can easily and quickly navigate to desired views of the imagery without having to fetch or render unnecessary data objects (e.g. image tiles) associated with other views of the imagery.
In particular implementations, the user interface 100 can allow a user to interact with a geographic information system, such as a mapping service or virtual globe application. The geographic information system can be hosted on a server (e.g. a web server) in communication with the one or more computing devices 110 over a network, such as the Internet. The geographic information system can provide interactive imagery 120 of a geographic area for navigation and viewing by a user via the user interface 100. The imagery 120 of the geographic area can be indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates. A user can navigate the imagery 120 using various navigation controls that enable the user to tilt, pan, rotate, and/or zoom the imagery to obtain views of the geographic area from various different perspectives.
The user interface 100 includes an example zooming interface 130. The example zooming interface 130 includes an interface element that has a “−” button and a “+” button. A user can interact with the “−” button to zoom the imagery in a first zoom direction to more zoomed out zoom levels. A user can interact with the “+” button to zoom the imagery in a second zoom direction to more zoomed in zoom levels.
A continuous zoom event can occur, for instance, when a user requests to zoom the imagery in the same zoom direction multiple times without interruption within a defined time period. In the example of FIG. 1 , a user can request to zoom the imagery with a user interaction 132 (e.g. a click or tap) with the zooming interface 130. In response to the user interaction 132, the imagery 120 can begin to transition to a more zoomed out zoom level as indicated by arrow 112. As the imagery 120 is transitioning to the more zoomed out zoom level and prior to fully rendering the updated imagery associated with the more zoomed out zoom level, a user can again request to zoom the imagery with a user interaction 134 with the zooming interface. In response to the request, the imagery 120 can further transition to an even more zoomed out zoom level as indicated by arrow 114. As the imagery 120 is transitioning to the even more zoomed out zoom level and prior to fully rendering the updated imagery associated with the even more zoomed out zoom level, a user can again request to zoom the imagery with a user interaction 136 with the zooming interface. A continuous zoom event can be detected based at least in part on the multiple, repeated user interactions with the zooming interface 130 demonstrated in FIG. 1 . In response to the continuous zoom event, a location selector interface element can be displayed in the user interface 100.
The location selector interface element 150 shown in FIG. 2 includes a plurality of geographic labels, in this case a first geographic label 152, a second geographic label 154, and a third geographic label 156. More or fewer geographic labels can be included in the location selector interface element 150 without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. In particular implementations, the location selector interface element 150 can also include a textual descriptor of the functionality of the location selector interface element. In the example location selector interface element 150 of FIG. 2 , the textual descriptor includes “Are you looking for:”
Each geographic label in the location selector interface element 150 can be associated with a different specific zoom level of the imagery 120 and can provide a description of a geographic area corresponding to zoom level. For instance, the first geographic label 152 includes a textual description “US” to describe a zoom level that views the entire United States. The second geographic label 154 includes a textual description “California” to describe a zoom level that views the entire state of California. The third geographic label 156 includes a textual description “San Jose” to describe a zoom level that views the entire city of San Jose. Other descriptors indicative of the geographic area corresponding to the zoom levels associated with the geographic labels can be used without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. The geographic labels can allow a user to select a particular zoom level associated with a desired view without having to continuous scan the imagery 120 while zooming for labels indicative of the current view.
According to particular aspects of the present disclosure, different geographic labels can be identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element 150 based on data indicative of user intentions while zooming the imagery. More particularly, data indicative of a current view of the imagery as well as a zoom direction (e.g. zooming in or zooming out) associated with the continuous zoom event can be used to identify candidate geographic labels for inclusion in the location selector interface element 150. The candidate geographic labels can be scored or ranked based at least in part on various factors, such as user browsing history, user location, user search history, popular views, data indicative of point of interest importance, etc. The candidate geographic labels with the highest scores or ranks can be selected for inclusion in the location selector interface element 150.
Various embodiments discussed herein may access and analyze personal information about users, or make use of personal information, such as historical location history, user device location information, user browsing history, and other information. In situations in which the systems and methods discussed herein access and analyze information about users, or make use of such information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect the information and to control whether and/or how to receive content from the system or other application. In certain cases, no such information or data is collected or used until the user has been provided meaningful notice of what information is to be collected and how the information is used. The information may not be collected or used unless the user provides consent, which can be revoked or modified by the user at any time. Thus, the user can have control over how such information is collected and used by the application or system. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user.
The location selector interface element 150 can have the technical effect of allowing a user to easily navigate to various zoom levels without having to fetch and render data objects associated with intermediate zoom levels. FIG. 4 depicts a representation 200 of zooming imagery using a location selector interface element according to example aspects of the present disclosure. For instance, imagery associated with a first zoom level 202 can be provided for display in a user interface. Upon the occurrence of a continuous zoom event, a location selector interface element can be provided for display in the user interface. The user can select a geographic label corresponding to a second zoom level 204 in the location selector interface element. As shown in FIG. 4 , the second zoom level 204 can be separated from the first zoom level 202 by one or more intermediate zoom levels 206. During the zooming of the imagery to the second zoom level 204, one or more data objects (e.g. image tiles) associated with the intermediate zoom levels may not be rendered. Accordingly, a faster transition can be provided between the first zoom level 202 and the second zoom level 204, enhancing the user experience.
At (302), the method includes providing for display, by one or more computing devices, imagery of a geographic area at a first zoom level. For instance, data objects (e.g. tile data objects) associated with the imagery of the geographic area can be provided for display on a display device. The imagery can include map imagery, satellite imagery, aerial imagery, interactive panoramic imagery presented from a perspective at or near ground level, and other imagery.
At (304), the method includes receiving data indicative of one or more zoom requests. A zoom request can be a request to navigate the imagery to a different zoom level. The data indicative of the zoom request can include data indicative of a user interaction with a zoom interface that is presented in conjunction with the imagery. The zoom interface can allow users to zoom and/or otherwise navigate the imagery. Other data indicative of zoom requests can include user inputs or gestures requesting to zoom imagery. For instance, the data indicative of a zoom request can include data associated with one or more touch gestures (e.g. a pinch gesture) on a touchscreen or touchpad used to zoom imagery.
At (306), the method can detect whether a continuous zoom event has occurred. A continuous zoom event can occur when a user provides multiple zoom requests over a time period. For example, a continuous zoom event can be detected when data indicative of a plurality of user interactions with a zoom interface are received over a given time period. As another example, a continuous zoom event can be detected when data indicative of a plurality of user requests to zoom (e.g. via user inputs or gestures) the imagery are received over a given time period. The time period can be specified to be any suitable time period. For instance, in one embodiment, a continuous zoom event can occur when data indicative of three or more zoom requests is received over a time period of five seconds or less.
When a continuous zoom event is detected, the method triggers the display of a location selector interface element as will be discussed in more detail below. Otherwise the method proceeds to zoom the imagery in accordance with the data indicative of the zoom request (308). For instance, the imagery can be zoomed in or zoomed out one or more zoom levels for each zoom request.
When a continuous zoom event is detected, the method can first identify geographic labels for inclusion in a location selector interface element (310). More particularly, a location selector interface element according to example aspects of the present disclosure can include a plurality of geographic labels. Each of the geographic labels can be associated with a particular zoom level and can provide a description of the geographic area corresponding to the zoom level.
The geographic labels can be identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element based on data indicative of user intentions so that the location selector interface element provides a convenient tool for zooming to desired views of the imagery. In one particular example embodiment, the geographic labels are identified based at least in part on a zoom direction associated with the continuous zoom event. For instance, if the continuous zoom event is associated with zooming out the imagery, one or more geographic labels associated with more zoomed out views can be identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element. If the continuous zoom event is associated with zooming in the imagery, one or more geographic labels associated with more zoomed in views can be identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element.
A plurality of candidate geographic labels can be identified based at least in part on a current view of the imagery and a zoom direction associated with the continuous zoom event. The candidate geographic labels can be scored or ranked based on various factors or signals, such as data indicative of user preferences, user browsing history, user location, point of interest/landmark importance, historical usage, and other factors. One or more of the candidate geographic labels associated with the highest rank or the highest score can be identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element.
At (312), the location selector interface element is provided for display, for instance, on a display device. For instance, the location selector interface element is provided for display in conjunction with the imagery of the geographic area in a user interface, such as adjacent to a zooming interface for zooming the imagery. The location selector interface element can include geographic labels identified for inclusion in the location selector interface element.
At (314) it is determined whether data indicative of a user interaction with a geographic label in the location selector interface element is received. If so, the method zooms the imagery to the zoom level corresponding to the geographic label selected by the user via the user interaction (316). Otherwise, the method continues to zoom imagery in accordance with the zoom request (308).
