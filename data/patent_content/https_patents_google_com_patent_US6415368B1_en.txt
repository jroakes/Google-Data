Definitions
- This invention relates generally to a system and method for optimizing end user and network resources in network systems where various levels of caching exist.
- Network systems such as intranets and the World Wide Web (the Web) employ caching (the use of resources like memory, disk, etc. with very short access time for frequently used data files) at various levels in order to decrease network loads and response times.
- caching the use of resources like memory, disk, etc. with very short access time for frequently used data files
- any sort of data file or document may be cached, including text, graphics, video, images, audio files, html files, Web pages, etc.
- Web caching typically stores the content associated with URLs for Web pages.
- local client resources most typically memory (RAM)
- RAM random access memory
- the client computer When using caching, the client computer initially examines whether the requested document is in the local cache. If the document exists in the local cache and it is current (where current means that a newer version of the document does not exist), then the document is immediately delivered to the user. Otherwise, if the document is not in the cache, the client computer fetches the document from a server located somewhere on the system or the Web. Depending on the document size and the available transmission rate, delivery of the document to the user could take a significant amount of time.
- Determining which documents to cache and when to replace them is achieved through a caching replacement algorithm.
- Most state of the art web server, proxy, and client caching replacement algorithms typically take into account variables such as frequency of access, recency of access, data file (document) size, and estimated document retrieval latency to determine the priority of a document in the cache. The primary assumption behind these parameters is that prior usage will be a reliable predictor of future access. These parameters also enable cache replacement policies to optimize hit rates, byte-weighted hit rates, and end-user latency. More recent algorithms employ these variables in adaptive frameworks since global weightings have been found non-optimal for individual caches and traffic patterns change over time.
- proxy servers are configured to perform validation either at pre-set intervals or on a demand-driven basis. Pre-set intervals may be insufficient to update the cache in a lengthy search. And, not all users will manually update the cache (by refreshing the web page).
- caching occurs at client browsers (in-memory caching and file-based caching), at proxy caches (e.g., ISPs, satellites, corporate firewalls, etc.), in hierarchies of proxy caches (e.g., the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research's caching network, @HOME's caching network, etc.), and in Web servers (e.g., Harvest server cache accelerator).
- proxy caches e.g., ISPs, satellites, corporate firewalls, etc.
- hierarchies of proxy caches e.g., the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research's caching network, @HOME's caching network, etc.
- Web servers e.g., Harvest server cache accelerator
- caching can occur at the client computers and the network servers, which access remote databases and repositories.
- Most approaches to caching try to either decrease end user latency or decrease network traffic consumed in delivering the desired content.
- the invention provides an enhanced system and method of caching, which is particularly useful for caching of information on the Web, and improves performance and network traffic.
- Enhanced caching comes from the use of quality or value attributes, provided for example, by a recommender system or by a dynamical analysis of site accesses, which are attached to cached information.
- the system and method of the invention recognizes that, everything else being equal, higher value documents are likely to be retrieved more often. Current caching algorithms do not take into account the actual perceived utility, or value, of the document contents being cached.
- the invention prioritizes documents in the cache according to the relative value of their content.
- the system of the invention employs a recommender system (or collaborative filtering system) which provides a value for a document according to user recommendations.
- the system of the invention includes methods for determining the value for individual Web pages as well as for individual Web sites.
- the system can use explicit recommendations, implicit recommendations or a combination of the two to identify the higher value documents.
- the system uses the measures of quality to more efficiently prioritize which documents, such as URLs, to preferentially cache.
- the system of the invention can be considered a “democratic caching” scheme, i.e., a caching scheme which shifts away from prior techniques which optimize network resources (which are essentially independent of the value of the document to the user) towards a new technique which optimizes resources for all users.
- a democratic caching system documents are cached based on their value to users and not based, for example, on the number of hits (which may occur because of the particular indexing algorithm used by the web crawler) or other essentially user-independent measures. In this manner, democratic caching enables all users of the system to benefit from caching, not just those users that consume the most resources or access a limited number of pages excessively.
- Recommender systems are used in Intranet information sharing applications for organizations and Internet information sharing applications for the public.
- a recommender system the quality of the recommendation service is of primary important, and access time is equally as important.
- the proposed system and method of caching can also be used for managing the cache in a recommender system.
- Recommendations in a recommender system may be prioritized according to their value, whether explicitly or implicitly derived.
- Recent recommendations shared by users are cached for periods of time that increase with their value, thus improving the performance of the recommender system for its users by reducing access time to recommended items.
- Past recommendations will tend to disappear from the cache, although a resurgence of interest will cause the document (or URL) to persist again for some time in the cache.
- the invention provides improved performance for both.
- a Web site may also be a repository or information source containing collections of documents that may be accessed via the Web.
- a Web site will have a high level URL (e.g. www. Abccompany.com), whereas the pages on the site will have lower level qualifiers (e.g. www.Abccompany.com/page1.html).
- the first method (a method of providing an implicit recommendation) provides a value recommendation at the Web site level (as opposed to the individual Web page or URL level) and is guaranteed to cover all the cached URLs associated with the Web sites. (Here the cache contains only Web sites listed by their URLs.)
- the first method statistically analyzes the number of unique visitors per Web site. Those Web sites with the highest number of unique visitors are accorded the highest value.
- the advantage of measuring value as a function of unique visits as opposed to total visits is that the bias created by spamming or heavy use of the Web site by only a few visitors is eliminated. Characterization of Web traffic reveals heavy-tailed distributions of the amount of traffic as a function of the number of users, with a few users accounting for the majority of the traffic (see Abdulla, G.
- the second method couples the cache (such as a proxy cache for an organization) with a database of user ratings of the individual Web page URLs.
- a database for example, may be provided as a component of a recommender system for Web pages, which uses filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations to individual users.
- the second method provides value recommendations for individual Web pages or URLs (as opposed to Web sites), but only for a fraction of the Web page URLs in the cache. While this fraction may be small for URLs in the Web at large, it can be expected to become significant as the use of the recommender system proliferates over time.
- the proxy cache By coupling the proxy cache with a recommender system, the performance of not only the cache, but also of the recommender system is improved.
- the average download time for recommended URLs will decrease. Users will see enhanced performance causing them to rate more documents for the recommender system, improving its efficiency as well.
- the two methods may be used in conjunction to evaluate the value of a Web page URL. For example, if the recommender system has provided a value for a particular URL, that value is used first. Otherwise, the value assigned to the URL is the Web site value predicted by the first method. Alternatively, a weighted combination of value from each method may be used.
- Another method for cache replacement includes predicted value (by any of the above methods or combinations) as well as recency and frequency of access. Since it is conceivable that at times it may be desirable to conserve network resources or minimize overall latency, it should be readily observable that the proposed democratic caching techniques can be used in tandem with the more traditional methods that optimize network bandwidth or latency. Using this scheme, the cache would switch between methods based upon the network and other system conditions, using predefined thresholds or adaptive ones.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system employing democratic caching according to the invention
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart describing a method for assigning a priority weight to a URL
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart describing a method for assigning caching priority weights to entailed URLs.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a recommender system used in the system of FIG. 1 .
- System 10 includes a computer 12 having a processor 22 and cache memory 24 . Also included in system 10 is value module 14 , which provides a value data for each item stored in cache 24 . System 10 is shown using a dotted line, since recommender system 16 may also be included in system 10 . Recommender system 16 also provides value information pertaining to items to be stored in cache 24 based on user input.
- Computer 12 may be a client computer or a proxy server or any other computer employing a cache memory. Computer 12 may operate in any distributed network such as an intranet or the Internet (as shown in FIG. 1 ). Users 40 access computer 12 and recommender system 16 via the Internet 30 as indicated by solid lines 31 . (Some users 40 may access computer 12 and recommender system 16 through some other form of communication as indicated by solid line 33 .)
- Computer 12 may communicate with value module 14 or recommender system 16 either directly (shown by doted lines 23 and 29 , respectively) or indirectly through the internet 30 (shown by solid lines 21 , 25 and 27 ).
- Value module 14 may provide statistical information such as the number of unique user visits to a particular web site or web page.
- Recommender system 16 may provide user ratings or value in any one or more of the following: a star rating pertaining to the document's (URL's) content, an action due on the document, an expiration date of the information contained in the document, an expert opinion or rating about the document (web page or web site) or a rating from an independent organization.
- Recommendations usually consist of numerical ratings input manually by users, but they can also be deduced from user behavior (e.g., time spent reading a document, actions such as printing, saving or deleting a document).
- the premise of such systems is that a user is going to prefer an item that is similar to other items chosen by the user and by other users.
- Module 14 analyzes the log of client (user 40 ) accesses to Internet 30 web sites. First, it extracts the number of unique visitors to a site by removing multiple visits by the same user. Then it associates a percentile rating with each site. For example, a site with a percentile rating of 75% has as many or more unique visitors than 75% of the sites accessed through the proxy. This percentile ranking is returned by the module 14 as a measure of the value of a site and/or any URL associated with the site. (Proxy server 12 stores URL addresses in cache 24 according to this percentile ranking.)
- Module 14 for calculating implicit site recommendations may reside separately as shown in FIG. 1, or it may reside within the proxy server 12 (or cache 24 ) and is shown as module 28 in FIG. 1 .
- Module 14 or 28 provides an application program interface (API) which allows the processor 22 to query the cache 24 for the predicted value of any URL, a list of URLs, any site or a list of sites.
- API application program interface
- the API allows the processor 22 to query the module 14 or 28 for the range of possible values returned by the module.
- a generic recommender system typically includes three modules: data storage, value prediction and ordering.
- a recommender system 16 for Web URLs data storage 52 , value prediction module 54 and presentation and ordering module 56 .
- the data storage module 52 includes, at minimum, date of entry, user IDs and user ratings (or preference rankings) of the URLs.
- the value prediction module 54 includes an algorithm for predicting the value, or relative rank, of the URL for a user.
- the presentation and ordering module 56 orders the presentation of the recommended URLs in accordance with their predicted values, or predicted relative ranks.
- Recommender system 50 also includes value prediction 58 , which predicts the value of the URL for a generic user.
- module 58 makes this prediction on a weighted sum of users' ratings for a URL. In the simplest case, this prediction will simply be the average of all the ratings received for a URL. Alternatively, the weights could be biased towards ratings from users whose opinion is objectively valued higher by other users.
- Such an objective function for taking into account the value of a user's opinion could be a function of the sum of that user's correlation with all other users; alternatively (or in addition), it could take into account the number of hits a user's recommendations receive.
- the module 58 provides an API which permits the cache 24 to query for the predicted value of one or a list of URLs provided as parameters, permits the cache 24 to query for a list of URLs and predicted values, passing as an optional parameter a date value. In the latter case, if a date value is provided, the module 58 returns only URLs whose date of entry into the recommender system data space is greater than the date specified by the cache. Finally, the API allows the cache 24 to query the module 58 for the range of possible values returned by the module.
- the ⁇ URL, value> pairs returned by the module 58 can be extended to include additional information about the URLs stored in the data space.
- One example of information of potential use to the cache is user-input expiry dates or modification periodicity.
- the cache 24 can then use these values to more efficiently flush URLs and perform validation.
- Proxy server 12 may also operate cache 24 in conjunction with the two modules (value module 14 and recommender system 16 ) providing implicit and explicit recommendations. Given the flexibility of the APIs for the two modules, numerous variations are possible.
- FIG. 2 A flow chart showing a method of assigning a priority weight to a URL is shown in FIG. 2 .
- the processor 22 reevaluates the priority of a URL, it first queries the explicit recommendation module 16 for its predicted value of the URL (step 62 ). If the explicit recommendation module is able to make a recommendation (step 64 ), then the processor proceeds to calculate the priority using this value (step 68 ), as described below with reference to FIG. 3 . Otherwise, it then queries the implicit recommendation module 14 for its predicted value of the URL (step 66 ) and then uses this value to calculate the priority of the URL.
- the reason for preferring the value predicted by explicit recommendation over implicit recommendation is that the former is specific to the URL, while the latter generalizes over the entire site. Note, however, that even in the case of implicit recommendation, the caching priority calculation will be URL-specific as it also takes into account the recency and frequency of access for the particular URL.
- Reddy, M. and G. P. Fletcher “An Adaptive Mechanism for Web Browser Cache Management.” IEEE Computing January/February 1998, describes a caching priority algorithm that takes into account overall frequency of use, as well as recency, irrespective of file size.
- module 54 / 58 of recommender system 16 we modify the Reddy and Fletcher algorithm to take into account the retrieved value of the URL.
- v i is the value of document i as provided by the recommender system
- ⁇ (v i ) is a monotonically increasing function of the utility.
- step 72 the URL with the explicit recommendation value is provided.
- step 74 the URL contents are parsed to extract the entailed URLs.
- step 76 for each URL, the priority weight W c of the entailed URL is calculated in step 78 . If a the previous weight W p for this re-evaluation period exists in step 80 , check if it is larger (step 84 ) or smaller (step 82 ). Update the cache index with the cache index in cache 24 with the URL, weight, time stamp.
- the recommender system may provide the democratic cache with additional information, such as the expiry date of the URL and/or re-fetch rate (also potentially available as meta-data within the HITL).
- additional information such as the expiry date of the URL and/or re-fetch rate (also potentially available as meta-data within the HITL).
- the cache can then delete the URL after the expiry date, for example.
- the cache can perform pre-fetching of the URL at fixed intervals for URLs currently in the cache. The pre-fetching can be performed during low-load periods.
- the present invention may be readily implemented in software using software development environments that provide portable source code that can be used on a variety of hardware platforms.
- the disclosed system may be implemented partially or fully in hardware using standard logic circuits. Whether software or hardware is used to implement the system varies depending on the speed and efficiency requirements of the system and also the particular function and the particular software or hardware systems and the particular microprocessor or microcomputer systems being utilized.
