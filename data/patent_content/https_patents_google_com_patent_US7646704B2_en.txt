Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems, and, in particular, to spur cancellation in an OFDM communication system.
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
- OFDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
- a user may then be assigned one or more of the frequency sub-bands for an exchange of user information, thereby permitting multiple users to transmit simultaneously on the different sub-carriers.
- These sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, and thus there is no inter-sub-carrier interference in theory
- This invention can be applied to both OFDM systems, where all sub-carriers are assigned to a single user, and OFDMA systems, where the sub-carriers are shared by multiple users in the same time. In what follows, the OFDM and OFDMA are interchangeable.
- mixers translate a high input radio frequency (RF) to a lower intermediate frequency (IF).
- This process is know as downconversion and it utilizes a difference term between the mixer's RF input and a local oscillator (LO) input for low side injection (LO frequency ⁇ RF frequency), or a difference term between the mixer's LO and RF inputs for high-side injection.
- an amplitude and a phase of the mixer output signal are proportional to the RF input signal's amplitude and phase and are independent of the LO signal characteristics.
- mixer nonlinearities produce undesired mixing products, called spurious responses, or spurs, which are caused by undesired signals reaching the mixer's RF input port and producing a response at the IF frequency.
- the signals reaching the RF input port do not necessarily have to fall into the desired RF band to be troublesome. Many of these signals are sufficiently high in power level that the RF filters preceding the mixer don't provide enough sensitivity to keep them from causing additional spurious responses.
- f IF ⁇ mf RF ⁇ nf LO , where m and n are integer harmonics of both the RF and LO frequencies that mix to create numerous combinations of spurious products.
- spurious components decreases as the value of m or n increases.
- frequency planning may be used to carefully select the IF and the corresponding LO frequencies to avoid spurious mixing products whenever possible. Filters are then used to reject out-of-band RF signals that might cause in-band IF responses.
- Intermediate frequency (IF) filter sensitivity following the mixer is then specified to pass only the desired frequencies, thereby filtering the spurious response signals ahead of the final detector.
- spurious responses that appear within the IF band will not be attenuated by the IF filter. This technique of spur avoidance works well in case of narrow band RF signals.
- RF signal bandwidth could be more than 20 MHz and it is very difficult to avoid spurious responses in the desired IF bandwidth.
- DAC digital-to-analog devices
- BS 802.16e Base Station
- the ninth harmonic of this signal is also a sinusoid at 3456 MHz.
- This continuous waveform may be radiated from a digital section of a transceiver (TRX) board inside a casting of a transceiver and may be coupled into the front-end circuitry of the receiver side of the transceiver, where the signal gets mixed down to the IF within the desired signal bandwidth.
- TRX transceiver
- an OFDMA system is very susceptible to the spur inside the desired signal bandwidth. It is very difficult to avoid spurious responses for wireless broadband OFDMA signals in RF design. Therefore a need exists for a simple and effective method of digital spur cancellation that may be implemented in baseband processing.

That is, inverse transformer 226 transforms each symbol to a frequency domain subcarrier, or bin, associated with the time domain signals to produce multiple, that is, ‘M,’ parallel symbols.
- DFT discrete Fourier Transform
- FFT fast Fourier Transform
- the output of inverse transformer 226 then includes the multiple, that is, ‘M,’ parallel symbols based on the ‘M’ modulated subcarriers, wherein each symbol of the ‘M’ parallel encrypted symbols is drawn from the possible symbols of a constellation applied by a symbol mapper (not shown) in transmitting communication device 102 .
- Inverse transformer 226 conveys the ‘M’ parallel symbols to equalizer 230 , or in the case of a WiMAX receiver, to PRBS 228 , via adders 245 1 - 245 M , wherein each adder is associated with a frequency domain subcarrier, or bin, output by the inverse transformer.
- one or more adders of adders 245 1 - 245 M also receives, from APE 242 , a signal corresponding to a negative of an estimate of a spur detected by the APE in the associated bin.
- an adder 245 1 - 245 M When an adder 245 1 - 245 M receives an output of inverse transformer 226 and a negative of a spur signal from APE 242 , the adder adds the two received signals, thereby canceling a spur in the output for that bin of inverse transformer 226 and producing a spur-canceled signal. The spur-canceled signal is then routed by the adder to equalizer 230 or PRBS 228 , whichever is appropriate.
- one or more adders of adders 245 1 - 245 M in addition to receiving the output of inverse transformer 226 , one or more adders of adders 245 1 - 245 M also receives, from APE 242 , a signal corresponding to estimate of a spur detected by the APE in the associated bin. The adder then subtracts the received estimate of the spur from the received output of inverse transformer 226 in order to cancel a spur in the output for that bin and to produce the spur-canceled signal.
- the PRBS removes the PRBS modulation from each received signal of the ‘M’ parallel signals and routes the PRBS modulation-less signals to equalizer 230 .
- Equalizer 230 receives the ‘M’ parallel outputs of inverse transformer 226 or PRBS 228 , whichever is appropriate, performs equalization on each of the ‘M’ parallel outputs in accordance with any one or more of many well-known equalization techniques, and routes the equalized ‘M’ parallel outputs to P/S 232 .

- a logic flow diagram 300 is provided that illustrates a method executed by auxiliary circuit 240 in performing spur cancellation in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- samples of a desired signal are denoted d t , and these samples may be corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) z t .
- AWGN Additive White Gaussian Noise
- These samples are formed into groups of N-samples, where N is the number of samples per OFDM symbol, and are fed to inverse transformer 226 . Consequently, the inverse transformer, for example, FFT, output for a pth OFDM symbol (that is, a pth group of N-samples) on an nth subcarrier can be expressed as
- S ⁇ n ⁇ ( p ) ⁇ S m ⁇ ( p ) + Z m + A ⁇ ⁇ e j ⁇ [ 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ f ⁇ ( ( p - 1 ) ⁇ N + pN CP ) + ⁇ ] n ⁇ [ - N d / 2 , N d / 2 ] S n ⁇ ( p ) + Z n n ⁇ m
- N d is the number of data subcarriers. That is, only the mth subcarrier is affected by the spur.
- the equation above represents a fundamental idea underlying spur cancellation herein, that is, that a spur added to a time domain signal can be cancelled in the frequency domain by subtracting a reconstructed frequency domain complex waveform.
- the complex waveform may be determined by three parameters: an amplitude A n , an initial phase ⁇ n , and a phase change rate over OFDM symbols ⁇ (m+ ⁇ ). In the following, a number of methods will be presented to determine these three parameters.
- FIG. 6 comprises a table depicting an exemplary spur phase change rate and amplitude on adjacent subcarriers adjacent to the subcarrier where the spur resides as a function of an offset ( ⁇ ) of the spur from the center of the subcarrier that includes the spur.
- FIGS. 7-10 graphically illustrate a receive signal strength indicator (RSSI) after a 1024-point FFT, where a spur with 20 dB power either is centered at a subcarrier, and in particular subcarrier 187 , ( FIGS. 7 and 8 ) or located at an edge of two subcarriers, and in particular at an edge of each of subcarriers 187 and 188 ( FIGS. 9 and 10 ).
- RSSI receive signal strength indicator
- spur's initial phase e j ⁇ n Another element of a spur seen in the inverse transformer output is the spur's initial phase e j ⁇ n .
- This is hard to accurately measure in practice and can be modeled as a random variable that uniformly is distributed within the phase range of [0 2 ⁇ ] due to very high spur frequency and timing jittering in practice.
- the spur's initial phase should be determined. This can be achieved by an exhaustive search over [0 2 ⁇ ] for a given search resolution. Simulation results indicate that the required search resolution can be set as coarse as 10 degrees without significant performance degradation. This translates to 36 different initial phases that may be considered.
- a spur can be easily identified by looking at the RSSI in an inverse transformer, for example, FFT, output. Once RSSI associated with a subcarrier is greater than a predetermined threshold, one can determine that a spur has been detected and spur cancellation should be performed on this subcarrier.
- logic flow diagram 300 begins ( 302 ) when receiving wireless communication device 120 routes ( 304 ), to APE 242 , each subcarrier, or bin, output by inverse transformer 226 when there is no transmitted signal present at the inverse transformer, for example, when no uplink (UL) signal is applied to the inverse transformer in the event that the receiving communication device is implemented in an infrastructure or no downlink (DL) signal is applied to the inverse transformer in the event that the receiving communication device is implemented in a mobile station.
- APE 242 then computes ( 306 ) a power, preferably an RSSI, of the output of inverse transformer 226 for each bin to produce multiple computed powers.
- APE 242 Based on the multiple computed powers, APE 242 identifies ( 308 ) a spur location, or bin. That is, for each bin of the multiple bins output by inverse transformer 226 , APE 242 compares the computed power for that bin to a corresponding threshold stored in at least one memory device 124 to produce a comparison. Based on the comparisons, and more particularly when a computed power of a bin exceeds the threshold, APE 242 determines that a spur is present in that bin.
- APE 242 estimates ( 310 ) one or more spur phase parameters, preferably a spur initial phase ⁇ n and a spur phase change rate ⁇ (m+ ⁇ ), and a spur amplitude A n in association with the identified bin n, that is, determines an estimated initial phase, phase change rate, and amplitude of the spur, and stores ( 312 ), in association with the bin and in one or more memory devices 124 of receiving communication device 120 , the estimated initial phase, phase change rate, and amplitude.
- spur phase parameters preferably a spur initial phase ⁇ n and a spur phase change rate ⁇ (m+ ⁇ )
- receiving communication device 120 When receiving communication device 120 receives ( 314 ), at antenna 200 , a transmitted signal from transmitting communication device 102 , (thereby producing a received signal), the receiving communication device routes the received signal though elements 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 212 , 214 , 216 , 218 , 220 , 222 , and 224 of the main signal path of the receiving communication device, as is described in detail above, to produce multiple, for example, ‘M,’ parallel baseband signals that are derived from the received signal and that are applied to inverse transformer 226 .
- M parallel baseband signals
- Inverse transformer 226 then transforms ( 316 ) the time domain baseband signals to produce multiple parallel frequency domain output signals, that is, an output signal in association with each subcarrier, or bin, of the multiple subcarriers, or bins, output by the inverse transformer. It may be assumed that the signal output by inverse transformer 226 at step 316 and associated with the bin identified at step 308 will include a spur similar to the spur estimated at step 310 . Each output signal of the multiple parallel output signals is then routed to an adder 245 1 - 245 M associated with the corresponding bin.
- APE 242 also routes a reconstructed spur based on the estimates of A n , ⁇ n , and ⁇ (m+ ⁇ ) for each OFDM symbol p to the corresponding adder 245 1 - 245 M , where the reconstructed spur is subtracted from the inverse transformer output for that bin.
- APE 242 may construct a negative of the spur based on the estimates of A n , ⁇ n , and ⁇ (m+ ⁇ ) for each OFDM symbol p, and convey the negative of the spur to a corresponding adder 245 1 - 245 M associated with the bin, where the negative of the spur is added to the inverse transformer output for that bin.
- the adder then cancels ( 318 ) the spur included in the output of inverse transformer 226 for the given subcarrier n by subtracting the reconstructed spur from, or adding the negative of the spur to, the output of inverse transformer 226 that is received by the adder, and logic flow 300 ends ( 320 ).
- Steps 306 and 308 preferably are performed at the outset of the spur detection and may be performed again occasionally after that for update purposes, but need not be performed for each transmitted subframe received by receiving communication device 120 .
- steps 310 - 318 preferably are performed for every transmitted subframe received by the communication device in order to cancel a spur in a subcarrier m.
- a logic flow diagram 400 depicts an estimating of the spur amplitude A n by receiving communication device 120 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the method depicted in logic flow diagram 400 preferably is performed when no transmitted signal is present at the input to inverse transformer 226 .
- Logic flow diagram 400 begins ( 402 ) when an input comprising principally noise and the spur is applied ( 406 ) to inverse transformer 226 .
- receiving communication device optionally may disable ( 404 ) incoming signals received at antenna 200 from receiver 126 .
- Inverse transformer 226 then transforms ( 408 ) the input from a time domain to a frequency domain to output the multiple, or ‘M,’ subcarriers, or frequency domain bins, which output is coupled to auxiliary circuit 240 , and more particularly to APE 242 .
- APE 242 For each bin of the multiple frequency domain bins, APE 242 collects ( 410 ) multiple samples of the output associated with the bin, which multiple samples may be collected over a single frame or over multiple frames. Based on the collected samples, APE 242 determines ( 412 ) a power in association with the bin output (again, when there is no transmitted signal present), that is, determines
- APE 242 determines ( 414 ) that the bin includes a spur and estimates ( 416 ) a power of the spur, and correspondingly an amplitude of the spur, which amplitude may be represented as
- APE 242 then stores ( 418 ) the estimated spur amplitude in the one or more memory devices 124 of the receiving communication device and logic flow 400 then ends ( 420 ).
- steps 404 to 418 may be repeated until expiration of a time period, ⁇ , that may be dynamically determined based on spur characteristics and environment, such as temperature.
- the estimated power may be updated upon each iteration or not determined until expiration of time period ⁇ .
- APE 242 determines a phase change rate of the spur, based on spur frequency and carrier frequency, and estimates and/or updates an initial phase of the detected spur.
- the phase change rate that is, ⁇ (m+ ⁇ )
- phase change rate (for simplicity, phase change rate is expressed as a constant, which is true in reality where spur frequency, system carrier frequency, and OFDM symbol interval are all constants)
- ⁇ mod(2 ⁇ f relative T symb , 2 ⁇ )
- f relative f spur ⁇ f carrier denotes the frequency difference between actual spur frequency and system carrier frequency
- T symb represents OFDM symbol interval including the CP.
- p is the OFDMA symbol index
- P is total number of OFDMA symbols, or samples, used for the amplitude estimation
- m denotes the subcarrier where spur cancellation should be performed.
- the factor e ⁇ j ⁇ p corresponds to a phase rotator. This is a coherent estimate of the spur amplitude, where a frequency of the spur is known, as opposed to the non-coherent estimate described above, where a frequency of the spur is not known.
- APE 242 may also estimate and/or update a phase change rate ⁇ (m+ ⁇ ) of the spur by determining a phase change rate over a number of OFDM symbol where there is no transmitted signal in present,
- a logic flow diagram 500 depicts an estimating of a spur initial phase by receiving communication device 120 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Similar to logic flow diagram 400 , the method depicted in logic flow diagram 500 preferably is performed when no transmitted signal is present at the input to inverse transformer 226 .
- Logic flow diagram 500 begins ( 502 ) when an input comprising principally noise and the spur is applied ( 506 ) to inverse transformer 226 .
- receiving communication device optionally may disable ( 504 ) incoming signals received at antenna 200 from receiver 126 .
- Inverse transformer 226 then transforms ( 508 ) the input from a time domain to a frequency domain to output the multiple, or ‘M,’ subcarriers, or frequency domain bins, which output is coupled to auxiliary circuit 240 , and more particularly to APE 242 .
- APE 242 For each bin of the multiple bins, APE 242 then collects ( 510 ) multiple samples of the output associated with the bin (again, when there is no transmitted signal present), which multiple samples may be collected over a single frame or over multiple frames. Based on the multiple samples, and as described in detail with reference to FIG. 4 , APE 242 identifies ( 512 ) a bin of the multiple bins output by inverse transformer 226 that includes a spur. For the identified bin, or subcarrier, and for each of multiple predetermined possible initial phases, for example, every 10 degrees, which over 360° corresponds to 36 possible initial phase points, APE 242 determines ( 514 ) a phase detection metric, each metric corresponding to a possible initial phase of a spur at that sample point.
- Each phase detection metric may be determined over one or more symbols taken in the bin where a spur is identified.
- APE 242 estimates ( 516 ) an initial phase of the spur based on the multiple phase detection metrics determined for the multiple possible initial phases, preferably by comparing each phase detection metric of the multiple phase detection metrics to other phase detection metrics of the multiple phase detection metrics to produce multiple comparisons and then estimating a spur phase based on the multiple comparisons, and more particularly selecting an initial phase that corresponds to the minimum determined phase detection metric.
- APE 242 stores ( 518 ) the estimated spur initial phase in the one or more memory devices 124 of the receiving communication device and logic flow 500 then ends ( 520 ).
- APE 242 may repeat steps 508 , 510 , 512 , 514 , and 516 and calculate, for each iteration, a running average of the initial phase that incorporates the currently determined initial phase and one or more previously determined initial phases and that further may include a weight associated with each of the currently determined, and one or more previously determined, initial phases.
- the initial phase of a spur seen on each subcarrier is a constant theoretically. Therefore, the initial phase of the spur on each subcarrier estimated in previous frames can be used for a current frame for spur cancellation.
- an initial phase of a spur on each subcarrier in each TDD frame can be estimated using the method presented before, that is by exhaustive search over predetermined possible phase points using the phase detection metrics. All estimated initial phases per TDD frame are passed through a smoothing filter for a running average.
- ⁇ n (k) be an estimated initial phase on nth subcarrier in kth TDD frame
- the exhaustive search for initial phase estimate in kth frame can be performed over a few points around the averaged initial phase ⁇ n (k), for example, one may search over 10 points instead of 36 points around 360 degrees with resolution 10 degrees. This operation can performed with or without a transmitted signal present.
- the determination of the spur amplitude can be modified as follows
- ⁇ tilde over (S) ⁇ n (p) and ⁇ tilde over (S) ⁇ d (p) are pth received symbols on an nth subcarrier and a dth subcarrier of a current frame, respectively, n denotes the subcarrier with a spur present, and d indexes a subcarrier where there is no spur present.
- spur phase change rate ⁇ the averaged initial phase ⁇ n (k+1) and the averaged amplitude ⁇ n (k+1) based on previous frames, a spur can be easily reconstructed for cancellation in (k+1)th frame, and so on.
- a communication device is provided that is capable of operating in an OFDM/OFDMA communication system and that includes a receiver that provides for in-band spur cancellation in a received signal. While the communication devices described herein are described as operating in a wireless communication system, one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that the principles described herein are applicable to the communication devices of any OFDM communication system, whether wireless or wireline.
- the communication device identifies a bin of multiple bins that is associated with an output of an inverse transformer and that includes a spur and estimates one or more spur phase parameters, preferably a spur initial phase and a spur phase change rate, and a spur amplitude in association with the identified bin.
- an inverse transformer of the communication device transforms the received signal to produce multiple parallel output signals, wherein each output signal of the multiple parallel output signals is associated with a frequency domain subcarrier, or frequency domain bin, of multiple subcarriers or bins, and cancels a spur in an output signal of the multiple parallel output signals based on the estimated one or more spur phase parameters and spur amplitude, wherein the output signal is associated with the identified bin.
- the communication device may identify the bin including the spur by computing a power for each bin of the multiple bins and identifying a bin including the spur based on the determined powers, preferably by comparing each computed power of the multiple computed powers to a threshold to produce multiple comparisons and identifying a bin including the spur based on the multiple comparisons.
- the communication device may further determine an amplitude of the spur based on the computed power associated with the identified bin.
- the communication device may estimate the spur phase change rate over multiple OFDM symbols based on the output of the inverse transformer when there is no transmitted signal present; however, in another embodiment of the present invention, the communication device may estimate the spur phase change rate over multiple OFDM symbols based on a known spur frequency and a known carrier frequency when a transmitted signal is present.
- the communication device may determine an initial phase of the spur by estimating a phase detection metric for the identified bin, preferably by determining multiple possible spur initial phases and computing a phase detection metric for each possible initial phase.
- the communication device then may estimate the spur initial phase based on the phase detection metric(s), for example, by comparing each phase detection metric of the multiple phase detection metrics to other phase detection metrics of the multiple phase detection metrics to produce multiple comparisons and estimating a spur phase based on the multiple comparisons.
- a phase detection metric for a possible spur initial phase may be determined by reconstructing the spur using the estimated spur amplitude, phase change rate, and the possible spur initial phase, determining a difference between the signal in the identified bin and the reconstructed spur, and summing the difference over more than one OFDM symbol.
- a spur initial phase may then be selected based on the summed differences for each possible initial phase, preferably by selecting the minimum of the summed differences.
- the spur then may be reconstructed, or a negative of the spur may be constructed, based on the estimated spur amplitude, initial phase, and phase change rate.
- the reconstructed spur may be subtracted from, or the negative of the spur may be added to, an inverse transformer output signal associated with the identified bin to cancel a spur in the signal.
Abstract
Description
f IF =±f RF ±f LO,
where fIF is the intermediate frequency (IF) at the mixer's output port, fRf is any RF signal applied to the mixer's RF input port, and fLO is the local oscillator signal applied to the mixer's LO input port.
f IF =±mf RF ±nf LO,
where m and n are integer harmonics of both the RF and LO frequencies that mix to create numerous combinations of spurious products.
[(768 MHz/2)×9]−(LO frequency 2988 MHz)=3.456 GHz−2988 MHz=IF frequency 456 MHz
where the LO frequency is 2988 MHz to get an IF frequency of 456 MHz.
Aej(2πft+φ) t=0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
where A is an amplitude of the spur, f is a frequency of the spur in a fraction of a system sampling frequency, φ is an arbitrary initial phase, and t is an index of sampling instance. Samples of a desired signal are denoted dt, and these samples may be corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) zt. Since the spur is added to the desired signal according to a known spur generation mechanism, samples fed by receiving
r t =d t +Ae j(2πft+φ) +z t t=0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .
These samples are formed into groups of N-samples, where N is the number of samples per OFDM symbol, and are fed to
where NCP is number of samples of cyclic prefix (CP) that is removed before
respectively. When f=m/N, which is the case that the digital spur is located in the center of subcarrier m, the inverse transformer output for the nth subcarrier is given as
where Nd is the number of data subcarriers. That is, only the mth subcarrier is affected by the spur. In a general case, when the spur resides in subcarrier m and is offset δ from the center the subcarrier (that is, δ is the difference between the bin (subcarrier) center frequency and the frequency of the spur), that is, f=(m+δ)/N where the absolute value of δ is less than 0.5, the inverse transformer output is
{tilde over (S)} n(p)=S n(p)+Z n +A n e jφ
where ejΔΦ(m+δ)p indicates that the spur phase change is a linear function of p, that is, the OFDM symbol index, and ΔΦ(m+δ) is a phase change rate of the spur and is a function of (m+δ), which is independent of subcarrier index n. However, the magnitude An=ABn and initial phase φn=φ+θn of the spur on subcarrier n depends on the subcarrier index n. The equation above represents a fundamental idea underlying spur cancellation herein, that is, that a spur added to a time domain signal can be cancelled in the frequency domain by subtracting a reconstructed frequency domain complex waveform. The complex waveform may be determined by three parameters: an amplitude An, an initial phase φn, and a phase change rate over OFDM symbols ΔΦ(m+δ). In the following, a number of methods will be presented to determine these three parameters.
over N samples, that is, for n=1, . . . , N where yn denotes the nth sample on the bin when there is no transmitted signal in present. When the power determined for a bin exceeds a corresponding power threshold,
based on the determined power of the bin.
ΔΦ=mod(2πf relative T symb, 2π)
where frelative=fspur−fcarrier denotes the frequency difference between actual spur frequency and system carrier frequency and Tsymb represents OFDM symbol interval including the CP. Clearly, with the relative spur frequency frelative, one can determine the spur location in terms of subcarrier index m. Consequently, a more accurate spur amplitude estimate may be determined as follows
where p is the OFDMA symbol index, P is total number of OFDMA symbols, or samples, used for the amplitude estimation and m denotes the subcarrier where spur cancellation should be performed. The factor e−jΔΦ×p corresponds to a phase rotator. This is a coherent estimate of the spur amplitude, where a frequency of the spur is known, as opposed to the non-coherent estimate described above, where a frequency of the spur is not known.
where P is the number of OFDM symbols over which the estimate is performed and m is subcarrier index in which the spur is detected, that is, Am>T where T is threshold for spur detection.
Y m (k)(p)={tilde over (S)} m(p)−A m e jφ
In other words,
Then the estimated initial phase φm for the spur on subcarrier m is given by the value indexed by k among 36 possible phases, where k indexes the minimum metric out of the 36 metrics. For example, if all possible phases are 0, 10, 20, . . . , 350 degrees and 5th metric is the minimum one among 36 metrics, i.e. M5 is the minimum metric, so k=5 and 5th of the phase values, which is 40 degrees, will be the estimated initial phase for the spur on subcarrier m.
Here, λ is a memory factor that takes a value from 0 to 1, for example, λ=0.2. To reduce computational complexity, the exhaustive search for initial phase estimate in kth frame can be performed over a few points around the averaged initial phase
Ā n(k+1)=(1−α)Ā n(k)+αA n(k).
Here, α is a memory factor that takes a value from 0 to 1, for example, α=0.2. In case a transmitted signal is present, the determination of the spur amplitude can be modified as follows
where the spur amplitude is An(k)=√{square root over (An 2(k))}. Here {tilde over (S)}n(p) and {tilde over (S)}d(p) are pth received symbols on an nth subcarrier and a dth subcarrier of a current frame, respectively, n denotes the subcarrier with a spur present, and d indexes a subcarrier where there is no spur present. With the analytically calculated spur phase change rate ΔΦ, the averaged initial phase
