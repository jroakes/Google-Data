Definitions
- the present invention concerns advertising.
- the present invention concerns managing the serving of one or more advertisements to be served in an interactive advertising environment.
- Advertisers have used these types of media to reach a large audience with their advertisements (“ads”).
- advertisers have used demographic studies. For example, advertisers may use broadcast events such as football games to advertise beer and action movies to a younger male audience.
- advertisers may use magazines that reach a relatively affluent readership to advertise luxury items such as expensive watches and luxury automobiles.
- advertisers recognize that much of their ad budget is simply wasted. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to identify and eliminate such waste.
- Advertisers have developed several strategies in an attempt to maximize the value of such advertising.
- advertisers use popular presences or means for providing interactive media or services (referred to as “Web sites”in the specification without loss of generality) as conduits to reach a large audience.
- Web sites popular presences or means for providing interactive media or services
- an advertiser may place ads on the home page of the New York Times Web site, or the USA Today Web site, for example.
- an advertiser may attempt to target its ads to more narrow niche audiences, thereby increasing the likelihood of a positive response by the audience. For example, an agency promoting tourism in the Costa Rican rainforest might place ads on the ecotourism-travel subdirectory of the Yahoo Web site.
- Web site-based ads are typically presented to their advertising audience in the form “banner ads”—i.e., a rectangular box that includes graphic components.
- banner ads i.e., a rectangular box that includes graphic components.
- viewer or “user”in the Specification without loss of generality
- embedded hypertext links typically direct the viewer to the advertiser's Web site.
- This process, wherein the viewer selects an ad, is commonly referred to as a “click-through”(or more generally, “selection”).
- the ratio of the number of click-throughs to the number of impressions of the ad i.e., the number of times an ad is displayed
- click-through rate of the ad.
- Online advertising has attracted a diverse group of advertisers—from large-multinational corporations to the smallest businesses.
- Some outlets for online advertisements offer in-person assistance to help advertisers set up and manage their advertisement(s). However, this such in-person assistance adds costs to the outlets, and therefore to the advertiser.
- Some outlets have provided self-service tools to help advertisers set up and manage their advertisement(s). However there is an ongoing need to provide simple, yet powerful tools to help advertisers create and manage their advertisement(s).
- the present invention simplifies the management of interactive advertising by allowing an advertiser to pause the serving of an ad, or some grouping of ads.
- the a pausing may continue for a predetermined time period, until a specified time and/or date, or until a restart is selected.
- FIG. 1 is a high-level diagram showing parties or entities that can interact with an advertising system.
- FIG. 2 is a bubble chart of an advertising environment in which, or with which, the present invention may operate.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a Web page that may be generated by a page assembly operation of an ad consumer, for rendering on a viewer's screen.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary inter-relationship of advertising information that may be used by the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method that may be used to pause one or more ads, one or more ad groups, and/or one or more ad campaigns, in a manner consistent with the principles of the present invention
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method that may be used to restart one or more ads, one or more ad groups, and/or one or more ad campaigns in a manner consistent with the principles of the present invention
- FIG. 7 is a high-level block diagram of apparatus that may be used to perform at least some of the various operations that may be performed consistent with the principles of the present invention.
- the present invention may involve novel methods, apparatus, message formats and/or data structures for simplifying the management of advertising.
- the following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements.
- Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments and applications.
- the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown and the inventor regards his invention any patentable subject matter described below.
- FIG. 1 is a high level diagram of an advertising environment.
- the environment may include an ad entry, maintenance and delivery system 120 .
- Advertisers 110 may directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in the system 120 .
- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads such as so-called banner ads, text only ads, text-based ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining various media types, etc.
- Ad consumers 130 may submit requests for ads to, accept ads responsive to their request from, and provide historical or usage information to, the system 120 .
- other entities may provide historical or usage information (e.g., whether or not a conversion or click-through related to the ad occurred) to the system 120 .
- an ad consumer 130 is a general content server which receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to, or otherwise services, the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to the system 120 .
- Such an ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include content request information.
- This information may include the content itself (e.g., a page), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geolocation information, etc.
- content itself
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geolocation information e.g., geolocation information, etc.
- the content server may combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 120 . This combined information including the content and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the end user that requested the content, for presentation to that user. Finally, the content server may transmit information about the ads and how the ads are to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the system 120 . Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the system 120 by some other means.
- search engine may receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine may retrieve relevant search results (e.g., from an index of Web pages).
- relevant search results e.g., from an index of Web pages.
- An exemplary search engine is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference , Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999 (both incorporated herein by reference).
- search results may include, for example, lists of Web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those Web pages, and hypertext links to those Web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine may submit a request for ads to the system 120 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In one embodiment, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, and preferably from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geolocation information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., WebPages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- identifiers related to the search results e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”
- scores related to the search results e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores
- snippets of text extracted from identified documents e.g., WebPages
- full text of identified documents e.g., feature vectors of identified
- the search engine may combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 120 . This combined information including the search results and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the user that requested the content, for presentation to the user.
- FIG. 3 is an abstract illustration of a display page 310 that may be provided by the search engine.
- the outline 320 depicted with dashed lines corresponds to a portion of the display page 310 that may be viewed on a typical personal computer display screen at a typical resolution.
- the exemplary display page 310 may include header information 312 (e.g., the name of search engine host), trailer information 316 (e.g., copyright, navigational hypertext links, etc.), a plurality of search results 314 and a plurality of ads 318 a , 318 b , and 318 c .
- the search results 314 are maintained as distinct from the ads 318 , so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- FIG. 3 shows only three ads 318 , embodiments consistent with the principles of the present invention may have more or less ads. For example, ten search results combined with ten ads has been found to be effective.
- the search engine may transmit information about the ad and/or how the ad was rendered, or to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the system 120 .
- information about the ad and/or how the ad was rendered, or to be rendered e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.
- information about the ad and/or how the ad was rendered e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.
- such information may be provided back to the system 120 by some other means.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary ad system 120 ′with which, or in which, the present invention may be used.
- the exemplary ad system 120 ′ may include an inventory system 210 and may store ad information 205 and usage or historical (e.g., statistical) information 245 .
- the exemplary system 120 ′ may support ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 , campaign (e.g., targeting) assistance operation(s) 220 , accounting and billing operation(s) 225 , ad serving operation(s) 230 , relevancy determination operation(s) 235 , optimization operations 240 , presentation ordering operations 250 , fraud detection operation(s) 255 , and result(s) interface operation(s) 260 .
- campaign e.g., targeting
- accounting and billing operation(s) 225 e.g., accounting and billing operation(s) 225
- ad serving operation(s) 230 e.g., relevancy determination operation(s) 235
- Advertisers 110 may interface with the system 120 ′via the ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 as indicated by interface 216 .
- Ad consumers 130 may interface with the system 120 ′via the ad serving operation(s) 230 as indicated by interface 231 .
- Ad consumers 130 or other entities may also interface with the system 120 ′via results interface operation(s) 260 as indicated by interface 261 .
- the ad information 205 can be entered and managed via the ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 .
- Campaign (e.g., targeting) assistance operation(s) 220 can be employed to help advertisers 110 generate effective ad campaigns.
- the campaign assistance operation(s) 220 can use information provided by the inventory system 210 , which, in the context of advertising for use with a search engine, may track all possible ad impressions, ad impressions already reserved, and ad impressions available for given keywords.
- the ad serving operation(s) 230 may service requests for ads from ad consumers 130 .
- the ad serving operation(s) 230 may use relevancy determination operation(s) 235 to determine candidate ads for a given request.
- the ad serving operation(s) 230 may then use optimization operation(s) 240 to select a final set of one or more of the candidate ads. That is, the relevancy determination operation(s) may be used to determine ads that may be served. The optimization operation(s) may then determine whether or not each of the candidate ads is, in fact, served. The ad serving operation(s) 230 may use presentation ordering operation(s) 250 to order the presentation of the ads to be returned.
- the fraud detection operation(s) 255 can be used to reduce fraudulent use of the advertising system (e.g., by advertisers), such as through the use of stolen credit cards.
- the result(s) interface operation(s) 260 may be used to accept result information (from the ad consumers 130 or some other entity) about an ad actually served, such as whether or not click-through occurred, whether or not conversion occurred (e.g., whether the sale of an advertised item or service was initiated or consummated within a predetermined time from the rendering of the ad), etc.
- result information may be accepted at interface 261 and may include information to identify the ad and time the ad was served, as well as the associated result.
- the principles of the present invention may be applied to the ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 and may affect the ad information 205 . More specifically, the principles of the present invention may be applied to simplify ad management.
- an advertising program includes information concerning accounts, campaigns, creatives, targeting, etc.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary inter-relationship 400 of advertising information, some of which information may be organized in a manner consistent with the principles of the present invention.
- account information 410 may include, for example, a unique e-mail address, a password, billing information (e.g., a billing address, a credit card, etc.), etc.
- the account information 410 may also include a pause indicator 412 , a pause countdown timer value 414 , and/or a pause until date and/or time value 416 . Accordingly, the term “account”relates to information for a given advertiser.
- Account information 410 may be associated with information 420 about one or more campaigns.
- Campaign information 420 may include, for example, one or more budgets for one or more time periods (e.g., a daily budget), geo-targeting information, syndication preference information, start and end dates of the campaign, etc.
- a daily budget e.g., a daily budget
- geo-targeting information e.g., a daily budget
- syndication preference information e.g., start and end dates of the campaign, etc.
- Honda may have one advertising campaign for its automobile line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line.
- Campaign information 420 may also include a pause indicator 422 , a pause countdown timer value 424 , and/or a pause until date and/or time value 426 .
- Ad group information 430 may include, for example, keywords (which may be used by the relevancy determination operation(s) to decide whether or not to serve an ad), and cost information, such as a maximum cost bid for example.
- Ad group information 430 may also include a pause indicator 432 , a pause countdown timer value 434 , and/or a pause until date and/or time value 436 .
- Ad information 440 may include, for example, content for the ad, a unique identifier, historical information about the ad or its performance, etc.
- Ad information 440 may also include a pause indicator 442 , a pause countdown timer value 444 , and/or a pause until date and/or time value 438 .
- an ad if an ad is “paused”, it should not be served. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, the ad can be ignored or filtered out by the relevancy determination operation(s) 235 , filtered out by the presentation ordering operation(s) 250 , or filtered out by the ad serving operation(s) 230 . If an ad group is “paused”, all ads belonging to the ad group will also be paused (unless restarted). Thus, for example, if ad group 430 b is paused, ads 440 c and 440 d will be paused.
- an authorized user can restart an ad belonging to a paused ad group.
- an authorized user could restart ad 440 d , while ad 440 c remains paused.
- all ads belonging to the ad group should be restarted.
- an authorized user can restart an ad group belonging to a paused ad campaign.
- pausing and restarting an ad can be applied to any type of ad information.
- paused may be broadly construed to include indefinitely stopped.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 500 that may be used to pause an ad account, an ad campaign, an ad group and/or an ad in a manner consistent with the principles of the present invention.
- a user may be authenticated (Block 505 ).
- Various branches of the method 500 may be triggered in response to various events (Event Block 510 ). For example, if an ad is selected a further event is checked (Event Block 520 ). If a selected ad is paused until manual restart, the pause indicator for the ad is set (Block 522 ).
- a selected ad is paused until date/time
- the pause indicator for the ad is set and the pause until date/time for the ad is set (Block 524 ).
- the pause indicator for the ad is set, a paused period is accepted or otherwise set, and a pause period countdown timer is started (Block 526 ).
- Event Block 530 if an ad group is selected a further event is checked. If a selected ad group is paused until manual restart, the pause indicator for the ad group (as well as the pause indicator(s) for any ad(s) belonging to the ad group) is set (Block 532 ). If a selected ad group is paused until date/time, the pause indicator and the pause until date/time for the ad group (as well as those for any ad(s) belonging to the ad group) is set (Block 534 ).
- the pause indicator for the ad group is set.
- the pause period for the ad group is accepted or otherwise set, and a pause period countdown timer is started (Block 536 ).
- Event Block 540 if an ad campaign is selected a further event is checked (Event Block 540 ). If a selected ad campaign is paused until manual restart, the pause indicator for the ad campaign is set (Block 542 ). This act should be propagated down to any ad group(s) belonging to the ad campaign, as well as to any ad(s) belonging to such ad group(s). If a selected ad campaign is paused until date/time, the pause indicator and the pause until date/time for the ad campaign are set (Block 544 ).
- user authorization to perform the selected action may be checked.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 600 that may be used to restart a paused ad account, a paused ad campaign, a paused ad group, and/or paused ads.
- Various branches of the method 600 may be triggered in response to an event (Event Block 610 ). For example, if a pause until date/time occurs, any ad campaigns, ad groups, and/or ads paused until that date/time are restarted (e g., their pause indicators can be reset) (Block 620 ).
- restart actions should propagate down through the hierarchy.
- any ad campaigns, ad groups, and/or ads paused for that time are restarted (e.g., their pause indicators can be reset) (Block 630 ).
- restart actions should propagate down through the hierarchy.
- an unauthorized user restarts any paused ad campaigns, ad groups, and/or ads, they are restarted (e.g., their pause indicators can be reset) (Block 640 ).
- restart actions should propagate down through the hierarchy.
- FIG. 7 is high-level block diagram of a machine 700 that may perform one or more of the operations discussed above.
- the machine 700 basically includes a processor(s) 710 , an input/output interface unit(s) 730 , a storage device(s) 720 , and a system bus or network 740 for facilitating the communication of information among the coupled elements.
- An input device(s) 732 and an output device(s) 734 may be coupled with the input/output interface(s) 730 .
- the processor(s) 710 may execute machine-executable instructions (e.g., C or C++running on the Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. or the Linux operating system widely available from a number of vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. of Durham, N.C.) to perform one or more aspects of the present invention. At least a portion of the machine executable instructions may be stored (temporarily or more permanently) on the storage device(s) 720 and/or may be received from an external source via an input interface unit 730 .
