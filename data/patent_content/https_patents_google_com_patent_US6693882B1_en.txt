Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to initial acquisition of a signal in a communication system which uses a time division multiple access (TDMA) method for transmission. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for detecting a frequency correction burst, estimating the frequency error and the burst arrival time for a TDMA communication system, such as the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM).
- GSM Global System for Mobile communications
- the TDMA method allows multiple access by subdividing a duration T f , called the frame duration, into N non-overlapping time slots, each of duration T f /N. Each user who wishes to transmit information is assigned to a particular time slot within each frame.
- the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is an exemplary communication system which uses the TDMA method for multiple access.
- GSM Global System for Mobile Communications
- DCS 1800 and PCs 1900 The Global System for Mobile Communications
- GSM Global System for Mobile Communications
- the primary GSM system also known as GSM 900, uses the 900 MHz band, of which 890-915 MHz is for mobile transmissions, and 935-960 MHz is for base transmissions.
- There are 124 channels 174 channels for extended GSM, 374 channels for DCS 1800 or PCS 1900 ) and each channel is 200 kHz wide.
- the TDMA method is used with 8 time slots, numbered 0 to 7, per channel.
- GSM uses wide channels to allow high speed digital transmissions, resulting in reducing the effect of fading and minimizing production costs.
- Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) is used as the modulation process.
- the first stage of synchronization between a receiver and a transmitter is called the initial acquisition process.
- initial acquisition process there are always initial time and frequency errors due to uncompensated local oscillator (LO) error, range uncertainty between the transmitter and the receiver, and motion in a multi-path channel environment.
- LO local oscillator
- a base station uses a Broadcast Common Control Channel (BCCH) to transmit signaling information.
- BCCH Broadcast Common Control Channel
- the frame structure of the control channel includes 51 TDMA frames lasting 235.38 milliseconds (each TDMA frame is 4.615 ms in duration).
- each of the information data shown in FIG. 1 is transmitted in time slot 0 of a corresponding TDMA frame.
- Synchronization data include a Frequency correction Burst (FB) and a Synchronization Burst (SB).
- FB Frequency correction Burst
- SB Synchronization Burst
- the FB is a sine wave at 67.7 kHz above the carrier, lasting 546.12 ⁇ s.
- the FB is formed by differentially encoding a string of 148 bits of values “0” and then modulating the resulting 147 bits.
- the data structure of the string of 148 bits is as shown in FIG. 2 .
- the string consists of 142 bits (all 0s) preceded by 3 tailing bits (three 0s) and followed by three tailing bits (three 0s) and 8.25 guarding bits (all 1s).
- the receiver In the acquisition mode, the receiver has to detect the FBs and perform timing and frequency error estimation. The receiver then uses the frequency error estimate to correct the reference frequency of the local oscillator, and the timing estimate in the subsequent demodulation of the Synchronization Burst (SB) which is sent in time slots 0 of frames 1, 11, 21, 31, 41.
- SB Synchronization Burst
- a receiver In the acquisition mode, a receiver first scans the whole frequency band used for GSM (or extended GSM, or DCS 1800 or PCS 1900 ) and measures the relative signal strength on up to 124 channels (174 channels for extended GSM, 374 channels for DCS 1800 or PCS 1900 ), each channel having a bandwidth of 200 kHz, to obtain a list of the strongest channels. Then, the receiver will start to search for the FBs over the channels in the list.
- the required frequency accuracy is 0.1 ppm, which is 90 Hz for a 900 MHz carrier.
- the maximum initial frequency offset can be about 5 kHz for GSM 900, and about 10 kHz for DCS 1800 and PCS 1900, when the receiver is first turned on. This initial frequency error must be rapidly detected and reduced to within the GSM requirement.
- the present invention is a method and: an apparatus for detecting a frequency correction burst embedded in a signal which includes ordered samples.
- the method comprises the following: (a) correlating K sequences of the ordered samples with a predetermined waveform to produce K correlation outputs, each of the K correlation outputs corresponding to one of the K sequences, having a magnitude and being associated with an order index, K being an integer, the predetermined waveform corresponding to the frequency correction burst; (b) storing the K correlation outputs in a buffer according to the order indices; and (c) estimating a parameter based on the K correlation outputs, the parameter indicating detection of the frequency correction burst.
- the estimated parameter includes a frequency error and an ending time of a frequency correction burst.
- a quality metric associated with each frequency error is also computed.

- FIG. 6 shows such a structure.
- a running sum module 60 has two inputs and one output. The running sum module 60 performs a running sum of M consecutive samples, where the number M indicates the number of samples that separate the two inputs.
- FIGS. 5 and 6 When the memories needed for the delay elements in FIGS. 5 and 6 are implemented in conjunction with the sample buffer 10 , they can be part of the sample buffer 10 , and the function of the decimator 20 can be realized by appropriately addressing the sample buffer.
- FIG. 7 shows the structure of such an implementation.

- a threshold is provided in order to determine whether a frequency correction burst is received. In consideration of the variations of the signal level, the threshold is calculated relative to the average power level of the contributing input samples of the FB correlator 32 .
- the threshold calculation module 36 computes the average power of a number input samples and scales it to an appropriate value. In the exemplary implementation shown in FIG. 7, the number of input samples used for this computation is 16 .
- the timing estimator 38 determines whether a frequency correction burst has occurred and outputs the ending time of the detected frequency correction burst. Equivalently, the arrival time of the detected frequency correction burst can also be outputted instead.
- the TDMA frame timing 39 which is the start time of a TDMA frame can be easily computed from the starting or ending times of the frequency correction bursts, since the frequency correction bursts occur within a known repeating pattern within the signaling multi-frame structure of GSM as shown in FIG. 1 .

- the adder 388 subtracts the threshold 37 from the value
- the counter 392 counts consecutive Is that are outputted from the comparator 390 . Any 0 outputted from the comparator 390 will reset the counter 392 . This resetting occurs often for FSM when the received signal is a randomly modulated GMSK signal, instead of a FB. If the count value reaches 131 , then the comparator 394 outputs a control signal value of 1 which enables the peak detector 396 .

- the FB correlator output y nmax represents the correlation of 16 samples over the end portion of the frequency correction burst, while Y nmax ⁇ 131 represents the correlation of 16 samples over the beginning portion of the burst. Since the two correlations are spaced 131 symbols apart in time, and since a frequency correction burst in the GSM is a pure sine wave of 147 symbols, the peak detector 396 will not achieve its maximum in

- FIG. 12 is a diagram of a system 120 which includes three frequency error estimators 124 , 126 , 128 .
- the system 120 can detect a frequency correction burst in a received signal with low probability of missed detection.
- the system 120 also includes two mixers 121 , 123 . Each of the mixers translates the carrier frequency of the received signal by a predetermined amount of frequency.
- the system 120 processes the received signal r(i) through three processing paths to produce three sets of outputs.
- Each set of outputs includes a TDMA frame timing estimate, a frequency error estimate, and an associated quality metric.
- Each of the TDMA frame timing estimates can be derived from a corresponding peak index.
- the advantage of the system 120 over the single path system of FIG. 3 is that the system 120 provides a lower probability of missed detection when the frequency error to be estimated is large.
- a large initial frequency error may be due to the use of an inexpensive crystal oscillator having low accuracy.
- the preferred embodiment of the system of FIG. 3 can perform satisfactorily when the frequency error is within the range ⁇ 5 kHz. If the frequency error due to an inaccurate crystal oscillator is outside this range, then the system of FIG. 3 may miss the detection of a FB.
- the system 120 of FIG. 12 has a lower probability of missed detection due to the two additional paths.
- the mixers 121 , 123 in these two paths translate the center frequency of the received signal by frequency amounts f 1 , f 2 , respectively.
- the system 120 In addition to being capable of detecting a FB despite a large initial frequency error due to the crystal oscillator of the receiver, the system 120 also has better resilience to carrier phase changes. It can be shown analytically, and verified by simulation, that the system 120 can detect a FB correctly even when the digital amplitude gain control (AGC) amplifiers in the receiver cause a 180 degrees phase change in the received signal.
- AGC digital amplitude gain control
- FIG. 13 One embodiment of another system which also provides a lower probability of missed detection than the system of FIG. 3 is illustrated in FIG. 13 .
- This system 130 requires less hardware logic and cycle complexity than the system 120 of FIG. 12, but may waste one or more FB time in order to figure out whether a frequency error is very large.
- the system 130 includes the FB detector 30 of the present invention, six mixers 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 , six FB correlators 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 , and six peak modules 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 155 , 156 .
- the system 130 can be implemented with any number of mixers, FB correlators and peak modules.
- the system 130 has 7 signal paths including a path marked “NOMIX path”. Except for the NOMIX path, each of the remaining paths includes a mixer 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 , or 136 , a FB correlator 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , or 146 , and a peak module. 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 155 , or 156 . Each of the mixers is used to translate the center frequency of the received signal r(i) by a predetermined frequency amount.
- the predetermined amounts of frequency which are used as inputs to the mixers 131 , 132 , 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 are f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 , f 5 , f 6 , respectively.
- the three look-up tables are preferably stored in an on-chip random access memory (RAM).
- Each of the FB correlators operates to search for a FB in a different translated signal.
- the FB correlators are searching for a FB over different ranges of frequencies.
- Appropriate choices of the frequencies f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 , f 5 , f 6 can make these ranges of frequencies mutually exclusive.
- the outputs of each of the FB correlators are correlation outputs, which are complex numbers, as described above.
- Each of the peak modules 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 155 , 156 computes a maximum of the magnitudes of the correlation outputs received from a respective FB correlator.
- Each of the peak modules also includes a register to store a threshold, compares the respective maximum with the threshold and only outputs the maximum if it is greater than the threshold.
- Each of the peak modules can also include a buffer to store a set of maxima. All of the maxima produced by all the peak modules 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 155 , 156 , along with the outputs from the FB detector 30 will be examined by a decision module 160 at certain time, e.g., at a start of a TDMA frame.
- Either one of the maxima or the outputs of the FB detector will be chosen by the decision module 160 . If one of the maxima is chosen, then the corresponding mixer input frequency is selected to bias the reference oscillator of the receiver. For example, if the output. MAX 1 of the peak module 151 is chosen, then the frequency f 1 is selected to bias the oscillator. If the outputs of the FB detector is selected, then the selected frequency error 43 is used to biased the reference oscillator.
- Each of the six FB correlators is the FB correlator of the present invention.
- each of the FB correlators 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 uses 64 samples of input signal to produce one correlation output, while the FB correlator 32 inside the FB detector 30 uses only 16 samples.
- the choice of 64 samples for the six FB correlators 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 is to provide better performance in signal selectivity.
- signal selectivity it is meant that each of the six FB correlators operates within a very narrow frequency range and at least one of the six FB correlators will produce a high magnitude output.
- each of the six FB correlators 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 operates in a very small range of frequency.
- the frequency error due to an inexpensive crystal oscillator typically has a Gaussian probability distribution function with low variance.
- the initial frequency error (for example, at start-up, when the cellular phone is turned on) is within ⁇ 5 kHz, and can be detected with the FB detector 30 of the path marked “NOMIX path” in FIG. 13 .
- the FB detector 30 of the path marked “NOMIX path” in FIG. 13 For the few times when the initial frequency error is greater than ⁇ 5 kHz, one of the other paths in FIG. 13 will detect this error. This error estimate will then be used to bias the crystal oscillator of the receiver appropriately to reduce the error to within the operating range ( ⁇ 5 kHz) of the NOMIX path.
- the main purpose of the paths containing the FB correlators 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 is to detect when the initial error is out of operating range of the FB detector 30 . For example, if the frequency error is near. ⁇ f 1 kHz, the output of the FB correlator 141 which succeeds the +f 1 kHz mixer 131 will have the highest magnitude output among all the FB correlator magnitude outputs. Thus, the output of the peak module 151 will be selected. The corresponding frequency f 1 will then be used to bias the oscillator. Subsequently, future FBs will arrive at the FB detector 30 with almost no frequency error.
- the systems 120 of FIG. 12 and 130 of FIG. 13 find particular applications in the systems DCS 1800 and PCS 1900, where the initial frequency errors can be as large as twice the one in the GSM system when the same LO is used to generate the reference carrier frequency.
