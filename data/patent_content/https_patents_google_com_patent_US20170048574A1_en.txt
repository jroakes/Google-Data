- a controlling device such as a mobile communication device or a tablet computer
- a controlling device can be identified that includes a display for presenting content to a user.
- the user can use the controlling device, for example, to initiate and control content that is presented on the presentation device (e.g., a television (TV)).
- User input can include, for example, using an application running on the controlling device to select a first content item (e.g., a specific video) that is to be shown on the presentation device (e.g., the TV).
- a first content item e.g., a specific video
- an indication can be received from the application of an intent by the user to present (either directly or indirectly as will be discussed below) a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device.
- the content server system can select one or more additional content items (e.g., advertisements) for simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while the first content item (e.g., the video) is presented on the co-located presentation device.
- the selecting can be based, at least in part, on the first content item.
- the one or more additional content items can include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the one or more additional content items.
- Interaction points can include, for example, clickable links or other controls that the user can use to respond to the content provided in the content item, such as to make a purchase.
- the one or more additional content items can be delivered to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device. This can include delivering a second different content item that includes a first interaction point.
- User input e.g., user actions constituting a conversion
- the interaction can be attributed to the presentation of the first content item.
- configurations can exist in which more than two devices are used, e.g., including plural of either or both of controlling devices and presentation devices.
- the controlling device and the presentation device need not be co-located, e.g., if the controlling device controls content provided to one or more remote presentation devices. Other configurations are possible.
- Presentation devices can typically have enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of a controlling device.
- the enhanced presentation characteristics can include, for example, display characteristics (e.g., higher resolution and/or a larger screen area) or audio characteristics (e.g., higher-quality speakers and/or other sound components). Other enhanced presentation characteristics are possible.
- the characteristics of presentation devices e.g., televisions
- the presentation devices can be initiated and controlled by controlling devices (e.g., mobile devices or laptop computers).
- simultaneous presentation can also include and/or refer to presentations that are relatively simultaneous or within a similar timeframe.
- the content items can be presented at exactly the same time (e.g. mirrored), within a few seconds of each other, or using a larger delay (e.g., minutes or hours).
- the content items can be presented in a way so that the user experiences a coordinated presentation, e.g., that appears to have the content items communicating with each other.
- One or more content items can be presented on either of the controlling device and the presentation device.
- some content items such as a pre-roll advertisement typically presented by conventional systems on presentation devices (e.g., before a presented video), can instead or additionally be presented on the controlling device.
- the pre-roll advertisement presented on the controlling device can be the same as, or different from, the advertisement presented on the presentation device.
- Some implementations can allow users to specify whether content items are to be provided on their controlling devices as described herein. For example, users can specify user settings and/or preferences that indicate that certain ones of their controlling devices are allowed to receive content items related to content presented on their presentation devices. Other settings, for example, can specify conditions or aspects of content presentation, e.g., under what conditions permission is granted to provide the content items, such as while watching videos but not full-length movies.
- a controlling device e.g., a mobile telephone
- a presentation device e.g., a co-located television set
- the presentation device may receive the content for presentation directly from the source (as opposed to through the controlling device). Other examples are possible.

- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by, for example, crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other webpages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a reservation process a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used
- conversions can be more likely to occur in situations in which related content is presented simultaneously, nearly simultaneously, coincidently, or within a predetermined amount of time on a user's presentation and controlling devices.
- the user may be more likely to convert after being presented, on the controlling device, an advertisement that is related to, and coordinated with, a video that is presented on the presentation device.
- the controlling device may include capabilities that allow for user interaction (e.g., selection of links, interaction with call-to-action features, or other interaction points) that may not be available on the presentation device, thus limiting the user's ability to interact with content presented on the presentation device.
- FIG. 2 shows an example system 200 for providing content.
- the content management system 110 can receive an indication from an application running on a controlling device 106 a of an intent by the user 202 to receive/present a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device 106 b .
- Example controlling devices 106 a can include a mobile communication device, a tablet computer, or some other device capable of running applications to control other devices.
- Example presentation devices 106 b can include a television, such as the user's Internet-connected television.
- the controlling device 106 a can be, for example, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, or some other mobile or non-mobile communication device of a user 202 .
- the content management system 110 can provide content items for simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery on both devices. In some implementations, providing content within the system 200 can occur in the following example sequence of stages.
- the device identification engine 121 can identify the controlling device 106 a that includes a display (e.g., a user interface 204 ) for presenting content to the user 202 .
- the user interface 204 can be an application that interfaces with the presentation devices 106 b, such as an application that selects video or other content (e.g., from the Internet).
- the user 202 in this example, can be a user using the controlling device 106 a to control content selected for presentation on the presentation device 106 b.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. A controlling device is identified that includes a display for presenting content to a user. An indication is received from an application running on the controlling device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device. Based on the first content item, additional content items are selected for simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while presenting the first content item on the co-located presentation device. The additional content items include interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the additional content items, which are delivered to the controlling device. User input is received that is in the form of an interaction with an interaction point. The interaction is attributed to the presenting of the first content item.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented. Some users may have multiple user devices capable of receiving content, and each of the user devices may have different display capabilities.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes identifying a controlling device that includes a display for presenting content to a user. The method further includes receiving an indication from an application running on the controlling device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device. The method further includes selecting, by one or more processors, one or more additional content items for simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while presenting the first content item on the co-located presentation device, wherein the selecting is based at least in part on the first content item, and wherein the one or more additional content items include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the one or more additional content items. The method further includes delivering, by one or more processors, the one or more additional content items to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device including delivering a second different content item including a first interaction point. The method further includes receiving user input in the form of an interaction with the first interaction point. The method further includes attributing the interaction to the presenting of the first content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The controlling device can be a mobile communication device or a tablet computer, and the presentation device can be a television. The first content item can be an Internet content item and the second different content item can be selected based at least in part on content or metadata of the Internet content item, wherein the Internet content item is selected from the group comprising a multi-media content item, a graphical display item, an audio content item, an executable software application, or an Internet resource. The first content item can be a video content item, wherein the video content item includes or is associated with a first advertisement that is presented before, during or after the presentation of the video content item, and wherein the second different content item is a second advertisement that is related to the first advertisement. The second advertisement can be a mirror of the first advertisement. The second advertisement can include an interaction point that corresponds to an interaction point that is presented but disabled on the first advertisement. Receiving an indication can include receiving a request to initiate a session for presenting content on the co-located presentation device, wherein the request includes an identifier for the first content item. Selecting one or more additional content items can include identifying eligible content items from an inventory of content items, and eligible content items can include content items that are adapted for coordinated presentation on the controlling device in view of simultaneously displayed content on the co-located presentation device. The method can further include providing additional content to the co-located presentation device based on the interaction. The method can further include providing an advertiser interface for configuring a campaign, the campaign including both a first advertisement to be shown in conjunction with the first content item when it is presented on the co-located presentation device and a second advertisement to be presented on the controlling device coincident with the presentation of the first advertisement on the co-located presentation device. Selecting one or more additional content items can include selecting a campaign associated with a content sponsor for providing the second different content item, the campaign having two or more associated content items, one for presentation on the co-located presentation device and one for presentation on the controlling device. Attributing includes crediting a conversion that is related to the interaction to the presentation of the first content item.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: identify a controlling device that includes a display for presenting content to a user; receive an indication from an application running on the controlling device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device; select one or more additional content items for simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while presenting the first content item on the co-located presentation device, wherein the selecting is based at least in part on the first content item, and wherein the one or more additional content items include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the one or more additional content items; deliver the one or more additional content items to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device including delivering a second different content item including a first interaction point; receive user input in the form of an interaction with the first interaction point; and attribute the interaction to the presenting of the first content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The controlling device can be a mobile communication device or a tablet computer, and the presentation device can be a television. The first content item can be an Internet content item and the second different content item can be selected based at least in part on content or metadata of the Internet content item, wherein the Internet content item is selected from the group comprising a multi-media content item, a graphical display item, an audio content item, an executable software application, or an Internet resource. The first content item can be a video content item, wherein the video content item includes or is associated with a first advertisement that is presented before, during or after the presentation of the video content item, and wherein the second different content item is a second advertisement that is related to the first advertisement.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system comprising one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a controlling device that includes a display for presenting content to a user; receive an indication from an application running on the controlling device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device; select one or more additional content items for simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while presenting the first content item on the co-located presentation device, wherein the selecting is based at least in part on the first content item, and wherein the one or more additional content items include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the one or more additional content items; deliver the one or more additional content items to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device including delivering a second different content item including a first interaction point; receive user input in the form of an interaction with the first interaction point; and attribute the interaction to the presenting of the first content item.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The controlling device can be a mobile communication device or a tablet computer, and the presentation device can be a television. The first content item can be an Internet content item and the second different content item can be selected based at least in part on content or metadata of the Internet content item, wherein the Internet content item is selected from the group comprising a multi-media content item, a graphical display item, an audio content item, an executable software application, or an Internet resource. The first content item can be a video content item, wherein the video content item includes or is associated with a first advertisement that is presented before, during or after the presentation of the video content item, and wherein the second different content item is a second advertisement that is related to the first advertisement.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Users can receive and interact with content items on mobile devices that are used for controlling presentation devices, e.g., receiving, on the mobile devices, pre-roll advertisements, product placement advertisements, and/or advertisements relevant to what they're watching on a second device, e.g., a video on a second device (a presentation device). Content sponsors can create campaigns that include content items (e.g., advertisements) that are tailored to a user's environment, e.g., for presentation when a mobile device is being used to control content presented on a presentation device. Content sponsors can create content items that are synchronized with content being experienced on a nearby presentation device, e.g., so that an advertisement is provided on a first device (e.g., a controlling device) coincident with related content that is shown on a second different but co-located device (e.g., a presentation). Devices that are being used simply to control presentations on other devices can be served content items which can improve the user experience and relevancy of content being presented on the other devices. Content sponsors can adjust their bids for the presentation of their content for situations in which content items are presented to controlling devices.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- Systems, methods, and computer program products are described for delivering content to a presentation device that is separate from, but co-located with, a controlling device. For example, a controlling device, such as a mobile communication device or a tablet computer, can be identified that includes a display for presenting content to a user. The user can use the controlling device, for example, to initiate and control content that is presented on the presentation device (e.g., a television (TV)). User input can include, for example, using an application running on the controlling device to select a first content item (e.g., a specific video) that is to be shown on the presentation device (e.g., the TV). At a content server system, for example, an indication can be received from the application of an intent by the user to present (either directly or indirectly as will be discussed below) a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device. The content server system, for example, can select one or more additional content items (e.g., advertisements) for simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while the first content item (e.g., the video) is presented on the co-located presentation device. The selecting can be based, at least in part, on the first content item. The one or more additional content items can include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the one or more additional content items. Interaction points can include, for example, clickable links or other controls that the user can use to respond to the content provided in the content item, such as to make a purchase. The one or more additional content items can be delivered to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device. This can include delivering a second different content item that includes a first interaction point. User input (e.g., user actions constituting a conversion) can be received by the content server system that is in the form of an interaction with the first interaction point. The interaction can be attributed to the presentation of the first content item.
- Although examples provided herein include the use of two devices that are co-located, other configurations are possible. In some implementations, configurations can exist in which more than two devices are used, e.g., including plural of either or both of controlling devices and presentation devices. In some implementations, the controlling device and the presentation device need not be co-located, e.g., if the controlling device controls content provided to one or more remote presentation devices. Other configurations are possible.
- Presentation devices can typically have enhanced presentation characteristics, relative to the display of a controlling device. In some implementations, the enhanced presentation characteristics can include, for example, display characteristics (e.g., higher resolution and/or a larger screen area) or audio characteristics (e.g., higher-quality speakers and/or other sound components). Other enhanced presentation characteristics are possible. The characteristics of presentation devices (e.g., televisions) can make them suitable for presenting rich content (e.g., videos), and the presentation devices can be initiated and controlled by controlling devices (e.g., mobile devices or laptop computers).
- While examples are provided for simultaneous presentation of content items on the controlling (e.g., initiating) and presentation devices, simultaneous presentation can also include and/or refer to presentations that are relatively simultaneous or within a similar timeframe. For example, the content items can be presented at exactly the same time (e.g. mirrored), within a few seconds of each other, or using a larger delay (e.g., minutes or hours). Also, the content items can be presented in a way so that the user experiences a coordinated presentation, e.g., that appears to have the content items communicating with each other. One or more content items can be presented on either of the controlling device and the presentation device.
- In some implementations, some content items, such as a pre-roll advertisement typically presented by conventional systems on presentation devices (e.g., before a presented video), can instead or additionally be presented on the controlling device. In this example, the pre-roll advertisement presented on the controlling device can be the same as, or different from, the advertisement presented on the presentation device.
- Some implementations can allow users to specify whether content items are to be provided on their controlling devices as described herein. For example, users can specify user settings and/or preferences that indicate that certain ones of their controlling devices are allowed to receive content items related to content presented on their presentation devices. Other settings, for example, can specify conditions or aspects of content presentation, e.g., under what conditions permission is granted to provide the content items, such as while watching videos but not full-length movies. Several examples are described below. One typical example includes the use of a controlling device (e.g., a mobile telephone) that is used to control content presented on a presentation device (e.g., a co-located television set). In some implementations, the presentation device may receive the content for presentation directly from the source (as opposed to through the controlling device). Other examples are possible.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andpublishers 109. - The
environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by thecontent management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using thenetwork 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. A data store ofeligible content items 131, for example, can include different types of content items such as advertisements, multi-media content items (e.g., videos), graphical display content items, audio content item, executable software applications, Internet resources, and other formats or types of content items. A data store of attributeduser interactions 132, for example, can include information about user interactions that are associated with the presentation of content. An example attribution can be a conversion by a user that occurs on a controlling device that is associated with a content item presented on a co-located presentation device under the control of the controlling device. - The
content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be combined or separate, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102). Adevice identification engine 121, for example, can identify a controlling device that includes a display for presenting content to a user. For example, the controlling device can be the user's mobile communication device (e.g., smart phone, cell phone, etc.), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or some other mobile or non-mobile communication device. - A
user intent engine 122, for example, can receive an indication from an application running on the controlling device of an intent by the user to receive/present a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device. For example, the received indication can also include a request for a content item (e.g., a particular video) to be presented on the presentation device. - A
content identification engine 123, for example, can select one or more additional content items for simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while presenting the first content item on the co-located presentation device. For example, thecontent identification engine 123 can identify advertisements that are related to a user-specified video to be presented on the presentation device. - A
content delivery engine 124, for example, can deliver the one or more additional content items, including a second different content item, to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device. For example, thecontent delivery engine 124 can deliver the selected video to the user's presentation device and the related one or more advertisements to the user's controlling device. - An
interaction attribution engine 125, for example, can attribute a user interaction with an interaction point in the second different content item with the presentation of the first content item. For example, the attributed interaction can be a conversion on an advertisement presented on the controlling device that is associated with the presentation of the video or other content on the presentation device. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by, for example, crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. - Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other webpages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. In some implementations, content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In some implementations, conversions can be more likely to occur in situations in which related content is presented simultaneously, nearly simultaneously, coincidently, or within a predetermined amount of time on a user's presentation and controlling devices. For example, the user may be more likely to convert after being presented, on the controlling device, an advertisement that is related to, and coordinated with, a video that is presented on the presentation device. Further, the controlling device may include capabilities that allow for user interaction (e.g., selection of links, interaction with call-to-action features, or other interaction points) that may not be available on the presentation device, thus limiting the user's ability to interact with content presented on the presentation device.

FIG. 2 shows anexample system 200 for providing content. For example, in thesystem 200, thecontent management system 110 can receive an indication from an application running on acontrolling device 106 a of an intent by theuser 202 to receive/present a first content item on a separate butco-located presentation device 106 b.Example controlling devices 106 a can include a mobile communication device, a tablet computer, or some other device capable of running applications to control other devices.Example presentation devices 106 b can include a television, such as the user's Internet-connected television. The controllingdevice 106 a can be, for example, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, or some other mobile or non-mobile communication device of auser 202. In response to the received indication, thecontent management system 110 can provide content items for simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery on both devices. In some implementations, providing content within thesystem 200 can occur in the following example sequence of stages. - At
stage 1, for example, thedevice identification engine 121 can identify thecontrolling device 106 a that includes a display (e.g., a user interface 204) for presenting content to theuser 202. For example, the user interface 204 can be an application that interfaces with thepresentation devices 106 b, such as an application that selects video or other content (e.g., from the Internet). Theuser 202, in this example, can be a user using the controllingdevice 106 a to control content selected for presentation on thepresentation device 106 b. In some implementations, the controllingdevice 106 a can include or access an electronic program guide (EPG) for content to be presented on thepresentation devices 106 b. - At
stage 2, for example, theuser intent engine 122 can receive anindication 206 from an application running on the controllingdevice 106 a of an intent by theuser 202 to receive afirst content item 208 on the separate butco-located presentation device 106 b. For example, theindication 206 can be received subsequent to theuser 202 using the user interface 204 to select acontrol 210 for identifying a particular video to be presented on thepresentation device 106 b. Thefirst content item 208, for example, can be a video (e.g., that includes rich content) that can be streamed to thepresentation device 106 b or that uses other enhanced presentation capabilities of the device. Thefirst content item 208, for example, can be one of theeligible content items 131, e.g., a particular video selected by theuser 202 using the user interface 204 for presentation on thepresentation device 106 b. - At
stage 3, for example, thecontent identification engine 123 can select one or moreadditional content items 212 for simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery on the controllingdevice 106 a while presenting thefirst content item 208 on theco-located presentation device 106 b. The video, for example, may include food-related scenes, such as a part of the video that shows a person removing a pizza from the oven or drinking a beverage. In this example, conventional systems that select related content items may select a pre-roll advertisement that typically precedes the selected video. In this example, as the video is to be presented on thepresentation device 106 b, content items, such as food-related advertisements, can be selected for simultaneous presentation on the controllingdevice 106 a. For example, thecontent identification engine 123 can select one or more food-related advertisements that are selected based, at least in part, on thefirst content item 208, e.g., a video for which a pre-roll food-related advertisement is typically selected. In some implementations, the one or more additional content items can be identified from theeligible content items 131. Theadditional content items 212, for example, can include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable theuser 202 to interact with the one or moreadditional content items 212. While pre-roll items are described, other content can be selected, such as to be displayed coincident with a particular portion of a selected presentation item. - At
stage 4, for example, thecontent delivery engine 124 can deliver the one or moreadditional content items 212 to the controllingdevice 106 a for presentation coincident with the presentation of thefirst content item 208 on theco-located presentation device 106 b. Theadditional content items 212 can include a seconddifferent content item 212 a (e.g., a pizza advertisement) that includes a first interaction point, e.g., with which theuser 202 can interact with the seconddifferent content item 212 a. In some implementations, the seconddifferent content item 212 a can be presented in acontent item slot 214 in the user interface 204. - At
stage 5, for example, thecontent management system 110 can receiveuser input 216 in the form of an interaction with the first interaction point in the seconddifferent content item 212 a. For example, if theuser 202 interacts with the pizza advertisement, e.g., by clicking on a link in the advertisement or by performing some other action, the controllingdevice 106 a can send theuser input 216 that identifies the interaction. - At
stage 6, for example, theinteraction attribution engine 125 can attribute the interaction (e.g., the user input 216) to the presentation of thefirst content item 208. For example, information associated with the user's interaction with the pizza advertisement can be stored in association with information for the provided first content item 208 (along with being attributed to the particular content that is being shown on the controlling device). In some implementations, the attributed interaction information can be stored, for example, in the data store of attributeduser interactions 132. In some implementations, the stored information can include, for example, conversions that are linked to the presentation of content on the presentation device. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for providing additional content on a device controlling a presentation device. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can perform stages of theprocess 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 300. - A controlling device is identified that includes a display for presenting content to a user (302). For example, the
device identification engine 121 can identify thecontrolling device 106 a as a device that is controlling thepresentation device 106 b and is capable of receiving content, such as advertisements. The identification can occur, for example, after a message or other communication is sent by the controllingdevice 106 a to thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, the identification can occur subsequent to receiving a request for content, either for content to be presented on the controllingdevice 106 a or thepresentation device 106 b. - An indication is received from an application running on the controlling device of an intent by the user to receive a first content item on a separate but co-located presentation device (304). As an example, an application executing on the controlling
device 106 a can provide theindication 206 to thecontent management system 110 that includes information associated with an intent by theuser 202 to watch a video on thepresentation device 106 b (e.g., notification of a selection can be received). The application can be, for example, an application that provides the user interface 204. Theindication 206, for example, can be received subsequent to theuser 202 using the user interface 204 to select acontrol 210 for a particular content item (e.g., a video) to be presented on thepresentation device 106 b. The first content item (e.g., first content item 208) can be a video containing rich content that can be streamed to thepresentation device 106 b or that uses other enhanced presentation capabilities of the presentation device. Also, thefirst content item 208, for example, can be one of theeligible content items 131, e.g., a particular video selected by the user 202 (e.g., using the user interface 204) for presentation on thepresentation device 106 b. - In some implementations, the controlling device can be a mobile communication device or a tablet computer, and the presentation device can be a television. For example, the
user 202 can use a smartphone or other mobile device (or a non-mobile device, such as a personal computer) to control the presentation of content on a flat-screen television or other device in the same room or otherwise nearby. - In some implementations, receiving the indication of the intent by the user can include receiving a request to initiate a session for presenting content on the co-located presentation device, and the request can include an identifier for the first content item. For example, the
indication 206 can identify “Example Video 2” as the video that theuser 202 wants to see. Theindication 206 can also include, for example, information that a session is to be initiated between thecontrolling device 106 a and thepresentation device 106 b, on which content (e.g., the selected video) is to be provided. - One or more additional content items are selected for simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery on the controlling device while presenting the first content item on the co-located presentation device (306). The selecting is based, at least in part, on the first content item, and the one or more additional content items include one or more interaction points that are configured to enable the user to interact with the one or more additional content items. For example, in response to the received
indication 206 received from the controllingdevice 106 a, thecontent identification engine 123 can select thefirst content item 208 and theadditional content items 212. Thefirst content item 208, for example, can be the video selected by theuser 202 in the user interface 204 for presentation on thepresentation device 106 b. Theadditional content items 212, for example, can be one or more advertisements selected for presentation on the controllingdevice 106 a and that are selected based in part on the selected video. Theadditional content items 212, for example, can include interaction points by which theuser 202 can interact with the content items (e.g., advertisements). In some implementations, one of theadditional content items 212 can be a pre-roll advertisement that is provided to bothdevices - In some implementations, selecting one or more additional content items can include identifying eligible content items from an inventory of content items (e.g., the eligible content items 131). The
eligible content items 131 can include, for example, content items that are adapted for coordinated presentation on the controlling device in view of simultaneously displayed content on the co-located presentation device. For example, theeligible content items 131 can include content items that content sponsors have provided specifically for (or that are suitable in) situations in which content can be provided, e.g., to the controllingdevice 106 a and theco-located presentation device 106 b. - In some implementations, selecting the one or more additional content items can include selecting a campaign associated with a content sponsor for providing the second different content item. The campaign can have two or more associated content items, one for presentation on the co-located presentation device and one for presentation on the controlling device. For example, when selecting the
content items content identification engine 123 can select fromeligible content items 131 that are specifically defined bycontent sponsors 108 to provide content to combinations of controlling and presentation devices. - The one or more additional content items are delivered to the controlling device for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item on the co-located presentation device including delivering a second different content item including a first interaction point (308). As an example, the
content delivery engine 124 can deliver the one or more additional content items 212 (e.g., food-related advertisements) to the controllingdevice 106 a for presentation coincident with the presentation of the first content item 208 (e.g., the video) on theco-located presentation device 106 b. The seconddifferent content item 212 a, for example, can be a pizza advertisement that includes a first interaction point with which theuser 202 can interact. - In some implementations, the first content item can be an Internet content item, and the second different content item can be selected based, at least in part, on content or metadata of or associated with the Internet content item. The Internet content item can be, for example, a multi-media content item, a graphical display item, an audio content item, an executable software application, or an Internet resource. For example, the content item that the
user 202 selects for presentation on thepresentation device 106 b can be any type of content item (e.g., the video that includes food-related segments). Thecontent identification engine 123, for example, can select advertisements for presentation on the controllingdevice 106 a based on information associated with the video, e.g., that may indicate that food-related advertisements are ideal for simultaneous presentation with the video. - In some implementations, the first content item can be a video content item, and the video content item can include or be associated with a first advertisement that is presented before, during or after the presentation of the video content item. The second different content item can be a second advertisement that is related to the first advertisement. For example, the
content identification engine 123 can select the seconddifferent content item 212 a which can be a food-related advertisement that is related to the food-related advertisement that is displayed as a pre-roll advertisement, e.g., before the video starts. - In some implementations, the second advertisement can be a mirror of the first advertisement. For example, the same advertisement (or complementary advertisements) can appear simultaneously on the controlling
device 106 a and thepresentation device 106 b. In some implementations, the second advertisement can include an interaction point that corresponds to an interaction point that is presented but disabled or otherwise unable to be interacted with on the first advertisement. For example, interaction points that are enabled on the advertisement presented on the user's smartphone may be disabled on the same advertisement presented on the flat-screen television. - User input is received that is in the form of an interaction with the first interaction point (310). As an example, the
user 202 may interact with the pizza advertisement, e.g., by clicking on a link in the advertisement or by performing some other action. Based on this interaction, for example, the controllingdevice 106 a can send theuser input 216 to thecontent management system 110. Theuser input 216, can identify the user interaction, e.g., associated with the first interaction point in the seconddifferent content item 212 a (e.g., the pizza advertisement). - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include providing additional content to the co-located presentation device based on the interaction. For example, based on interactions by theuser 202 using the controllingdevice 106 a, thecontent management system 110 can provide additional content, including advertisements, to thepresentation device 106 b. - The interaction is attributed to the presentation of the first content item (312). As an example, the
interaction attribution engine 125 can generate and store information in the attributeduser interactions 132 that attributes theuser input 216 to an advertisement presented on thepresentation device 106 b. - In some implementations, attributing the interaction can include crediting a conversion that is related to the interaction to the presentation of the first content item. For example, the
interaction attribution engine 125 can attribute selection by theuser 202 of a link on the seconddifferent content item 212 a (e.g., a food-related advertisement) as a conversion associated with a complementary advertisement presented on thepresentation device 106 b. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include providing an advertiser interface for configuring a campaign, the campaign including both a first advertisement to be shown in conjunction with the first content item when it is presented on the co-located presentation device and a second advertisement to be presented on the controlling device coincident with the presentation of the first advertisement on the co-located presentation device. For example, content sponsor interfaces can be presented for use by content sponsors for designating when and how content items are to be simultaneously presented on controlling and presentation devices. Content sponsors can identify, for example, complementary advertisements, e.g., one advertisement to be shown on devices such as the controllingdevice 106 a, and the other related advertisement to be shown on devices such as thepresentation device 106 b. The interfaces can also include, for example, selection criteria for identifying content to use, parameters indicating when the same content items are to be mirrored, information identifying enabled and disabled interaction points, and other information. -
