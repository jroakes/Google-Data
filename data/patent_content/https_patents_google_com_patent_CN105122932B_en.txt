Control information is emitted to network entity on channel (PUCCH).PUSCH usually carries such as video data from UE to network entity
The user data of (for example, streaming video) or audio data (for example, audio call).UE can also the emission control on PUSCH
Information, such as HARQ feedback, CSI report.In addition, UE can emit scheduling request (SR) on PUCCH.UE can also emit spy
It surveys reference signal (SRS), is not a part of any particular channel.
In the embodiment of invention, in order to which from network entity requests uplink resource, scheduling request is emitted to net by UE
Network entity.It is responded if network entity authorization requests by sending UE for scheduling authorization referring to Fig. 7.Scheduling authorization
It is a part of down link control information (DCI).Network entity is in downlink control channel (for example, physical down link
Control channel (PDCCH)) on emit DCI.Scheduling authorization provides parameter to UE, and UE is emitted on PUSCH using these parameters
Data.These parameters include data modulation and encoding scheme, transport block size, resource allocation (for example, resource block and transmission bandwidth
Position in configuration), jumping parameters, power control information and other control information.
In the embodiment of invention, there are different PUCCH formats, usually take from UE to network entity but regardless of PUCCH
Format with control information.PUCCH resource block is usually located at the edge of UL carrier wave, and between RB can be used for PUSCH resource
It assigns.In the various embodiments of invention described herein, network entity can configure PUCCH be D2D communication in from UE to
UE carries data.Part of the PUCCH for D2D will be referred to as PUCCH-D2D.
On PUCCH by UE emit control information include HARQ feedback, SR and CSI report.UE send HARQ feedback with
Just ACK the or NACK data that UE is received from network entity.SR requests UL resource from network 100 by UE use, including from one
A or multiple network entity requests UL resources.CSI report is used to network entity report from UE about being seen from UE viewpoint
The information of DL transmission channel.
Each CSI report transmitted by UE may include one or more of CQI, PMI, PTI and RI.UE uses CQI
It indicates highest MCS, if used, will lead to the DL transmission with the BLER no more than 10%.UE is come using PMI
Any pre-encoder matrix should be used to transmit for DL to network entity instruction.RI by UE be used to recommend be preferred for
The grade of transmission (number of transport layer) of the DL transmission of UE.PTI distinguishes slow fading environment and rapid fading environment.
According to the embodiment of invention, UE transmitting be configured to PUCCH-D2D about RB pairs of control information.PUCCH-
D2D RB is not necessarily continuously.Each RB of one centering can for example be located at the opposite end of the frequency range of transmission bandwidth.
UE can with during network communication emit UL DM-RS and/or SRS.UL DM-RS is used for channel by network entity
Estimate to make it possible to carry out coherent demodulation to PUSCH and/or PUCCH.SRS by network entity for channel status estimate with
Just uplink channel is supported to rely on scheduling and link circuit self-adapting.
Referring to Fig. 7, the DL for carrying data from one or more network entities to UE on DL carrier wave will now be described
The T/F figure of subframe.The horizontal scale of Fig. 6 indicates frequency, and vertical scale indicates the time.Horizontal scale is divided into more
A frequency chunks, or the OFDM subcarrier (" subcarrier ") of transmission can be allocated for.The vertical scale of Fig. 6 is divided into more
A time block, or the OFDM symbol (" symbol ") being used for transmission can be distributed.Subframe is divided into time-frequency resources block
(RB).Each RB is typically used for 12 carrier waves of normal CP multiplied by 7 symbols.Subframe 1ms long and is divided into two in total
The time slot of each 0.5ms.Each RB can be divided into multiple resource elements (RE) again.Each RE is a subcarrier multiplied by one
A symbol.
If DL subframe includes the reference signal of dry type.Reference signal is emitted to UE so that UE can be held by network entity
The various functions of row.One such reference signal is channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS), is used to determine letter by UE
Channel state information (CSI).UE is by CSI report to network entity.CSI-RS not necessarily emits in all subframes.
Referring again to Fig. 6, other reference signals in UL subframe include demodulated reference signal (DM-RS), and RE is referred to as DM-
RS RE.In general, reference signal corresponding with antenna port 7 and 8 is using code division multiplexing (CDM) or other schemes and by multichannel
Multiplexing, and it is mapped to the identical RE in time and frequency domain.Subframe can also include other reference signals, and such as cell is specific
Reference signal (CRS), location reference signals (PRS), the master that is distributed in the control area of subframe and/or user data area are same
Walk signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS).
CSI-RS configuration is supplied to UE via RRC signaling by network entity.Rrc layer in UE proposes CSI-RS configuration information
The physical layer (for example, " higher level signaling ") being supplied in UE.
HARQ
In the various embodiments of invention, the UE and network entity of Fig. 1 uses HQRA communication plan.More specifically, when hair
When transmission block is emitted to recipient's (UE or network entity) by side's of sending (UE or network entity), recipient is by disappearing HARQ-ACK
Breath (" HARQ-ACK ") be sent to sender indicate ACK (transmission block is successfully decoded by recipient), NACK (transmission block not by
Recipient is successfully decoded) or DTX (interrupt transmission) respond.
When harq is used, sender emits grouping, and waits until it receives ACK or NACK from recipient, with
After emit next grouping.Once receiving ACK or NACK, sender emits next grouping.In the case where receiving NACK, hair
The side of sending also re-emits the TB for receiving NACK.Reception/transmitting TB/HARQ-ACK and the process suitably responded can use UE
Or several subframes of network entity.In order to avoid establishing multiple HARQ procedures in the timing period waste bandwidth, UE or network entity,
Wherein each HARQ procedure is deviated with other HARQ procedures in time.
Uplink HARQ-ACK is launched in uplink subframe, and downlink HARQ-ACK is in downlink
It is launched in subframe.Time lag in TDD operation, during specific HARQ between the reception of TB and the transmitting of HARQ-ACK
It is configured depending on UL/DL, which specify the position of the ratio and UL subframe and DL subframe of UL subframe and DL subframe in frame.
UL/DL configuration #0 to the #6 of one example collection is shown in fig. 8 a, wherein U=uplink frame, D=descending chain circuit frame, S=
Special frames.Each UL/DL configuration has corresponding HARQ-ACK scheme.The replacement presentation of configuration #0 to #6 is shown in the fig. 8b.
In the embodiment of invention, the HARQ-ACK of the transmission block in subframe n emits in subframe n+k, wherein k >=4, and
And (1) is chosen to when HARQ-ACK will emit (on PUCCH or PUSCH) from UE, n+k is UL subframe, and (2)
When confirmation emits from network entity, n+k is DL subframe.
The value of k is configured depending on UL/DL.Table 1 is shown when UE emits HARQ-ACK to respond DL transmission and (be in this example
PDSCH transmission) when from the value of k from the point of view of UE angle.For example, when UE and network entity are communicated with each other using UL/DL configuration #2,
The downlink transmission on PDSCH in DL subframe 0 should be identified on the PUCCH (or PUSCH) in UL subframe 0+7=7.
The value of table 1-k when UE emits the HARQ-ACK to DL subframe n in UL subframe n+k
Table 1 also shows the number for HARQ procedure used in each UL/DL configuration UE.
It can also express, show as shown in table 2 with the UL/DL of description configuration #0 to #6 shown in Fig. 8 A, 8B and table 1
The value of the k of UL subframe n out, in UL subframe n, UE should respond to the transmission before k subframe in received DL subframe and send out
Penetrate HARQ-ACK message.
The value of table 2- k when UE emits the HARQ-ACK for DL subframe n-k in UL subframe n
For example, the HARQ-ACK message sent during UL subframe 7 should respond in 7 and 6 subframes in configuration #1
Received DL transmission, i.e. DL subframe 0 and special subframe 1 before.The HARQ-ACK message sent during UL subframe 8 should respond to
The received DL transmission before 4 subframes.The example also illustrates in figure 9 a.It is more during single UL subframe as can see
A DL subframe can be responded, such as when being multiplexed using HARQ-ACK binding or HARQ-ACK.
HARQ-ACK binding and multiplexing:
Because TDD realize in (such as in TD-LTE) number of DL and UL subframe is unequal in frame, come from multiple DL
The data transmission of subframe may need to be identified in single UL subframe.In the embodiment of invention, two can be respectively adopted
One of method is completed respectively --- ACK binding and ACK multiplexing.In ACK multiplexing, separated HARQ-ACK message
It is sent in a single sub-frame.Therefore, in preceding example (UL/DL configure #1, Fig. 9 A), UE is during UL subframe 7, in response to
DL subframe 0 and 1 emits two sseparated HARQ-ACK.
If UE, which limits it, to be the quantity of power of HARQ extension, ACK binding can be used.It is bundled in an ACK
In scheme, UE executes logical AND operation to multiple HARQ-ACK messages and transmits the result to network entity.This process makes
With bit more less than multiplexing process, power is therefore saved on.Referring to Fig. 9 B, for example, UE is considered in son in configuration #1
HARQ-ACK message is sent network entity by frame 7, in response to the DL data receiver during subframe 0 and 1.UE disappears to these
Breath executes logical AND and transmits the result to network entity during subframe 7.Therefore, if there is to subframe 0 ACK and
To the NACK of subframe 1, then UE sends NACK in subframe 7.
Carrier wave polymerization
According to the embodiment of invention, the UE and NE of Fig. 1 can be used carrier wave polymerization (CA) and communicate with each other.CA allows multiple loads
Wave (for example, LTE carrier wave), each bandwidth having until 20MHz will be by transmitted in parallel to single UE, and simultaneously from single UE
Row receives.CA increases the size of overall channel bandwidth workable for UE and NE.Each carrier wave in CA scheme is referred to as component load
Wave.For example, the component carrier of NE2 can be used in UE4 and NE2 component carrier and NE3 communicates with each other.In LTE embodiment, directly
It is each to have until 20MHz overall channel bandwidth to five component carriers, it can be aggregated to together, cause until 100MHz
Effective overall channel bandwidth.
Component carrier in CA scheme needs not take up cline frequency.Referring to Figure 10 A and 10B, three possible CA are depicted
Arrangement: (1) polymerization, the continuous component carrier of frequency in frequency band；(2) polymerization, discontinuous component carrier in frequency band；(3) gather between frequency band
It closes, discontinuous component carrier.
UE is communicated in CA scheme uses a down-link principal component carrier wave and corresponding up-link principal component carrier wave.
In addition, UE can have one or several auxiliary component carriers in each direction.It is carried moreover, UE need not be used with its principal component
The identical carrier wave of wave.For example, Figure 10 B shows three UE, each UE uses different aggregation schemes: UE1 makes without using polymerization, UE2
It is polymerize with symmetrical, and UE3 uses asymmetric polymerization.The principal component carrier wave of each UE is indicated with letter P.
UE can be changed using the ability of CA.It is some to be able to use CA and other may not be able to.Moreover, UE may energy
Enough CA on downlink direction, but cannot CA (such as UE3 in Figure 10 B) in the uplink direction.
For giving UE, the NE communicated on main carrier is referred to as Pcell, and provides one or more secondary carriers
Each of one or more NE are referred to as Scell.
PUCCH format
According to the LTE embodiment of invention, PUCCH supports multiple format-formats 1, format 1a, format 1b, format 2, format
2a, format 2b and format 3.Format 1a, 1b and 3 will be only discussed herein.
Scheduling request and HARQ-ACK are emitted to network entity using format 1a and format 1b by UE.In third generation partner
Description can be found in plan 36.211 5.4.1 of (3GPP) technical specification TS section.In format 1a, UE use is about one
Single HARQ acknowledgement bit of downlink component carrier generates BPSK symbol.If multiplexed using downlink spatial,
Then two acknowledgement bits be used to generate the QPSK symbol with format 1b.In the format 1b with HARQ-ACK channel selection
In, when UE is configured with more than one serving cell, or in TDD, when UE is configured with single serving cell
When, UE is using two bits and generates QPSK symbol to transport up to four acknowledgement bits in PUCCH.
Format 1a/1b uses seven OFDM symbols (if using normal cyclic prefix) of every time slot.As use format 1a/
When 1b, UE emits 12 sequence of length.Three symbols are used as reference signal to facilitate the channel estimation of network entity, and remaining
Four are modulated by BPSK/QPSK.The sequence that multiple UE of cell can be rotated in same time-frequency resource using same phase
Column are separated to emit HARQ-ACK by different orthogonal covering.
The HARQ-ACK message that PUCCH format 3 has commonly used to allow UE to emit more than four bits.Format 3 is
It is described in 36.211 5.4.2A of three generations's Partnership Program (3GPP) technical specification TS section.
Format 3PUCCCH subframe has seven OFDM symbols of every time slot.In normal cyclic prefix, UE uses each
The two code elements of time slot emit for reference signal.UE emits data using remaining 5 symbols.In each time slot, 12DFT
The block of precoding QPSK symbol emits in five available OFDM symbols.
PUCCH resource
The PUCCH resource of the LTE embodiment according to invention will now be described.PUCCH resource is the number for determining three things
Mesh: UE should emit the resource block, its orthogonal sequence that should be used index and its cyclic shift that should be used of PUCCH.
It is denoted as n(1)_PUCCHA kind of PUCCH resource type for the independent mixing ARQ confirmation in PUCCH format 1a and 1b.In order to
Calculate n(1)_PUCCH, rope of the UE using network entity for the first control channel element (CCE) of its downlink scheduling order
Draw.
If HARQ multiplexing is used in UE, then it may need to emit two in a subframe in TDD realization
A above HARQ-ACK.In order to complete this point, UE can be in up to four PUCCH resources --- n(1)_PUCCH, 0 arrives
n(1)_PUCCH, emit on 3 (UE is calculated from the first CCE as previously described).If UE needs to send CSI in same time,
Need to emit HARQ-ACK, then HARQ-ACK is compressed to two bits by it, them are multiplexed with CSI report, and
PUCCH resource n with PUCCH format 2/2a/2b(2)_PUCCH, on they are sent, this is UE specific and by for every
The higher of a serving cell is configured.
D2D communication
Referring to Figure 11, the D2D communication plan according to the embodiment of invention will now be described.In this embodiment, network
Entity is come mutual by the way that appropriate time-frequency resource allocation to UE to be initiated to D2D communication, UE using the time-frequency resources
Communication carrys out order using the resource of distribution or authorization UE is directly communicated with each other.The time-frequency resources for being assigned to UE can be UL
Resource (for example, UL RB) or DL resource (for example, DL RB).For example, network entity can be by the one of UL subframe or DL subframe
A or multiple resource blocks distribute to UE.
In the embodiment of invention, D2D UL or the DL RB of distribution can periodically occur, such as in each frame or
In each subframe.Data flow is established using these RB, UE1 and UE2 for distributing, such as is configured to a series of time duplexs
Subframe or time slot, wherein each subframe or time slot use one or more RB of UL or DL carrier wave.In one embodiment, UE
Used RB is derived from UL subframe, and these RB are selected from the PUCCH of UL carrier wave.
Modification HARQ-ACK feedback timing is to adapt to D2D communication
When operating in tdd mode, for the regular communication with network entity, the UE of specific cell is based on list UL/DL and matches
It sets using list (first) HARQ-ACK timing.According to the embodiment of invention, in order to facilitate D2D communication, if necessary, UE
(that is, to from the received ACK/NACK downlink transmission of NE) can be configured based on another UL/DL on uplink direction to cut
Change to the 2nd HARQ-ACK timing.First UL/DL configuration (non-D2D) will be referred to herein as the specific UL/DL of cell sometimes and match
It sets.2nd UL/DL configuration will sometimes referred to as D2D DL be configured with reference to UL/DL.
As will be discussed, UE either explicitly or implicitly can obtain D2D DL from network entity and refer to the body that UL/DL is configured
Part, or can determine the configuration about its own.
According to the embodiment of invention, a reason of the 2nd HARQ-ACK timing is switched to such as from the first HARQ-ACK
Under.If UE participates in D2D communication, UE will need at least one UL subframe to be used for D2D communication.Therefore, the subset of the UL subframe
It will be unavailable for the uplink communication of UE and network entity.This unavailability significantly reduces every UL/ currently in use
DL configures the number of distributed UL subframe.Therefore, if the configuration #0 hypothesis of Fig. 8 A is used, and UE is needed using two UL
Subframe (for example, UL subframe 4 and 9) is communicated for D2D, then can be used for UE and transmit in response to the DL from NE and send HARQ-ACK
The number of the subframe of message is reduced to every frame 4 from every frame 6.In order to compensate for the change, UE or network entity are by from
One HARQ-ACK exchange-column shift to the 2nd HARQ-ACK periodically modifies uplink HARQ-ACK scheme.
Referring to table 3, shows and how to make such example modified in inventive embodiments.Data in table 3 are preparatory
It is assumed that it is configuration #0 that cell, which specifically configures,.In practice, table 3 is used as being assigned to D2D DL from D2D subframe matches with reference to UL/DL
The mapping set.
Table 3
Further embodiment will be described in the environment of different scenes now.
UE can know that its D2D DL is configured with reference to UL/DL in various ways.In one embodiment, network entity uses
Dedicated higher (for example, RRC) signaling come notify UE which configure its will be used as its D2D DL with reference to UL/DL configuration.The D2D
DL can be used for HARQ-ACK timing of the UE from the received all DL subframes of network entity with reference to UL/DL configuration.Alternatively,
The HARQ-ACK timing that D2D DL is configured with reference to UL/DL can be only used for now by UE come common in the subframe for D2D
The DL subframe of ACK/NACK.
In another embodiment, UE selects D2D DL to configure with reference to UL/DL (for example, from D2D subframe according to predefined rule
It is assigned to the mapping that D2D DL refers to UL/DL configuration) or using the default UL/DL specified for example in whole industry communication standard
Configuration, and it is stored in the memory 308 of UE (Fig. 3).
Standard according to the embodiment of invention, in order to select D2D DL to configure with reference to UL/DL, below UE or network entity use
Then: the UL subframe other than (a) D2D DL should have for D2D with reference to UL/DL configuration, and (b) D2D DL matches with reference to UL/DL
The UL subframe set set should be after subtracting D2D subframe in cell specific UL/DL configuration available UL subframe
Subset is used to emit the HARQ-ACK message of the DL subframe of the specific UL/DL configuration of cell.In other words, D2D DL is referred to
UL/DL configuration should be selected such that UE in the subset of the UL subframe of the specific UL/DL configuration of cell by HARQ-ACK message
It is emitted to network entity.
It is configured if there is the multiple UL/DL for meeting these criterion, selecting D2D DL can be based on additional with reference to UL/DL configuration
Criterion is selected from them.For example, D2D DL, which with reference to UL/DL configuration can be (1), to be had and can be used for UL HARQ-ACK and disappear
Breath is configured with the UL/DL for responding the maximum number UL subframe of the DL subframe of the specific UL/DL configuration of cell；(2) there is minimum
The UL/DL configuration of HARQ-ACK delay；And/or (3) have minimum HARQ-ACK delay and with can for the single of HARQ-ACK
With the UL/DL configuration of the DL subframe of the associated more peanut of UL subframe.
Scene 1
It will now be described how UE obtains the example that the specific D2D DL of its UE refers to UL/DL configuration.In this illustration,
NE2 (Figure 11) has the specific UL/DL configuration 0 of cell, and the allocated UL subframe 4 and 9 is used for the D2D between UE3 and UE4
Communication.In order to compensate for the loss of these UL subframes of HARQ-ACK, it is fixed that UE4 selects the 2nd UL/DL to be configured to HARQ-ACK
When.Due to only having the reservation of UL subframe 2,3,7 and 8 to can be used for emitting HARQ-ACK message, so UE4 needs to select to can be used for emitting
The UL subframe of the HARQ-ACK message of DL subframe 0,1,5 and 6 is the configuration of the subset of subframe 2,3,7 and 8.UL/DL configures #1, #
2, #4, #5 and #6 meet these criterion.In this illustration, it will be assumed that UE4 selects UL/DL to configure #6, because of four UL subframes
(subframe 2,3,7 and 8) is used to emit in UL/DL configuration #6 the HARQ-ACK message of DL subframe 0,1,5 and 6, and other are candidate
UL/DL configures (#1, #2, #4 and #5), and there are most two available UL subframes to emit HARQ-ACK message for UE.UE4 is then
It is communicated using D2D with UE3, and is communicated using the uplink HARQ-ACK timing of UL/DL configuration #6 with NE2.
Alternatively, UE4 can choose UL/DL configuration #1 as D2D DL and configure with reference to UL/DL, because UL/DL configures #
1 postpones with the HARQ-ACK more shorter than configuration #6 and has maximum associated with the single UL subframe for HARQ-ACK
Two DL subframes.
Scene 2
Another example will now be described.In this illustration, it is assumed that NE2 is only serving cell for UE3 and UE4
(Figure 11), and NE2 configures #0 using UL/DL, and subframe 3,4,8 and 9 is distributed to UE3 and UE4 to be used to carry out mutually
D2D communication.This, which leaves, can be used for the UL subframe 2 and 7 of UE3 and UE4 and is used for transmission NE2.In order to adjust UL subframe 3,4,8 and 9
Loss, UE4 is based on more appropriate UL/DL --- its UL subframe for being used to emit DL subframe 0,1,5 and 6 is subframe 2 and 7
Subset configuration --- to obtain the second uplink HARQ-ACK timing.In this illustration, it is full to configure #1, #2 and #5 by UL/DL
The foot criterion.Due to UL/DL configuration #1 have shortest HARQ-ACK postpone and with the single UL subframe phase for HARQ-ACK
The DL subframe of associated minimal amount, the D2D DL that UL/DL configuration #1 becomes UE4 are configured with reference to UL/DL.Since DL subframe can be used
Do not change because D2D is communicated, NE2 haves no need to change HARQ-ACK timing on downlink direction (that is, from UE4 reception
It is transmitted to ACK/NACK uplink).Therefore, in this illustration, network entity will use the downlink of UL/DL configuration #0
HARQ-ACK timing.But UE4 will not monitor the HARQ-ACK message by NE2 transmission or be used for the uplink of subframe 3,4,8 and 9
Link scheduling message, because UE4 just participates in communicating with the D2D of UE3 using these subframes.
Scene 3
In another example, NE2 (Figure 11) has the specific UL/DL configuration 0 of cell, and the allocated UL subframe 4 is used for
D2D communication between UE3 and UE4.Then, the reservation of UL subframe 2,3,7,8 and 9 can be used for emitting HARQ-ACK.In this example
In, UE3 selects UL/DL configuration #1 to configure as D2D DL with reference to UL/DL, has the HARQ- more shorter than UL/DL configuration #6
ACK delay, and have compared with UL/DL configures #2, #4 and #5 can be used UL subframe associated with for the single of HARQ-ACK
More peanut DL subframe.Moreover, UE3 is configured using the D2D DL for being served only for DL subframe with reference to UL/DL, HARQ-ACK disappears
Breath is assumed to emit on assigning the UL subframe for D2D communication.It is, when be used for the HARQ-ACK message of DL subframe 0 according to
When uplink HARQ-the ACK of UL/DL configuration #1 periodically emits, in UL subframe 9, matched according to the specific UL/DL of cell
It sets #0 and emits the HARQ-ACK message for DL subframe 5.
For determining that UE4 will need not be executed using the above process which D2D DL is configured with reference to UL/DL by UE.One
In a little embodiments, network rather than UE may make the determination by using above-mentioned same criterion.
The UE in each embodiment of invention, which will now be described, can obtain its other party that its D2D DL refers to UL/DL configuration
Formula.In initially setting up for D2D communication, network entity identifies the first UL/DL configuration to UE, that is, the specific UL/DL of cell matches
It sets.Then NE identifies the 2nd UL/DL configuration to UE, that is, D2D DL is configured with reference to UL/DL.NE can emit via broadcast signaling
The 2nd UL/DL is matched about the information of the first UL/DL identity configured and via dedicated higher (for example, RRC) signaling
The identity set is emitted to UE.By comparing the group of the UL subframe of the group and the second configuration of the UL subframe of the first configuration, UE determination makes
It which UL subframe to carry out D2D communication with, such as configures the UL subframe having jointly based on two.UE is referred to according to D2D DL
The HARQ-ACK feedback of UL/DL configuration periodically executes the uplink HARQ-ACK feedback to NE.
In another embodiment, NE is assigned to UL subframe of the UE for D2D communication to UE mark.NE can (for example, through
From dedicated higher level signaling) identity for assigning the UL subframe for D2D communication is signaled to UE.UE, which is then based on, to be assigned
D2D UL subframe and determine D2D DL with reference to UL/DL configuration based on cell specific UL/DL configuration.UE joins according to D2D DL
The HARQ-ACK feedback timing of UL/DL configuration is examined to execute the HARQ-ACK feedback to DL subframe.
According to other embodiments, UE or NE (are stored in the memory of UE4 or NE2) by reference to one or more tables,
Such as one or more of table 1 to 3, to determine that D2D DL is configured with reference to UL/DL.
The timing of TDD uplink HARQ-ACK feedback and PUCCH resource due to D2D communication change
According to the embodiment of invention, UE executes uplink HARQ-ACK according to one or more rules and feeds back.Now will
The example for the such rule that can be realized in the LTE embodiment of invention is described.It should be understood that UE can be using these rules
All or some subsets.
Serving cell c associated with UL subframe n in TDD operation mode, for uplink HARQ-ACK feedback
On the set of DL subframe (be designated as Kc, downlink association set will be referred to as here) and it is DL subframe n-k, wherein k ∈ K (table 2
In the value of k is shown) and K be to be determined according to the specific UL/DL configuration of cell.In the embodiment of invention, if UE is used
Some UL subframes participate in D2D communication, then can be according to cell with the downlink association set of UL subframe for one or more
Specific UL/DL configuration, D2D DL are configured with reference to UL/DL and what D2D subframe was distributed combines to determine.DL can be used in UE
It configures with reference to UL/DL for all DL subframes to serving cell c or only to DL associated with UL D2D appointment subframe
The HARQ-ACK of frame feeds back timing.
PHICH (feeding back for the HARQ-ACK of PUSCH, i.e. downlink HARQ-ACK) occurs and PUSCH tune occurs
One or more DL subframes of degree authorized transmissions defer to the scheme of the specific UL/DL configuration of cell.But UE does not monitor PHICH
Or the UE PUSCH for being used in the subframe of D2D communication is authorized.In scene 2, for example, UE will not monitor PHICH or to subframe 3,
4,8 or 9 PUSCH authorization is monitored.
For being configured with the UE of a serving cell:
For for HARQ-ACK transmit configured with using channel selection and HARQ-ACK multiplexing modes (for example,
As illustrated in 3GPP TS 36.213V11.1.0) PUCCH format 1b UE:
Emit HARQ-ACK using PUCCH if UE: if UE use HARQ-ACK bit value and under UL subframe n
Line link relation integration feeds back to construct the uplink HARQ-ACK on UL subframe n, as illustrated in LTE standard.?
In LTE Rel-11, for example, UE will save " TDD HARQ-ACK feedback according in 36.213 10.1.3 of 3GPP TS
The table that procedures " is found feeds back to construct uplink HARQ-ACK.One such table is reproduced herein as table
2.When participating in the UE construction uplink HARQ-ACK feedback of D2D, UE can modify downlink association set and count as follows
Calculate the size M:M=M of modified downlink association setr- D-S-U, wherein M is to be configured according to D2D DL with reference to UL/DL
Table 10.1.3.1-1 (among 3GPP TSs 36.213) defined in set K associated with subframe n in element number,
D is the number of the D2D subframe configured in set K, and if set K includes that there is the special subframe of normal downlink CP to match
0 or 5 or the configuration 0 and 4 with expanded downstream link CP are set, then S=1, otherwise S=0, U is in set K for serving cell c
The number of the subframe of available UL subframe, determining by the specific UL/DL configuration of cell and the distribution of D2D subframe.M+S be include special
The set K of different subframecIn element number.
In some embodiments, S=0 is configured but regardless of special subframe.
In scene 2, for example, if UL/DL configuration #2 is selected as D2D DL and configures with reference to UL/DL, for UL
Subframe n=2, Mr=4, D=2 (subframe 4,8), S=0, U=0, therefore, M=2.
If the M=0 on UL subframe n, on UL subframe n, there will be no HARQ-ACK to feed back.For example, in scene 2, such as
Fruit D2D DL is #1 with reference to UL/DL configuration, then for UL subframe n=3, Mr=1, D=1 (subframe 9), S=0, U=0, therefore, M
=0.
For the HARQ-ACK transmission in UL subframe n, if the specific DL of cell is #0, Huo Zheru with reference to UL/DL configuration
Fruit HARQ-ACK transmission occurs on the PUSCH not by UL authorization adjustment, then the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits is OACK=M
=Mr-D-S-U。
#1 to #6 is configured with reference to UL/DL with the specific DL of cell for the HARQ-ACK transmission in UL subframe n, if
Emit HARQ-ACK on PUSCH by UL authorization adjustment, then the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits is based on indicating in UL authorization

In another embodiment, above-mentioned modification of the substitution in downlink association set, UE are reflected using LTE Rel-11
Firing table will be used for Rel-11 downlink association set with the downlink association set for being worth with Rel-11M
The HARQ-ACK bit of interior subframe is set as DTX or NACK, corresponds to D2D subframe or can use UL subframe.For example, in scene
In 2, if D2D DL is configuration #2 with reference to UL/DL configuration, the HARQ-ACK bit for subframe 4 and 8 is arranged to DTX
(when emitting on PUCCH) or NACK (when emitting on PUSCH) are to construct the feedback of the HARQ-ACK in UL subframe 2.
For the UE configured with HARQ-ACK tie-in mode for HARQ-ACK transmission (PUCCH format 1a/1b):
UE is tied according to the modified downlink association set that D2D DL is configured with reference to UL/DL to execute HARQ-ACK
It ties up.It will assume in D2D subframe or PDCCH can be discharged with PDSCH or DL SPS is not present in UL subframe.Therefore, under modified
The size M of line link relation integration is determined as follows: M=Mr- D-S-U, wherein MrBe according to D2D DL with reference to UL/DL configuration with
The number of element, D are in the associated set K defined in table 10.1.3.1-1 (in 3GPP TS 36.213) of subframe n
The number of the D2D subframe configured in set K, if set K include have normal downlink CP special subframe configuration 0 or
5 or the configuration 0 or 4 with expanded downstream link CP, then S=1, otherwise S=0, U are in set K for by the specific UL/ of cell
The number of the subframe of the available UL subframe of serving cell c of DL configuration and the distribution determination of D2D subframe.M+S be include special subframe
Set KcIn element number.
For example, if D2D DL is #1 with reference to UL/DL configuration, UE will assume will not in subframe 4 and 9 in scene 2
There are PDSCH or DL SPS to discharge PDCCH.Therefore, UE will not detect PDSCH transmission in the subframe for being configured to D2D transmission
And/or the PDCCH of indicating downlink link SPS release, as desired.Moreover, UE will not emit in UL subframe 3 and 8
HARQ-ACK message for subframe 4 and 9.
For being used for the UE of HARQ-ACK transmission configured with PUCCH format 3:
UE will be usedTo determine HARQ-ACK feedback bitsNumber.For support 1 transmission block TM or
Application space HARQ-ACK binding,.Otherwise,。
If UE emits HARQ-ACK on PUCCH or on the PUSCH not by UL authorization adjustment, or if service is small
TDD UL/DL configuration in area is #0:Wherein MrBe table 10.1.3.1-1 associated with subframe n (
3GPP TS 36.213) defined in element in set K number, D is the number of the D2D subframe configured in set K, if
Set K includes that there is the special subframe of normal downlink CP to configure 0 or 5 or the configuration 0 and 4 with expanded downstream link CP,
Then S=1, otherwise S=0.U is the number of the subframe of UL subframe available for serving cell c in set K.It is to include
The set K of special subframecIn element number.
In some embodiments, S=0 is configured but regardless of special subframe.
In scene 2, if D2D DL is #2 with reference to UL/DL configuration, for UL subframe n=2, Mr=4, D=2 (son
Frame 4,8), S=0, U=0 therefore,。
If UE emits HARQ-ACK in UL subframe n and in the PUSCH by UL authorization adjustment, and special for cell
Fixed DL configures #1 to #6 with reference to UL/DL, and the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits is based on the DAI value indicated in UL is authorized, such as
Such as described in LTE-Rel 11.
In another embodiment, above-mentioned modification of the substitution in downlink association set, UE refer to UL/ using D2D DL
The Rel-11 downlink association set of DL configuration (for example, UL/DL configure #2), setting is for D2D subframe (such as 3,4,8 and
9) and the HARQ-ACK bit of available UL subframe is NACK.
For the UE configured with more than one serving cell (regardless of whether the serving cell of all configurations uses same cells
Specific DL is configured with reference to UL/DL or different configurations):
If using the interband CA with full duplex ability (i.e. permission UE emits and receives simultaneously in different frequency band),
PDSCH HARQ timing and the timing of uplink HARQ-ACK feedback (herein will based on downlink timing reference UL/DL configuration
Referred to as " DL is configured with reference to UL/DL "), from the D2D DL in serving cell, with reference to UL/DL configuration, (wherein D2D subframe is matched
Set for UE (herein will be referred to as " D2D cell ")) and other serving cells in the specific UL/DL configuration of cell come it is true
It is fixed.It is defined similar to the case where being the TDD interband CA that there are the different UL/DL in different frequency band to configure in Rel-11
Mechanism is determined for DL and configures with reference to UL/DL.
If continuous CA in service band, due to adjacent-channel interference, for not being for the serving cell of D2D communication configuration
Uplink (or downlink) subframe it is unavailable also for transmitting (or reception) during D2D receives (or transmitting).Therefore,
Be not for D2D communication configuration serving cell also have D2D DL with reference to UL/DL configuration (its be based on D2D subframe subframe series
In position determine) and serving cell the specific UL/DL configuration of cell.
If using there is half-duplex ability (at any given time, in all polymerization carrier waves from different frequency band
On, UE may only emit or may only receive) interband CA, then for being not for the downlink of the serving cell of D2D communication configuration
Link (or uplink) subframe is also unavailable during D2D transmitting (or reception).Therefore, it is not configured to D2D communication
Each serving cell also have D2D with reference to UL/DL configure, based on D2D subframe subframe series in position and service it is small
The specific UL/DL configuration of the cell in area is to determine.
If using continuous CA or interband CA in the frequency band with half-duplex ability, from for all of D2D configuration UE

PUCCH resource supply
According to the embodiment of invention, for D2D and honeycomb mixing UE, uplink HARQ-ACK feedback timing and for bee
The PUCCH resource supply of nest communication is all based on the rule that D2D DL refers to UL/DL configuration, is specially signaled by UE or really
It is fixed.For most cases, only the PUCCH resource conflict between honeycomb UE and mixing UE may not occur, because of PUCCH resource
It is that scale is determined by the number of element in downlink association set, and the PUCCH resource of cell specific UL/DL configuration
Scale may be different from (or determination) D2D UL/DL configuration of the UE signal specific notice in given uplink subframe.
But if the two UL/DL configuration has phase in the downlink association set of given uplink subframe
With the element of number, then PUCCH resource conflict may occur.For example, it is assumed that the specific UL/DL configuration of cell is #0 and D2D DL
It is #6 with reference to UL/DL configuration, then subframe 9 is assigned for D2D communication.For UL subframe 2, associated DL subframe namely for
The subframe 6 of the specific UL/DL configuration #0 of cell and the subframe 5 for configuring #6 with reference to UL/DL for D2D DL.If only honeycomb UE
PDSCH is scheduled in subframe 6 and mixes the PDSCH of UE in identical first CCE with the transmission for corresponding two PDCCH
It is dispatched in the subframe 5 of number, then PUCCH resource conflict occurs in uplink subframe 2.In one embodiment, for given
Mixing UE in uplink subframe, PUCCH resource scale increase by one, for avoiding potential PUCCH from conflicting.
Transmission of the table 4-for the HARQ-ACK multiplexing of M=2
In LTE embodiment, it is given by the use that M=1 (PUCCH format 1a/1b) in serving cell is configured at one
In the PUCCH resource of HARQ-ACK binding or HARQ-ACK multiplexing, wherein M is the number of element in downlink association set

It the first CCE number of PDCCH and determines to advise by the number of the element in the downlink association set according to LTE Rel-11
Mould.
In another embodiment, the case where conflicting if there is potential PUCCH, then network can be configured by higher and be used
In the PUCCH resource of DL subframe associated with UL D2D appointment subframe.UL/DL specific for cell be configured to #0 and
D2D DL is configured to #6 and subframe 9 with reference to UL/DL and assigns sample situation for D2D communication, is used in UL subframe 2 and UL subframe
The PUCCH resource of the HARQ-ACK message of 9 associated DL subframes 5 is configured by higher level signaling.In another embodiment,
PUCCH resource is indicated to the UE for assigning control channel (E) PDCCH of PDSCH in DL subframe.UE can be by higher level signaling half
It is statically configured with P PUCCH resource, and which resource used in P PUCCH resource of dynamic instruction.
The number of HARQ-ACK process is adjusted to adapt to D2D communication
In some embodiments, UE it may also be desirable to number of the adjustment for the HARQ procedure of both DL and UL.If with
Uplink HARQ-ACK feedback the timing of all possibility DL subframes is deferred to D2D DL and is configured with reference to UL/DL in serving cell
The rule of (for example, the UL/DL in scene 2 configures #2), then determine that DL HARQ is fixed with reference to UL/DL configuration also based on D2D DL
When.But the reservation subframe (for example, subframe #3,4,8 and 9) for D2D communication is neither can be also not available with DL subframe
UL subframe.In addition, some subframes that D2D DL is referred in the DL subframe set of UL/DL configuration may be according to the specific UL/ of cell
DL configures and corresponds to the available UL subframe of serving cell.Therefore, true as follows for mixing the number of the DL HARQ procedure of UE
It is fixed: the number of the DL HARQ procedure for UE=D2D DL with reference to the DL HARQ procedure in UL/DL configuration number-for
The reservation number of D2D communication adds the service in the DL subframe set in the radio frame for referring to UL/DL configuration according to D2D DL
The number of the available UL subframe of cell.
Similarly, the number of UL HARQ procedure can be updated as follows: the number of the UL HARQ procedure for UE=small
Number in number-radio frame of UL HARQ procedure in the specific UL/DL configuration in area for the reservation subframe of D2D communication
Referring to Figure 13, the scene that D2D communication is participated according to the UE3 and UE4 (Fig. 1) of the embodiment of invention will now be described.
Step 1304-1324 in Figure 13 is marked to show the subframe numbers transmitted and HARQ-ACK message is loud
Should be in which DL subframe.
It will assume that network 100 is TDD LTE network in this scene, and NE2 has determined the D2D between UE3 and UE4
Communication is desired.It will also be assumed that UL/DL configuration #0 (Figure 12) has been set up as the cell specific configuration for cell C2.
In step 1300, NE2 is configured via the specific UL/DL in broadcast signaling signaling cell and is distributed subframe and uses
It is communicated in D2D.In this illustration, NE2 distributes UL subframe 4 and UL subframe 9 is used for D2D.In step 1301, NE2 determines D2D
DL is configured to UE3 with reference to UL/DL.NE2 makes this determination based on above-mentioned one or more criterion.In this example
In, it will be assumed that NE2 selected UL/DL configuration #1 and configure as the D2D DL of UE3 with reference to UL/DL.It is passed through in step 1302A, NE2
D2D DL is signaled to UE3 with reference to UL/DL configuration by dedicated signaling.
Alternatively, NE2 executes step 1302B, herein its position for signaling subframe (for example, the time, frequency,
Subframe numbers etc.) it is communicated to be used by UE3 for the D2D with UE4.It is then based on described in relatively morning in step 1302C, UE3
Which UL/DL configuration is criterion use as its D2D DL with reference to UL/DL configuration to determine.If UE3 carries out configuration determination,
NE2 may not be needed to execute step 1301 and 1302A, and only carry out 1302B and 1302C.In this case, UE3 will be sent out
Signal notifies NE2 to notify NE2 to have determined that use which UL/DL configuration as its D2D DL matches with reference to UL/DL about UE3
It sets.Another alternative solution is NE2 execution step 1302B, and according to the predefined rule in the memory for being stored in NE2 and UE3
Then, NE2 and UE3 execute step 1301 and 1302C respectively.In any case, UE3 will use UL/DL configuration #1 to be used for HARQ-
ACK feedback timing.
In step 1304 to 1324, UE3 received from NE2 in DL subframe and special subframe data (step 1304,
1306,1316 and 1318), in UL subframe and special subframe emit data (step 1306,1308,1310,1318,1320 and
1322), in special subframe from DL be converted to UL (step 1306 and 1318) and participate in UE4 D2D (step 1312 and
1324)。
In step 1308 (UL subframe 2), UE3 emit HARQ-ACK message in response to UE3 in (former frame) DL subframe 5
With transmission block received in special subframe 6.In step 1320 (UL subframe 7), UE3 emits HARQ-ACK message in response to UE3
The received transmission block in (present frame) DL subframe 0 and special subframe 1.
