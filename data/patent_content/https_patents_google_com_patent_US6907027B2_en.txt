Definitions
- the invention relates to a radio communication system and radio devices used in the radio communication system, and to methods of transmitting and receiving signals in a radio communication system.
- the radio frequency spectrum is used by a large number of radio broadcast and radio communication systems.
- conflict between the signals used in the different radio broadcast systems and radio communication systems must be avoided. This is generally achieved by allocating different frequency bands of the radio frequency spectrum to each of the different radio broadcast systems and radio communication systems.
- the demand for capacity in radio communication systems is high and is expected to increase in the future.
- the available radio frequency spectrum is not unlimited, and so it is desirable to enable different radio communication systems to operate in at least partially overlapping frequency bands in order to provide the desired increase in capacity in radio communication systems to meet the expected demand.
- GSM Global System for Mobile communication
- the GSM system was initially designed to carry mainly voice traffic, and is unable to provide high data transfer rates for data traffic.
- the EDGE packet radio system (EGPRS) has been proposed as a development of the GSM system, to provide improved data capacity.
- the EDGE packet radio communications system (EGPRS) provides both a classic EGPRS system, using the same signal format as the current GSM system, and a COMPACT system which uses a different system format. It is envisaged that radio frequency spectrum used by the classic EGPRS system and by the COMPACT system will overlap with the radio frequency spectrum currently used for the GSM system.
- GSM format signals however it will be clear that this description applies to classic EGPRS system signals as well as to GSM signals.
- Both the GSM and the COMPACT radio communication systems are cellular radio communication systems in which a network of base stations is provided. Each base station provides access to the GSM network or the COMPACT network for a number of mobile stations within a cell associated with that base station, by means of a radio frequency interface.
- the frequency bands allocated to the GSM radio communication system and to the COMPACT radio communication system are divided into a number of radio frequency channels. As indicated above, the radio frequency channels are common to the two systems. Signals on the radio frequency channels are arranged as multi-frame signals comprising a fixed number of frames, each of the frames containing within it a number of time slots. A base station and a mobile station communicate by means of logical control channels and traffic channels which are mapped onto specified parts of the transmitted multi-frame signals.
- FIG. 1 a A schematic diagram of the multi-frame format defined for GSM signals is shown in FIG. 1 a .
- a multi-frame comprising 51 Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frames numbered 0 - 50 is used, each frame of the multi-frame being divided into eight time slots.
- a down link signal from the base station to the mobile station carrying the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) and Command Control Channel (CCCH) logic channels is shown, as an exemplary illustration of the multi-frame signal structure used in the GSM system.
- FIG. 1 a also shows the presence of a Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH) containing a frequency correction burst (FCB) in timeslot 0 of frame nos.
- FCCH Frequency Correction Channel
- FCB frequency correction burst
- Synchronization Channel containing a synchronization burst (SB) in timeslot 0 of frame nos. 1 , 11 , 21 , 31 and 41 .
- FIG. 1 b A schematic diagram of the multi-frame format defined for COMPACT signals is shown in FIG. 1 b .
- a multi-frame comprising 52 Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frames numbered 0 - 51 is used, each frame of the multi-frame being divided into eight time slots.
- TDMA Time Division Multiple Access
- CPBCCH Compact Broadcast Channel Control
- CPCCCH Compact Command Control Channel
- FIG. 1 b also shows the presence of a Frequency Correction Channel (CFCCH) containing a frequency correction burst (FCB) in timeslot 1 of frame no.
- CFCCH Frequency Correction Channel
- CSCH Synchronization Channel
- SB synchronization burst
- the frequency correction burst (FCB) is modulated to contain a tone and is provided to enable the mobile station to synchronize with a signal from the base station.
- the tone contained by the frequency correction burst (FCB) can easily be detected by the mobile station. If a frequency correction burst (FCB) is received, the mobile station can deduce that the currently received radio frequency channel also contains synchronization information, in the form of the synchronization burst (SB). The mobile station can then attempt to frame synchronize with a signal from the base station on the currently received radio frequency channel by attempting to locate the synchronization burst (SB) carried on the Synchronization Control Channel (CSCH).
- SB Synchronization Control Channel
- the multi-frame structures used in the GSM radio communication system and the COMPACT radio communication system are different, as described above with reference to FIGS. 1 a and 1 b .
- the synchronization burst (SB) in a GSM format multi-frame signal can be found at a position 10 or 11 frames after the position in the multi-frame of the frame containing the detected frequency correction burst (FCB): in contrast the synchronization burst (SB) in a COMPACT format multi-frame signal can be found at a position 26 frames after the position in the multi-frame of the frame containing the detected frequency correction burst (FCB).
- the frequency correction burst used in the COMPACT system is modulated to contain a tone at ⁇ 67.7 kHz offset from the radio frequency channel carrier, instead of a frequency correction burst (FCB) modulated to contain a tone at +67.7 kHz offset from the radio frequency channel carrier, as established for the GSM system. Since the tones carried by the COMPACT system frequency correction burst (FCB) and the GSM frequency correction burst (FCB) would be different, COMPACT mobile stations would be able to differentiate between a radio frequency channel carrying a GSM format multi-frame signal, and a radio frequency channel carrying a COMPACT format multi-frame signal.
- FCB frequency correction burst
- FCB frequency correction burst
- FIG. 2 shows the power spectral density S( ⁇ ) for a tone with a positive offset from the carrier and FIG. 2 b ) shows the power spectral density S( ⁇ ) for a tone with a negative offset from the carrier.
- the power spectral density Sb( ⁇ ) resulting from the down-converting of S( ⁇ ) is shown in FIG. 2 c ) and is seen to result from the contribution of both frequency mirror tones.
- any existing GSM mobile station which detects the frequency of the tone contained in the frequency correction burst (FCB) using a power spectrum density evaluation method will be unable to distinguish between a frequency correction burst (FCB) tone at +67.7 kHz offset from the carrier and a frequency correction burst (FCB) tone at ⁇ 67.7 kHz offset from the carrier.
- Any such existing GSM mobile station receiving a frequency correction burst (FCB) tone at ⁇ 67.7 kHz offset from the carrier would attempt a synchronization burst decode operation at a position 10 or 11 frames after the position in the multi-frame of the frame containing the detected frequency correction burst (FCB). This synchronization burst decode operation would be unsuccessful for the reasons outlined above.
- the time required for the GSM mobile station to synchronize with a GSM signal would undesirably be extended by the time taken for the failed attempt to synchronize with a received COMPACT signal.
- the mobile station uses the difference between the frequency of the received tone and the expected frequency of +67.7 kHz to adjust the local oscillator.
- a GSM mobile station which detects the frequency of the tone contained in the frequency correction burst (FCB) using a power spectrum density evaluation method will make erroneous adjustments to its local oscillator on receipt of a ⁇ 67.7 kHz tone.
- the present invention seeks to minimize the time necessary for a receiving radio device to establish synchronization with a signal received from a transmitting radio device capable of providing an appropriate service to the mobile station.

In addition, it will be obvious that other types of base station can be used, and the structure shown in FIG. 3 is only one example of a suitable type of base station.
- a base station 1 has an input buffer memory 2 for receiving traffic data to be transmitted by the base station, and storing such data until transmission.
- the base station 1 also has a control data memory 3 for storing control signal data to be transmitted by the base station, and a frequency control burst memory 4 for storing frequency control burst data.
- the input buffer memory 2 , the control data memory 3 and the frequency control burst memory 4 are shown as separate memories for clarity, clearly it is not necessary to provide physically separate memories, as will be appreciated by a skilled person.
- Data to be transmitted by the base station is taken from one of the input buffer memory 2 , the control data memory 3 and the frequency control burst memory 4 and input to a digital signal processor 5 .
- the digital signal processor 5 is controlled by a controller 6 to generate an in-phase signal I and a quadrature phase signal Q in accordance with a modulation scheme.
- the digital signal processor 5 used in the COMPACT system base station is able to use both a GMSK modulation scheme or an offset 8PSK modulation scheme.
- the invention is not restricted to the use of GMSK and offset 8PSK modulation schemes and in general it is only necessary that the digital signal processor can use at least a first or a second modulation scheme.
- the “first” modulation scheme refers to a GMSK modulation scheme
- the “second” modulation scheme refers to an offset 8PSK modulation scheme.
- the details of the processing performed by the digital signal processor 5 which includes interleaving and other processing known to a skilled person, have been omitted for clarity.
- the in-phase signal I and quadrature phase signal Q output from the digital signal processor 5 are input to respective digital-to-analog converters 7 a and 7 b and respective filters 8 a and 8 b .
- the output of filters 8 a and 8 b are used to modulate the signal output from a local oscillator and an in-quadrature version of the signal output from the local oscillator 9 , respectively.
- the resulting signals are combined and used to modulate the carrier signal supplied from local oscillator 10 .
- the local oscillator 10 is controlled by the controller 6 to supply the correct signal for the required radio frequency channel.
- the modulated carrier signal is filtered in filter 11 , amplified in amplifier 12 , and filtered in filter 13 prior to being transmitted by antenna 14 .
- the base station transmits signals containing both traffic channels and control channels, including the COMPACT Frequency Control Channel (CFCCH) containing the frequency correction burst.
- CFCCH COMPACT Frequency Control Channel
- the digital signal processor 5 When the COMPACT base station is transmitting a time slot containing a traffic channel, the digital signal processor 5 is free to use any modulation scheme which is available to the digital signal processor, as shown in step 1 in FIG. 4 .
- GMSK and offset 8PSK are approved modulation schemes for traffic channels in the COMPACT system.
- the use of the 8PSK modulation scheme is advantageous for traffic data as it allows a greater throughput of traffic data.
- the digital signal processor 5 uses an offset 8PSK modulation scheme as a second modulation scheme, as shown in step 2 in FIG. 4 .
- the invention is not intended to be limited to the use of an 8PSK modulation scheme for Frequency Control Channel (CFCCH) modulation.
- CFCCH Frequency Control Channel
- the digital signal processor 5 uses a GMSK modulation scheme as a first modulation scheme, as shown in step 3 in FIG. 4 .
- GMSK modulation scheme is currently the approved modulation scheme for transmission of a control channel in the COMPACT system, as well as for the GSM system, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the use of GMSK modulation scheme for control channel modulation.
- the first and second modulation schemes of the present invention are such that the tone resulting from modulation using the second modulation scheme has a frequency which the first modulation scheme is unsuited to generate.
- the mobile station can establish the format of the received signal from the frequency of the tone contained in the frequency correction channel.
- the frequency control channel for GSM-format signals is modulated using GMSK: in contrast the frequency control channel for COMPACT-format signals is modulated using 8PSK.
- any binary controlled phase modulation can be defined by the phase shift function ⁇ ( ⁇ ) and the modulation index h.
- the modulating bit stream is represented by the set ⁇ a i ⁇ of the signs of the phase variations associated with each bit.
- the GSM05.04 standard contains a formal mapping of GMSK used in the GSM system.
- the bit stream is differentially encoded prior to modulation in order to gain some robustness—in this way, after coherent demodulator, the sampled data value on each branch is uncorrelated with respect to the preceding data values.
- a time slot is divided into 156.25 bit periods.
- a particular bit period within a time slot is referenced by a bit number (BN), with the first bit period being numbered 0 , and the last (1 ⁇ 4) bit period being numbered 156.
- BN bit number
- Different types of burst exist in the system-one characteristic of which is their useful duration.
- FCB frequency correction burst
- the period between bursts appearing in successive time slots is termed the guard period.
- the tones generated by GMSK modulation as outlined above can be obtained by reasoning, in both time and frequency domains at baseband, on a possible scenario for the phase shift function ⁇ ( ⁇ )
- Two pure tones are obtained corresponding to linear trajectories of the phase shift function, inducing a ⁇ /2 phase accumulation per bit period in steady state, or conversely a ⁇ 2 ⁇ phase accumulation after 4 bit periods.
- These tones are pure sine waves since they are generated using a constant phase shift and have a frequency offset from the carrier frequency by ⁇ 67.7 kHz since the modulating symbol rate in the GSM system is 270.833 ksym/s.
- a tone having a zero offset frequency is induced by restricting the dynamic of the phase accumulation oscillation to its minimum, which is obtained with a 2 alternate bit period pattern owing to the filtering effect of the GMSK pre-shaping filter.
- the signal in Equation 1 is then equivalent to a low modulation index sine wave frequency modulated tone.
- the corresponding spectrum of this tone displays frequencies located at ⁇ n ⁇ F m —where F m corresponds to the frequency of the modulating sine wave, i.e. 135.46 kHz since the modulating symbol rate is 270.833 ksym/s.
- the energy repartition is expected to happen between the fundamental and the first harmonic given the low modulation index.
- Those harmonics are sufficiently high to be filtered out by the baseband filter of the handset receiver, whereas the desired energy around the zero frequency can be generated by allocating an average to the phase shift function, i.e. ⁇ 0 ⁇ 0.
- FIG. 6 is a trellis diagram illustrating the phase trajectories for tones at ⁇ 67.7 kHz and a DC tone.
- Two tones may obtained by tweaking a pattern with a pseudo-period of 5 bit duration yielding ⁇ 2 ⁇ phase accumulation after an 8 bit period, leading to a tone having a frequency around ⁇ 33.85 kHz since the modulating symbol rate is 270.833 ksym/s. Since the phase change is not constant, the tone is not a pure sine wave. Only odd harmonics are generated owing to the odd parity of the resulting signal generated by Equation 1. Those harmonics are sufficiently high to be filtered out by the baseband filter of the handset receiver, except possibly the rank 3 harmonic located at ⁇ 101.56 kHz, which is on the verge of the inband bandwidth for GSM. It is believed that the post filtering vestigial energy at ⁇ 101.56 kHz is small enough compared to the energy located at ⁇ 33.85 kHz so as to avoid convergence of any detection algorithm on that harmonic.
- FIG. 7 is a trellis diagram illustrating the phase trajectories for tones at ⁇ 33.85 kHz.
- phase variation trajectories determine the various set of ⁇ a i ⁇ as per equation 2.
- the corresponding ⁇ b i ⁇ are deducted after NRZ to RZ mapping and reverse differential decoding.
- modulation using GMSK can generate pure sine waves or sine waves with acceptable harmonics only at 0, ⁇ 33.85 kHz and ⁇ 67.7 kHz relative to the carrier frequency using baseband filtering required to meet GSM selectivity.
- the basic constellation diagram for 8PSK is shown in FIG. 8 .
- the phase difference between the eight symbols is ⁇ /4
- the GSMO5.04 standard specifies that the constellation itself is successively shifted by 3 ⁇ /8 in consecutive symbol periods leading to a phase shift function rate as small as ⁇ /8 per symbol.
- This phase shift function rate amounts to a ⁇ 2 ⁇ phase accumulation after 16 symbol periods yielding tones of ⁇ 16.92 kHz since the modulating symbol rate is 270.833 ksym/s.
- FIGS. 9 to 11 depict the constellations instantiations of 8PSK constellations resulting in a ⁇ /8 offset per symbol.
- each successive circle represents the constellation at the next symbol time, the original being that of FIG. 8 .
- the differences between the diagrams arise from differences in the initial phase offset and the use of positive and negative constellation shifts between successive symbols, as will be clear to a skilled person.
- tones can be generated by transmitting the following 8PSK modulated symbols in the sequences indicated below:
- FIG. 12 shows the frequency spectrum of the above tones. Simulations were performed with Matlab, with a 5 bit period spread for the linearised GMSK pulse described in GSM05.04.
- the 0.17 dB power flatness due to 8-PSK modulation results in harmonics observed in the 250-300 kHz range with a suppression in excess of 22 dB relative to the fundamental. Those harmonics fall far off the 200 kHz band allocated to the RF channel and will not be seen after filtering.
- offset 8PSK is able to generate a pure sine wave having a frequency offset from the carrier frequency by ⁇ 16.9 kHz.
- One of the 8SPK tones in the above table may be used as the frequency correction burst tone for the COMPACT system.
- FIG. 13 is a functional block diagram of a superheterodyne type mobile station of the COMPACT system. Details of the structure of such a mobile station which will be obvious to a skilled person and are not relevant to the present invention have been omitted for clarity. In addition, it will be obvious that other types of mobile station can be used and the structure shown is only one example of a suitable type of mobile station.
- the mobile station 15 has an antenna 16 for receiving signals transmitted from the base station.
- the received signal is filtered and amplified in filters 17 , 18 and amplifier 19 prior to being converted to base band by mixing with the channel carrier signal from local oscillator 20 .
- a controller 21 controls the local oscillator to select an appropriate channel to receive a signal.
- the base band signal is mixed with a signal from a second local oscillator 22 and also with a in-quadrature signal from a second local oscillator 22 and the resulting signals are respectively filtered in filters 23 a and 23 b and input to analog-to-digital convertors 24 a and 24 b .
- the resulting in-phase and quadrature signals are input to a digital signal processor 25 for further processing.
- the digital signal processor 25 communicates with the controller 21 , as shown.
- a method of selecting a channel in a mobile station will now be described with reference to FIG. 14 .
- the mobile station must detect a frequency correction burst in order to synchronize with a signal received from a base station.
- the mobile station in order to receive signals in the COMPACT format, the mobile station must detect a tone contained in a frequency correction burst of a COMPACT-format signal, i.e. a predetermined one of the tones indicated in the above table having a frequency of ⁇ 16.9 kHz.
- the controller 21 of the mobile station selects that channel by controlling the local oscillator 20 to output the carrier for that channel as shown (step 1 ).
- the digital signal processor 25 evaluates whether or not a frequency correction burst has been received by detecting whether a predetermined tone, as indicated above, is received (step 2 ).
- a number of techniques for determining the frequency of a received tone for example de-rotation and accumulation of the received energy, detection and estimation of zero crossings, and energy estimation around a frequency are known, and will not be described further.
- the controller 21 deduces that the received radio frequency channel does not contain any synchronization information (step 3 ) and the controller 21 controls the local oscillator to select a new channel (step 1 ).
- the controller 21 deduces that the received radio frequency channel contains relevant o synchronization information, and continues the known synchronization procedure (step 4 ).
- the plurality of different tones provided by the present invention can be used to convey additional information to mobile stations able to distinguish between the different tones.
- Such additional information might relate to the services offered by the cell so that the mobile station can determine after a frequency correction burst is received whether it is desirable to synchronize with the current carrier or to search for a new channel based on the services required by the mobile station and the available services offered by the cell.
- One example of such service is whether data transfer is supported by the cell.
- the tone transmitted by a base station in a cell which supports data transfer may be different from the tone transmitted by a base station in a cell which does not support data transfer (i.e. a ⁇ 16.9 kHz tone, for example).
- This determination is also represented by step 3 shown in FIG. 14 .
- the different predetermined tones made available in this advantageous embodiment of the invention can be used to indicate any service capability or other information, such as the identity of the service provider.
- the mobile station is adapted to receive signals only in a first radio communication system format (i.e. the COMPACT system format), in practice, advantageously the mobile station is adapted also to receive signals in a second radio communication system format (i.e. the GSM/(E)GPRS system format).
- a first radio communication system format i.e. the COMPACT system format
- the mobile station is adapted also to receive signals in a second radio communication system format (i.e. the GSM/(E)GPRS system format).
- the invention can be implemented by minor software changes in the base station and the mobile station to produce the new set of tones, and the ability to detect them respectively. It is foreseen that any existing algorithm implemented in a mobile station for detecting the 67.7 kHz frequency correction burst tone used in the existing GSM system can be modified in a simple manner to also detect the new tones.
- the second modulation scheme should be chosen such that the tone generated by the second modulation scheme has a frequency which is not detected by a mobile station adapted to detect a tone generated by the first modulation scheme.
- the use of the present invention has advantages which are clear from a consideration of the GSM and CONTACT systems.
- the nature of signals borne by received radio frequency carriers i.e. either GSM/(E)GPRS signals or COMPACT signals, and hence the need for logical synchronization on those radio frequency carriers, is known to a mobile station before a synchronization burst decode is attempted.
- the existing GSM mobile stations will not detect COMPACT format signals, thus ensuring full backward compatibility which is highly desirable. This is achieved because the existing GSM mobile stations detect a tone at ⁇ 67.7 Khz and a tone having a frequency of ⁇ 16.9 kHz will not be detected as a frequency correction burst.
- a COMPACT handset can infer the services supported by a COMPACT cell prior to frame synchronization, thus avoiding time penalties incurred should the expected service not be available giving rise to rejection of cell by the mobile station after synchronization.
- the tone contained in the frequency correction burst of the COMPACT system has a frequency generated by 8PSK modulation, and that hence is inherently different from the one used for the GSM/(E)GPRS system, substantial time can be saved on cell selection in the COMPACT system, since an unwanted cell can then be discarded after detection of a frequency correction burst.
- the cell selection time for a COMPACT mobile station could be reduced by ⁇ 120 ms by avoiding at attempt at synchronization with a GSM/(E)GPRS carrier. This could save 4.8 s should the 1900 MHz band contain powerful but non-COMPACT carriers, and potentially 9.6 s should a retry mechanism be implemented.
- a non-capable COMPACT handset trying to select a cell in an environment with COMPACT carriers will not detect a COMPACT signal frequency correction burst implemented in accordance with the invention. More specifically, a non-capable COMPACT handset would see a COMPACT carrier as a regular traffic carrier, rendering the invention backward compatible with previous generation GSM handsets.
- the cell selection time is reduced by ⁇ 50 ms relative to a situation in which a COMPACT carrier is investigated before a successful selection, or up to 100 ms per failed synchronization attempt with a COMPACT carrier should a retry mechanism be implemented.
- cell selection time would be further decreased. For example, if a Class C COMPACT mobile station receives a frequency correction burst indicating that data traffic is not supported, the mobile station can reject that cell after receiving the frequency correction burst without needing to synchronize with the signal and decode it. The cell selection time would then be reduced by an extra ⁇ 720 ms relative to the situation if the advantageous embodiment of the invention were not used.
- the invention enables a COMPACT specific frequency correction burst generated using 8PSK and located at 16.92 kHz offset from the carrier, to distinguish between GSM/(E)GPRS and COMPACT cells.
- the COMPACT-compatible mobile station is provided with information relating to the service capability of the cell enabling undesirable cells to be rejected after the decoding of the frequency correction burst without requiring synchronization with the carrier to establish system information. The time required for synchronization to both GSM/(E)GPRS and COMPACT in an environment with COMPACT carriers is thus minimized for all mobile stations, keeping backward compatibility with previous generation GSM mobile stations.
- the invention also allows a decrease in complexity for the scheduling of synchronization.
