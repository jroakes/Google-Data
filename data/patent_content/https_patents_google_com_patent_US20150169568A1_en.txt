Abstract
A method and apparatus for enabling memory walls is described. The method may include receiving digital image data and location data captured by a mobile device. The method may also include performing image recognition analysis on objects within the digital image data to recognize a physical marking on a surface of an object in the digital image data. The method may also include determining that a recognized physical marking is associated with a digital memory wall based on the recognized physical marking and the location data. The method may also include providing digital media associated with the digital memory wall to the mobile device to be rendered over the surface of the object, where the digital memory wall acts as a digital bulletin board.
Description
- Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of augmenting reality, and more particularly, to enabling digital memory walls.
- Many venues like featuring pictures of their customers, and welcome people writing messages on walls, napkins, etc. One problem associated with this type of patron communication is that there is only a limited amount of space for the messages and notes. Furthermore, old messages and photos may not be relevant to recent patron experiences at the venue.
- Online rating and review service providers enable users to share photos and comments about a venue. A user must first navigate to the service provider's website, or open the service providers corresponding native application. The user must then select the venue from among many possible venues. Finally, a user is able to view or post comments to the service provider's web site. Other users may then navigate to the service provider web site to view the photos, user reviews, etc. The photos and comments at such online service provider web sites, however, are disconnected from the venues that are the subject of the photographs and reviews.
- A method and apparatus for enabling memory walls is described. According to an exemplary method, digital image data and location data captured by a mobile device are received. In one embodiment, image recognition analysis is performed on objects within the digital image data to recognize a physical marking on a surface of an object in the digital image data. In one embodiment, a recognized physical marking is determined to be associated with a digital memory wall based on the recognized physical marking and the location data. In one embodiment, digital media associated with the digital memory wall is provided to the mobile device to be rendered over the surface of the object, where the digital memory wall acts as a digital bulletin board.
- The present invention will be understood more fully from the detailed description given below and from the accompanying drawings of various embodiments of the invention, which, however, should not be taken to limit the invention to the specific embodiments, but are for explanation and understanding only.

It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.
- Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
- It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “receiving”, “performing”, “determining”, “providing”, “querying”, “adding”, “locating”, “filtering”, or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
- The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
- The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram ofexemplary system architecture 100 for enabling digital memory walls. In one embodiment, thesystem 100 includesmobile device 110 andmemory wall server 130. In one embodiment,mobile device 110 may be a binocular wearable computing device as illustrated inFIGS. 7 and 8 , a monocular wearable computing device (i.e., a single eye head mounted display similar to those described inFIGS. 7 and 8 ), as well as a cellular telephone, tablet computer, etc. Thememory wall server 130 may also be a computing device, such as a server computer, desktop computer, etc. - The
mobile device 110 andmemory wall server 130 may be coupled to anetwork 102 that communicates any of the standard protocols for the exchange of information. In one embodiment,mobile device 110 is coupled withnetwork 102 via a wireless connection, such as a cellular telephone connection, wireless fidelity connection, etc. Themobile device 110 andmemory wall server 130 may run on one Local Area Network (LAN) and may be incorporated into the same physical or logical system, or different physical or logical systems. Alternatively, themobile device 110 andmemory wall server 130 may reside on different LANs, wide area networks, cellular telephone networks, etc. that may be coupled together via the Internet but separated by firewalls, routers, and/or other network devices. In yet another configuration, thememory wall server 130 may reside on the same server, or different servers, coupled to other devices via a public network (e.g., the Internet) or a private network (e.g., LAN). It should be noted that various other network configurations can be used including, for example, hosted configurations, distributed configurations, centralized configurations, etc. - The
memory wall server 130 is responsible for providing digital memory walls tomemory wall client 112 ofmobile device 110. In one embodiment, a digital memory wall is similar to a digital bulletin board on which users can post, view, sort, etc. digital memories. In one embodiment, the digital memories may include images, video, audio, text messages, links, or other digital user-created multimedia content. In one embodiment, a digital memory wall is associated with a real-world location, as well as a physical surface at the real world location. As will be discussed below,memory wall system 132 provides the digital memories tomemory wall client 112 to display or render over an image, or field of view, of the physical surface. By displaying the digital media data over the physical surface, memory wall client augments reality and creates a digital bulletin board at the physical location. For example, digital memories (e.g., pictures, video, audio, notes, etc.) associated with a particular digital memory wall may be displayed over an actual wall at a restaurant, thereby connecting digital memories with a real-world location. In one embodiment, the digital memories may be posted to the digital memory wall bymemory wall client 112 ofmobile device 110, as well as other memory wall clients (not shown). - In one embodiment, prior to presenting a digital memory wall to
memory wall client 112,memory wall system 132 atmemory wall server 130 informsmemory wall client 112 that a user of mobile device is proximate to, or within a given distance from, one or more digital memory walls. In one embodiment,memory wall client 112 sends location data associated with the real world location of themobile device 110 tomemory wall system 132. In one embodiment, the location data is global positioning system (GPS) data captured by a sensor ofmobile device 110. In one embodiment,memory wall client 112 may transmit location data tomemory wall system 132 automatically at periodic intervals. In one embodiment,memory wall client 112 may also transmit location data tomemory wall system 132 in response to a user-request to determine whethermobile device 110 is proximate to a digital memory wall. - In one embodiment,
memory wall system 132 utilizes the received location data ofmobile device 110 to query adigital memories database 134. In one embodiment, digital memories database stores digital memories associated with a plurality of digital memory walls. In one embodiment, each digital memory wall stored indigital memories database 134 is associated with a real-world location.Memory wall system 132 uses the received location data to determine whether there are any digital memory walls near the real-world location of themobile device 110. Whenmemory wall system 132 determines thatmobile device 110 is located near a memory wall,memory wall system 132 transmits a notification message tomemory wall client 112. - In one embodiment,
memory wall client 112 receives the notification and activates one or more user interface elements of themobile device 110. In one embodiment,memory wall client 112 informs a user ofmobile device 110 that a digital memory wall is nearby. - In one embodiment, in order to display a memory wall,
memory wall client 112 captures digital images of real-world objects with a digital camera (not shown) of the mobile device. A real-world object may be a person, place, or thing. In one embodiment, the digital images of the real-world objects may include still photographs, digital video, a sequence of digital photographs, a live video feed, etc. In one embodiment,mobile device 110 captures a digital image at the physical location of the digital memory wall. In one embodiment, the digital image captures image data of a physical marking, or identifier, on a physical surface of an object. In one embodiment, the physical marking is associated with a digital memory wall.Memory wall client 112 transmits the digital image, which includes image data for the physical marking, tomemory wall server 130. In one embodiment,memory wall client 112 also transmits a current location data (i.e., GPS data) for themobile device 110 to thememory wall server 130. - In one embodiment,
memory wall system 132 atmemory wall server 130 receives the digital image data and location data from thememory wall client 112. In one embodiment,memory wall system 132 performs one or more image recognition analysis techniques on the received image data to attempt to locate and interpret the physical marking/identifier within the digital image data. In one embodiment, the physical marking is an identifier associated with one or more digital memory walls. In one embodiment, the physical marking may be a symbol, glyph, identification number, word, etc. on a physical surface. In one embodiment, a particular arrangement of physical objects, such as a set of empty picture frames, white squares painted on a wall, or other arrangement of real-world objects may be recognized as a digital memory wall marking/identifier. - In one embodiment, when
memory wall system 132 recognizes the physical marking,memory wall system 132 queries the digital memories database based on the recognized physical marking and the location data provided bymemory wall client 112. In one embodiment,memory wall system 132 utilizes both the location data and physical marking identifier to search for digital memories because digital memory walls are specific to particular physical locations, and particular physical locations may include more than one distinct digital memory walls. In one embodiment, a digital memory wall could be automatically revealed to amemory wall client 112 exploring the world with an augmented reality application. In this embodiment, any physical object, boundaries of a physical wall, item, marking, etc. that is associated with a digital memory wall could reveal itself to thememory wall client 112 when it is within the field of view of the augmented reality application. - In one embodiment,
memory wall system 132 provides one or more located digital memories tomemory wall client 112. In one embodiment,memory wall system 132 may provide additional media data tomemory wall client 112 with the digital memories. For example,memory wall system 132 may provide advertisements or other relevant media content to supplement the located digital memories. In one embodiment, the media data provided by a digital memory wall is curated by the user or entity that created, or is otherwise associated with, the digital memory wall. Thus, the curator, or owner, of a digital memory wall would have authority over the content associated with a digital memory wall, as if the digital memory wall were a physical space. In one embodiment, the authority may include specification of particular media items to be displayed at a digital memory wall, priority between media associated with the digital memory wall, priority between different users that have posted to the digital memory wall, type and frequency of advertisements displayed at a digital memory wall, etc. - In one embodiment,
memory wall client 112 displays the received digital memories over an image of the physical surface as a digital bulletin board. In one embodiment, wheremobile device 110 is a user-wearable computing device (e.g.,FIGS. 7 and 8 ),memory wall client 112 renders the received digital memories over a field of view of a user corresponding to the physical surface of the digital memory wall. - In one embodiment,
memory wall client 112 may then transmit received user requests tomemory wall system 132 for additional digital memories associated with the digital memory wall.Memory wall system 132 queriesdigital memories database 134 for additional digital memories. In embodiment,memory wall system 132 transmits additional digital memories tomemory wall client 112 for display on the digital memory wall. - In one embodiment,
memory wall client 112 may also post new digital memories to a digital memory wall. In one embodiment, digital media data, such as digital images, video, audio, text messages, links, etc. may be transmitted bymemory wall client 112 tomemory wall system 132. In one embodiment, the digital media data may be media data captured bymobile device 110 at the physical location. In one embodiment, the digital media data may be any user-created or user-supplied media data. In one embodiment,memory wall system 132 receives the digital media data, and stores it in thedigital memories database 134 along with an association to the particular digital memory wall. In one embodiment, whenmemory wall client 112 captures and uploads an image to memory wall sever 130,memory wall server 130 utilizes the location data indicative of where the digital image was captured, and automatically adds the digital image to a memory wall proximate to the location data. The proximate digital memory wall may be the closest memory wall to where the digital image was captured, a digital memory wall selected based on user preferences, based on contents of the image, etc. -

In one embodiment,memory wall solicitor 222 causes GPS module to 220 to capture the location data periodically or in response to a user request.Memory wall manager 238 utilizes the location data to querydigital memories database 234 to determine whether there are any digital memory walls proximate to the location data.Memory wall manager 238 transmits results of the query tomemory wall solicitor 222. In one embodiment, whenmemory wall client 212 is proximate to a digital memory wall,memory wall solicitor 222 activates one or more user interface elements of a mobile device. In one embodiment,memory wall solicitor 222 displays a message ondisplay 226, causes a mobile device to vibrate, causes mobile device to sound an alarm, etc. - In one embodiment,
memory wall solicitor 222 periodically, and transparently to a user, transmits location data to memory wall system. In this embodiment,memory wall solicitor 222 only alerts a user whenmemory wall client 212 is determined to be located near a digital memory wall. - In one embodiment,
image capture module 214 of memory wall client is responsible for capturing digital images of real world objects, including physical markings for digital memory walls. The digital images may include still digital photographs, a series of still digital photographs, a recorded video, a live video feed, etc. In one embodiment,image capture module 214 is a digital camera of a mobile device. In one embodiment,memory wall solicitor 222 transmits the captured digital image(s) or video, along with location data, tomemory wall system 232. - In one embodiment,
image recognition engine 240 receives the location and digital image data, and performs one or more image recognition analysis techniques on the image data in an attempt to locate and recognize a physical marking denoting a digital memory wall within the digital image data.Image recognition engine 240 analyzes the digital image to generate one or more digital signatures for real-world objects within the digital image. In one embodiment,image recognition engine 240 calculates a feature vector from pixels of the digital image, where values in the feature vector correspond to relevant pixels within the image. This feature vector then becomes a digital signature for a real-object within the digital image.Image recognition engine 240 utilizes the digital signature to search a digital image index (not shown). Whenimage recognition engine 240 finds a match between the digital signature generated for the digital image, and a digital signature for a digital memory wall identifier (e.g., the physical marking, image, glyph, identification number, etc.)image recognition engine 240 informsmemory wall manager 238. - In one embodiment,

In one embodiment, themethod 300 is performed by a memory wall client and a memory wall system (e.g.,memory wall client memory wall system 132 or 232). - Referring to
FIG. 3 , processing logic begins by capturing location data of a mobile device (processing block 302). In one embodiment, the location data will be utilized by a memory wall system to determine whether the mobile device is located near one or more digital memory walls. In one embodiment, the location data of the mobile device may be captured periodically, in response to a user-generated memory wall proximity request, or automatically and without intervention of a user. Processing logic transmits the location data to a memory wall system (processing block 304). - Processing logic receives the location data (processing block 306) and determines if there is a digital memory wall proximate to the mobile device (processing block 308). In one embodiment, a mobile device may be determined to be proximate to a digital memory wall when the mobile device is within an average range of human visibility to the memory wall, within a preset distance (e.g., within 10 feet, within 100 feet, etc.), etc. When there are no memory walls near a mobile client, the process ends. In one embodiment, as indicated by the dashed line, where a memory wall client has requested to know whether a digital memory wall is nearby, instead of ending, processing logic may transmit a notification indicating that the memory wall client is not near a digital memory wall, consistent with the discussion of processing blocks 310-318 below.
- When processing logic determines that the mobile device is near one or more digital memory walls (processing block 308), processing logic transmits a notification to the client (processing block 310). In one embodiment, the notification indicates that memory wall client is located proximate to at least one digital memory wall. In one embodiment, the notification may also indicate the number of digital memory walls the memory wall client is proximate to, the distance to each digital memory wall, a location of each digital memory wall, a description of the proximate digital memory walls, etc.
- Processing logic receives the memory wall notification data (processing block 316) and initiates one or more memory wall notification on a mobile device (processing block 318). In one embodiment, the notification may cause a mobile device to vibrate, active a ring or chime, cause a visual notification to be displayed via a user interface of a mobile device (e.g., a popup message, text message, application alert, image augmentation, etc.), etc.
- In one embodiment, notification that a user is near a digital memory wall enables the user to attempt to locate and/or capture digital image data of the physical surface associated with the digital memory wall. Where a user is using a wearable computing device, the notification may inform the user to pan their field of view until they are looking at the physical surface associated with the digital memory wall. In one embodiment, the notification may further augment the field of view of the user to illustrate the location of the digital memory wall, or illustrate the digital memory wall itself.

In one embodiment, the digital signature is a feature vector extracted from the digital image of the real-world object and provides a unique identification of the real-world object. Processing logic determines if an identifier for a memory wall is recognized within the digital image data (processing block 408). In one embodiment, the identifier is a physical marking, such as a specific image, word, glyph, PIN, etc. on the surface of an object within the image data.
- When no memory wall identifiers are recognized, the process ends. However, when one or more memory wall identifiers are recognized, processing logic searches a digital memories database for digital memories based on the location data and the identifier (processing block 410). As discussed above, digital memories may include user-posted photos, videos, audio, links, etc. associated with the digital memory wall. The digital memories may be relevant to a physical location where the digital memory wall is located.
- Processing logic filters located digital memories based on one or more factors (processing block 412). In one embodiment, processing logic may locate a large number of digital memories. Thus, processing logic filters the number of digital memories based on various factors, such as when the digital memory was posted to a digital memory wall, the type of media data in the digital memory, available bandwidth for transferring the digital memories, etc. Processing logic then transmits one or more digital memories to the memory wall client (processing block 414). In one embodiment, processing logic may also transmit one or more advertisements along with the digital memories.
- Processing logic at the memory wall client renders received digital memories over digital image data of a physical surface (processing block 416). In one embodiment, the digital memories are rendered based on instructions by the memory wall client, based on a determined configuration of the surface, based on one or more preferences of the memory wall client, etc. In one embodiment, the digital memories are rendered as a digital bulletin board of user images, video, audio, notes, advertisements, etc. In one embodiment, where the processing logic is being executed in a wearable computing device, the solicitation for and display of digital memories associated with a digital memory wall may occur automatically, and without intervention of a user. In the embodiment, processing logic automatically augments the reality of a user by rendering digital memory all data over a field of view of a user, such digital memory wall notifications, display of digital memories, etc.
- In one embodiment, processing logic then receives a user request for additional memories (processing block 418). In one embodiment, the request may include one or more factors to be applied to filter available digital memories. Processing logic transmits the request to memory wall system (processing block 420), and processing logic at the memory wall system searches digital memories database for additional memories associated with the identified digital memory wall (processing block 422).
- In one embodiment, the process ends when memory wall client, such as may be run on a mobile computing device, user wearable computing device, etc., closes. In another embodiment, the process ends when memory wall client ceases to capture digital image data of, or ceases to direct the camera at, the physical surface of a digital memory wall.
