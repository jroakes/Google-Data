Definitions
- the invention relates to a method and an apparatus for a speech coding algorithm, in particular for a code excited linear predictive (CELP) coding algorithm.
- CELP algorithms are utilised in two-way voice communications, e.g. between a base station and a mobile station in a cellular system.
- a method for a CELP algorithm includes the steps of pre-processing a sampled speech s ⁇ n ⁇ in a signal pre-processor so as to output at least a noise filtered speech output vector and a channel noise estimate, model parameter estimation of the noise filtered speech output vector so as to output a prediction residual and a long term prediction gain, encoding the prediction residual so as to output an adaptive codebook vector including an index of impulse response functions of a filter and a vector gain, and formatting the encoded speech packets.
- the CELP algorithm was found to provide good speech quality at intermediate bit rates, that is 4800 or 9600 bps.
- the vector quantization of the excitation signal requires an extremely high computational effort.
- Several suggestions have been made for speeding up the vector quantization including the use of overlapping codebook vectors.
- CELP Code excited linear predictive
- the spectral envelope of the speech signal is described by a filter of which the coefficients are obtained using the linear prediction technique.
- the coefficients are quantized so that the filter can be constructed on both the transmitter and the receiver side.
- the filter coefficients are determined by an analysis-by-synthesis procedure.
- a set of such candidate excitation sequences or vectors is stored in a codebook.
- the index of the vector producing the most accurate speech is transmitted to the receive end of the channel.
- the input speech on the transmitter side is regained on the receiver side by synthetic speech that is generated using the vector of which the index has been transmitted.
- the main task is to find an optimum vector in the codebook which describes most accurately the input speech.
- Fast vector quantization and excellent synthetic speech quality makes the CELP algorithms attractive for speech coding applications.
- the implementation of the CELP algorithm in a spread spectrum digital system is described in the IS-127 Standard “Enhanced Variable Rate Codec, Speech Service Option 3 for Wideband Spread Spectrum Digital Systems”, Apr. 19, 1996, Section 4.5.7, “Computation of the algebraic CELP Fixed Codebook Contribution”.
- the codebook utilised in this standard is a fixed codebook with an algebraic codebook (ACELP) structure.
- the ACELP codebook is searched by minimising the mean-squared error (MSE) between the weighted input speech and the weighted synthesis speech.
- MSE mean-squared error
- C k is the correlation of the impulse response and the perceptual domain target signal and E k is the energy or covariance of the impulse response of the codebook vector, both at position k.
- the codebook vector is a series of unit pulses, each pulse being at an appropriate position in the codebook and having an appropriately chosen sign.
- the pulse signs are pre-set (outside the closed loop search) by considering the sign of an appropriate reference signal. Amplitudes are pre-set by setting the amplitude of a pulse at a position equal to the sign of the reference signal at that position. With this “new” components a modified correlation C k ′ and a modified energy E k ′ is calculated.
- the optimum pulse positions are determined using an efficient non-exhaustive analysis-by-synthesis search technique.
- T k is tested for a small percentage of position combinations using an iterative “depth-first” tree search strategy.
- the “new” codebook vector is built as a series of unit pulses, each pulse being at a “new” position in the codebook.
- T k C k 2 E k
- the computation of the minimising function is very time consuming and necessitates a large number of computation cycles.
- the fixed codebook search method as proposed in the IS-127 Standard assumes a linear search for pulse positions in each track and requires 1144 calculations.
- the evaluation of T k includes a division operation that augments considerably the complexity of the algorithm.
- the need for improved efficiency of a fast multi-pulse coding algorithm for speech residuals on frames with a constant length is met by the present invention.
- the method and apparatus according to the present invention provide for a fast convergence of the algorithm such that the optimum vector may be searched for more efficiently than with the prior art.
- the basic idea underlying the invention is the decomposition of the task of finding an optimum codebook vector into two sub-tasks:
- the method according to the invention permits to reduce the multidimensional multi-extremum non-linear task of searching for optimum coding pulse positions of a discrete source signal to an optimum extremum search task with a multidimensional square form that is minimised sequentially for every pulse. This decreases essentially the computation time and provides a higher coding accuracy.
- x is a source discrete signal (perceptual domain target signal vector)
- h is a special function (impulse response of the filter)
- a is an experimentally determined weighting coefficient
- N is a subframe length
- FIGS. 1 a and 1 b are flow charts of a particular implementation of the invention incorporating a particular application of an approximation strategy for the gain evaluation;
- FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a computer hardware implementation of the invention.
- MSE is a mean square error of deviation of the fixed codebook search target vector, x w , from the fixed codebook contribution in a subframe
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, in dB, with the modified (shifted) original speech signal, s w , used as a processed signal and the difference between it and the reconstructed signal, with the aid of adaptive and fixed codebooks, considered as a noise
- mean SNR is an SNR averaged on a speech fragment and computed as a mean SNR value for all frames transmitted at a rate of 9600 bps and at a rate of 4800 bps, named Rate 1 and Rate 1 ⁇ 2, respectively.
- All p(j) are distributed over 5 tracks T 0 . . . T 4 .
- Three of the tracks are allocated 2 of the 8 non-zero pulses each, two of the tracks are allocated 1 of the 8 pulses each.
- the two tracks with 1 pulse each are cyclically adjacent to each other, i.e. track 3 and track 4 may contain 1 pulse each, track 4 and track 0 may contain 1 pulse each and so on.
- N is a subframe size
- the function being minimised is a non-linear 9-order function having in general more than one extremum.
- the restrictions form a non-linear boundary of the area of permissible solutions so that the number of local extrema is additionally increased and the search for a global extremum becomes even more complicated.
- the search for a real minimum of the MSE of the encoding of a discrete signal obtained by subtracting the adaptive codebook output from the modified (shifted with respect to the RCELP-algorithm) original residual may thus be unsuccessful.
- the first step in the method according to the invention is the calculation of the gain.
- This gain calculation is shown in FIG. 1 a .
- the energy X of the pre-processed speech signal is calculated in step 103 .
- the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are determined.
- a first diagonal element ⁇ ((i,i) is calculated, namely ⁇ ( 1 , 1 ). It is stored in a memory for later purposes, step 105 .
- the value ⁇ ((i,i) is added to a value A so as to yield eventually the trace of the covariance matrix:
- ⁇ is a coefficient which is to be adapted to the speech residual and A is a mere and temporary substitute for the trace of the covariance matrix of the subframe under consideration.
- the first embodiment relies—save for the discrete source signal and the subframe length—exclusively on the covariance of the first diagonal term in the covariance matrix, i.e. on ⁇ ( 1 , 1 ).
- This first term of the covariance matrix is “expanded” by multiplication with N, the subframe length, and is then compared to the mean squared source signal X.
- the first pulse contains up to 70% of information.
- the first pulse is a main candidate for the g c calculation. Since, however, the value of g c exceeds the optimal value, if it is determined on the first pulse only, more pulses are taken into account.
- g ci is the gain g c for i-th pulse
- k is the number of pulses for the g c determination
- a is the weighting coefficient of the first pulse.
- the influence of the covariance of the impulse response functions is taken into account.
- g c is the gain that was determined in the gain calculation sequence above.
- the correlation of speech residual and impulse response function d j (i) is calculated (step 110 ) and a variable F′ for temporarily storing the currently best value of the maximised criterion F is reset.
- the fixed codebook structure restrictions are checked, and if they are violated the procedure branchs to step 117 .
- the covariance terms ⁇ (i,i) are retrieved from the memory which were calculated in the course of the gain-computation above.
- an estimate function F is calculated in step 113 .
- step 117 it is checked whether or not all sample positions in a subframe are estimated. If not the procedure proceeds after the query in step 117 at step 111 with an incremented i (step 118 ).
- the search procedure checks at step 120 whether or not the evaluation of all vector components is completed. If so the procedure of finding the optimum codevector is finished for the subframe under consideration and at step 121 the packet is formatted for the transmission to the receiver side of the channel. If the evaluation of the vector components is not yet completed the procedure proceeds after the query in step 120 at step 110 with an incremented j (step 119 ).
- the method according to the invention has several advantages over the prior art:
- the vector 1/ ⁇ (i,i) needs only be calculated once per subframe.
- the computational effort of the search procedure for an optimum vector is significantly reduced.
- the number of non-diagonal elements in a covariance array ⁇ (i,j) to be calculated is reduced to seven rows (out of 54) of the covariance array; it is not necessary to calculate all non-diagonal rows of the covariance array ( 54 ) as with the prior art.
- the number of cycles of the criterion calculation is restricted to the number of pulses multiplied by the subframe length (e.g.
- the inventors found an increase of the mean SNR value of up to 0.7 dB with the method according to the invention for the most part of test speech fragments. Further, the computational complexity was found to be smaller by factor 2-3 than with the prior art algorithm implementations. This was attributed to the successive search of the code vector components with the recursive calculation (correction) of the vector d j (i), i 1 . . . N, before searching for each component.
- the real gain corresponding to the code vector found can be computed (as in IS-127) instead of using the calculated g c . This slightly improves the synthesised speech quality, but requires some additional computational efforts.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a hardware implementation of the present invention.
- a computer program for the implementation of the present invention may be stored in a program memory 202 which is preferably a ROM.
- Other memory 211 RAM
- RAM RAM
- source discrete signal energy (X) and gain (g c ) are necessary for temporarily storing the values of correlation terms (d j (i)), covariance terms ( ⁇ (p(i,i) and ⁇ (p(i);p(j)) ), source discrete signal energy (X) and gain (g c ).
- the ALU 203 the calculations of the various formulas above are performed where the status register 204 indicates the status of the ALU 203 to other components. All components of the hardware implementation are coupled through a data bus 210 . The result of the search for the optimum vector is also output via the data bus 210 .
- the rate was not considered because it does not affect the computations of gain and optimum codebook vector according to the invention.
- the rate is determined in accordance with the noise on the channel and with the signal energy estimate.
