Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to providing automated recommendations, and more particularly to a system and method of providing automated recommendations to a group based on comparisons of object characteristics.
- Individuals can make choices from a set of objects according to the individual's own preferences. However, when groups of individuals are working together to choose an object from a set of objects, reaching agreement or consensus among the group is difficult because the individuals have different preferences. For example, a group of individuals working together to select a restaurant can have difficulty reaching an agreement on a particular restaurant as a result of different dining preferences by the individuals in the group.
- One approach to providing an object recommendation for a group is to use algorithms to produce acceptable recommendations in the face of heterogeneous preferences provided by individuals in the group.
- algorithms can have difficulty achieving a group ranking of objects while also meeting a specified set of criteria, such as allowing for all the individual preferences of a group and providing for non-dictatorship of a single individual in the group.
- collaborative filtering technology and other recommender systems have been developed that generally make recommendations to individuals based on past preferences and behavior of the individuals and based on the preferences and behaviors of others.
- collaborative filtering technology generally makes recommendations based on one individual's preferences and not the preferences of a group.
- collaborative filtering technology typically requires a body of existing information about the preferences or behavior of users before making a recommendation.
- collaborative filtering technology generally makes group recommendations based on user preferences between the objects themselves as opposed to preferences between characteristic traits of the objects.
- One exemplary aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of providing a recommendation to a group of at least one object from a plurality of candidate objects.
- the method includes identifying, with a computing device, a plurality of keywords associated with the plurality of candidate objects and providing a plurality of selection queries to each of a plurality of users in the group. Each of the plurality of selection queries requires a user to select one or more of the plurality of keywords based on user preferences.
- the method further includes receiving a response to each of the plurality of selection queries from the plurality of users; and generating, with the computing device, a ranking score for each of the plurality of candidate objects based on the responses to the plurality of selection queries.
- exemplary aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems, apparatus, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces and devices for providing a group recommendation of an object based on user comparisons of object characteristics.
- FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary system for providing group recommendations according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure
- FIGS. 2-5 depict exemplary user interfaces for providing group recommendations according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure
- FIGS. 6A and 6B depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure
- FIG. 7 depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method for generating a ranking score based on user responses to selection queries according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 8 depicts an exemplary computing environment for implementing the systems and methods according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.
- the present disclosure is directed to a system and method for making a recommendation of an object(s), such as a restaurant, movie, or other object, from a set of candidate objects to a group of users based on user comparisons of characteristic traits of the candidate objects.
- a “characteristic trait” of an object can be a descriptive aspect or feature associated with the object, but does not include the name of the object or the object itself.
- the object(s) recommended to the group can be selected to best suit the preferences of the group as a whole, as opposed to individual users in the group.
- the group decision capability of the present disclosure can be used by a group of users to assist a user in selecting an object from a plurality of candidate objects.
- a group recommendation provided in accordance with the present disclosure can be used to assist a group of users in selecting, for instance, a restaurant, a movie, or other object for the group.
- a user that is part of a group faced with selecting an object can request that a host system initiate a group decision session for the group.
- the user can also request that other members of the group be invited to participate in the group decision session.
- the users can interact with the host system using client devices, such as smartphones, tablets, mobile devices, computers, or other devices in communication with the host system.
- a host system can identify a plurality of keywords associated with characteristic traits of the plurality of candidate objects. For instance, the host system can access a data store storing information associated with the candidate objects and extract keywords associated with characteristic traits of the candidate objects.
- the keywords can be terms, clauses, phrases, or other words associated with descriptive features or aspects of the candidate objects.
- Example keywords associated with characteristics traits of restaurants can include, “fine dining,” “quiet atmosphere,” “great meatballs,” “Mexican cuisine,” “casual atmosphere,” “dim lighting,” “Japanese fusion,” “famous eggplant,” “vegetarian,” “rude staff,” or other suitable keywords associated with characteristic traits of restaurants.
- the host system can identify keywords from a data store storing information associated with the candidate objects, such as reviews, comments, blogs, web pages, and other information associated with the candidate objects.
- the plurality of keywords can be presented to the users in the group as a series of selection queries.
- the selection queries can be presented in a suitable user interface presented on display of a device accessed by a user.
- the selection queries can require the users to compare two or more of the keywords and to select or rank the keywords based on user preferences. For instance, in one implementation, the selection queries can require the users to select between one of two keywords as part of a pairwise decision. An example pairwise decision can require a user to select between the keywords “vegetarian” and “dim lighting.” In another implementation, the selection queries can require users to rank a plurality of keywords. For instance, a selection query can require a user to rank the keywords “famous eggplant,” “rude staff,” and “fine dining.” The keywords can be selected for presentation to the users at random and/or based on the number of candidate objects associated with the keywords
- the host system can present a series of selection queries to the users of the group until a condition is satisfied. For instance, the host system can present a series of selection queries until the host system has enough information to provide a recommendation. Alternatively or in addition, the host system can present a series of selection queries until the host system has received a predetermined number of responses to the selection queries or until a predetermined amount of time has elapsed.
- the host system can generate a ranking score for each of the candidate objects based on the responses to the selection queries.
- the ranking score can be generated using any suitable ranking algorithm that assigns ranks based on the user responses to the selection queries. For instance, when a user selects a keyword as part of a selection query, that keyword can receive a point value, such as one point. In turn, all of the candidate objects associated with that keyword can also receive a point value. The point value for each candidate object can then be summed and used to generate a ranking score for the candidate object.
- Candidate objects with the higher ranking scores can then be presented to the user as recommendations to the group. For instance, one or more restaurants, movies, or objects can be recommended to the group. The group can then rely on the recommendation(s) in selecting an object from the plurality of candidate objects.
- users can be granted veto power over the recommendations so that a user can veto a recommendation in cases where the recommended object is simply not suitable for the user.
- the subject matter of the present disclosure can assist a group of users in selecting a candidate object, such as a restaurant, movie, or other object, from a plurality of candidate of objects.
- a candidate object such as a restaurant, movie, or other object
- the cognitive load on individuals making the group decision can be reduced.
- members of the group can consider responding to the selection queries as a fun game that can build social cohesion among the group.
- the systems and methods for providing group recommendations according to aspects of the present disclosure can reduce interpersonal disagreements during the selection process while increasing the speed and likelihood of consensus on selecting an object.
- the group recommendation(s) can also be provided without knowledge or information of a user's past behavior or general preferences.
- the recommendation(s) can be generated based on quick bootstrapping of user preferences as provided in response to the selection queries. This allows the group recommendation(s) to support dynamically changing contexts (e.g. the group is not in the usual location) and ephemeral preferences (e.g. a member of the group generally likes Mexican food, but not tonight).

- the method ( 300 ) will be discussed with reference to the computer-implemented system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the method ( 300 ) can be implemented using any suitable computer implementation.
- FIG. 6 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods discussed herein are not limited to any particular order or arrangement.
- One skilled in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that various steps of the methods can be omitted, rearranged, combined and/or adapted in various ways.
- the method includes initiating a group decision session.
- the group recommendation platform 110 of FIG. 1 can initiate a group decision session in response to a request to initiate a group decision session received from a user.
- the group recommendation platform 100 can assign the group decision session a unique session id.
- a plurality of users to participate in the group decision session can be identified at ( 304 ).
- the group recommendation platform 110 of FIG. 1 can identify users that are members of a group and establish communication with devices associated with the identified users. The users can be identified based on invitations specified in the request to initiate the group decision session.
- the group recommendation platform 110 can send the invitations to the invited users and can identify users that have accepted invitations as participants of the group decision session.
- the group recommendation platform 110 can also identify users that have joined the group decision session using other suitable techniques, such as by identifying a particular group decision session by unique session id or by instantly joining a group session using a proximity detection system.
- the method includes identifying a plurality of candidate objects for the group decision session.
- the plurality of candidate objects will serve as the base set from which the group recommendation(s) will be selected.
- the plurality of candidate objects can be identified based on user settings, such as user setting specifying the type of candidate object and specifying constraints for the plurality of candidate objects.
- the group recommendation platform 110 can identify a plurality of candidate objects based on the type of candidate object (e.g. restaurant, movie, or other object) provided in the request to initiate the group decision session.
- the group recommendation platform 110 can identify a plurality of candidate objects satisfying location constraints specified by a user, such as constraints requiring the candidate objects to be within a specified radius of a particular location.
- the plurality of candidate objects can also be identified based on other user settings and/or constraints, such as time constraints, reservation availability, price limits, etc.
- a plurality of keywords associated with the plurality of candidate objects are identified at ( 308 ).
- the keyword module 112 can access information associated with the plurality of candidate objects, such as web pages, comments, reviews, and other information, stored in a data store 140 and extract keywords associated with characteristic traits of the candidate objects.
- the keywords can be identified using any suitable keyword extraction technique.
- the keyword module 112 can scan information stored in the data store 140 to identify keywords associated with one or more of the plurality of candidate objects.
- the associations between an identified keyword and one or more of the plurality of candidate objects can be maintained for purposes of implementing a ranking algorithm to rank the candidate objects based on user preferences between the keywords.
- the method includes generating a plurality of selection queries. For instance, keywords identified by the keyword module 112 can be passed to the selection query module 114 that will use the keywords to generate a plurality of selection queries for presentation to members of a group. Each of the plurality of selection queries can require a user to select or rank one or more keywords based on user preferences. In one implementation, the keywords can be selected for a selection query module at random to enhance user interaction with the group recommendation module. In particular, user experience can be improved by presenting selection queries to the user with humorous random combinations of keywords.
- the keywords can be selected based on the number of candidate objects associated with a particular keyword. For instance, keywords that are associated with either a relatively large or, in alternative implementation, a relatively small number of candidate objects, can be selected more often for inclusion in a selection query.
- a weighting value can be assigned to a keyword based on the number of candidate objects associated with the keyword. The keyword can be selected to be used as part of a selection query based on the weighting value.
- the selection queries are provided to the plurality of users participating in the group decision session at ( 312 ).
- the group recommendation platform 110 can communicate the selection queries to devices associated with members of the group over a network.
- the same or different sets of selection queries can be provided to the different members of the group.

- the users can respond to the selection queries by identifying or ranking the keywords presented in each selection query based on user preferences.
- Responses to the selection queries are received at ( 314 ).
- the group recommendation platform 110 can receive responses to the selection queries from the group recommendations modules 120 over a network.
- the method determines whether a condition is satisfied. For instance, the group recommendation platform 110 can provide and receive responses to a series of selection queries to the users of the group until a condition is satisfied. In one implementation, the condition is satisfied when the group recommendation platform 110 has enough information to provide a recommendation. In other implementations, the condition can be satisfied after the expiration of a period of time or after a predetermined number of responses to the selection queries has been received. If the condition is not satisfied, the method continues to provide selection queries to users ( 312 ) and receive responses to the selection queries ( 314 ) until the condition is satisfied.
- the method includes generating ranking scores for each of the plurality of candidate objects based on the responses to the selection queries as shown at ( 318 ) of FIG. 6B .
- the group recommendation platform 110 can implement the group recommendation engine 116 to generate ranking scores for each of the plurality of candidate objects. Any suitable ranking algorithm can be used that ranks the plurality of candidate objects based on user preferences of keywords associated with the candidate objects.
- FIG. 7 depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method ( 320 ) that can be used to generate ranking scores for the plurality of candidate objects based on user responses to the selection queries according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.
- the method ( 320 ) can be implemented using any suitable computer implementation, such as the group recommendation engine 116 implemented by the group recommendation platform 110 of FIG. 1 .
- a point value is assigned to keywords based on user responses to the selection queries. For instance, each time a user selects a keyword in response to a selection query, the keyword can be assigned one point. Different point values can be assigned based on the responses to the selection query. For instance, if the selection queries require a user to rank keywords, the keywords can be assigned different point values based on the rankings provided by the user.
- candidate objects associated with each of the keywords are identified.
- the candidate objects can be identified based on associations between candidate objects and keywords identified during keyword extraction.
- the point values assigned to each keyword are assigned to all candidate objects associated with the keyword. For example, if the keyword “fine dining” is associated with fifteen different candidate objects, the point value assigned to the keyword “fine dining” is assigned to each of the fifteen different candidate objects.
- the point values assigned to each candidate object are tallied to determine the total value for each candidate object.
- the total point value for each candidate object is based on the point values assigned to all keywords associated with the candidate object.
- a ranking score for the candidate object can be generated from the total point value ( 330 ).
- the ranking score can be equal to the total point value assigned to the candidate object or can be determined based on a weighting algorithm or other suitable algorithm as a function of the total point value associated to the candidate object.
- the method can determine recommendation(s) based on the ranking scores.
- the group decision engine 114 of the group recommendation platform 110 can determine one or more candidate objects of the plurality of candidate objects to recommend to the group.
- the recommendation(s) can be determined by identifying the candidate object(s) with the highest ranking scores.
- the recommendation(s) are provided to the plurality of users at ( 334 ).
- the group recommendation platform 110 provides the recommendations to devices 130 associated with members of the group over a network.
- the group recommendations can be presented to the users in a suitable user interface. Any suitable number of recommendations can be identified and provided to the members of the group without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, in one implementation, only one group recommendation is identified and provided to the group. In other implementations, multiple group recommendations can be identified. Multiple group recommendations can be presented in a user interface in order of ranking score to facilitate the decision making process by the group.
- the method includes determining whether a veto decision has been made for a recommended object by a member of the group. For instance, the group recommendation platform 110 can determine whether it has received a veto decision from a user. If so, the object subject to the veto decision can be removed from the plurality of candidate objects for the group decision session ( 338 ). The method can then determine new recommendations based on the ranking scores ( 332 ) and provide the new recommendations to the group ( 334 ). Otherwise, a notification can be sent to the group indicating that the group recommendation is complete ( 340 ). For instance, the group recommendation platform 110 can send a notification to members of the group notifying the members of the group that the group recommendation process is complete. The members of the group can then make a decision based on the group recommendation(s).

Abstract
Systems and methods for determining a group recommendation of an object, such as a restaurant, movie, or other object, from a plurality of candidate objects based on user comparisons of characteristic traits of the candidate objects are provided. In particular, keywords associated with characteristic traits are identified. The keywords are then presented to members of the group as a series of selection queries. The selection queries require a user to select or rank the keywords based on user preferences. The responses to the selection queries are used to generate a ranking score for each of the plurality of candidate objects and to select one or more of the candidate objects to recommend to the group.
Description
- This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/728,257 filed on Nov. 20, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
- The present disclosure relates generally to providing automated recommendations, and more particularly to a system and method of providing automated recommendations to a group based on comparisons of object characteristics.
- Individuals can make choices from a set of objects according to the individual's own preferences. However, when groups of individuals are working together to choose an object from a set of objects, reaching agreement or consensus among the group is difficult because the individuals have different preferences. For example, a group of individuals working together to select a restaurant can have difficulty reaching an agreement on a particular restaurant as a result of different dining preferences by the individuals in the group.
- One approach to providing an object recommendation for a group is to use algorithms to produce acceptable recommendations in the face of heterogeneous preferences provided by individuals in the group. However, algorithms can have difficulty achieving a group ranking of objects while also meeting a specified set of criteria, such as allowing for all the individual preferences of a group and providing for non-dictatorship of a single individual in the group.
- Collaborative filtering technology and other recommender systems have been developed that generally make recommendations to individuals based on past preferences and behavior of the individuals and based on the preferences and behaviors of others. However, collaborative filtering technology generally makes recommendations based on one individual's preferences and not the preferences of a group. In addition, collaborative filtering technology typically requires a body of existing information about the preferences or behavior of users before making a recommendation. Finally, collaborative filtering technology generally makes group recommendations based on user preferences between the objects themselves as opposed to preferences between characteristic traits of the objects.
- Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.
- One exemplary aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of providing a recommendation to a group of at least one object from a plurality of candidate objects. The method includes identifying, with a computing device, a plurality of keywords associated with the plurality of candidate objects and providing a plurality of selection queries to each of a plurality of users in the group. Each of the plurality of selection queries requires a user to select one or more of the plurality of keywords based on user preferences. The method further includes receiving a response to each of the plurality of selection queries from the plurality of users; and generating, with the computing device, a ranking score for each of the plurality of candidate objects based on the responses to the plurality of selection queries.
- Other exemplary aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems, apparatus, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces and devices for providing a group recommendation of an object based on user comparisons of object characteristics.
- These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.
- A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode thereof, directed to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, in which:
-
FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary system for providing group recommendations according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; -
FIGS. 2-5 depict exemplary user interfaces for providing group recommendations according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; -
FIGS. 6A and 6B depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; -
FIG. 7 depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method for generating a ranking score based on user responses to selection queries according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; and -
FIG. 8 depicts an exemplary computing environment for implementing the systems and methods according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. - Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
- Generally, the present disclosure is directed to a system and method for making a recommendation of an object(s), such as a restaurant, movie, or other object, from a set of candidate objects to a group of users based on user comparisons of characteristic traits of the candidate objects. As used herein, a “characteristic trait” of an object can be a descriptive aspect or feature associated with the object, but does not include the name of the object or the object itself. The object(s) recommended to the group can be selected to best suit the preferences of the group as a whole, as opposed to individual users in the group. The group decision capability of the present disclosure can be used by a group of users to assist a user in selecting an object from a plurality of candidate objects. For instance, a group recommendation provided in accordance with the present disclosure can be used to assist a group of users in selecting, for instance, a restaurant, a movie, or other object for the group.
- More particularly, a user that is part of a group faced with selecting an object, such as restaurant, movie, or other object, can request that a host system initiate a group decision session for the group. The user can also request that other members of the group be invited to participate in the group decision session. The users can interact with the host system using client devices, such as smartphones, tablets, mobile devices, computers, or other devices in communication with the host system.
- Once the group decision session has been initiated, a host system can identify a plurality of keywords associated with characteristic traits of the plurality of candidate objects. For instance, the host system can access a data store storing information associated with the candidate objects and extract keywords associated with characteristic traits of the candidate objects. The keywords can be terms, clauses, phrases, or other words associated with descriptive features or aspects of the candidate objects. Example keywords associated with characteristics traits of restaurants can include, “fine dining,” “quiet atmosphere,” “great meatballs,” “Mexican cuisine,” “casual atmosphere,” “dim lighting,” “Japanese fusion,” “famous eggplant,” “vegetarian,” “rude staff,” or other suitable keywords associated with characteristic traits of restaurants. The host system can identify keywords from a data store storing information associated with the candidate objects, such as reviews, comments, blogs, web pages, and other information associated with the candidate objects.
- After a plurality of keywords associated with characteristic traits of the candidate objects have been identified, the plurality of keywords can be presented to the users in the group as a series of selection queries. The selection queries can be presented in a suitable user interface presented on display of a device accessed by a user. The selection queries can require the users to compare two or more of the keywords and to select or rank the keywords based on user preferences. For instance, in one implementation, the selection queries can require the users to select between one of two keywords as part of a pairwise decision. An example pairwise decision can require a user to select between the keywords “vegetarian” and “dim lighting.” In another implementation, the selection queries can require users to rank a plurality of keywords. For instance, a selection query can require a user to rank the keywords “famous eggplant,” “rude staff,” and “fine dining.” The keywords can be selected for presentation to the users at random and/or based on the number of candidate objects associated with the keywords
- The host system can present a series of selection queries to the users of the group until a condition is satisfied. For instance, the host system can present a series of selection queries until the host system has enough information to provide a recommendation. Alternatively or in addition, the host system can present a series of selection queries until the host system has received a predetermined number of responses to the selection queries or until a predetermined amount of time has elapsed.
- Once the host system has received a number of responses to the selection queries from the members of the group, the host system can generate a ranking score for each of the candidate objects based on the responses to the selection queries. The ranking score can be generated using any suitable ranking algorithm that assigns ranks based on the user responses to the selection queries. For instance, when a user selects a keyword as part of a selection query, that keyword can receive a point value, such as one point. In turn, all of the candidate objects associated with that keyword can also receive a point value. The point value for each candidate object can then be summed and used to generate a ranking score for the candidate object.
- Candidate objects with the higher ranking scores can then be presented to the user as recommendations to the group. For instance, one or more restaurants, movies, or objects can be recommended to the group. The group can then rely on the recommendation(s) in selecting an object from the plurality of candidate objects. In one implementation, users can be granted veto power over the recommendations so that a user can veto a recommendation in cases where the recommended object is simply not suitable for the user.
- In this manner, the subject matter of the present disclosure can assist a group of users in selecting a candidate object, such as a restaurant, movie, or other object, from a plurality of candidate of objects. By relying on user responses to a plurality of selection queries involving random characteristic traits of the candidate objects, the cognitive load on individuals making the group decision can be reduced. Indeed, members of the group can consider responding to the selection queries as a fun game that can build social cohesion among the group. In this way, the systems and methods for providing group recommendations according to aspects of the present disclosure can reduce interpersonal disagreements during the selection process while increasing the speed and likelihood of consensus on selecting an object.
- The group recommendation(s) can also be provided without knowledge or information of a user's past behavior or general preferences. The recommendation(s) can be generated based on quick bootstrapping of user preferences as provided in response to the selection queries. This allows the group recommendation(s) to support dynamically changing contexts (e.g. the group is not in the usual location) and ephemeral preferences (e.g. a member of the group generally likes Mexican food, but not tonight).

FIG. 1 depicts an overview ofexemplary system 100 for providing a recommendation of an object, such as a restaurant, movie, or other object, from a plurality of candidate objects according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. Thesystem 100 can be implemented using any suitable computing environment, such as the computing environment depicted inFIG. 8 . Thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 includes agroup recommendation platform 110 that can be used to generate a group recommendation of an object for agroup 50 according to exemplary aspects of the present disclosure. Thegroup recommendation platform 110 can be hosted by a server, such as a web server. A member of thegroup 50 can interact with thegroup recommendation platform 110 using agroup decision module 120 implemented on acomputing device 130 accessible by the member of thegroup 50, such as a laptop, desktop, mobile device, smartphone, tablet, PDA, or other computing device, that is in communication with thegroup recommendation platform 110, for instance, over a network. - It will be appreciated that the term “module” refers to computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. Thus, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, application specific circuits, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. In one embodiment, the modules are program code files stored on the storage device, loaded into memory and executed by a processor or can be provided from computer program products, for example computer executable instructions, that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as RAM, ROM, hard disk or optical or magnetic media.
- More particularly, a
user 52 can interact with agroup decision module 120 to send a request to initiate a group decision session to thegroup recommendation platform 100. For instance, theuser 52 can interact with a suitable user interface implemented by thegroup decision module 120 that allows for the creation and the joining of a group. Theuser 52 can send invitations to other users, such asusers group recommendation platform 110 to invite the users to join the group decision session. Whileuser 52 is not illustrated as being a part ofgroup 50 inFIG. 1 , those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand thatuser 52 can be a part of or separate from thegroup 50 without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. -
FIG. 2 depicts anexemplary user interface 200 that can be presented touser 52 to allow theuser 52 to initiate a group decision session and invite users to join the group according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. Theuser interface 200 can includefields 202 to allow the user to select the type of candidate object for the group decision session, such as restaurant, movie, or other type of candidate object. Theuser interface 200 can also include other fields to allow the user to select various selection criteria for the group decision session. For instance, theuser interface 200 includes alocation field 204 and aradius field 206 so that a user can specify location settings to restrict the set of candidate objects to objects within a specified radius of the specified location. The specified location can be manually entered by the user in thefield 204. Alternatively, the specified location can be based on position data optionally provided by the user indicative of the current position of the user as determined by, for instance, a positioning system, such as a GPS system or other suitable positioning system. Theuser 52 can have control over how the position data is used by thegroup recommendation platform 110. - The defined radius can be manually entered or selected from a list in
field 206. The defined radius can also be a default condition that does not have to be specified every instance by the user. Other suitable fields/inputs can be provided in theuser interface 200 to allow the user input selection criteria for the group decision session. For instance, fields can be provided to allow the user to specify time restrictions, such as movie time restrictions, price limits, etc. - Referring still to
FIG. 2 , theuser interface 200 can include afield 208 that allows the user to invite other users to join the group. The user can manually input the other users into thefield 208 or contact information, social network information, or other information, associated with the user can be accessed and presented to the user as candidates to join the group. The user can then select which of the contacts the user desires to invite to join the group. The user can complete the request to initiate the group session by interacting (e.g. clicking or tapping) with the initiate groupsession control tool 210. - In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or make use of personal information, such as position information or contact information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect the information (e.g. the user's contact information, information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preference or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the
group recommendation platform 110 or other application that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data can be treated in or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identify may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's location can be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to city, ZIP code, or other level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined Thus, the user can have control over how information is collected about the user and used by thegroup recommendation platform 110 or other application. - Referring back to
FIG. 1 , thegroup decision platform 110 can initiate the group decision session in response to the request from theuser 52 and assign the group decision session a unique session identifier. Thegroup decision platform 110 can then invite specified users to join the group. In one example, thegroup decision platform 110 can send invitations to the specified users, 54, 56, and 58 to join the group decision session. Theusers - Once several users, such as
users group recommendation platform 110 can identify a set of candidate objects based on the settings input by theuser 52. For instance, as discussed above, thegroup recommendation platform 110 can access candidate object information stored in thedata store 140 and identify a set of candidate object within a specified radius of a location specified by or associated with theuser 52 and that satisfy other constraints specified by theuser 52. - After the plurality of candidate objects have been identified, the
group recommendation platform 110 can implement akeyword module 112 to identify keywords associated with the plurality of candidate objects. In particular, thekeyword module 112 can access thedata store 140 of candidate object information and extract keywords associated with characteristic traits of the candidate objects. For instance, thekeyword module 112 can access comments, reviews, blogs, web pages, and other information associated with the candidate objects and extract keywords associated with characteristic traits of the plurality of candidate objects from the information. - Any suitable keyword extraction technique can be used by the
keyword module 112 to identify the plurality of keywords associated with characteristics traits of the candidate objects. For instance, the information stored in thedata store 140 can be analyzed using data mining techniques to identify specific predefined keywords in the information stored in thedata store 140. The predefined keywords can be a set of typical keywords associated with the type of candidate objects. For example, a set of typical keywords associated with characteristics traits restaurants can be predefined or collected. The set of typical keywords can include many thousands of keywords that can be associated with characteristic traits of restaurants. Information associated with candidate restaurants, such as web pages, blogs, reviews, etc., can be searched using thekeyword module 112 to identify any of the predefined set of keywords in the information. The identified keywords can be extracted and used in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. - The plurality of identified keywords can be passed to a
selection query module 114 which generates a plurality of selection queries for presentation tousers selection query module 114 selects two or more keywords to be used as part of each selection query. The keywords can be selected at random or can be based on any suitable factor, such as the number of candidate objects associated with the particular keyword. - The selection queries can be provided to
computing devices 130 associated with theusers users group recommendation module 120. In one example, the selection queries can require a user to select one of two keywords as part of a pairwise decision. In another example, the selection queries can require a user to rank two or more keywords. Theusers -
FIG. 3 depicts anexemplary user interface 212 presenting a selection query that requires a user to select one of two keywords as part of a pairwise decision. Theuser interface 212 can presentunique session identifier 214 including descriptive information associated with the group decision session in theuser interface 212. The user interface can also presenttools 216 allowing a user to select between one of two keywords or to “pass” in response to the selection query. In the example depicted inFIG. 3 , the selection query requires the user to select between “fine dining” and “eggplant.” A user can select either “fine dining” or “eggplant” based on user preferences. If the user has no preference, the user can elect to “pass.” Theuser interface 212 can presentadditional information 218 to the user such as total votes and amount of time elapsed during the group decision session. -
FIG. 4 depicts anexemplary user interface 220 presenting a selection query that requires a user to rank three keywords. Similar to theexemplary user interface 212, theuser interface 220 can present theunique session identifier 214 andadditional information 218 such as total votes and amount of time elapsed during the group decision session. In addition, theuser interface 220 includes aranking tool 222 that allows the user to rank a plurality of keywords. In the example depicted inFIG. 4 , theranking tool 222 allows the user to rank the keywords “fine dining,” “egg plant,” and “dim lighting” based on user preferences. Theranking tool 222 can be any suitable interface for ranking the keywords. For instance, theranking tool 222 can allow the user to manipulate the order of the keywords in a stack presented in the ranking tool. - Referring back to
FIG. 1 , the selection queries can be presented to theusers group recommendation platform 110 can present a series of selection queries until thegroup recommendation engine 116 has enough information to provide a recommendation. Alternatively or in addition, thegroup recommendation platform 110 can present a series of selection queries until thegroup recommendation platform 110 has received a predetermined number of responses to the selection queries or until a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. - The
group recommendation platform 110 can receive the responses to the selection queries and generate group recommendation(s) based on the responses using thegroup recommendation engine 116. In particular, thegroup recommendation engine 116 can assign ranking scores to the candidate objects based on the responses to the selection queries using any suitable ranking algorithm. The candidate object(s) with the highest ranking scores can be provided to thecomputing devices 130 associated withusers - The group recommendation(s) can be presented to the
users group recommendation module 120.FIG. 5 depicts anexemplary user interface 224 for presenting a group recommendation to theusers group 50. Similar to theuser interface 212, theuser interface 220 can present theunique session identifier 214 andadditional information 218 such as total votes and amount of time elapsed during the group decision session. In addition, theuser interface 224 can present thegroup recommendation 226 as well as additional information associated with thegroup recommendation 226, such as amapping tool 228 providing the location of thegroup recommendation 226 relative to members of the group. A user can interact with thegroup recommendation 226 to obtain additional information, such as a web page, comments, blogs, and other information associated with thegroup recommendation 226. - The
user interface 224 can also include aveto tool 230 to allow a user to veto the group recommendation. For instance, a user displeased with thegroup recommendation 226 can interact with theveto tool 230 to veto thegroup recommendation 226. Thegroup recommendation platform 110 ofFIG. 1 can receive the veto decision and remove the candidate object subject to the veto decision from the plurality of candidate objects. Thegroup recommendation platform 110 can then provide an alternative group recommendation to thegroup 50. -
FIGS. 6A and 6B depict a flow diagram of an exemplary method (300) of generating a group recommendation according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The method (300) will be discussed with reference to the computer-implementedsystem 100 ofFIG. 1 . However, the method (300) can be implemented using any suitable computer implementation. In addition, althoughFIG. 6 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods discussed herein are not limited to any particular order or arrangement. One skilled in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that various steps of the methods can be omitted, rearranged, combined and/or adapted in various ways. - At (302), the method includes initiating a group decision session. For instance, the
group recommendation platform 110 ofFIG. 1 can initiate a group decision session in response to a request to initiate a group decision session received from a user. Thegroup recommendation platform 100 can assign the group decision session a unique session id. - A plurality of users to participate in the group decision session can be identified at (304). The
group recommendation platform 110 ofFIG. 1 , for instance, can identify users that are members of a group and establish communication with devices associated with the identified users. The users can be identified based on invitations specified in the request to initiate the group decision session. Thegroup recommendation platform 110 can send the invitations to the invited users and can identify users that have accepted invitations as participants of the group decision session. Thegroup recommendation platform 110 can also identify users that have joined the group decision session using other suitable techniques, such as by identifying a particular group decision session by unique session id or by instantly joining a group session using a proximity detection system. - At (306), the method includes identifying a plurality of candidate objects for the group decision session. The plurality of candidate objects will serve as the base set from which the group recommendation(s) will be selected. The plurality of candidate objects can be identified based on user settings, such as user setting specifying the type of candidate object and specifying constraints for the plurality of candidate objects. For example, the
group recommendation platform 110 can identify a plurality of candidate objects based on the type of candidate object (e.g. restaurant, movie, or other object) provided in the request to initiate the group decision session. As another example, thegroup recommendation platform 110 can identify a plurality of candidate objects satisfying location constraints specified by a user, such as constraints requiring the candidate objects to be within a specified radius of a particular location. The plurality of candidate objects can also be identified based on other user settings and/or constraints, such as time constraints, reservation availability, price limits, etc. - A plurality of keywords associated with the plurality of candidate objects are identified at (308). For instance, the
keyword module 112 can access information associated with the plurality of candidate objects, such as web pages, comments, reviews, and other information, stored in adata store 140 and extract keywords associated with characteristic traits of the candidate objects. The keywords can be identified using any suitable keyword extraction technique. For instance, thekeyword module 112 can scan information stored in thedata store 140 to identify keywords associated with one or more of the plurality of candidate objects. The associations between an identified keyword and one or more of the plurality of candidate objects can be maintained for purposes of implementing a ranking algorithm to rank the candidate objects based on user preferences between the keywords. - At (310), the method includes generating a plurality of selection queries. For instance, keywords identified by the
keyword module 112 can be passed to theselection query module 114 that will use the keywords to generate a plurality of selection queries for presentation to members of a group. Each of the plurality of selection queries can require a user to select or rank one or more keywords based on user preferences. In one implementation, the keywords can be selected for a selection query module at random to enhance user interaction with the group recommendation module. In particular, user experience can be improved by presenting selection queries to the user with humorous random combinations of keywords. - Alternatively or in addition, the keywords can be selected based on the number of candidate objects associated with a particular keyword. For instance, keywords that are associated with either a relatively large or, in alternative implementation, a relatively small number of candidate objects, can be selected more often for inclusion in a selection query. In particular, a weighting value can be assigned to a keyword based on the number of candidate objects associated with the keyword. The keyword can be selected to be used as part of a selection query based on the weighting value.
- The selection queries are provided to the plurality of users participating in the group decision session at (312). For instance, the
group recommendation platform 110 can communicate the selection queries to devices associated with members of the group over a network. The same or different sets of selection queries can be provided to the different members of the group. The selection queries can be presented to the members of the group using a suitable user interface. The users can respond to the selection queries by identifying or ranking the keywords presented in each selection query based on user preferences. Responses to the selection queries are received at (314). For instance, thegroup recommendation platform 110 can receive responses to the selection queries from thegroup recommendations modules 120 over a network. - At (316), the method determines whether a condition is satisfied. For instance, the
group recommendation platform 110 can provide and receive responses to a series of selection queries to the users of the group until a condition is satisfied. In one implementation, the condition is satisfied when thegroup recommendation platform 110 has enough information to provide a recommendation. In other implementations, the condition can be satisfied after the expiration of a period of time or after a predetermined number of responses to the selection queries has been received. If the condition is not satisfied, the method continues to provide selection queries to users (312) and receive responses to the selection queries (314) until the condition is satisfied. - Once the condition is satisfied, the method includes generating ranking scores for each of the plurality of candidate objects based on the responses to the selection queries as shown at (318) of
FIG. 6B . For instance, thegroup recommendation platform 110 can implement thegroup recommendation engine 116 to generate ranking scores for each of the plurality of candidate objects. Any suitable ranking algorithm can be used that ranks the plurality of candidate objects based on user preferences of keywords associated with the candidate objects. -
FIG. 7 depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method (320) that can be used to generate ranking scores for the plurality of candidate objects based on user responses to the selection queries according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The method (320) can be implemented using any suitable computer implementation, such as thegroup recommendation engine 116 implemented by thegroup recommendation platform 110 ofFIG. 1 . - At (322), a point value is assigned to keywords based on user responses to the selection queries. For instance, each time a user selects a keyword in response to a selection query, the keyword can be assigned one point. Different point values can be assigned based on the responses to the selection query. For instance, if the selection queries require a user to rank keywords, the keywords can be assigned different point values based on the rankings provided by the user.
- At (324), candidate objects associated with each of the keywords are identified. The candidate objects can be identified based on associations between candidate objects and keywords identified during keyword extraction. At (326), the point values assigned to each keyword are assigned to all candidate objects associated with the keyword. For example, if the keyword “fine dining” is associated with fifteen different candidate objects, the point value assigned to the keyword “fine dining” is assigned to each of the fifteen different candidate objects.
- At (328), the point values assigned to each candidate object are tallied to determine the total value for each candidate object. In this way, the total point value for each candidate object is based on the point values assigned to all keywords associated with the candidate object. A ranking score for the candidate object can be generated from the total point value (330). The ranking score can be equal to the total point value assigned to the candidate object or can be determined based on a weighting algorithm or other suitable algorithm as a function of the total point value associated to the candidate object.
- Referring back to
FIG. 6B at (332), once the ranking score for the candidate objects have been generates, the method can determine recommendation(s) based on the ranking scores. For instance, thegroup decision engine 114 of thegroup recommendation platform 110 can determine one or more candidate objects of the plurality of candidate objects to recommend to the group. The recommendation(s) can be determined by identifying the candidate object(s) with the highest ranking scores. - The recommendation(s) are provided to the plurality of users at (334). For instance, the
group recommendation platform 110 provides the recommendations todevices 130 associated with members of the group over a network. The group recommendations can be presented to the users in a suitable user interface. Any suitable number of recommendations can be identified and provided to the members of the group without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, in one implementation, only one group recommendation is identified and provided to the group. In other implementations, multiple group recommendations can be identified. Multiple group recommendations can be presented in a user interface in order of ranking score to facilitate the decision making process by the group. - At (336), the method includes determining whether a veto decision has been made for a recommended object by a member of the group. For instance, the
group recommendation platform 110 can determine whether it has received a veto decision from a user. If so, the object subject to the veto decision can be removed from the plurality of candidate objects for the group decision session (338). The method can then determine new recommendations based on the ranking scores (332) and provide the new recommendations to the group (334). Otherwise, a notification can be sent to the group indicating that the group recommendation is complete (340). For instance, thegroup recommendation platform 110 can send a notification to members of the group notifying the members of the group that the group recommendation process is complete. The members of the group can then make a decision based on the group recommendation(s). -
