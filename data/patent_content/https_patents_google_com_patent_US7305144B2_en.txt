Definitions
- the invention relates generally to the field of computer image processing, and more particularly to systems and methods for compressing the dynamic range of an image.
- High dynamic range (“HDR”) images are becoming increasingly common in a number of applications.
- a HDR image of a scene can be generated by conventional computer graphics techniques.
- a HDR image of a scene can also be constructed from a series of photographs taken by an image capture device of the scene at different shutter speeds or under different lighting conditions. Typically, the various photographs taken at different shutter speeds, for example, will reveal different details of the objects in the scene.
- the photographs can be combined to provide a single image that can contain details of the various objects in the scene that may be visible in one or more, but not necessarily all, of the photographs, and which has a relatively high dynamic range of luminance, that is, the brightness at respective points in the image. It is not unreasonable to expect that, in the not too distant future, image capture devices may be developed that have the capability of capturing HDR images.
- HDR images since conventional computer video display or other output devices, such as monitors, printers, and the like have a much lower dynamic range than the HDR images. For example, using one or more of various techniques, it is possible to produce an HDR image with a dynamic range of on the order of 25,000:1, whereas the dynamic range of a typical display monitor is on the order of 100:1. Accordingly, in order to display such an HDR image on a conventional output device, it would be necessary to compress the dynamic range of the image to accommodate the capabilities of the particular output device or devices that are to be used for outputting the image.
- mappings (ii) adaptive, or spatially variant, mappings.
- Spatially invariant mapping methodologies generally map the luminance values such that two pixels in an HDR image that have the same value, are mapped to the same value for use with the output device.
- adaptive mapping methodologies may provide different values based on the characteristics of the HDR image. In both cases, the methodologies also take into account the characteristics of the particular target output device or devices that will be used for the resulting image, which will be referred to as a low-dynamic-range (“LDR”) image.
- LDR low-dynamic-range
- Spatially invariant mapping methodologies are typically simpler to implement since, once a mapping has been developed using the global characteristics of the HDR image and the characteristics of the target output device(s), the LDR image can generally be generated using, for example, look-up tables.
- Several spatially invariant mapping methodologies have been developed. Some methodologies scale, either in a linear manner or a non-linear manner, the dynamic range of the HDR image to provide the LDR image. Linear scaling is relatively simple to carry out, and it preserves relative contrasts in a perfect fashion, but a severe loss of visibility of elements of the image can occur, particularly if the output device's dynamic range is significantly lower than the dynamic range of the image.
- Other spatially invariant mapping methodologies make use of histograms or gamma correction to develop mappings.
- each point in an image I of a scene can be represented by the product of a reflectance function R and an illuminance function L.
- the reflectance function for the image is commonly referred to as the intrinsic image of the scene.
- the largest luminance variations in an HDR image come from the illuminance function, since in the real world reflectances are unlikely to create large contrasts.
- the LDR image can be generated by separating the image I into its R and L components, compressing the L component to provide a compressed illuminance L′, and generating the LDR image I′ as the product of R and L′. In principle, this should provide an LDR image in which contrasts between highly illuminated areas and areas in deep shadows in the HDR image are reduced, while leaving contrasts due to texture and reflectance undistorted.
- the logarithm of L and the logarithm of R can be separately exponentiated, to provide the assumed illumination and reflectance functions L and R, which can be processed as described above.
- subjecting the logarithm of I to high-pass filtering, followed by exponentiation, can achieve simultaneous dynamic range compression and local contrast enhancement.
- the invention provides a new and improved system and method for compressing the dynamic range of an image.
- the invention makes use of the observation that the human visual system is not as sensitive to the absolute luminances reaching the eye, as to local changes in the ratios of the intensities, and further that the human visual system reduces the effect of large global differences, which may be associated with differences in illumination over the scene.
- the invention further makes use of the observation that drastic changes in the luminance of an image gives rise to gradients in the luminance of large magnitudes at some scale. On the other hand, fine details, such as textures, have luminances with much lower gradients.
- a system in accordance with invention identifies large gradients at various scales, and attenuates their magnitudes, while leaving the directions of the gradients unchanged.
- the attenuation is progressive, so as to reduce relatively high gradients more than somewhat lower gradients.
- a system in accordance with the invention preserves fine details by increasing relatively low gradients, also in a progressive manner. The result is to compress the gradients.
- Such a system converts the compressed gradients into an image whose luminance has a lower dynamic range (an LDR image) relative to the dynamic range of the luminance of the original image.
- the invention provides a gradient domain compression system for generating, from an input image having a high luminance dynamic range, an output image having a lower luminance dynamic range.
- the system comprises a gradient image generator module, a gradient compression module, and an output image generator module.
- the gradient image generator module is configured to generate, from the input image, a gradient image representing, for respective points of the input image, gradient values in the luminance of the input image.
- the gradient compression module is configured to receive the gradient image and generate a compressed range gradient image in which the range of gradient values are compressed.
- the output image generator module is configured to receive the compressed range gradient image and to generate therefrom an image, the image generated by the output image generator module comprising the output image.
- the gradient compression module comprises a gradient attenuation function generator module and an attenuated image gradient generator module.
- the a gradient attenuation function generator module is configured to generate, for respective points in the gradient image, a gradient attenuation function whose value for respective points in the gradient image is configured to reduce the range of gradient values in the gradient image.
- the attenuated image gradient generator module is configured to generate, from the gradient image and the gradient attenuation function, the compressed range gradient image.
- the gradient attenuation function generator module is configured to generate the gradient attenuation function in relation to a Gaussian pyramid defining gradient values at various resolution levels.
- FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a gradient domain HDR compression system constructed in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a gradient domain high-dynamic-range (“HDR”) compression system 10 constructed in accordance with the invention.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system 10 receives a HDR image and generates therefrom a low-dynamic-range (“LDR”) image that can be accommodated by an output device such as, for example, a video display, a printer or other output device.
- LDR low-dynamic-range
- the gradient domain HDR compression system 10 is designed with reference to two general observations.
- the human visual system is not as sensitive to the absolute luminances reaching the eye, as to local changes in the ratios of the intensities, and further that the human visual system reduces the effect of large global differences, which may be associated with differences in illumination over the scene.
- drastic changes in the luminance of an image gives rise to gradients in the luminance of large magnitudes at some scale.
- fine details, such as textures have luminances with much lower gradients.
- the invention identifies large gradients at various scales, and attenuates their magnitudes, while leaving the directions unchanged. The attenuation is progressive, so as to reduce relatively high gradients more than somewhat lower gradients.
- the compressed gradients are converted into an image that has a dynamic range (an LDR image) whose luminance is compressed relative to the dynamic range of the luminance of the original image
- the gradient domain HDR compression system 10 includes an input image receiver module 1 , an input image preprocessor module 12 , a preprocessed image gradient generator module 13 , a gradient attenuation function generator module 14 , an attenuated gradient image generator module 15 , a low dynamic range (“LDR”) image generator module 16 , and an image post-processor module 17 , all under control of a control module 18 . Details of the operations performed by each of the modules will be described below.
- the input image module 11 receives an input HDR image from an HDR image source (not shown).
- the HDR image may be generated by any convenient methodology, or it may be generated by any image capture device. In any case, after receiving the HDR image, the input image receiver module 11 couples the HDR image to the input image preprocessor module 12 .
- the input image preprocessor module 12 performs two operations. If the input HDR image is a color image, the input image extracts the luminance information and color channel information for the various color channels comprising the input HDR image. The luminance information and the color channel information may be used by the image post-processor module 17 , as will be described below.
- the luminance information defines a “luminance channel HDR input image,” irrespective of the colors that may comprise the image.
- the input image preprocessor module 12 generates from the luminance channel HDR input image a preprocessed input image that is the logarithm of the luminance channel HDR input image.
- an image comprises an array of elements, which are generally referred to as pixels, that are arranged in a plurality of rows and columns.
- each array element comprises a value that defines the luminance channel HDR input image at the respective location in the image.
- the input image preprocessor module 12 In generating the preprocessed input image, the input image preprocessor module 12 generates an array having elements arranged in the same number of rows and columns as the luminance channel HDR input image, with array element containing a value that corresponds to the logarithm of the value in the corresponding array element of the array that defines the luminance channel HDR input image.
- the value in array element H(x,y) corresponds to the logarithm of the value in array element M(x,y).
- the input image preprocessor module 12 may use any convenient logarithm base.
- the preprocessed image gradient generator module 13 After the input image preprocessor module 12 has generated the preprocessed input image array H, it will provide the preprocessed input image array H to the preprocessed image gradient generator module 13 .
- the preprocessed image gradient generator module 13 generates a gradient array that represents the gradients of the values in the array defining the preprocessed input image that it received from the input image preprocessor module 12 .
- the gradient array which will be referred to as “ ⁇ H,” has an array of elements arranged in the same number of rows and columns as the preprocessed input image array H, with each array element ⁇ H(x,y) containing two values that together serve to define the gradient of the luminance at location (x,y) in the preprocessed input image array H.
- the values correspond to the horizontal and vertical components of the gradient at the respective location (x,y).
- the processed image gradient generator module 13 After the processed image gradient generator module 13 has generated the gradient array ⁇ H, it will provide the gradient array ⁇ H to both the gradient attenuation function generator module 14 and the attenuated gradient image generator module 15 .
- the gradient attenuation function generator module 14 generates a gradient attenuation function, which will be referred to as “ ⁇ ,” which will be used to attenuate the values in the array elements comprising the gradient array ⁇ H.
- the gradient attenuation function comprises an array having a plurality of array elements arranged the same number of rows and columns as the gradient array ⁇ H.
- Each array element ⁇ (x,y) contains an attenuation value that will be used to attenuate the values in the corresponding array element ⁇ H(x,y) of the gradient array ⁇ H.
- the gradient attenuation function generator module 14 generates the attenuation values so that relatively large gradients are reduced and relatively small gradients are increased, with the reduction or increase being performed in a progressive manner. That is, for the gradients that are to be reduced, larger gradients will be reduced more than smaller ones. Similarly, for the gradients that are to be increased, lower gradients will be increased more than smaller ones. This serves to compress, or decrease the range of, the values of the gradients in the gradient array ⁇ H, which, as will be described, serves to provide a reduction in the dynamic of the image that is generated by the gradient domain HDR compression system 10 .
- the gradient attenuation function generator module 14 After the gradient attenuation function generator module 14 has generated the gradient attenuation function ⁇ , it will provide the gradient attenuation function ⁇ to the attenuated gradient image generator module 15 .
- the attenuated gradient image generator module will use both the gradient attenuation function ⁇ and the gradient array ⁇ H to generate an attenuated gradient array, which will be referred to as G.
- the attenuated gradient array comprises a plurality of array elements arranged in the same number of rows and columns as the gradient array ⁇ H.
- Each array element G(x,y) contains two values, corresponding to the values of the horizontal and vertical components of the gradient in the corresponding array element ⁇ H(x,y) of the gradient array ⁇ H, both of which are attenuated according to the attenuation value in the corresponding location ⁇ (x,y) in the gradient attenuation function ⁇ .
- the attenuated gradient image generator module 15 After the attenuated gradient image generator module 15 has generated the attenuated gradient array G, it will provide the attenuated gradient array G to the low dynamic range (“LDR”) image generator module 16 .
- the LDR image generator module 16 performs two operations. Initially, it will receive the attenuated gradient array G and generate therefrom an LDR image array, which will be referred to as I.
- the LDR image array comprises a plurality of array elements arranged in the same number of rows and columns as the attenuated gradient array G. Each array element I(x,y) contains a value that corresponds to the luminance of the LDR image.
- the dynamic range of the luminance values in the LDR image array I will be reduced from the dynamic range of the luminance channel HDR input image “M.”
- the exponentiated LDR image array I E comprises a plurality of array elements arranged in the same number of rows and columns as the LDR image array. Each array element I E (x,y) receives a value that corresponds to the value in the corresponding location of the array element I(x,y) in the LDR image array I, exponentiated using any convenient base.
- the LDR image generator module 16 After the LDR image generator module 16 has generated the exponentiated LDR image array I E , it will provide the array I E to the image post-processor module 17 .
- the image post-processor module 17 will receive the exponentiated LDR image array I E and perform several operations. First, if the original HDR image was a color image and the LDR image is also to be a color image, the image post-processor module can make use of the exponentiated LDR image array I E and color channel information that it receives from the input image pre-processor module 12 to generate a color LDR image array I C .
- the color LDR image array I C comprises a plurality of array elements arranged in the same number of rows and columns as the LDR image array I.
- Each array element I C (x,y) contains a plurality of values, each associated with one of the color channels. Typically, three color channels are used, one each for colors red, blue, and green, although it will be appreciated that both other colors may be used, and the number of color channels may differ from three.
- the image post-processor module 17 will use the color channel information for the respective colors and the values in the array elements I E (x,y) to generate values for the various color channels for the respective array elements I C (x,y) of the color LDR image array I C .
- the image post-processor module 17 can scale and shift the values in the color LDR image array I C , or the exponentiated LDR image array I E if the LDR image is not to be a color image, to accommodate requirements and limitations of the specific output device that is to be used to output the LDR image.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system described above in connection with FIG. 1 generates a LDR image from a HDR image by adjusting the gradients of the luminance in the HDR image, generally reducing the gradients in regions in which the gradients in the HDR image are relatively high, and increasing the gradients in regions in which the gradients in the HDR image are relatively low.
- the reduction or increase is performed in a progressive manner.
- H(x,y) corresponds to the preprocessed input image H described as being generated by the image pre-processor module 12 .
- G(x,y) corresponds to the attenuated gradient image G described as being generated by the attenuated gradient image generator module 15 .
- the gradient domain HDR compression system uses G(x,y) defined above to determine the LDR image, as follows. If I (which corresponds to the LDR image array I described above as being generated by the LDR image generator module 16 ) defines the logarithm of the LDR image that is to be generated, the gradient domain HDR compression system can determine I by performing a search to determine the function whose gradient field is closest to G in the least-squares sense, that is:
- equation (3) is a partial differential equation in “I.” Substituting the definition for “F” as given above into equation (3), the following equation is obtained:
- equation (6) defines the LDR image, which is a function of “I,” in terms of “G.”
- G(x,y) is defined in terms of “H(x,y),” which, in turn, represents the logarithm of the luminance of the original HDR image
- the luminance of the LDR image is obtained by exponentiating I (which is described as being also performed by the LDR image generator module 16 ).
- Equation (6) can be solved numerically, to obtain “I,” using any of a number of techniques.
- a technique used by one embodiment of the gradient domain HDR compression system will be described below in connection with equations (10) through (12).
- G(x,y) is also defined in terms of the gradient attenuation function ⁇ (x,y).
- the gradient attenuation function preferably reduces relatively large gradients, and increases relatively low gradients, while doing so on a progressive basis. This will provide, for example, in the case of reduction of relatively large gradients, a larger reduction for larger gradients than smaller gradients. Contrariwise, in the case of increasing relatively low gradients, it will provide a larger increase for smaller gradients than larger gradients.
- each pixel at location (i,j) in the level “k” can be generated from a plurality of pixels (m,n) in the previous “k ⁇ 1” level, for example, as follows
- w(m,n) represents a Gaussian weighting kernel, which can be provided to affect the contribution of various pixels in the 5 pixel-by-5 pixel window around the pixel at location (2i,2j) in the image H k ⁇ 1 at level (k ⁇ 1).
- the Gaussian pyramid defined by equation (7) will provide the image defined by H k to have one-fourth the resolution as the image defined by H k ⁇ 1 . It will further be appreciated that the difference in resolution as between levels in the Gaussian pyramid is determined by the coefficients for “i” and “j” on the right-hand side of equation (7); different differences in resolution as between levels of a Gaussian pyramid can be used with appropriate selections of the respective coefficients.
- the size and shape of the window can also differ from the one in equation (7) by modifying the range of “m” and/or “n.”
- the gradient domain HDR compression system After the gradient domain HDR compression system has generated the Gaussian pyramid, at each level “k” the gradients are determined using central differences, and a scaling factor ⁇ k (x,y) is generated for each pixel based on the magnitude of the gradient ⁇ H k (x,y) at that point.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system generates the scaling factor ⁇ k (x,y) as follows
- ⁇ k ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ H k ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ H k ⁇ ( x , y ) ⁇ ⁇ ) ⁇ , ( 8 )
- ⁇ H k (x,y) ⁇ represents the magnitude of the gradient at the pixel at location (x,y) in the “k-th” level
- ⁇ and ⁇ are parameters to be determined.
- the gradient attenuation function ⁇ (x,y) will reduce the magnitude of relatively large gradients, and increase the magnitude of relatively small gradients.
- the parameter “ ⁇ ” determines the magnitude at which the gradient will remain unchanged.
- the parameter “ ⁇ ” determines the direction in which the magnitudes will be changed. If the value of parameter “ ⁇ ” is selected to be strictly greater than “zero” and less than “one” (0 ⁇ 1), and also if the value of parameter “ ⁇ ” is strictly greater than zero (0 ⁇ ), equation (8) will provide that, if the value of ⁇ H k (x,y) ⁇ is greater than the value of “ ⁇ ,” the value of the scaling factor ⁇ k (x,y) will be less than “one.” On the other hand if the value of ⁇ H k (x,y) ⁇ is less than the value of “ ⁇ ,” the value of the scaling factor ⁇ k (x,y) will greater than “one.” Finally, if the value of ⁇ H k (x,y) ⁇ equal to the value of “ ⁇ ,” the value of the scaling factor ⁇ k (x,y) will be “one.” Preferably, the value of parameter ⁇ is selected as a function of the average of the magnitudes of the gradients at each level. In one embodiment, satisfactory results were
- the first line in equations (9) indicates that the gradient attenuation function ⁇ d (x,y) at the highest level “d” in the Gaussian pyramid, that is, the level associated with the lowest resolution, corresponds to the scaling factors ⁇ d (x,y) that were generated for that level.
- the last line in equations (9) indicates that the final gradient attenuation function ⁇ (x,y), which will be used generating G(x,y) as described above in connection with equation (1), is the gradient attenuation function ⁇ 0 (x,y) that is generated for the lowest “zero-th” level in the Gaussian pyramid, which corresponds to the level associated with the highest resolution.
- the middle line in equations (9) indicates that, at each level “k” in the Gaussian pyramid, other than the highest level “d,” the gradient domain HDR compression system generates the gradient domain function using the set of scaling factors ⁇ k (x,y) generated for that level and the gradient domain function ⁇ k+1 that was generated for the next higher level “k+1,” using an “upsampling operator” “L” for the gradient domain function ⁇ k+1 .
- the upsampling operator L essentially relates elements of the array comprising the gradient domain function ⁇ k+1 to the elements of the array comprising set of scaling factors ⁇ k (x,y) that was generated for level “k.”
- the array comprising the set of scaling factors ⁇ k (x,y) that was generated for level “k” will also have four times the number of elements as the array comprising the gradient attenuation function ⁇ k+1 generated for level “k+1.”
- the upsampling operator L provides linear interpolation, so that
- the upsampling operator L provides the value of element (i,j) of the gradient attenuation function ⁇ k+1 (x,y) of level k+1;
- the upsampling operator L provides the linear interpolation between values of adjacent elements (i,j) and (i ⁇ 1,j) in the same row of the gradient attenuation function ⁇ k+1 (x,y) of level k+1;
- the upsampling operator L provides the linear interpolation between values of adjacent elements (i,j) and (i,j ⁇ 1) in the same column of the gradient attenuation function ⁇ k+1 (x,y) of level k+1.
- G(x,y) is generated for each pixel in the HDR image using the gradient ⁇ H(x,y) and the gradient attenuation function ⁇ ( ⁇ H ⁇ ). Since only the gradient attenuation function ⁇ ( ⁇ H ⁇ ) is generated in a multiple-resolution manner, only the gradients ⁇ H(x,y) at the finest resolution, namely that associated with level zero, will be manipulated. This allows the gradient domain HDR compression system to avoid halo artifacts in the LDR image, which can occur if different resolution levels are manipulated separately.
- equation (6) is a partial differential equation, its solution, up to an additive term, can be determined in part by specifying the boundary conditions.
- the particular value that is selected for the additive constant is generally unimportant, since the gradient domain HDR compression system can shift and scale the final LDR image to fit the limitations of the particular output device that will be used to display, print or otherwise output the LDR image.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system generates the approximations of the divergence of “G” using backward finite differences as follows: divG ( x,y ) ⁇ G x ( x,y ) ⁇ G x ( x ⁇ 1 ,y )+ G y ( x,y ) ⁇ G y ( x,y ⁇ 1) (12) where G x (x,y) and G x (x ⁇ 1,y) are the “x” components of G at points (x,y) and (x ⁇ 1,y), respectively, and G y (x,y) and G y (x,y ⁇ 1) are the “y” components of G at points (x,y) and (x,y ⁇ 1), respectively.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system has been described as using “forward finite differences” in approximating values for ⁇ I x (x,y) and ⁇ I y (x,y) (that is, generating ⁇ I x (x,y) as I(x+1,y) ⁇ I(x,y), and so forth, as described above in connection with equation (11)), and “backward finite differences” in approximating the values for div G(x,y) (that is, using G x (x,y) and G x (x ⁇ 1,y) and so forth, as described above in connection with equation (12)), it will be appreciated that the gradient domain HDR compression system may also use forward finite differences in approximating the values for div G(x,y) and backward finite differences in approximating the values for ⁇ I x (x,y) and ⁇ I y (x,y).
- the gradient domain HDR compression system use the different finite differences for approximating the values for div G(x,y), on the one hand, and the values for ⁇ I x (x,y) and ⁇ I y (x,y), on the other hand, since that is consistent with the central finite difference scheme used to approximate the value for the Laplacian.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system may use a forward or a backward finite difference scheme in approximating both the values for div G(x,y) and ⁇ I x (x,y) and ⁇ I y (x,y).
- the gradient domain HDR compression system will use the approximated values for G(x,y) generated using equation 12, along with equation (10) to establish a system of linear equations that will then be solved to generate approximate values for each I(x,y).
- Each pixel at location (x,y) in the LDR image will be associated with an equation, and so the system of equations will be relatively large for an image with a large number of pixels, but each of the pixels will only be associated with five unknown values as noted on the right-hand side of equation (10) above.
- the boundary conditions are used in connection with pixels on the boundary.
- I( ⁇ 1,y) ⁇ I(0,y) 0, in which case the right-hand side of equation (10) reduces to I(1,y)+I(0,y+1)+I(0,y ⁇ 1) ⁇ 3I(0,y), for pixels that are not also along the upper and lower boundary.
- the boundary condition is used in connection with pixels along other boundaries in a similar manner.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system After the gradient domain HDR compression system has established the system of linear equations as described above, it can solve the system to generate values for I(x,y) using any convenient methodology.
- One such methodology is the so-called Full Multi-grid Algorithm, described in W. Press, et al., Numerical Recipes in C, The Art of Scientific Computing, (Cambridge University Press, 1992), particularly pages 868, et seq., using Gauss-Seidel smoothing, which is described elsewhere in Numerical Recipes.
- Other methodologies known to those skilled in the art may also be employed.
- each value is the logarithm of the value of the luminance L(x,y) of the pixel at location (x,y) in the LDR image, and, to generate the value of the luminance L(x,y), the gradient domain HDR compression system will exponentiate the value I(x,y).
- the gradient domain HDR compression system operates to compress the gradients in the luminance of the HDR image.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system can use the luminance values L(x,y) to further generate color pixel values for the various color channels using any convenient methodology.
- the gradient domain HDR compression system generates values for the various color channels in accordance with
- C LDR ⁇ ( x , y ) ( C HDR ⁇ ( x , y ) L HDR ⁇ ( x , y ) ) s ⁇ L LDR ⁇ ( x , y ) , ( 13 )
- C HDR (x,y) represents the color value for the particular color channel for the pixel at location (x,y) in the HDR image
- L HDR (x,y) represents the luminance value for the pixel at that location
- L LDR (x,y) represents the luminance value generated for the pixel at the same location in the LDR as described above
- C LDR (x,y) represents the color value for the same color channel for the pixel at the same location in the LDR.
- the value of the exponent “s” can be adjusted to control the color saturation of the resulting LDR image. In one embodiment, satisfactory LDR image results were obtained for values of exponent “s” between 0.4 and 0.6. It will be appreciated that the operations described in connection with equation (13) are performed by the image post-processor module 17 .
- the invention provides a number of advantages.
- the invention provides a gradient domain HDR compression system 10 that reduces the dynamic range of an input image, which has been referred to as an HDR image, to provide a LDR image having a reduced dynamic range.

Abstract
Description
G(x,y)=∇H(x,y)Φ(x,y) (1),
where ∇H(x,y) (which corresponds to the gradient array ∇H described above) represents the gradient of H(x,y) at the point in the image having coordinates (x,y), and Φ(x,y) (which corresponds to the gradient attenuation function Φ described above) represents the value of an attenuation function that is generated for the point (x,y), which attenuation function is a function of the magnitude of the gradient at that point. It will be appreciated that, in connection with equation (1)
where “G” is as in equation (1) and
where Gx and Gy represent the x and y components of G, respectively. According to the Variational Principle provided by the calculus of variations, the function “I” that minimizes the integral in (2) is the function that satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation
where “Ix” and “Iy” represent the “x” and “y” components, respectively of “I.”
Cancelling the common factor of “2” in equation (4) and rearranging,
which can also be written
∇2I=divG
where “∇2I” represents the application of the Laplacian operator
to the scalar function “I”, and “div G” represents application of the divergence operator (which is abbreviated “div,” and is the “dot product” of the “∇” operator
to the “x” and “y” components of a vector, where “i” and “j” refer to the basis vectors for the “x” and “y” components of the vector) to the vector function “G.”
where w(m,n) represents a Gaussian weighting kernel, which can be provided to affect the contribution of various pixels in the 5 pixel-by-5 pixel window around the pixel at location (2i,2j) in the image Hk−1 at level (k−1). It will be appreciated that the Gaussian pyramid defined by equation (7) will provide the image defined by Hk to have one-fourth the resolution as the image defined by Hk−1. It will further be appreciated that the difference in resolution as between levels in the Gaussian pyramid is determined by the coefficients for “i” and “j” on the right-hand side of equation (7); different differences in resolution as between levels of a Gaussian pyramid can be used with appropriate selections of the respective coefficients. The size and shape of the window can also differ from the one in equation (7) by modifying the range of “m” and/or “n.”
where “∥∇Hk(x,y)∥” represents the magnitude of the gradient at the pixel at location (x,y) in the “k-th” level, and “α” and “β” are parameters to be determined. As noted above, the gradient attenuation function Φ(x,y) will reduce the magnitude of relatively large gradients, and increase the magnitude of relatively small gradients. The parameter “α” determines the magnitude at which the gradient will remain unchanged. The parameter “β” determines the direction in which the magnitudes will be changed. If the value of parameter “β” is selected to be strictly greater than “zero” and less than “one” (0<β<1), and also if the value of parameter “α” is strictly greater than zero (0<α), equation (8) will provide that, if the value of ∥∇Hk(x,y)∥ is greater than the value of “α,” the value of the scaling factor φk(x,y) will be less than “one.” On the other hand if the value of ∥∇Hk(x,y)∥ is less than the value of “α,” the value of the scaling factor φk(x,y) will greater than “one.” Finally, if the value of ∥∇Hk(x,y)∥ equal to the value of “α,” the value of the scaling factor φk(x,y) will be “one.” Preferably, the value of parameter α is selected as a function of the average of the magnitudes of the gradients at each level. In one embodiment, satisfactory results were obtained by setting the value of α to one-tenth the average gradient magnitude, and the value of β to between 0.8 and 0.9.
Φd(x,y)=∂d(x,y)
Φk(x,y)=L(Φk+1)(x,y)∂k(x,y)
Φ(x,y)=Φ0(x,y) (9).
The first line in equations (9) indicates that the gradient attenuation function Φd(x,y) at the highest level “d” in the Gaussian pyramid, that is, the level associated with the lowest resolution, corresponds to the scaling factors φd(x,y) that were generated for that level. The last line in equations (9) indicates that the final gradient attenuation function Φ(x,y), which will be used generating G(x,y) as described above in connection with equation (1), is the gradient attenuation function Φ0(x,y) that is generated for the lowest “zero-th” level in the Gaussian pyramid, which corresponds to the level associated with the highest resolution.
Similarly gradient domain HDR compression system approximates the “x” and “y” components of the gradients ∇Ix and ∇Iy, for use in connection with the boundary conditions, using forward finite differences as follows:
∇I x(x,y)=I(x+1,y)−I(x,y)
∇I y(x,y)=I(x,y+1)−I(x,y) (11)
where ∇Ix(x,y) and ∇Iy(x,y) are the “x” and “y” components of the gradient ∇I at point (x,y). Similarly, the gradient domain HDR compression system generates the approximations of the divergence of “G” using backward finite differences as follows:
divG(x,y)≈G x(x,y)−G x(x−1,y)+G y(x,y)−G y(x,y−1) (12)
where Gx(x,y) and Gx(x−1,y) are the “x” components of G at points (x,y) and (x−1,y), respectively, and Gy(x,y) and Gy(x,y−1) are the “y” components of G at points (x,y) and (x,y−1), respectively.
where CHDR(x,y) represents the color value for the particular color channel for the pixel at location (x,y) in the HDR image, LHDR(x,y) represents the luminance value for the pixel at that location, LLDR(x,y) represents the luminance value generated for the pixel at the same location in the LDR as described above, and CLDR(x,y) represents the color value for the same color channel for the pixel at the same location in the LDR. The value of the exponent “s” can be adjusted to control the color saturation of the resulting LDR image. In one embodiment, satisfactory LDR image results were obtained for values of exponent “s” between 0.4 and 0.6. It will be appreciated that the operations described in connection with equation (13) are performed by the
