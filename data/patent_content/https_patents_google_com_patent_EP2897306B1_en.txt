- a Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) strategy comprises the design of transmit filters (or antenna weights) for each user.
- H k is the M r ⁇ M t channel matrix for user k
- W i is the M t ⁇ M s SDMA transmit filter (i.e., antenna weight) for mobile i (designed to minimize crosstalk to other mobiles while maximizing signal power to the mobile i )
- x i is the M s ⁇ 1 symbol vector for mobile i (e.g., a vector of QPSK symbols)
- n k is the additive noise for the k -th user.
- each mobile has M r receive antennas was only illustrative and that each mobile can have a different number of receive antennas.
- the base station has full channel knowledge (i.e., the base has perfect channel state information (CSI)) to all mobiles and is designing transmit SDMA weights.
- the main purpose of the transmit SDMA weights described now is to introduce the concept of subspace averaging that can be used by the base station to compute transmit SDMA weights when the base station has the channel subspace to mobile 102 and the null subspace to mobile 103 (instead of full channel knowledge to both).
- the high-level idea behind the subspace averaging is to improve the transmit SDMA weights by allowing some level of crosstalk (i.e., interference from the transmission intended for mobile 102 being received by mobile 103) that is insignificant given the noise power at mobile 103. By allowing this crosstalk, the received power can be increased at mobile 102 over transmit SDMA weights that allow no crosstalk.

- the codebooks C and C' may be designed by uniformly spacing points on the Grassmann manifold using any available algorithm in the art.
- the transmit SDMA weights may be computed at the base station with the following steps.
- the base station will use the transmit weights (i.e., antenna weights), W u , to beamform the data to mobile u and these weights will maximize the power to one mobile while providing little interference to the other K -1 mobiles.
- W u transmit weights
- the next step is to apply the above algorithms developed for flat-faded MIMO to broadband (e.g., OFDM) MIMO systems.
- broadband e.g., OFDM
- a MIMO-OFDM system is considered, with the full bandwidth being allocated to all the users and average BER is chosen as the performance metric.

Description
- The present invention relates generally to spatial-division multiple access and in particular, to a method and apparatus for performing spatial-division multiple access within a communication system employing multiple nodes.
- Transmit beamforming (sometimes referred to as transmit adaptive array (TXAA) transmission) increases the effective signal-to-noise seen by a receiver device by creating a coverage pattern that tends to be directional in nature (i.e., not uniformly broadcast). This is accomplished by employing multiple antennas at the transmit site and weighting each antenna such that the combined transmissions result in a beamformed pattern that delivers maximum power/energy to the receiver. In the case of transmitting multiple streams to multiple receivers (i.e., transmit spatial division multiple access or SDMA), it would be beneficial to compute the antenna weights so that minimum cross talk or interference between users is achieved. In other words, in addition to choosing an antenna matrix (i.e., the weights for each antenna) that maximizes power to the desired receiver, it would additionally be beneficial to minimize power to the non-desired receivers. However, accomplishing this requires full channel knowledge at the transmitter which is difficult to get in practical communications because of the large amount of feedback required to obtain the full channel knowledge. Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for performing spatial-division multiple access within a communication system employing multiple nodes that minimizes cross-talk or interference for non-desired receivers while employing a practical feedback method.

Thus, for example, when transmitting tonode 102, it would be beneficial if along with maximizing the power atnode 102, the antennas weights for transmitting tonode 102 additionally minimized the received power at node 103, especially in the case of SDMA transmission. - In order to address this issue, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention multiple nodes will return null subspace information along with their channel subspace information. The null subspace is similar to the channel subspace except that the null subspace information directs
base station 101 to the matrix in a predefined codebook that results in minimum power being received at the node. The null subspace for each node is taken into consideration when communicating with a particular node. Thus, for example, if bothnodes 102 and 103 have communicated their channel subspace and null subspace information tobase station 101,base station 101 will compute the antenna weights utilized for communication to mobile 102 based on both the channel subspace returned by mobile 102 and the null subspace returned by mobile 103. This will have the effect of maximizing power to mobile 102, while minimizing power to mobile 103. More particularly, the null subspace to mobile 103 is used to create a projection matrix that will project a matrix (or vector) onto the null subspace associated with mobile 103. This projection matrix is applied to the channel subspace of mobile 102 to create a projected channel subspace for mobile 102. Then the transmit SDMA weights (i.e., antenna weights) for mobile 102 are computed using this projected channel subspace. The power is minimized to mobile 103 through the application of the projection matrix to the channel subspace for 102. The power is maximized to mobile 102 by designing weights that are the singular vectors associated with the largest singular values of the projected channel subspace for mobile 102. A detailed explanation of how this is accomplished is described below. - A Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) strategy comprises the design of transmit filters (or antenna weights) for each user. Considering a system with K users (nodes), Mt transmit antennas at the base, Mr receive antennas at each mobile (user or node), and Ms data streams to be transmitted to each mobile, the system may be described by K equations as:
- Note that the assumption that each mobile has Mr receive antennas was only illustrative and that each mobile can have a different number of receive antennas.
- In the following text, it is assumed that the base station has full channel knowledge (i.e., the base has perfect channel state information (CSI)) to all mobiles and is designing transmit SDMA weights. The main purpose of the transmit SDMA weights described now is to introduce the concept of subspace averaging that can be used by the base station to compute transmit SDMA weights when the base station has the channel subspace to mobile 102 and the null subspace to mobile 103 (instead of full channel knowledge to both). The high-level idea behind the subspace averaging is to improve the transmit SDMA weights by allowing some level of crosstalk (i.e., interference from the transmission intended for mobile 102 being received by mobile 103) that is insignificant given the noise power at mobile 103. By allowing this crosstalk, the received power can be increased at mobile 102 over transmit SDMA weights that allow no crosstalk.
- In the following an antenna-weighting approach is introduced based on subspace averaging. Consider K users for SDMA with channels H 1, ...,H K and let us assume that Ms data streams will be transmitted to each user. The objective is to determine the corresponding SDMA weights W 1, ..., W k. Assuming that the base has channel space information (e.g., the null and the channel subspace obtained through channel sounding or channel feedback) and Mt>KMs, the computation of W k is obtained with the following steps:
-
- 1) Define null {H 1,...,H K }: Assume Mt>KMs and let H1 ,...,H K be the K channel matrices for each mobile each of size Mr ×Mt with complex entries. Define the KMr ×Mt matrix
- 2) Define V=avg(V 1, V 2): Assume V 1, V 2 are Mt ×Ms orthonormal matrices and define the "subspace distance" between the subspaces spanned by orthonormal matrices V 1 and V 2 as
- 3) For user k obtain N k= null(H1 ,...,H k-1,H k+1,..,H K ) and the orthogonal projection matrix
- 4) For user k let V k be an Mt ×Ms orthonormal matrix formed by the Ms dominant right singular vectors of H k .
- 5) Compute W k =avg(V k , P k V k ).
- Note that W k = V k implies that interference is ignored, W k = P k V k implies interference cancellation or nullforming (i.e., zero crosstalk at mobile 103 if user k is mobile 102). By using the subspace averaging, some level of crosstalk is present at mobile 103, but the power delivered to mobile 102 is increased. As long as the level of crosstalk at mobile 103 is below the noise power, the performance is unaffected at mobile 103.
- Now that the concept of subspace averaging is introduced, it will now be used to design transmit SDMA weights at the base station when only the channel and null subspaces for each mobile are known by the base station. Assume that there are K mobiles (each with Mr receive antennas) with Mr ×Mt downlink channels H 1, ..., H K that are measured by the mobile from pilot signals sent from each of the Mt transmit antennas at the base station. The idea is to devise a codebook based quantization strategy that enables a practical method for the mobile to feedback its null and channel subspaces to the base station. For each user, the feedback consists of the quantized null subspace Q ( N k ) and the quantized channel subspace Q(V k ) determined by the following algorithm. Note that the quantization can be done by selecting an entry out of a codebook of B matrices (the dimension of the matrices is given below). The codebooks can be designed as known in the art, D. J. Love, R. W. Heath, Jr., and T. Strohmer, "Grassmannian Beamforming for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Wireless Systems," IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, October 2003.

-
- The codebooks C and C' may be designed by uniformly spacing points on the Grassmann manifold using any available algorithm in the art. The transmit SDMA weights may be computed at the base station with the following steps.
- This algorithm assumes that the base station will simultaneously transmit to K mobiles. The following steps are used to compute the transmit SDMA weights:
- 1) Compute the orthogonal projection matrix for mobile u as:
- 2) Compute the SDMA weight for mobile u as W u =avg(Q(V u)P uQ(V u).
- The base station will use the transmit weights (i.e., antenna weights), W u , to beamform the data to mobile u and these weights will maximize the power to one mobile while providing little interference to the other K-1 mobiles.
- The next step is to apply the above algorithms developed for flat-faded MIMO to broadband (e.g., OFDM) MIMO systems. In the following, a MIMO-OFDM system is considered, with the full bandwidth being allocated to all the users and average BER is chosen as the performance metric. With perfect channel knowledge (i.e., perfect CSI) at the transmitter the SDMA weights may be computed independently for each subcarrier using the subspace average solution.
- As in the case of flat fading channels, we will assume there are K users with channels represented by H 1(f) through H K (f), f=1...,N where f is the subcarrier index and N is the total number of subcarriers. Then, the null subspace and the channel subspace information for each subcarrier may be quantized, specifically Q(N 1(f)), Q(V 1(f)),..., Q(N K (f)), Q(V K (f)) and the subspace average based SDMA solution given above may be applied to each subcarrier independently. In this case the feedback load increases by N-fold compared to a flat fading MIMO channel. However, because there is typically correlation between the channel on adjacent subcarriers, the amount of feedback can be reduced as follows.
- Due to the fact that the number of resolvable multipath components are typically less than the number of subcarriers, the adjacent subcarrier channels are correlated and this fact may be exploited to reduce feedback information. The adjacent subcarriers may be grouped to form a cluster that share a common SDMA weight and provide a common feedback for the channel subspace and the null subspace. Considering an arbitrary cluster of F subcarriers (F≤N) and representing the subcarriers in that cluster by 1, ...,F, the common feedback information may be determined as follows.
-
- 1) Define the "cluster channel subspace" for mobile u as:
t (i.e., a space formed by all Mt -dimensional complex-valued vectors) - 2) Define the "cluster null subspace" for mobile u as:
t . - The codebooks can be designed as in the flat faded case presented above. Note that in the above definitions that the subcarriers in a cluster are from 1 to F but in general the cluster can be any group of F subcarriers from the N data-carrying subcarriers.
- Mobile u communicates its quantized cluster channel subspace to the base station by feeding back the index of the codebook matrix that maximizes
- Special cases of clustering include cluster size of one (i.e., F=1), meaning that each subcarrier is treated independently or cluster size of F=N, when only one SDMA weight is used for all the subcarriers. Recall that in the case of Ms=Mr, either channel subspace or null subspace information is sufficient because one of the two subspaces can be derived from the other.

FIG. 2 is a block diagram ofbase station 101.Base station 101 comprisesstream weighting circuitry 201, inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)circuitry 203, optionalcyclic prefix circuitry 207 andtransmitter 209. During operation a data stream s(f), f=1, 2, ... N enters stream weighting circuitry 201 (where N is the number of subcarriers). Note that the weighting operation performed by the stream weighting circuitry will be repeated for each of the Ms data streams at each of the K nodes (mobiles).Stream weighting circuitry 201 outputs a plurality of weighted data streams, and in particular, one weighted data stream per antenna. Each weighted data stream (alternatively referred to as "antenna stream") is appropriately weighted in the frequency domain by an antenna-specific weight vn (f) where n=1, 2, ... Mt , where Mt is the number ofantennas 211. Note that the weights may or may not be different on each beamformed subcarrier. Assuming vm (f) is the weight for antenna m and subcarrier f, then streamweighting circuitry 201 outputs weighted data/antenna stream xm (f)= vm (f)s(f) for antenna m. In the case where the data on some of the subcarriers is not to be beamformed, the data/antenna stream s(f) for those subcarriers are fed directly into the f th subcarrier as the input to the IFFT. In other words, on those subcarriers, the vm(f) are effectively set to one. -
IFFT circuitry 203 performs an inverse Fast Fourier Transform on each weighted data stream, converting the frequency-domain data stream into a time-domain data stream. An optional cyclic extension operation is then carried out viacyclic extension circuitry 207 on the circularly-shifted antenna streams. In particular, a cyclic prefix, or guard interval is added. The cyclic prefix is typically longer than the expected maximum delay spread of the channel. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the cyclic extension can comprise a prefix, postfix, or a combination of a prefix and a postfix. The cyclic extension is an inherent part of the OFDM communication system. The inserted cyclic prefix makes the ordinary convolution of the transmitted signal with the multipath channel appear as a cyclic convolution when the impulse response of the channel ranges from 0 to LCP, where LCP is the length of the cyclic extension. Finally, the properly weighted, and circularly-shifted antenna data streams are OFDM modulated and transmitted bytransmitters 209 fromantennas 211. - As is evident,
base station 101 additionally comprisesreceiver 213 for receiving channel and null subspace information transmitted by nodes. For example,node 102 will transmitsubspace information 105 and node 103 will transmitsubspace information 106, which will be received byreceiver 213. This information will be passed to streamweighting circuitry 201 in order to determine the appropriate antenna/stream weightings to use when communicating to a particular node. -
FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing operation of the base station ofFIG. 2 . The logic flow begins atstep 301 where pilot data is transmitted to at least a first and a second node. The transmission of pilot data simply comprises the transmission of a known sequence from each of themultiple antennas 211. The known sequence could be different for each antenna, and/or could be transmitted on different channel resources from each antenna. In response,receiver 213 receives first and second channel subspace information from the first and the second nodes atstep 303. As discussed above, the channel subspace information comprises information on which antenna weights will be calculated that maximize the power to the mobile. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention this information comprises an index to codebook 215 shared bybase station 101 and mobiles 102-103. - Continuing, at
step 305 first and second null subspace information is received from the first and second nodes byreceiver 213. As discussed above, the null subspace information is received in response to the pilot data being transmitted, and comprises information on which antenna weights will be calculated that minimize power to the mobile. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention this information comprises an index to codebook 215 shared bybase station 101 and mobiles 102-103. - At
step 307 the first channel subspace information and the second null subspace information is utilized bystream weighting circuitry 201 to determine first antenna/stream weights for the first node, and atstep 309 the second channel subspace information and the first null subspace information is used bystream weighting circuitry 201 to determine second antenna/stream weights for the second node. As discussed above, the first stream weights will maximize power to the first node while minimizing (or limiting the) power to the second node, while the second stream weights will maximize power to the second node while minimizing (or limiting the) power to the first node. Finally, atstep 311 information or data is transmitted to the first and the second nodes utilizing the first and the second stream weights, respectively. The transmission to the first and second nodes using the first and second stream weights may occur simultaneously (e.g., in an SDMA fashion). -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram ofnode 400. As shown,node 400 compriseslogic circuitry 401,receiver 403,transmitter 405, andcodebook 215.Logic circuitry 401 preferably comprises a microprocessor/controller and serves to determine the best codebook indices from thecodebook 215 that represent the node's channel subspace and the node's null subspace based on pilot data received from the base station (the received pilot data is obtained by thelogic circuitry 401 from the receiver 403). The logic circuitry provides the codebook indices to thetransmitter 405 in order to feedback the indices to the base station. -
FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing the operation of thenode 400 during calculation of a channel subspace and a null subspace. The logic circuitry begins atstep 501 where a pilot signal (pilot data) is received byreceiver 403. As known in the art, a pilot signal comprises a known sequence, transmitted at a known time by each of the Mt transmit antennas at the base.Receiver 403 computes a channel estimate and passes the channel estimates to logic circuitry 401 (step 503). Once the channel estimate is known,logic circuitry 401 determines subspaces that will result in maximum power and minimum power (step 505). Both are determined based on the channel estimates.Codebook 215 is accessed bylogic circuitry 401 and appropriate indices are determined for the channel weights. (step 507). Atstep 509 channel subspace information and null subspace information is transmitted viatransmitter 405 as codebook entries. - While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a particular embodiment. For example, the matrix 2-norm (∥A∥2) was used exclusively. However other matrix norms could also be used such as the Frobenius matrix norm.
