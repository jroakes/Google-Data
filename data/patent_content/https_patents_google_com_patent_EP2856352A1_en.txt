- the noting application determines other users similar to the first user as those in the same social network that have +1 'ed the same sites, articles and ads or a portion of the same sites, articles and ads (e.g., 60% of the sites, articles and ads).
- the noting application retrieves other +1 'ed items approved by the other similar users (e.g., other sites, articles, ads, videos, etc., that are approved by the other similar users and not yet approved by the first user) and provides the other +1 'ed items to the first user.
- the first user may browse through the other +1 'ed items approved by the other similar users in a full screen view or in a list overview via a user interface.
- the determination module retrieves a noting profile associated with the first user from a storage device and determines, based at least in part on the noting profile, a first noting pattern associated with the first user.
- the term noting profile as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning including, but not limited to, a profile describing an aggregation of items noted by a user.
- a noting pattern is data describing a pattern in a noting profile. For example, a noting profile for a first user includes data describing that in a first day the first user has visited 50 online services and approved 10 articles and 8 ads from the 50 online services, and in the next day the first user has viewed 10 videos and approved 2 of the 10 videos.
- the 10 approved articles, 8 approved ads and 2 approved videos form a noting pattern for the first user.
- a noting profile indicates that the first user has approved 10 ads and disapproved 5 videos from 20 online services in a week, and the 10 approved ads and the 5 disapproved videos form a noting pattern for the first user.
- the determination module determines the one or more second users related to the first user as one or more other users each having a second noting pattern related to the first noting pattern of the first user. For example, the determination module determines the one or more second users as one or more other users who have the same noting pattern as the first user. In another example, the determination module determines the one or more second users as other users each having a second noting pattern related to the first noting pattern of the first user.
- the determination module receives an indication of one or more social categories from the first user via the communication module.
- a social category is a grouping of one or more social connections.
- a social category includes one or more circles in a social network (e.g., a g+ circle).
- the determination module determines the one or more second users related to the first user as one or more other users within the one or more social categories of the first user. This encompasses a particular group or network that the second user(s) should be part of in order for their electronically marked data to taken into consideration. For example, if the social category specified by the first user is a "friend" circle, the determination module determines the one or more second users as members from the "friend" circle.
