Definitions
- This specification generally relates to search engines, and one particular implementation relates to evaluating synonyms that are used in revising search queries.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include that actions of evaluating a synonym rule based on determining whether a user has (i) selected a search result that includes a synonym generated using the synonym rule (referred to as a “click evaluation” of the synonym rule), or (ii) selected a search result that ranks below a search result that includes a synonym generated using the synonym rule (referred to as a “skip evaluation” of the synonym rule).
- a synonym engine may infer, though a user's clicking on or skipping a particular search result, that synonyms included in the particular search played some part in the user's decision to select or not select the particular search result. This insight may be used to measure of the quality of the synonym and, by extension, the quality of the corresponding synonym rule.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing query log data that identifies, for an initial search query, a query term included in the initial search query, one or more synonyms for the query term that were generated using a corresponding one or more synonym rules, a revised search query that includes the one or more synonyms, search results that were generated using the initial search query and the revised search query, and a particular search result selected by a user; determining, using the query log data, that the particular search result includes a particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query; and in response to determining that the particular search result includes a particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, incrementing a crucial click count for a synonym rule that corresponds to the particular synonym.
- a score is assigned to the synonym rule based on the crucial click count.
- the score is based on a ratio of (i) the crucial click count to (ii) the crucial click count and a crucial skip count.
- the actions include determining that the score of the synonym rule does not meet a threshold; and removing the synonym rule from a set of synonym rules used to generate revised search queries based on determining that the score does not meet the threshold.
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the particular search result includes a second particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, and does not include the query term; and in response to determining that the particular search result includes the second particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query and does not include the query term, incrementing a click count for a synonym rule that corresponds to the second particular synonym.
- the actions include associating a first weight with the click count and a second different weight with the crucial click count; and assigning a score to the synonym rule based on the crucial click count and associated first weight and the click count and associated second weight. The score satisfies:
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the particular search result includes a second particular synonym for a second query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the second query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the second query term that occurs in the revised search query; and in response to determining that the particular search result includes a second particular synonym for the second query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the second query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the second query term that occurs in the revised search query, incrementing a crucial click count for a second synonym rule that corresponds to the second particular synonym.
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the particular synonym was generated for the query term using a synonym rule with a particular query context, and wherein incrementing a crucial click count for the synonym rule comprises incrementing a crucial click count for the synonym rule with the particular query context.
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the particular synonym was generated for the query term using a second synonym rule with a second particular query context; and incrementing a crucial click count for the second synonym rule that corresponds to the particular synonym in the second particular query context.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing query log data that identifies, for an initial search query, a query term included in the initial search query, one or more synonyms for the query term that were generated using a corresponding one or more synonym rules, a revised search query that includes the one or more synonyms, search results that were generated using the initial search query and the revised search query, a ranking of the search results, and a particular search result selected by a user; determining, using the query log data, that a search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes a particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query; and in response to determining that the search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes a particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised
- a score is assigned to the synonym rule based on the crucial skip count.
- the score is based on a ratio of (i) the crucial skip count to (ii) the crucial skip count and a crucial click count.
- the actions include determining that the score of the synonym rule does not meet a threshold; and removing the synonym rule from a set of synonym rules used to generate revised search queries based on determining that the score does not meet the threshold.
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes a second particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query, and does not include the query term; and in response to determining that the search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes the second particular synonym for the query term that occurs in the revised search query and does not include the query term, incrementing a skip count for the synonym rule that corresponds to the second particular synonym.
- the actions include associating a first weight with the skip count and a second different weight with the crucial skip count; and assigning a score to the synonym rule based on the crucial skip count and associated first weight and the skip count and associated second weight. The score satisfies:
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes a second particular synonym for a second query term that occurs in the revised search query, and includes neither (i) the second query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the second query term that occurs in the revised search query; and in response to determining that the search result that is ranked above the particular search result includes a second particular synonym for the second query term, and includes neither (i) the second query term nor (ii) any other synonym for the second query term that occurs in the revised search query, incrementing a crucial skip count for a second synonym rule that corresponds to the second particular synonym.
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the particular synonym was generated for the query term using a synonym rule with a particular query context, and wherein incrementing a crucial skip count for the synonym rule comprises incrementing a crucial skip count for the synonym rule with the particular query context.
- the actions include determining, using the query log data, that the particular synonym was generated for the query term using a second synonym rule with a second particular query context; and incrementing a crucial skip count for the second synonym rule that corresponds to the particular synonym in the second particular query context.
- Click and skip evaluation of synonym rules can identify synonym rules that should be removed from a search system. Click and skip evaluation can also improve the quality of retrieved search results by helping to eliminate search results that users found unhelpful. Click and skip evaluation of synonyms can also demote (instead of removing completely) synonym rules, allowing low-confidence rules to be used less frequently in retrieving search results.

- FIGS. 4 and 5 are flow charts of example processes for evaluating synonym rules using click and skip evaluation.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system 100 that uses synonyms to generate search results.
- the system 100 includes a client device 110 coupled to a search system 130 over a network 120 .
- the search system 130 receives a query 105 , referred to by this specification as the “original query” or an “initial query,” from the client device 110 over network 120 , and the search system 130 provides a search results page 155 that presents search results 145 identified as being responsive to the query 105 to the client device 110 over the network 120 .
- the search results 145 identified by the search system 130 can include one or more search results that were identified as being responsive to queries that are different than the original query 105 .
- the other queries can be obtained or generated in numerous ways, including by revising the original query 105 .
- the search system 130 can generate a revised query by adding to the original query 105 additional terms that are synonyms of one or more terms that occur in the original query 105 .
- the search system 130 can generate a revised query by substituting terms that are synonyms of terms that occur in the original query 105 , in place of the terms in the original query 105 .
- synonyms i.e., terms that are used to generate revised queries, are also referred to as “substitute terms.”
- the search system can consider each of one or more terms to be synonyms or substitute terms for a particular query term.
- the original query 105 and the revised queries can be used by a search engine 150 to identify and rank search results.
- the identified search results 145 can be provided to the client device 110 on a search results page 155 .
- the search system 130 can identify the synonyms that are used to generate revised queries by evaluating terms included in previously received queries stored in query logs 190 . For instance, given a first term (“cat”), the search system can evaluate terms (“feline” or “banana”) that are candidate synonyms for the original term, and can determine that the certain terms are synonyms of the first term (as in the case of “feline”), and that other terms are not synonyms of the first term (as in the case of “banana”).
- terms (“feline” or “banana” that are candidate synonyms for the original term, and can determine that the certain terms are synonyms of the first term (as in the case of “feline”), and that other terms are not synonyms of the first term (as in the case of “banana”).
- the search system 130 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 130 includes a search system front-end 140 (or a “gateway server”) to coordinate requests between other parts of the search system 130 and the client device 110 .
- the search system 130 also includes a search engine 150 , a query reviser engine 170 , and a synonym engine 180 .
- an “engine” refers to a software implemented input/output system that provides an output that is different than the input.
- An engine may be an encoded block of functionality, such as a library, a platform, Software Development Kit (“SDK”), or an object.
- the network 120 may include, for example, a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or Wi-Fi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, a wired Ethernet network, a private network such as an intranet, a public network such as the Internet, or any appropriate combination thereof.
- the search system front-end 140 , search engine 150 , query reviser engine 170 , and synonym engine 180 can be implemented on any appropriate type of computing device (e.g., servers, mobile phones, tablet computers, music players, e-book readers, laptop or desktop computers, PDAs, smart phones, or other stationary or portable devices) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media.
- the client device 110 includes one or more processors 112 , computer readable media 113 that store software applications 114 (e.g. a browser or layout engine), an input module 116 (e.g., a keyboard or mouse), communication interface 117 , and a display 118 .
- the computing device or devices that implement the search system front-end 140 , the query reviser engine 170 , and the search engine 150 may include similar or different components.
- the search system front-end 140 receives the original query 105 from client device 110 , and routes the original query 105 to the appropriate engines so that the search engine results page 155 may be generated. In some implementations, routing occurs by referencing static routing tables, or routing may occur based on the current network load of an engine, so as to accomplish a load balancing function.
- the search system front-end 140 also provides the resulting search engine results page 155 to the client device 110 . In doing so, the search system front-end 140 acts as a gateway, or interface, between the client device 110 and the search engine 150 .
- the search system 130 contains many thousands of computing devices to execute for the queries that are processed by the search system 130 .
- Two or more of the search system front-end 140 , the query reviser engine 170 , and the search engine 150 may be implemented on the same computing device, or on different computing devices. Because the search engine results page 155 is generated based on the collective activity of the search system front-end 140 , the query reviser engine 170 , and the search engine 150 , the user of the client device 110 may refer to these engines collectively as a “search engine.” This specification, however, refers to the search engine 150 , and not the collection of engines, as the “search engine,” since the search engine 150 identifies the search results 145 in response to the user-submitted search query 105 .
- a user of the client device 110 enters query terms 115 for the original search query 105 during state (A), and the client device 110 communicates the original search query 105 to the search system 130 over the network 120 .
- the user may submit the original search query 105 by initiating a search dialogue on the client device 110 , by speaking or typing the terms 115 of the original search query 110 , then by pressing a search initiation button or control on the client device 110 .
- the client device 110 formulates the original search query 105 , e.g., by specifying search parameters, and transmits the original search query 105 over the network 120 .
- the query 105 refers to the query 105 as an “original” or an “initial” query, such reference is merely intended to distinguish this query from other queries, such as the revised queries that are described below.
- the designation of the original query 105 as “original” is not intended to require the original query 105 to be the first query that is entered by the user, or to be a query that is manually entered.
- the original query 105 may be the second or subsequent query entered by the user, or the original query 105 may be automatically derived (e.g., by the query reviser engine 170 ) or may be modified based upon prior queries entered by the user, location information, and the like.
- the search system front-end 140 receives the original query 105 and communicates the original query 105 to the query reviser engine 170 .
- the query reviser engine 170 can generate one or more revised queries 135 based on the substance of the original query 105 .
- the query reviser engine 170 generates a revised query by adding terms to the original query 105 using synonyms 125 for terms in the original query 105 .
- the query reviser engine 170 generates a revise query by substituting the synonyms 125 for the corresponding terms of the original query 105 .
- the query reviser engine 170 can obtain synonyms 125 for use in revising the original query 105 from synonym engine 180 .
- the query reviser engine 170 communicates terms 115 of the original query 105 to the synonym engine 180 .
- the synonym engine 180 uses synonym rules to generate synonyms 125 for the terms 115 of the original query 105 .
- the search system 130 can define a synonym rule for a pair of terms that are determined to be synonyms, and can use the synonym rule at a later time to identify synonyms for query terms. For example, for a query that includes the terms “cat food,” the search system 130 can identify a synonym rule that indicates that “pet” is a synonym for “cat,” and can generate a revised query using “pet” as an additional or replacement term in the revised query.
- Synonym rules can be defined to apply generally, or can be defined to apply only when particular conditions, or “query contexts,” are satisfied.
- the query context of a synonym rule can specify, for example, one or more other terms that must be present in the query for the synonym rule to apply.
- query contexts can specify relative locations for the other terms (e.g. to the right or left of a query term under evaluation) or can specify a general location (e.g. anywhere in the query).
- a particular synonym rule can specify that the term “pet” is a synonym for the query term “dog,” but only when “dog” is followed by the term “food” in the query.
- Multiple distinct synonym rules can generate the same synonym for a given query term. For example, for the query term “dog” in the query “dog food,” the term “pet” can be specified as a synonym for “dog” by both a synonym rule for “dog” in the general context and a synonym rule for “dog” when followed by “food.”
- the synonym rules can depend on query contexts that define other terms in the original query 105 . In other words, a synonym rule need not apply in all situations. For example, when “cats” is used as a single-term query, “felines” can be considered a synonym for “cats” and returned to the query reviser engine 170 to generate a revised search query. But when the query includes “cats” followed by the term “musical,” a synonym rule might specify that the term “felines” is not a synonym for “cats.”
- the synonym rules can be stored for use by, e.g., the synonym engine 180 , the query reviser engine 170 , or the search engine 150 .
- the synonym engine 180 communicates synonyms 125 to the query reviser engine 170 during state (D).
- the query reviser engine 180 generates one or more revised queries 135 by, for example, adding synonyms 125 to the original query 105 , or substituting certain terms of the original query 105 .
- the query reviser engine 170 communicates the one or more revised queries 135 to the search system front-end 140 during state (E).
- the search system front-end 140 communicates the original query 105 and/or the one or more revised queries 135 to the search engine 150 during state (F).
- the search engine 150 generates search results 145 that it identifies as being responsive to the original query 105 and/or the one or more revised queries 135 .
- the search engine 150 can identify search results 145 for each query using an index database 160 that stores indexed resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet).
- the search engine 150 can combine and rank the identified search results 145 and communicate the search results 145 to the search system front-end 140 during state (G).
- the search system front-end 140 generates a search results page 155 that identifies the search results 145 .
- Each of the search results 145 can include, for example, titles, text snippets, images, links, reviews, or other information.
- the query terms 115 or the synonyms 125 that appear in the search results 145 can be formatted in a particular way, for example, in bold print.
- the search system front-end 140 transmits code (e.g., HyperText Markup Language code or eXtensible Markup Language code) for the search results page 155 to the client device 110 over the network 120 at state (H), so that the client device 110 can display the search results page 155 .
- code e.g., HyperText Markup Language code or eXtensible Markup Language code
- the client device 110 invokes the transmitted code, e.g., using a layout engine, and displays the search results page 155 on the display 118 .
- the terms 115 of the original query 105 are displayed in a query box (or “search box”), located for example, on the top of the search results page 155 , and some of the search results 145 are displayed in a search results block, for example, on the left-hand side of the search results page 155 .
- FIG. 2A is a diagram of an example system 200 that evaluates synonym rules.
- the system 200 includes a client device 260 , a search engine system 270 , and a synonym system 280 .
- the entities illustrated in FIG. 2A can, for example, be implemented as part of the system illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the search engine system 270 receives queries 261 from the client device 260 and provides identified search results 264 on a generated search results page 256 in response to the received queries 261 .
- the search results page 256 can also present the entered query 201 .
- Some of the provided search results 264 can be identified by the search engine system 270 by revising the received query 261 to include synonyms 263 for terms of the query 261 .
- the search engine system 270 can provide a query message 262 that includes terms of the received query 261 to the synonym system 280 .
- the synonym system 280 can identify synonyms 263 for the terms of the received query 261 and provide the identified synonyms 263 to the search engine system 270 .
- the search engine system 270 can identify search results 202 , 203 , and 204 using the term “banana” from the query 261 , and using the synonyms “fruit” and “plantain” of the term “banana.”
- the synonym rule notation “A ⁇ B” indicates that, according to a particular synonym rule, the term “B” is considered to be a synonym for the term “A.”
- a query reviser of the search engine system 270 may generate revised queries by adding term “B” to an original query, by substituting term “B” for term “A” in the original query, or by performing other query revision techniques.
- search results retrieved by the search engine system 270 can be identified by the search engine system 270 if they include the original query term “banana,” or if they include any of the identified synonyms for the original query term “banana.”
- search result 202 includes a synonym, “fruit,” for the original query term “banana.”
- search result 203 includes a synonym, “plantain,” for the original query term “banana.”
- Search result 204 includes the original query term “banana,” but does not include any of the identified synonyms for the original query term “banana.”
- User interaction with the search results 266 can be measured in order to gain insights that the synonym system 280 may use to evaluate particular synonym rules.
- a user selection 266 of a particular search result on search results page 256 can be received by the search engine system 270 and provided as a selection message 267 to the synonym system 280 .
- the synonym system 280 may in turn evaluate particular synonym rules that were used to identify the synonyms associated with the particular search result, or to evaluate synonym rules that were used to identify the synonyms associated with search results that were not selected.
- a particular synonym rule may be used to identify a synonym that is included in a particular revised query. If the search engine system 270 identifies a user-selected search result based on executing the particular revised query, the synonym system 280 may, through click evaluation, infer that particular synonym (and, by extension, the particular synonym rule) drove the user's decision to select the user-selected search result.
- the synonym system 280 may, through skip evaluation, infer that the particular synonym (and, by extension, the particular synonym rule) drove the user's decision to skip the particular search result. This example is particularly relevant when the user-selected result is lower ranking than, i.e., is displayed on a search result page below, the particular search result.
- the query 261 which includes the term “banana,” produces search results 202 , 203 , and 204 .
- the synonym system 280 can determine that using the term “plantain” in revised queries does improve the quality of the search results.
- the synonym system 280 can, through click evaluation, then infer that the synonym rule “banana ⁇ plantain” is a helpful synonym rule.
- This insight 290 may suggest that the “banana ⁇ plantain” synonym rule should have an expanded role, or should be promoted or added to the synonym system 280 , in a general context or in particular contexts.
- the synonym system 280 can determine that using the synonym “fruit” in revised queries did not improve the quality of the search results. By extension, the synonym system 280 can then infer, though skip evaluation, that the synonym rule “banana ⁇ fruit” is not a helpful synonym rule. The insight 290 gained from this situation may suggest that the “banana ⁇ fruit” synonym rule may need to be limited, demoted or removed from the synonym system 280 , in a general context or in particular contexts.
- synonym rules based on user interaction with provided search results
- various metrics can be computed and combined into score for each synonym rule.
- a separate score can be computed for each synonym rule, in a general context or in particular contexts.
- a “click” occurs when a user selects a search result that was identified for a revised search query when the referenced document of the selected search result: (i) includes a synonym of a particular query term that occurs in the revised search query and (ii) does not include the particular query term.
- a “click” occurs when the search result itself, and not the referenced document, satisfies these criteria.
- the selection of a search result is referred to by this specification as a “click,” the selection can also be a voice-based selection, or a selection by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, e.g., a touch-screen device, or any other appropriate selection mechanism.
- both clicks are given a weight smaller than clicks due to the potential ambiguity of the user selection.
- a skip occurs when a user skips over a particular search result that was identified for a revised search query when the referenced document of the skipped search result: (i) includes a synonym of a particular query term that occurs in the revised search query, and (ii) does not include the particular query term. Skipping over the particular search result occurs when the user selects another search result that is ranked lower than, or displayed beneath, the particular result on a search results page. In other implementations, a “skip” occurs when the search result itself, and not the referenced document, satisfies these criteria.
- both skips are given a weight smaller than skips due to the ambiguity of the user skip.
- clicks and skips are particularly informative for use in evaluating synonym rules. These situations will be referred to in this specification as “crucial clicks” and “crucial skips.”
- a crucial click or crucial skip situation occurs when a search result that is clicked or skipped is more directly associated with a single, particular synonym.
- a crucial click occurs when a user selects a search result that was identified for a revised search query when the referenced document of the selected search result: (i) includes a synonym of a particular query term that occurs in the revised search query, (ii) does not include the particular query term, and (iii) does not include any other synonym of the particular query term that occurs in the revised search query.
- a “crucial click” occurs when the search result itself, and not the referenced document, satisfies these criteria.
- a crucial skip occurs when a user selects of a search result that was below a search result that was identified for a revised search query when the referenced document of the skipped search result: (i) includes a synonym of a particular query term that occurs in the revised search query, (ii) does not include the particular query term, and (iii) does not include any other synonym of the particular query term that occurs in the revised search query.
- a “crucial click” occurs when the search result itself, and not the referenced document, satisfies these criteria.
