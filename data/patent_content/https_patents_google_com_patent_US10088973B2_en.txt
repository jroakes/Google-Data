Definitions
- Example embodiments of the present application generally relate to task management and, more particularly, to a system and method for providing intelligent task management services to users.
- task management involved creating and maintaining one or more paper to-do lists.
- task management software tools allow users to manage multiple tasks on multiple task lists, share tasks with other users, set alerts and reminders for certain tasks, and prioritize tasks based on the wishes of the user.
- the task lists of traditional task management tools are often outdated, unstructured, and incomplete or unmanageably long.
- the information for describing individual tasks is often scant, containing little more than a subject and a due date.
- the tasks on these lists are often mismanaged and quickly become irrelevant or moot due to the passing of time or a change in other circumstances.
- these task management tools allow users to schedule tasks, they do not assist users in determining when to schedule certain tasks or how to prioritize each task on the list of tasks.
- traditional task management tools do not assist users in tracking available time at which one or more tasks may be performed.
- traditional task management tools provide little assistance to users in actually undertaking or completing the tasks on the task lists.

- Each generated intention object may have a number of different actions that may be taken with regard to the intention objects themselves (e.g., sharing via email) and a number of different executable actions that may be executed with regard to the respective activities of the intention object.
- a particular intention object may persist regardless of the actions taken with respect to that object.
- a user may receive an email confirming a dentist appointment at the dentist's office that same day at 2:30 PM.
- the system may then analyze the email to obtain the activity attributes defining the user's intended activity, which in this example is the dentist appointment.
- the activity attributes obtained from the email may include the date and time of the appointment (e.g., a temporal attribute) and the location of the appointment (e.g., a contextual attribute), which in this case is the dentist's office.
- An intention object including these obtained activity attributes may then be created.
- a travel time e.g., an additional attribute
- 15 minutes may then be inferred based on the current location of the user and the location of the dentist's office.
- the intention object may then be updated to include the inferred attributes.
- aspects of the present disclosure describe systems and methods for intelligent task management services including selectively presenting a user with a collection of intention objects.
- the method may include accessing a collection of intention objects belonging to the user.
- Each of the intention objects may comprise a data structure including a plurality of activity attributes of an intended activity.
- the plurality of activity attributes may comprise temporal attributes and contextual attributes including a location associated with the intended activity.
- the method may also include determining a relevancy rank for each of the collection of intention objects based on the plurality of activity attributes corresponding to each intention object.
- the relevancy rank indicates a suggested order in which the user undertakes each of the respective activities.
- one or more intention objects with a relevancy rank above a predefined threshold are identified.
- Graphical representations of the above-threshold intention objects may be presented to the user in a free form spatial interface.
- the identified intention objects may be presented to a user in an order listed with the order of the intention objects determined based on the respective relevancy rank.
- the user may have created an additional intention object for rearranging his sock drawer, which includes a temporal attribute indicating that the duration of this activity is 30 minutes.
- the user may have created another intention object for a date with his wife at a time and location to be determined at a later time.
- the user's collection of intention objects may thus comprise the intention objects for the dentist appointment, rearranging the sock drawer, and the date with his wife.
- a relevancy rank is then determined for each intention object, and assuming each intention object is above the predefined threshold, a graphical representation of each intention object is presented to the user in a free form spatial canvas.
- the rearranging sock drawer intention object may have the highest relevancy ranking, followed by the dentist office intention object, and then finally the date with his wife.
- the intention objects may be presented to the user in this order in an ordered list.
- the method may also include determining an updated relevancy rank for each intention object and identifying a particular intention object with an updated relevancy rank that is below the threshold. In response to the particular intention object being below the threshold, the particular intention object is removed from the free form spatial interface and from the ordered list.
- an updated relevancy ranking for each intention object may be determined in response to the time of day being later than the dentist appointment without the user indicating that the dentist appointment was completed.
- the updated relevancy rank of the dentist appointment may then be determined to be below the predefined threshold.
- the graphical representation of the dentist appointment intention object may be removed from the free form spatial interface.
- the method may include accessing a collection of intention objects belonging to the user.
- Each of the intention objects may be comprised of a data structure including a plurality of activity attributes defining an intention of the user to undertake an intended activity.
- the plurality of activity attributes may comprise temporal attributes and contextual attributes including a location associated with the intended activity.
- the method may also include accessing calendar data from a calendar of the user and determining an available time slot on the calendar.
- a suggested intention object is selected from the collection of intention objects.
- the selection of the suggested intention object may be based on one or more of the plurality of activity attributes of the suggested intention object.
- the user may then be provided a scheduling suggestion including a suggestion to schedule the activity associated with the suggested intention object in the available time slot.
- the activity is scheduled in the available time slot.
- the calendar of the user may be accessed and it may be determined that the user currently has a 30 minute opening in his schedule. If the user is home (e.g., the location of his sock drawer), the user may then be provided with a suggestion to rearrange his sock drawer. Upon approval from the user, the rearranging of the sock drawer activity may be scheduled on the user's calendar. Alternatively, it may be determined that the user has a 2 hour opening in his schedule later that day. The user may then be provided a suggestion to schedule a date with his wife during that available time slot. Upon approval from the user, the date with his wife may be scheduled on the user's calendar.
- the method may include accessing a set of intention objects.
- Each of the intention objects may comprise a data structure including a plurality of activity attributes of an intended activity.
- the method may further include assigning particular intention objects of the collection of intention objects to a coarse time window.
- the assigning of intention objects to a coarse time window may be based on the attributes of the respective intention objects.
- the method may further include presenting at least a portion of the collection of intention objects to a user in a day view that is arranged based on the assigned coarse time windows. Consistent with this embodiment, a user may create new intention objects and have them quickly assigned to a coarse time window.
- a collection of intention objects belonging to a particular user may each have a start or due date on a particular day.
- the user may be presented with a day view of these intention objects, which may provide the user with a list of all activities for the particular day.
- the day view may be organized according to a number of coarse time windows based on the periods of the day. Accordingly, the day view may include a section for the “Morning,” “Afternoon,” and “Evening.”
- Each of the intention objects may be assigned to one of these coarse time windows based on the attributes of the respective intention object. For example, a particular intention object with a start time of 9:00 A.M. may be assigned to the “Morning” window.
- a new intention object expressing the intention of a user to undertake a new activity may be created and committed to being undertaken in the “Afternoon.”
- a graphical representation of this new intention object may subsequently be included in the day view within the “Afternoon” window.

- the contextual attributes 306 may, for example, include a location, a mental state of the user, a proximity to another user, a mode of transportation, or a particular environmental setting.
- the categorical attributes 308 include one or more categories or types of activities.
- the category is based on one or more of the temporal attributes. For example, an intention object with an activity that may depend on a relatively long period of time to complete may be classified as a “long term” intention object. In contrast, an intention object with an activity that may require only a relatively short period of time may be classified as a “short term” intention object.
- the category may be based on one or more contextual attributes. For example, an intention object with an activity that must be undertaken at the home of the user may be classified as a “household errand.”
- the intention object 300 may also include dependency attributes 310 .
- Dependency attributes 310 relate to dependencies of the intention object 300 and on other intention objects or additional users.
- the intention object 300 may be associated with or depend on one or more additional intention objects.
- the intention object 300 may depend on the additional intention object such that the activity of the intention object 300 must be undertaken or completed prior to the activity of the additional intention object.
- the dependency attributes 310 may also provide an indication of the order in which the activities are to be undertaken. In some embodiments, this order is determined based on the relevancy rank calculated by the relevancy ranking module 216 .
- the intention object 300 may depend on an activity, action, or event that does not correspond to an intention object.
- the dependency attributes 310 of the intention object 300 may also include information related to one or more additional users related to or important for undertaking the activity.

- activity data defining a plurality of activity attributes of an intention of a user to undertake an activity is obtained.
- the plurality of activity attributes may include at least one temporal attribute defining a time constraint relating to the intended activity and at least one contextual attribute identifying a context relating to the intended activity.
- the activity data defining the plurality of activity attributes may be obtained from a user via a user interface provided by the interface modules 114 .
- the obtaining of the activity data comprises obtaining a communication (e.g., a calendar event, an email, a text message, an instant message, a phone call, etc.) related to the activity and parsing the communication to determine the one or more activity attributes.
- a communication e.g., a calendar event, an email, a text message, an instant message, a phone call, etc.
- the content data may define one or more content items related to or required for the undertaking of the activity.
- the content data may be obtained from a user.
- the communication may be automatically included as part of the content data.
- an intention object is generated based on the plurality of activity attributes.
- the generated intention object may comprise a data structure including the plurality of activity attributes and the one or more content items.
- an additional attribute of the intention object is inferred based on the plurality of activity attributes.
- the additional attribute is a categorical attribute.
- the inferring of the additional attribute is based on a physical location of the user. For example, if the contextual attributes of a particular intention object indicate that the activity is to be undertaken at a first location, but the user is in a second location, the travel time for the activity may be inferred based on the location of the user.
- the inferring of the additional attribute is based on a particular client device being used by the user. For example, users with multiple devices may have certain devices for personal use and other devices for business use. If a user initiates the generation of an intention object from a device that is for personal use, it may be inferred that the intention object is in the category of “household errands.” Thus, a categorical attribute may be inferred.
- the intention object is updated to include the additional attribute.
- a context event is detected.
- the context event relates to one or more of the contextual attributes.
- the contextual attributes may specify a particular location and the GPS functionality of the client device may be used to determine the occurrence of a context event based on the current location of the user being at a location specified by the contextual attributes.

- the calendar data is analyzed to determine an available time slot in the user's schedule.
- a suggested intention object is selected from the collection of intention objects.
- the suggested intention object may be selected based on a combination of the length of the available time slot, the plurality of activity attributes of the intention object, and the relevancy rank of the intention object. For example, at operation 715 a fifteen minute available time slot in the schedule of the user may be identified and at operation 720 a particular intention object may be selected as the suggested intention object based on the particular intention object having a temporal attribute indicating that the corresponding activity may take fifteen minutes to complete. In another example, the intention object with the greatest relevancy ranking may be selected as the suggested intention object.

The number of coarse time windows may be predetermined or established based on user preferences. In some embodiments, the coarse time windows may include morning, afternoon, and evening.
- Each intention object may be assigned to a coarse time window based on the respective temporal attributes of the intention object. For example, an intention object having a temporal attribute indicating a start time of 9:00 P.M. may be assigned to the “evening” coarse time window. In another example, an intention object having a start time of 8:00 A.M. may be assigned to the coarse time window “before work,” assuming that the intention object corresponds to a user with a work schedule that begins after 8:00 A.M.
- a day view of at least a portion of the set of intention objects is presented to the user.
- the day view includes intention objects associated with a particular day. The association may be based on the temporal attributes of each respective intention object. For example, each intention object having a start date of Aug. 23, 2013, may be presented in the day view for the day of Aug. 23, 2013.
- the day view may be arranged according to two or more coarse time windows. The two or more coarse time windows correspond to the coarse time windows assigned to the set of intention objects at operation 810 . Example embodiments of the day view are discussed below in reference to FIG. 16A-16D .

- Software may accordingly configure a processor 1710 , for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.
- Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation, and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).
- a resource e.g., a collection of information

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors 1710 , not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor 1710 or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors 1710 may be distributed across a number of locations.
- the one or more processors 1710 may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a “cloud computing” environment or as a “software as a service” (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors 1710 ), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).)
