Definitions
- This invention relates generally to data protection, and more particularly to aspects of a novel digital watermark system and methodology for multimedia content, such as audio, video, text, still images, computer graphics, and software.
- a watermark is an imperceptible or at least difficult to perceive signal embedded into multimedia content such as audio, video, text, still images, computer graphics, or software.
- the watermark conveys some useful information without disturbing or degrading the presentation of the content in a way that is noticeable or objectionable.
- Watermarking techniques play an important role in protecting copyright ownership of digital contents including images, audio, and video.
- Watermarks may be used to identify the original owner of the content, to trace where pirate copies of the content come from (fingerprinting), and to determine royalty payments by monitoring the number of times content has been used. Watermarks may also be used to authenticate original content and to locate change in a corrupted or altered copy of the content. In order to encourage copyright owners to use watermarking schemes, four basic and conflicting requirements should be met.
- the distortion introduced by embedding the watermarks into content should be unperceivable by regular users.
- the watermarks should be secure so that they are hard to be modified or removed by the pirates.
- the watermarks should be robust against intentional attacks, ranging from simple content manipulation such as cropping, to common image processing techniques, such as filtering and compression.
- the overall cost of using watermarking should not be expensive.
- Watermarking schemes may be categorized as non-oblivious or oblivious, depending on whether the original content is available or not.
- Oblivious watermarking may be defined as a watermarking scheme in which the original image is not available during watermarking decoding.
- Non-oblivious image watermarking schemes in general may be more robust due to the accessibility of the original image because image distortions caused by image processing, transmission, or intentional attacks may be compensated for using the original image.
- the interference between the original image and the watermarks during watermark decoding may be removed by using the difference of the watermarked and original images.
- the requirement of accessing the original image is simply not practical. This may make oblivious watermarking the only choice.
- Watermarks may be embedded in the pixel or the transform domains.
- Two papers which discuss and compare different methodologies and watermarking schemes include “A fair benchmark for image watermarking systems”, by M. Kutter and F. A. P. Petitcolas, (SPIE Electronic Imaging'99: Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents, vol. 3657, January 1999), and “Comparing robustness of watermarking techniques” by J. Fridrich and M. Goljan (SPIE Electronic Imaging'99: Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents, vol. 3657, January 1999).
- Proposed transforms include DCT, DFT, LOT, wavelets, Hadamard transform and key-dependent transforms.
- the watermark signal in a transform domain may usually be related to that in the pixel domain by a linear transformation, if the transform itself is linear.
- the analysis may be applied to pixel-based approaches as well.
- Human visual models have been used to adjust watermark strength so that embedded watermarks may be invisible.
- Spread-spectrum techniques are widely used by most oblivious watermarking approaches. When extracting the watermark message, these methods may rely on the watermark information embedded in the middle frequencies, although the noise-like watermark signal may also be embedded in the low and the high frequencies.
- the watermark information in the high frequencies may be easily removed using low-pass filtering and JPEG compression, and humans may be able to tolerate high distortion there.
- watermark signals may have a high interference with the image itself. Note that the energy of a typical image may be concentrated in the lower frequencies.
- watermarks in the low frequencies in general may be more robust than that in the middle frequencies, with respect to image distortions that have low-pass characteristics, such as filtering. Examples of nonlinear filtering, may include median filting, lossy compression filtering, and adaptive Wiener filtering. Watermarks in the low frequencies may also be less sensitive to small geometric distortions (e.g., rotation, shifting, and scaling). Therefore, seeking oblivious watermark schemes unitizing the low frequencies and distortion compensation techniques without the original image have become two active research topics.
- Watermark attack and counterattack methods have been proposed. To overcome a geometric attack, small blocks of a corrupted image may be registered with an original pseudo noise signal using correlation matching. Watermarks may also be removed by capturing watermark information pixel by pixel with a sensitivity attack if a pirate has access to a device that can detect whether the content contains a watermark or not.
- a calibration pattern may be embedded into the Fourier transform in the log-polar coordinates, so that the shift, scaling, s and rotation of the image may be compensated.
- Some oblivious watermarking approaches using the low frequency bands have been proposed including embedding watermark information by swapping selected transform coefficients of 8 ⁇ 8 DCT blocks.
- the robustness of this type of approach may not be high and visible distortions may be introduced.
- Another approach includes embedding watermark message bits into disjoint triplets of wavelet coefficients, which may be chosen according to a key-dependent random sequence.
- the middle coefficient may be quantized by a quantization step, what is equal to the difference of the largest and the smallest values of the triplet, divided by a fixed scale factor.
- This approach may not be applied to DCT coefficients since the standard deviation of the DCT coefficients in low frequencies may typically be very high. This requires a large fixed scale factor, or equivalently a small quantization step, in order for the watermark to remain invisible. Therefore, the robustness has to be compromised. Similar quantization techniques have been proposed to embed a cartoon or map image into a host image.
- Yet another proposed method includes using the quantization index modulation to embed a watermark message into a host image. Message bits are used to select the pre-defined quantizers. Theoretical results for some channel models have been discussed. However, no experiments on real distortions have been reported.
- Watermarks inserted in the middle and high frequencies may typically be very robust with respect to noise adding, nonlinear deformations of the gray scale, (e.g., contrast/brightness adjustment, gamma correction, histogram equalization), and cropping. Since these advantages are complementary to that of low-frequency techniques, and watermarks of low and middle frequencies are embedded into disjoint portions of the spectrum, Fridrich proposed to embed both low and high frequency watermarks into the image. To decode the hidden message in the low frequencies without the original image, binary mapping may be used.
- a (watermark) mapping function also called an index function
- the watermarks may be easily removed by clustering the DCT coefficients using a histogram attack, which may search for the parameters of the mapping function. If the intensity of some of the original pixels are guessed and if the basis function is known, then the watermarks may be estimated and the general watermark system fails. To overcome the histogram and the watermark-estimation attacks, it has been proposed that some secret key-dependent basis functions could be used. Although this scheme seems to be able to achieve better robustness to different distortions and high security to attacks, it may require very high computation and a relatively large amount of storage to generate the basis functions and to find the corresponding transform coefficients.
- j 0,1, . . . , n p ⁇ 1 ⁇ consisting of the index of all n p pixels in a raster scan order.
- FIG. 9A shows some raster scan orders that may be used. The present invention may be practiced with any scan order, several of which are shown in FIGS. 9A , 9 B, 9 C, and 9 D.
- m(f o ) and ⁇ 2 (f o ) be the sample mean and variance of f o .
- the image may be normalized by the following transform so that its sample mean becomes zero and its coefficients of discrete cosine transform (DCT) may fall into a pre-specified range.
- DCT discrete cosine transform
- n w ⁇ 1 ⁇ consists of the index of DCT coefficients in a zig-zag order.
- the above mapping function is called an index function. It can be shown that the maximum difference between v i and v i ′ is less than
- the scale factor s may be used to compensate the change of variance due to image distortions
- the weighting factor ⁇ may be used to reduce the effect of small coefficients.
- the above binary watermarking has been shown by Fredrich to be robust for many attacks. However there arises a serious security problem. Since the watermarked coefficients u i ′ are always located in the middle of the quantization intervals with a fixed size, a pirate may search for the correct quantization step using a histogram attack. Once the quantization step is found, the watermarks may be modified or removed. The histogram may be formed from the quantized DCT coefficients with a guessed quantization step size. For the correct step size, a peak will be present in the middle of the quantization interval.
- Fridrich has observed this problem. He also discussed the security problem faced under the watermark-estimation attack. If the original intensity of some pixels of a watermarked image can be guessed, then the watermarks may be estimated and removed by solving a system of linear equations. To address both security problems, Fredrich proposed the use of key-dependent basis functions. He also demonstrated that his approach was quite robust to common distortions. However, his approach requires a high computation to generate the transform functions and to perform the forward or inverse transforms. To provide an alternative, the present invention will disclose a new class of mapping functions, which may require only simple operations. These mapping functions may be controlled by a secret key. To combat the watermark-estimation attacks, some counter-attacks will also be disclosed.
- What is needed is a simple and effective scheme to enhance the security and robustness of a low-frequency watermarking scheme that protects the watermarks by using a secret (watermark) mapping function instead of a secret transform basis function.
- the scheme should also reduce the interference between the watermarks and the image itself by using a key-dependent quantization function.
- the scheme should also be generalized so that it may be applied to pixel-domain watermarking schemes. To combat the watermark-estimation attack, a simple counterattack is also needed that that the use of key-dependent basis functions isn't needed.
- One advantage of the invention is that it that protects watermarks by using a secret (watermark) mapping function instead of a secret transform basis function.
- Another advantage of this invention is that it reduces the interference between the watermarks and the image itself by using a key-dependent quantization function.
- Yet a further advantage of this invention is that it is generalized so that it may be applied to pixel-domain watermarking schemes.
- a method for embedding a watermark into content contains content samples.
- the method including the steps of: receiving the content, creating a continuous watermark sequence from the watermark, for each content sample in a first predetermined order: calculating a sample mean, calculating a sample variance, and normalizing the content. Further steps include generating a set of content coefficients from the content, generating a set of watermark coefficients from the watermark sequence, embedding the watermark in the content by adjusting the amplitude of the watermark coefficients so that the distortion between the content coefficients and the associated watermark coefficients are minimized using a secret mapping function, and outputting the content.
- a method for a method for embedding a watermark into content wherein the step of embedding the watermark in the content is performed by adjusting the watermark coefficients sequentially in a second predetermined order.
- an apparatus for embedding a watermark data into content including: a content preprocessor, the content preprocessor further including: a mean calculator; and a variance calculator, a content coefficient generator for generating content coefficients from the preprocessed content; a watermark sequence generator for generating a watermark sequence from the watermark data; a watermark coefficient generator for generating watermark coefficients from the watermark sequence; and a watermark inserter for generating watermarked content.
- the watermark inserter may further include a key dependent sequencer; a secret mapping function device, the secret mapping function device receiving input from the key dependent sequencer; and a coefficient modifier for generating watermarked content by adjusting the amplitude of the watermark coefficients so that the distortion between the content coefficients and the associated watermark coefficients are minimized using the secret mapping function device.

- the present invention is a new method for watermarking content using a novel class of secure mapping watermarking functions using key-dependent mapping functions.
- the binary watermarking scheme disclosed by Fredrich and discussed in the background section may be defeated by a histogram attack because the DCT coefficients may be clustered in the middle of the interval for the correct quantization step size ⁇ .
- the present invention overcomes this security problem by first replacing the binary watermark sequence by a continuous sequence and by using secret mapping functions for different DCT coefficients. Replacing the binary watermark sequence by a continues sequence may cause the DCT coefficients after quantization to spread out in the quantization interval, making the search for the original quantization step size ⁇ difficult. Using secret mapping functions for different DCT coefficients may make the histogram attack impossible because the mapping functions may not be known and may be changed for different DCT coefficients.
- mapping functions may be used as the mapping functions.
- the functions may be generated by a program or retrieved from a look-up table. For the robustness concern to different distortions or attacks, it may be required that these functions are continuous or at least piecewise continuous. Otherwise, a small change of the DCT coefficients may introduce a big error in the estimated watermark.
- mapping functions may be rapidly computed or generated in real-time and/or they do not require a large space to store their values.
- the present invention may use mapping functions which preferably take a simple function form. Their parameters may be controlled by some key-dependent random sequences to offer security.
- the watermark sequence w i is an uniformly distributed random sequence with zero mean and unit variance, i.e. w i ⁇ [ ⁇ square root over ( 3 ) ⁇ , ⁇ square root over ( 3 ) ⁇ ].
- the quantization step size may be controlled by a key-dependent sequence ⁇ i .
- the above mapping function may be a sawtoothed function as shown in FIG. 8 B.
- the error ⁇ v may come from the quantization process.
- the watermark sequence may be determined by using the correlation in ( 6 ). Note that only u i ′′ may be required to find this watermark estimate. It means that the original image may not be required to extract the watermark sequence. Since the mapping function M 2 (u) may be easy to compute, the computation requirement for watermark encoding and decoding may be relatively low.
- mapping function M 2 (u) is preferably controlled by the secret random sequence ⁇ i and each DCT coefficient may have a different quantization step size, it may be very difficult for a pirate to estimate the mapping functions for all DCT coefficients or the watermark sequence. Note that both values of the watermark sequence and the ⁇ i may be continuous, which mat make estimation even harder. The histogram of the quantized DCT coefficients for different ⁇ may be quite random, demonstrating that the watermarks as well as the mapping functions may be protected under this attack.
- u i ′ q ( u i ′)+( ⁇ 1) l(u i ′) ⁇ i w l (12)
- FIG. 8C shows the triangle mapping function M 3 (u).
- the above watermark encoding and decoding may be modified as follows so that the final sign of the embedded watermark may be controlled by an additional key-dependent random sequence s i ⁇ 0, 1 ⁇ .
- One type of attack to a watermark system is to estimate the unknown watermarks from a given watermarked image f o ′, by assuming that part of the original image f o may be guessed or closely approximated. This is called the watermark-estimation attack. For example, the intensity of a uniform region in the original image may be reasonably approximated by the sample mean of that region. Assume that the watermark sequence is embedded in some transform coefficients.
- a sequential order may always be imposed to the index of the frequency components of a 2-D transform, such as a zigzag order of DCT coefficients.
- FIGS. 9A , 9 B, 9 C, and 9 D show examples of various orders that may be used.
- v i ′ be the corresponding watermarked coefficients.
- v di v i ⁇ v i ′.
- mapping functions are preferably unknown, the watermarks may not be determined even if the pirate knows the transform function. As a result, both Fridrich's and our approach may keep the watermarks secure, while our approach requires much lower computations.
- Another counterattack to offend the watermark-estimation attack may be to add some noise to the image to corrupt quality of the estimation of v di .
- the added noise may make the estimation of watermarks for this attack unusable.
- the approach of using the key-dependent basis functions may also fail.
- a pirate may select some well-known basis functions and estimate v i with respect to these basis functions.
- Such a replaced v i may still be used to remove the watermarks that are embedded in the transform coefficients with respect to the unknown key-dependent basis functions.
- the reason for that is the representation of the original image with respect to the basis functions may be unique, and the transform coefficients using two different basis functions may be related by a linear or non-linear transformation.
- the pixels in the watermarked image may be replaced by the pixels in the original image.
- V di may not be estimated because the left hand side of (23) may be equal to zero.
- the new transform coefficients of the new watermarked image with this replacement should be quite close to the original v i ′ because only a small portion of pixel intensities are affected.
- This treatment should not degrade the picture quality since it only brings the final image to be closer to the original, and most likely such substitution takes place at uniform regions.
- the detection of the watermark should also remain robust since the majority of the pixels are not altered and may be used for watermark decoding.

Description
Denoting the original and watermarked DCT coefficients off as vi and vi′, let iεĨ where Ĩ={i|i=0,1, . . . , nw−1} consists of the index of DCT coefficients in a zig-zag order. Then a binary watermark sequence wi,εĨ, wiε{−1, 1} may be embedded to f by adjusting the amplitude of vi′, so that the distortion between vi and vi′ is minimum and
w i =M 0(|v i′|) (2)
where the mapping function
If vi<1, vi′=vi. The above mapping function is called an index function. It can be shown that the maximum difference between vi and vi′ is less than |vi|α. In order to maximize the robustness with respect to image distortions, vi′ is chosen to be the middle point of interval I1l. To survive some common lossy compression and low-pass filtering, the watermarks may be embedded in the perceptually significant frequency bands with high energy, and the amount of change of different transform coefficients may be proportional to the amplitude of the coefficient itself. The watermark encoding and decoding may be simplified if they are performed in a log-magnitude domain. Let ui=1n|vi|, ui′=1n|vi′| and β=1n α. The 1-th interval in the log domain may be denoted by I21=[lβ, (l+1)β). The index of the interval where u is located may be determined by a locating function
The watermark may be generated by the following mapping function
and assign ui′=q(ui′), where q(ui)=(l(ui)+0.5)β is the quantization function. More specifically, if (−1)(u
u i ″=u i ′+n i (5)
and ni is the noise. Then the watermark sequence may be determined by using the following correlation function
where the scale factor s may be used to compensate the change of variance due to image distortions, and the weighting factor γ may be used to reduce the effect of small coefficients. The values Δs=¼ and γ=1 will be used in the disclosure of the present invention.
u i ′=q(u i′)+αi w i, (7)
and the closest ui′ with respect to ui is selected. It means that if ut=q(ui)+αiwi, then ui′ may be equal to ut, ut+βi or ut−βi, depending on which is closest to ui. For different DCT coefficients, the quantization step size may be controlled by a key-dependent sequence βi. The sequence βi may be uniformly distributed in Sβ=[βoi−Δβ, βoi+Δβ]. The watermark strength may be controlled by αi, which is preferably set to
in order to map a quantization interval to a full dynamic range of the watermark sequence. From (7), the new mapping function may be found as
The above mapping function may be a sawtoothed function as shown in FIG. 8B. From (7), it may be shown that, the i-th DCT coefficient after watermarking may be related to the vi and wi by
v i ′=v i exp(αi w i)exp(Δv) (9)
where Δv=q(ln|v′i|)−ln|vi|. The error Δv may come from the quantization process.
If the noise ni is of low energy, ui″ may fall into the same quantization interval as ui′, i.e. q(ui″)=q(ui′). It implies that wi=M2(ui″)−ni|αi. Therefore, a good estimate of wi from ui″ may be
ŵ si =M 2(u i″). (10)
The watermark sequence may be determined by using the correlation in (6). Note that only ui″ may be required to find this watermark estimate. It means that the original image may not be required to extract the watermark sequence. Since the mapping function M2(u) may be easy to compute, the computation requirement for watermark encoding and decoding may be relatively low.
To insert watermark, adjust ui′ so that
u i ′=q(u i′)+(−1)l(u
Similar to the saw-toothed function, if the noise ni is not large, i.e. q(ui″)=q(ui′), then wi=M4(ui″)−ni|αi. A good estimate of wi from ui″ without knowing the ui or ui′ becomes ŵti=M4 (ui″).
The watermark estimate of that becomes ŵbi=M1′(ui″).
w(u i)=f(A i , f i , θ i u i) (16)
Where Ai may be the amplitude, fi may be the period, θl may be the phase. This leads to
Hence
u i =q(u i)+,αi w l(u l)+θl]
Which leads to
W 2(u)=A i cos(2πf i(u i)+θi)
u i ′=u i′+(−1)l(u
A truncated function may be used
u i ′=t1(u i+(−1)l(u
n i=2kβ i +n ti , k=0, ±1, ±2, . . . (16)
where ntiε(−0.5βi−aiwi, 1.5βi−aiwi).
If ui″εRa, then
Therefore,
since
If ui″εRb and nli≧0, then
This may imply that
In other words,
For the triangle mapping function, if ui″εRa, i.e. (−1)l(ui′)=(−1)l(ui″), we have
On the other hand, if ui′εRb, i.e. (−1)l(ui″)=(−1)l(ui′)+1, then
Since αwi+nli=βi+(ui″−q(ui″)), Δwti) can be rewritten as
Table 2 summarizes these results.
If ui″εRb and
This leads to two different cases. If ui″εRb1; αiwi<βi-nli, then we have |Δwsi|>|Δwti|. Similarly, if ui″εRb2, aiwi≧βi−nli, we find |Δwsi|<|Δwti|.
Similar results for other cases can be derived. The results are summarized in Table 3.

where vdi=vi−vi′. Under the watermark-estimation attack, if a pirate guesses the original intensity of a sufficient number of pixels, the value of vdi may be determined by solving the above linear system. If the watermarking scheme is not properly designed, the watermark sequence wi may be easily estimated. For example, one approach may be to embed the watermark sequence wi as vi=vi(1+αwi),′. Given vi′ and vdi, the watermark sequence may be found by
Key-dependent basis functions may be used to protect the watermarks. Since the basis functions may be kept secret, a pirate may not find the transform coefficients, neither vi′ nor vdi. For key-dependent mapping functions as per the present invention, since the mapping functions are preferably unknown, the watermarks may not be determined even if the pirate knows the transform function. As a result, both Fridrich's and our approach may keep the watermarks secure, while our approach requires much lower computations.
