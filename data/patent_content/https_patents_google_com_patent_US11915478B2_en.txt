Definitions
- Semantic searching is looking for a specific object or environmental attribute, such as a lamp post or park land, by name rather than for an exact pattern of pixels.
- Traditional methods of semantic searching require manual review, and emerging methods require elaborately trained and tuned purpose-specific image recognition models.
- manual triangulation is very labor intensive, slow, and costly
- automated triangulation requires sophisticated and laboriously-created localization-specific image recognition models or very high-resolution imagery, and may still provide an imprecise location.
- general-purpose image classification models are becoming available for photo storage or web searching, these unspecialized models lack the precision to adequately localize objects.
- One aspect of the disclosure provides a method of determining a location of an object of interest.
- This method includes identifying, from a database of images, a set of plural images that relate to a region of interest, each of the plural images having associated therewith image capture information including at least an image capture location.
- the method further includes applying an image recognition tool to each image in the set of plural images; and determining, based on the applying of the image recognition tool, which of the images include the object of interest and which of the images do not include the object of interest.
- a likelihood value of the object of interest existing at the candidate location is calculated using the image capture information for images in the set of plural images determined to include the object of interest and using the image capture information for images in the set of plural images determined not to include the object of interest.
- the location of the object is determined using the likelihood values for the multiple candidate locations.

For each of multiple candidate locations in the region of interest, a likelihood value of the object of interest existing at the candidate location is calculated using the location information for images in the set of images determined to include the object of interest and using the location information for images in the set of images determined not to include the object of interest.

- FIG. 11 is a flow-diagram illustrating an example method of determining object locations using observations and non-observations according to aspects of the disclosure.
- the technology relates generally to image recognition and mapping. More particularly, information derived from both observations and non-observations is used to localize a particular object or feature. For example, to locate all fire hydrants within a target geographic region, image recognition may be performed on images of the region, where images including hydrants as well as images not including hydrants are used to more accurately compute the locations of each hydrant.
- the non-observations near an observation significantly narrow the range of places an object could be.
- the location of the object can be determined relatively easily and with relatively high confidence even if the images are not high resolution and/or are associated with low resolution or unreliable image capture information.
- This can allow object location identification to be performed using non-professional content, e.g. from smartphones, for instance.
- object location identification can be improved. Moreover, this can be achieved at no or relatively little computational cost.
- An initialized value is determined for a set of candidate locations for the particular object or feature.
- the initialized value for each candidate location may be set to zero or, in a more-sophisticated version, set to a prior likelihood value, prior to image recognition analysis, representing a likelihood that the object or feature is present in that location.
- a likelihood that the location contains a fire hydrant may be x%, based on a number of fire hydrants in the target area and a size of the target area.
- the candidate locations may each be defined by, for example, a discrete list of sites (e.g., only street corners), a grid or gridoid division of the target region into cells, a rasterized map of the target region (e.g., each pixel of the raster is a cell), or a continuous vector-and-gradient defined set of regions.
- an image recognition tool For each image in a plurality of images, an image recognition tool is applied to the image to obtain a score or confidence rating that the particular object or feature is visible in the image.
- This score or confidence rating may be converted into a normalized value indicating an amount that a likelihood of the object being located in a region depicted in the image increased after the image recognition. For example, where the prior likelihood (prior to image recognition analysis) that the image contains a fire hydrant is x%, after image recognition that likelihood may increase from x% to (x+n)% or decrease from (x%) to (x ⁇ m)% depending on whether or not a hydrant was recognized in the image.
- the prior likelihood may increase or decrease successively (additively or otherwise) into a posterior probability and/or a normalized likelihood score.
- a log Bayes factor may be used. This can provide a particularly computationally efficient manner of using both observations of the object and non-observations of the object to identify the location of the object.
- Candidate locations contained within a field of view of each image are identified, for example, using camera characteristics and pose.
- camera geometry plus some default horizon distance may define a sector, which is compared to the initialized set of candidate locations, to determine which candidate locations are contained within the sector.
- a falloff function may be used representing a probability that an object would be visible in the image conditional on it actually being there, for example, factoring in possible occlusion of the object in the image.
- the falloff function may be non-radial and/or location-dependent, for example, accounting for other factors like local population density or vegetation density which would increase the risk of occlusion.
- Using information relating to the orientation of an image capture device can allow improved object location detection. However, object location detection can be performed even if some or all of the images do not include image capture orientation information.
- a likelihood score may be computed for each candidate location determined to be visible in the image based on the normalized value and the initialized value for each of these location candidates. For example, the normalized value may be added to or multiplied with the initialized value, discounted if a falloff function is used.
- the likelihood score may be compared to a threshold, above which the object may be determined to be at the candidate location corresponding to that likelihood score.
- the likelihood score may be converted to a probability of the object or attribute being present at that candidate location. This can allow information to be used in object location identification even if there is not absolute confidence in object identification from the image recognition tool.

- FIG. 2 is a top-view illustration of example observations and non-observations of a particular object 205 .
- an image capture device moving along a roadway 210 captures images at each of a plurality of capture locations 221 - 225 along the roadway 210 .
- Each image has an associated field of view 23 - 235 .
- the image capture device would capture imagery of objects within field of view 233 .
- fields of view 233 and 234 which include the object 205 , are considered observations of that object.
- Fields of view 231 , 232 , and 235 which do not include the object 205 , are considered non-observations.
- Both the observations and non-observations are used to precisely determine a location of the object 205 .
- consideration of where the object 205 is not located helps to narrow the possibilities of where the object 205 is located.
- determining the location of the object 205 using observations and non-observations includes initializing a candidate set of detection locations, such as by setting to zero or setting to a likelihood that the candidate location, wherein the likelihood is determine prior to reviewing imagery. Such determination may be based on available information, such as zoning, population density, non-visual signals, etc. Then each image is reviewed to obtain a score or confidence rating that the object is visible in the image.
- the confidence rating is converted into a value that approximates the amount by which the post-image review odds of the object being located in that image's field of view exceed the prior odds, conditional on the observation of that image.
- the camera characteristics and pose are used to determine which candidate locations are contained in the field of view in this image.
- the candidate locations may be, for example, sectors defined by the camera geometry and some default horizon distance.
- the normalized value is then added or multiplied to the initialized value for each of the candidate locations determined to be visible in the image. As a result, a likelihood score for each candidate location is produced. The likelihood score may be compared to a threshold, above which it is determined that the object is located at the candidate location.
- greater precision may be achieved by using a falloff function, such as a radial falloff function, representing the probability that the object would be visible in each image conditional on it's actually being there. For instance, sometimes the object may be occluded in the image by other objects such as trees, cars, fences, etc. Even further precision may be achieved by using a non-radial or location-dependent falloff function. Such function may account for other factors like local population density or vegetation density which would increase the risk of occlusion. In these examples, the result is not just a simple boolean yes/no for containment but also includes a discount factor reflecting the likelihood of a false negative for reasons other than non-presence, such as occlusion.
- these techniques may also be used for determining precise locations of attributes. For example, a search may be performed for geographic areas that are sunny, such as for real-estate searching purposes. Accordingly, images depicting a natural light level above a threshold may be identified as observations, and images depicting a natural light level below the threshold may be identified as non-observations. Relevant timestamp information may also be considered, such as by limiting the searched images to those taken during a particular time of day (e.g., daytime). Image capture information associated with the non-observations may be used to help precisely locate the sunny areas.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of street-level imagery corresponding to the images captured from capture locations 221 - 225 .
- the imagery includes a plurality of individual images 341 - 345 which are overlapped, thus forming an extended or panoramic image.
- a field of view of each image 341 - 345 corresponds to the field of view 231 - 235 from image capture locations 221 - 225 .
- the object 205 corresponds to fire hydrant 305 .
- any other type of object or attribute may be searched, such as restrooms 362 , playground equipment 364 , weather conditions 366 , or any of a variety of other objects or attributes not shown.
- regions of interest may be defined by a grid including plurality of cells.
- FIG. 4 provides a top-view illustration of observations and non-observations in relation to a plurality of cells 455 in a grid 450 .
- Each cell 455 may correspond to a sub-division of a geographic region, with each cell being generally equal in size and shape.
- the cells may be defined by latitudinal and longitudinal points.
- the grid 450 may be used to define candidate locations for the object 205 . For example, prior to reviewing an images, a probability of each cell containing the object 205 may be determined. If the object 205 is a fire hydrant, for example, a number of fire hydrants in the geographical region may be known, and that number may be divided by the number of cells 455 . It may then be determined, for each image taken along the roadway 210 , whether the image points in a direction that includes a cell. For example, each image may be stored in association with the image capture location and also a direction, such as in a direction the image capture device was pointed.
- a probability of each cell containing the object 205 may be determined. If the object 205 is a fire hydrant, for example, a number of fire hydrants in the geographical region may be known, and that number may be divided by the number of cells 455 . It may then be determined, for each image taken along the roadway 210 , whether the image points in a direction that includes a cell. For example,
- the direction may be defined by conventional coordinates, such as North, West, etc., in relation to other objects, such as between First Street and Second Street, or by any other mechanism.
- Locations of the cells 355 may be known, and thus a comparison may be performed to determine whether the image includes cells.
- Each cell may be treated as a discrete data point, positive or negative.
- each of the cells 455 may be considered a candidate location for the object 205 .
- An initial probability of each cell including the object 205 prior to reviewing the images, may be approximately the same for each of the cells 455 .
- the images 341 - 345 may then be reviewed, for example, using an image recognition tool to detect objects in the images. Based on the review, a score or confidence rating may be computed for each candidate location, the score or confidence rating indicating a likelihood that the object is located within the candidate location. For each image, a normalization function may be used to convert this confidence rating into a value. In some examples, the normalization may include adjusting the prior computed probabilities for each cell 455 . For example, for each observation, the cells included in the fields of view 233 , 234 of those observations may be increased in probability that the object 205 is in that cell. Cells within fields of view 231 , 232 , 235 of non-observations may be attributed a decreased probability.
- Some cells in a particular field of view may be attributed a higher score or confidence rating than others, for example, based on location of the cell as compared to a general position of the object 205 within the reviewed image.
- the hydrant 305 is shown as positioned in a left portion of the image 343 . Accordingly, cells in a left portion of field of view 233 may attributed a higher confidence than cells in a right portion of field of view 233 .
- other camera characteristics and pose information may be used compute confidence ratings to candidate locations. For example, depth, focus, or any other information may be used.
- the confidence rating may be increased or further refined as successive images are reviewed. For example, if the image 343 corresponding to capture location 223 is reviewed first, each cell in field of view 233 may be attributed an increased probability of including the object 205 . If the image 344 corresponding to capture location 224 is subsequently reviewed, each cell in field of view 234 may be attributed an increased probability of including the object 205 . Because the cells including the object 205 are included within both fields of view 233 , 234 , those cells may result with a higher probability than others.
- the normalized value indicating an amount that a likelihood of the object being located in a region depicted in the image increased after the image recognition is then added or multiplied with the initialized value for each candidate location.
- the result for each candidate location may be compared to other results for other candidate locations. If the resulting value for a first candidate location is comparatively higher than the result for other locations, such as by a predetermined numerical factor, then the first candidate location may be determined to be the location of the object. In other examples, the result is compared to a threshold value. In this regard, a candidate location having a resulting value above the threshold value may be determined to be a location for the object.
- FIG. 5 is a top-view illustration of such an example. Images captured at various locations 521 - 525 may have corresponding fields of view 531 - 535 . In this example, each field of view 531 - 535 may be considered as having a radius around its respective capture location 521 - 525 . The candidate locations within such radial fields of view may include the entire radius or some portion thereof, such as cells or any other subdivision. Initialization and computation of confidence values based on image analysis may be performed as described above.
- FIG. 6 illustrates another example where directional information for the imagery is not used, though images captured from various angles are used.
- a first roadway 610 intersects with a second roadway 615 .
- Images are captured from locations 621 , 622 on the second roadway 615 , and from locations 623 - 625 on the second roadway.
- the positions of the capture locations 621 - 625 along different axes may further increase the accuracy of localization of object 605 .
- the object 605 is within the fields of view 632 and 633 , but not fields of view 631 , 634 , 635 .
- the confidence score computed for candidate locations within both fields of view 632 , 633 should be greater than those computed for other locations. Accordingly, the normalized value for such candidate locations within both fields of view 632 , 633 , which factors in non-observations from adjacent fields of view 631 , 634 , 635 should indicate a high likelihood of the object's presence.
- images are described as being captured from locations along a roadway, it should be understood that the images used to locate objects or attributes may be captured from any of a number of off-road locations.
- images may include user-uploaded photos taken in parks, inside buildings, or anywhere else.
- FIG. 7 illustrates another example using a bounding box to narrow the candidate locations for object 705 .
- a bounding box 760 is drawn around object of interest 705 .
- the object 705 is a fire hydrant.
- the bounding box 760 corresponds to a narrower slice 762 of the field of view 733 .
- candidate locations for which confidence score and normalized values are computed may be limited to locations within the narrower slice 762 . Accordingly, locations outside of the slice 762 but still within the field of view 733 may be considered non-observations and used to more precisely locate the object 705 .
- computation may be expedited since a reduced number of candidate locations may be analyzed.
- FIG. 8 provides a top-view illustration of example obstructions 871 - 873 , resulting in at least partial occlusion of object 805 .
- the obstructions 871 - 873 in this example are trees, although occlusion may occur from weather conditions such as fog, or any other objects, such as people, monuments, buildings, animals, etc.
- a radial falloff function may be used representing the probability that the object 805 would be visible in that image conditional on it's actually being there.
- a non-radial or location-dependent falloff function may account for factors like local population density or vegetation density which would increase the risk of occlusion. Accordingly, the confidence score includes a discount factor reflecting the likelihood of a false negative for reasons other than non-presence, such as occlusion.
- occlusion may occur as a result of performance of an image recognition tool.
- the image recognition tool may nevertheless fail to detect the object of interest, such as if the object of interest is far away, small, and/or only represented by a few pixels. Accordingly, a significance of an observation or non-observation may be discounted if an object is far away, small, represented by few pixels, etc.
- the falloff function may account for any of various types of occlusion or effects. For example, different types of occlusion may be added or multiplied when applying the falloff function. Further, the falloff function may be applied differently to observations than to non-observations. For example, non-observations may be discounted for occlusion, but not observations.
- the falloff function may also be trained, for example, if a location of a particular object of interest is known. If locations of every fire hydrant in a given town are known, and imagery for the town is available, various computations using different falloff functions may be performed, and the function producing a result closest to the known locations may be selected.
- a likelihood of occlusion may increase as a distance between an image capture location and an object of interest increases.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example probability of obstructions affecting observations.
- Object 905 is within a field of view 933 of an image captured from location 923 .
- the field of view 933 is subdivided into different regions 982 , 984 , 986 based on the probability of occlusion. For example, for any objects within first region 982 , which is closest to the image capture location 923 , the probability of occlusion is lowest. For objects within second region 984 , such as object 905 , the probability of occlusion is higher than for the first region 982 . For region 986 , which is furthest from the image capture location 923 , the risk of occlusion is greatest.
- the probabilities may be adjusted using iterative training based on observations.
- the computed location of objects of interest resulting from a semantic search may be used in any of a number of applications.
- the locations may be used to populate a map to show particular features, such as locations of skate parks, dog parks, fire hydrants, street lights, traffic signs, etc.
- the locations may also be used by end users searching for particular destinations or trying to understand the landscape of a particular neighborhood. For example, a user looking to purchase a house may wish to search for any power plants or power lines near a prospective home, and determine a precise location of such objects with respect to the home.
- the prospective homeowner may want to perform a more general search for areas that appear to be “rural,” for example, in which case localized objects or attributes such as trees or “green” may be returned.
- a marketer may wish to determine where particular industries are located in order to serve advertisements to such industries.
- the marketer may also want to know which of its competitors are advertising in a particular area.
- An employee of a power company may search for and locate all street lamps. These are just a few of numerous possible example uses.
- FIG. 10 illustrates an example output of semantic searching using observations and non-observations.
- a map 1000 is updated to indicate locations of particular objects.
- the object of interest in the semantic search may be, for example, a fire hydrant.
- markers 1012 , 1014 , 1016 , 1018 , and 1020 are displayed highlighting the locations of the fire hydrants in the displayed region. While markers are shown in FIG. 10 , it should be understood that any other indicia may be used, such as icons, text, etc.
- FIG. 11 illustrates an example method 1100 for accurately locating objects based on semantic image searching.
- Such methods may be performed using the systems described above, modifications thereof, or any of a variety of systems having different configurations. It should be understood that the operations involved in the following methods need not be performed in the precise order described. Rather, various operations may be handled in a different order or simultaneously, and operations may be added or omitted.
- geographic images relating to a region of interest are identified. For example, various images may be stored in association with information indicating a capture location for the images. If a user wants to search for objects within a particular neighborhood, city, country, or other region, images having capture location information within that region may be identified.
- each of the identified images may be reviewed, such as by applying an image recognition tool.
- any images in which the object of interest is not detected may be separately identified and/or marked.
- Each of the images identified in blocks 1120 and 1130 may include a plurality of candidate locations.
- a likelihood of the object of interest existing at the candidate location is computed.
- the likelihood may be computed using image capture location information for the images in block 1120 and the images in block 1130 .
- the likelihood may also be computed using directional or pose information and other information, such as camera optical characteristics or factors relating to possible occlusion.
- a location of the object of interest is determined using the likelihood value.
- the likelihood value may be normalized, added to an initial value, and compared to a threshold. If the resulting value for a particular candidate location is above the threshold, the location of the object of interest may be determined to be the same as that candidate location.
- the location of the object can be determined relatively easily and with relatively high confidence even if the images are not high resolution and/or are associated with low resolution or unreliable image capture information.
- This can allow object location identification to be performed using non-professional content, e.g. from smartphones, for instance.
- object location identification can be improved. Moreover, this can be achieved at no or relatively little computational cost.
- images may be images in the traditional sense, such as a collection of pixels, or they may be frames from a video, video observations (e.g., a section of a video), LIDAR imaging, radar, imaging, sonar imaging, or even “listening” observations like audio recordings or radio frequency reception.
- video observations e.g., a section of a video
- LIDAR imaging e.g., radar
- imaging e.g., sonar imaging
- listening” observations like audio recordings or radio frequency reception.
- the image recognition performed in these examples may be video recognition, LIDAR recognition, audio recognition, etc. Accordingly, observations and non-observations using any of these or other types of imaging may be used to precisely locate an object or attribute.
