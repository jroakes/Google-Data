Definitions
- the invention generally relates to information extraction. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for detecting and extracting information from articles.
- Documents are, for example, web pages of various formats, such as HTML, XML, XHTML, Portable Document Format (PDF) files, and word processor, database, and application program document files. This is especially due to the continued growth in the number of computer users, services and applications offered for example on the web, and the amount of information being added to the web, enterprise computer networks and other databases.
- PDF Portable Document Format
- a search engine or search engine program is a widely used mechanism for allowing users to search vast numbers of documents for information.
- a search engine provides a user interface that includes a query field.
- a user can enter one or more search terms describing the desired information in the query field.
- the search engine attempts to locate, rank, sort and then return for display the search results, usually as a list of relevant documents.
- a hyperlink to each document is included in the list.
- the list can also contain an excerpt of text from the document meant to summarize the content corresponding to the link to aid the user in assessing the relevance of each search result.
- search engines match the search terms to the documents as a whole. If the user is interested in specific information, for example, “sharks”, but a particular document about “beaches around the world”, for example, only has one sentence about sharks, it is unlikely that the search engine would return the document. Documents like the one described are likely to score very low under the query for “sharks”, if at all, because the document as a whole is not “about” sharks. Yet the specific sentence within this document may be what the user is looking for. Search engines typically do not allow users to detect and extract such details within documents. Conventional search engines generally do not allow the user to specify portions of the documents to be returned in the search results.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for detecting and extracting information from articles.
- One aspect of an embodiment of the present invention comprises defining target rules for detection of target hits in an article, including defining a target article region, defining extraction rules based on the target rules for the extraction of extracts from the article, including an extraction article region, applying target rules to each target article region of the article to determine target hits, and applying extraction rules to detect at least one extract from the article based on the determined target hit.

- a gist can be a vector of weighted concepts. The gist can be defined by a user or can be a calculated gist of the article.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary method 200 in accordance with the present invention in detail.
- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by any of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIG. 2 .
- the method 200 shown provides a method for detecting information in documents and extracting the information from documents.
- a concept set can be defined by a user 212 a on a client device 202 a interacting with the concept set processor 126 .
- the concept set processor 126 allows the user, through a user interface, to define the concept set.
- a concept is a lexical concept that can be defined by a group of related words, relationships with related concepts, the strength of the relationship, and other statistics about concept usage in language.
- a concept is a cluster of words.
- a concept set can contain a list of concepts that can be combined with set operations, such as, for example, AND, OR, and AND NOT.
- Each concept list can contain an origin concept, relations and distances.
- Relations can define a relationship between the origin concept and an evaluated concept and can be, for example, “is a product of”, “is a part of”, “is a kind of”, “has kind”, and “has part”.
- the relation “single concept” can be used when no relations are desired.
- a distance can be a representation of the strength of the relationship between the origin concept and an evaluated concept. If the relation is “single concept”, the distance is zero. By choosing a distance of “unlimited” requires only that some relationship exits, no matter what the strength.
- an origin concept of “dog”, a relation of “is a kind of” and a distance of “unlimited” can produce a list of all types of dogs.
- Another concept list can be defined with an origin concept of “cataract”, a relation of “single concept”, and a distance of “0”. This “cataract” concept can then be combined with the “dog” concept using the AND operation to define a concept set concerning cataract problems with dogs.
- Target rules can be defined by a user 212 a on a client device 202 a interacting with the target rule processor 130 .
- the target rule processor 130 allows the user through a user interface to define target rules.
- Target rules specify a particular kind of target to be detected and the rules for how a hit on the target should be scored.
- the target rule processor 130 can allow a user to select from predefined rules or can allow the user to define new rules.
- Target rules can include a target definition, a target scope and a target score formula.
- the target definition is what the user wants to detect and can relate to a single concept or multiple concepts.
- the target scope defines the size of a document region the user wishes to identify and can be, for example, a document, a paragraph, a sentence, a concept, or a term.
- the target score formula is used to determine a target score for each document region as specified in the target scope.
- the target score represents how well the requirements for the target rule are satisfied by the document region.
- a target hit is a document region that is determined to be relevant based on the target score and can be a document region with a non-zero target score.
- the target definition can be simple or can be complex having multiple sub-rules.
- a target can be defined by a contributor or multiple contributors.
- Contributors can be a concept, a concept set, a gist or a combination thereof.
- a gist can be, for example, a vector of weighted concepts.
- a gist can be the list of concepts concerning computer manufactures, computer mouse and China and can be weighted 40%, 40% and 20% respectively.
- a user can define a gist or specify that an existing gist determined for a document region, such as a document, be used.
- Each contributor can have a specific method that describes the kind of comparison to be performed when evaluating whether a contributor is present in a document.
- a contributor can have an associated categorization-like method, an inverse categorization-like method, a similarity to gist method or a concept set hit method.
- the first three methods can be used when the contributor is a gist and the fourth method can be used when the contributor is a concept set.
- Every region gist in a document is “categorized into” a specified gist.
- An example of this type of method is the detection of “sentences about topics within sports”.
- a contributor is defined for the target rule that has a sentence target scope and the categorization-like method, with the gist specified as the concept “sports”. Sentences that have meanings that could be categorized under the wider topic of “sports” will receive target scores for such a rule, based on how well they relate.
- the contributor acts as the “category” into which the specified gist is “categorized”.
- An example of this type of method is the detection of “concepts that represent topics into which Fred Astaire might be categorized”. This might lead to concepts such as “movies”, “actor”, and “dancing” to be recognized in a document region and used as contributors for the target rule.
- the similarity to gist method blends the previous two methods.
- this method the gist of a potential contributor is tested against the gist specified in the rule in both directions, to see if either categorizes well into the other.
- the effect of this is to detect any potential contributors that are closely related to the gist in the rule, containing either narrower or broader related topics.
- a user can define the gist or the user can specify that the gist of a document region be used. If a user defines a gist, as in the examples above, the detection is performed against the values of the gist specified. However, instead of requiring a specific gist, a user can request that the gist of the detected document region be used, which changes the nature of the contributor. For example, instead of looking for “sentences about sports”, the rule can instead be looking for “sentences about what the document as a whole is about”.
- the concept set hit method involves looking for a contributor that has a match for a concept set.
- a concept set can be specified that contains a list of concepts of interest and can be combined with set operations.
- the concept set can be created separately by the user and stored in the detection database 122 . If any of the concepts in this list are found in the text, a contributor to the targeting rule can be created.
- An example of this method is in the detection of “NASDAQ companies” appearing in a document. First, a concept set defining the list of companies is created. Then a targeting rule is created that has a contributor with a term scope. The concept set hit method is then requested, and the “NASDAQ companies” concept set is named as the one to use.
- the target score assigned to a contributor using the concept set hit method is based on the likelihood that the desired concept or concepts actually appeared in the document region. This value may depend on the ambiguity of the term in question.
- the term “Microsoft” has extremely high likelihood of representing the concept of Microsoft Corporation.
- the term “bank” has a low base likelihood of meaning “river bank”, and therefore the score for this term, as a representative of the concept set containing the concept “river bank”, may be low.
- the target score formula can be selected from a list of predefined formulas or can be defined by the user.
- the contributors act like variable names and are combined together using mathematical operators to produce a final score.
- the first contributor is named “SoftwareMakers” and looks for matches on a concept set that defines a set of software companies.
- the second contributor is named “Publishers” and uses a concept set containing a set of publishers.
- the user desires to identify any sentence that mentions either a software company or a publisher, and if both appear, it's even better.
- the scores for each contributor can be added together and the target score formula can be like equation 1.1 below.
- the score formula for this example can be like equation 1.2 below. (0.25*SoftwareMakers)+(0.75*Publishers) 1.2
- Block 204 is followed by block 206 , in which extraction rules are defined.
- the extraction rules are defined by a user 212 a on a client device 202 a interacting with the extraction rule processor 134 .
- the extraction rule processor 134 allows the user through a user interface to define extraction rules. Extraction rules specify what kind of document region is to be extracted from the document and what target rules must be hit within these regions in order for them to be deemed significant.
- Extraction rules can include an extraction scope, a sort order, and the targeting rules to which the extraction rules relate.
- the extraction scope can define the document region to be extracted and can be, for example, document, paragraph, sentence, concept, or term. In one embodiment, the extraction scope is equal to or greater than the target scope.
- the sort order is the order in which the extracts can be displayed to the user or stored, such as, for example, score, alphabetical, ascending and descending. Score order can be based on an aggregated score calculated for the extracts. The aggregate score can be a maximum, minimum, sum, count, or average of all the target scores for the extract.
- the target hits and target scores are used by the extraction rules to determine what to extract.
- a user can define a threshold in the extraction rules that the target score must be equal to, or greater than, or less than in order for the target hit to be extracted.
- the extraction rules can also contain rules concerning the output form of text. For an example with a sentence target scope, the entire document can be extracted with the sentences considered target hits highlighted.
- Block 206 is followed by block 208 , in which a document or multiple documents are accessed.
- the documents can be accessed and received by the detection engine from the document database 124 , another server device via network 106 or another device.
- the documents can be preprocessed prior to access to determine the concepts contained in each document and the gist of each document.
- Block 208 is followed by block 210 , in which the target rules are applied to each document by the targeting processor 132 .
- Each document is processed to determine a target score for each document region contained in the document by applying the target rules.
- the document region is defined by the target scope.
- the granularity of the processing can depend on the target scope and the contributor type. For example, if a contributor is a user's defined gist and the target scope is the document, then the processing granularity is the document. If a contributor is a user's defined gist and the target scope is a sentence then the processing granularity is every sentence, such that the target score formula is evaluated at every sentence.
- a target hit is determined by a non-zero target score.
- the target hits with associated target scores for each document have been determined.
- Block 210 is followed by block 212 , in which the extraction rules are applied to each document by the extraction processor 136 .
- the target score for each target hit can be evaluated by the extraction processor 136 using the extraction rules.
- Each target hit that meets the requirements of the extraction rules is marked for extraction and considered an extract.
- the extraction processor 136 checks to see if the extract corresponds to an existing extract.
- the existing extract can be stored, for example, in the detection database 122 . If an existing extract exists, it is called up by the extraction processor 136 . Once an extract exists, either through calling up an existing extract or determining an extract, the extraction processor 136 computes an aggregated score for the extract.
- the aggregated score can be the aggregate of the individual target scores for the extract.
- the extraction processor 136 processes the extracts according to any output limitations specified in the extraction rules. For example, if the extraction rules specify allowing a specified number of extracts, the extracts are sorted by score, a cutoff point is determined based on the specified number, and the list of extracts is truncated. The extraction rules can further specify sorting the extracts, such as in alphabetical, ascending or descending order and the extracts are, thus, further sorted by the extraction processor 136 . If the extraction rules specify specific formatting of the extracts, the extraction processor 136 processes the extracts for the formatting. For example, the extraction rules can specify that certain concepts are highlighted or sentences containing certain concepts are highlighted.
- Block 212 is followed by block 214 , in which extracts are output.
- the extracts can be output from the extraction engine to a user's client device through the network 106 .
- the extracts can be output to another device on the network 106 and/or stored in the database 120 or other storage device.
- Block 214 is followed by block 216 , in which the method ends.
- Information that can be detected and extracted using one embodiment of the present invention can be, for example, without limitation, the following:
