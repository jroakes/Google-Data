Definitions
- This invention relates to advertising.
- Computer users can receive e-mail, news, games, entertainment, music, books, and web pages all with a simple Internet connection (and with improved quality on a broadband connection).
- Internet users also have access to a plethora of services such as maps, shopping links, images, blogs, local search, satellite images, group discussions, hosted content, and e-mail. These service providers may track users' interactions with such services to determine associated metrics and/or modify these services based on such interactions to further enhance the user experience.
- a method includes receiving a request for an advertisement to embed in a Web page identifying one or more search results.
- the search results are based, at least in part, on a name of an individual.
- One or more advertisements associated with the name of the individual are identified.
- FIG. 1 is a is a block diagram illustrating an example system for providing name-based advertisements in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example system including name-based advertisements in accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method for providing name-based advertisements in the system of FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for selecting advertisements based, at least in part, on search queries associated with names.
- the system 100 may identify a search query for a person and select one or more advertisements for embedding in the search results based, at least in part, on the searched name.
- embedded name-based ads may include information associated with a specific individual and/or a group of individuals identified by the searched name(s).
- the system 100 may select ads based on one or more of the following: name entered in a search query (e.g., a query targeting a specific person), names contained in the search results (e.g., from queries that are not named-based), or some combination of names from the search query and search results.
- the system 100 may provide name-based embedded advertisements based on the name Sree Sriharikota.
- Such ads may be based on the individual's (e.g., Sree Sriharikota's) person profile.
- a name-based ad for Sree may be based on information in a personal profile generated for Sree Sriharikota, such as Sree's name, age, birth date, income, gender, location, ethnicity, nationality, religion, marital status, occupation, professional interests, and preferences for music, TV and movies.
- Sree's person profile indicates that she is a wealthy professional women who likes classical music
- the system 100 may, for example, provide embedded advertisements for expensive tickets to a nearby romantic opera.
- an individual's person profile may include one or more of the following: psychographic, demographic and/or behavioral.
- the category of psychographic variables may relate to the individual's personality traits (e.g., interests, attitudes, opinions, lifestyle and values). For example, an individual's religion and/or cultural background may be modeled in psychographic variables.
- the category of demographic variables may include age, gender and/or other statistical data.
- the category of behavioral variables may serve to define the individual's propensity to use specific products. For example, an individual's likelihood to buy certain quantities of name-brand merchandise may be represented by behavioral variables, such as brand loyalty and consumption rates, that may have been compiled, for example, from past purchases.
- the system 100 may use various combinations of psychographic, demographic and/or behavioral variables that are appropriate to the ad. For example, ads for products generally used by women in their seventies may be just as pertinent to members of that group regardless of their personality traits. In another example, the system 100 may target an ad for golf vacations in Arizona to retired men who are known to have visited Arizona in the past, as indicated by their person profiles.
- the system 100 may, alternatively or in combination, employ one or more name-based profiles (e.g., based on etymology and/or anthroponymy) that include information associated with first names and/or surnames, such as geographic region, language, root information, etc.
- name-based profile may associate a surname such as Sriharikota with a remote region in India, while a surname such as McKeevechester may be associated with an obscure location in Scotland.
- names may be popular names or rare names. Popular names may typically be more prevalent in certain parts of the world, or at least may be known to have originated from certain geographic areas. For example, the names Anderson and Erickson may be associated with people whose families originated in Europe.
- Popular names may be further categorized by gender because female names tend to differ from male names. For example, Bob may typically be associated with a male, and Mary with a female. Having the ability to differentiate names (e.g., by geographic area and/or gender) may provide the advantage of targeting ads to individuals who are generally more likely to respond to the ads. Additionally, aggregated profiles, based on groups of names, may help the system 100 target ads more effectively by presenting ads to individuals in those groups. For rare names, the system 100 may use information not readily available in existing person profiles. In some implementations, the system 100 may build person profiles for rare names using past activity on the Web provider and/or public profiles stored in social networking sites (e.g., Myspace, linkedin, hi5, friendstar, etc.). These profiles may be built in an offline manner based on the content crawled or stored in logs and may be further updated at query time based on the search results provided for an individual.
- social networking sites e.g., Myspace, linkedin, hi5, friendstar, etc.
- the system 100 may use identifying information from the name-based search results to select associated ads.
- the name-based search query may generate search results containing information associated with the name such as information identifying their interest (e.g., triathalons), careers (e.g., research articles on robotic vision), as well as other information.
- the system 100 may use frequently-occurring words contained in a subset of the search results (e.g., the top ten entries) to select one or more ads. For instance, if the top ten search results include several Web sites describing robotic toys, the system 100 may select one or more ads for local hobby or specialty shops that sell or service robots.
- the system 100 may automatically generate one or more profiles for the specific individual in response to an event (e.g., request, a specified number of queries). For example; the system 100 may automatically generate a first profile including biographical information and a second profile including interest for a specific individual. In analyzing the associated search results, the system 100 may use the content on these web pages as well as any anchor text pointing to these web pages to generate a list of weighted keywords and phrases for this person. The system 100 may use techniques such as NLP and/or sentiment detection. In addition, the system 100 may use specialized rules to identify characteristics of a person.
- an event e.g., request, a specified number of queries.
- the system 100 may automatically generate a first profile including biographical information and a second profile including interest for a specific individual.
- the system 100 may use the content on these web pages as well as any anchor text pointing to these web pages to generate a list of weighted keywords and phrases for this person.
- the system 100 may use techniques such as NLP and/or sentiment detection.
- the system 100 may include specialized rules to determine whether the person is a scholar (has a home page on a university site, has publications etc.) and/or an entrepreneur (is mentioned on company websites under senior management or board of directors etc.), is an actor (mentioned on IMDB pages) etc.
- the system 100 may derive information for the person profiles by using contents from the search results, such as key words occurring frequently in the search results.
- the system 100 may generate profiles based, at least in part, on information included in social networking sites.
- the system 100 may query a plurality of social network sites (e.g., MySpace, Facebook) to retrieve publicly available information associated with a specific individual.
- the system 100 may receive information from public databases, personal Web sites and/or other publicly available information (e.g., court records, Driver-Motor-Vehicle records, SEC filings, criminal records).
- the system 100 may use NLP, sentiment detection to extract weighted keywords and phrases corresponding to interests, likes, dislikes etc. In some implementations, the system 100 aggregates such keywords and phrases across a plurality of publicly available sites such as social networking sites. In addition, the system 100 may use specialized rules to identify characteristics of a person represented in the public information. For example, the system 100 may include specialized rules to determine whether is in a high income bracket and, as a result, may be included in SEC filings.
- the system 100 may use an aggregate of the names to provide targeted ads. For example, if most of the names in the search results are male names, the system 100 may select ads that are generally more tailored to males. In another example, if the names contained in the search results are determined by the system 100 to be related to sports figures, ads corresponding to sporting events and/or sporting goods may be selected. Such ad generation based on groups of names may use aggregate profiles that associate characteristics of groups of individuals with the types of ads to which they may have a higher probability of responding.
- Name-based ads may include (among other things) primary content, secondary content, and/or sponsored content.
- each ad may be a text element, a graphics element, a multimedia element, a network link to a second application, a network link to a remote module, an executable, or any other graphical or display element.
- an ad may include or reference a publicly-available Web page (or portion thereof), an internal e-mail, the user's personal contact information, weather information, a profit and loss report of a company, an OLAP (on-line analytical processing) report, portion of a sales order, as well as many others.

Using the identified information, the selection engine 208 may select or otherwise identify one or more ads 116 for presenting with the search results. As mentioned above, the selection engine 208 may select ads 116 based on names contained in the search results. In some implementations, the selection engine 208 may use the person profiles 117 and/or name-based profiles 118 to identify ads 116 . In comparing the search criteria to the one or more selection criteria 204 , the selection engine 208 may determine associations between keywords and one or more Web sites.
- the client 102 transmits, to the search engine 104 , a request to identify Web sites associated with specified search criteria including one or more names of individuals.
- the request engine 122 identifies one or more search indexes 202 in accordance with the search criteria and, using these search indexes, identifies Web sites associated with the search criteria.
- the selection engine 208 identifies information associated with the searched names. For example, the selection engine 208 may identify information using the search results, one or more person profiles 117 , and/or one or more named-based profiles 118 .
- the selection engine 208 selects one or more ads 116 in accordance with selection criteria 204 .
- the request engine 122 generates the Web page 112 including the selected ads 116 .
- the request engine 122 transmits the Web page 112 to the client 102 for display through GUI 110 .
- the system 100 may employ one or more thresholds for determining, for example, if search requests based on the name of an individual are sufficient for creating one or more personal profiles 117 and/or name-based profiles 118 .
- the system 100 may generate profiles for someone named Iwanna Karlandcyzk only after the number of queries has reached a predetermined threshold (e.g., 1000 or more).
- the system 100 may also wait until a sufficient amount of personal information is available in order to build suitable person profiles 117 and/or name-based profiles 118 .
- the system may use a smaller threshold (e.g., 100 search results corresponding to a person name) when determining the point at which to update profiles 117 and/or 118 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 300 for selecting name-based advertisements for embedding in Web page presenting search results.
- method 300 describes an example technique where advertisements are selected for embedding in Web page search results in accordance with selection criteria.
- System 100 contemplates using any appropriate combination and arrangement of logical elements implementing some or all of the described functionality.
- Method 300 begins at step 302 where the search query are parsed for person names. For example, a name may be contained in the search query executed by a user of client 102 .
- the system determines if one or more person profiles exist for the person name(s) identified in step 302 . For example, if the user submits a search query for Jane Doe, the system may determine if one or more person profiles 117 exist for Jane Doe. If person profiles are found to exist at decisional step 304 , then at step 306 , ads are selected based on the characteristics of the personal profiles. Continuing the example above, the system may select one or more ads that match the characteristics of Jane Doe stored in person profiles 117 . In particular, if Jane Doe likes to sew and enjoys sports, an ad may be selected by the system 100 for nearby fabric stores having sales on sport-themed material.
- the system determines if name-based profiles exist. For example, if the user's query produces search results having a name (e.g., Sophie Erickssonn) for which no person profiles 117 exist, the system may check for the name-based profiles for Sophie and/or Erickssonn. If name-based profiles are found to exist at decisional step 308 , then at step 310 , the identified name-based profiles are used to identify name-based ads. For example, the system 100 may determine that Sophie is a female name and Erickssonn is a Swedish name. Using such information, the system may identify name-based ads that may be of interest to Scandinavian woman.
- a name e.g., Sophie Erickssonn
- the system selects ads based on words contained in the search results. For example, if the search results returned to the user of the client 102 contain several Web sites including the identified name, then the system 100 may use frequently-occurring words found in a subset of the search results (e.g., the top ten entries) to select ads for presenting with the search results. For example, if the top ten search results make numerous references to robotic vision, the system 100 may select ads associated with robots for presenting with the search results.
- a subset of the search results e.g., the top ten entries
