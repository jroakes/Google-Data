A plurality of examples of the session characteristics that can be used for statistical model have been described above.But, those skilled in the art will recognize that: can use other session characteristics,, perhaps combine with any above-mentioned session characteristics as selection.
Be back to Fig. 5, can derive statistical model then, be used for determining that each selected advertisement is the probability (frame 250) of the good quality advertisement of the given session characteristics of surveying that is associated with advertisement selection.Can use existing statistical technique (for example logistic regression) to derive and the corresponding to statistical model of principle of the present invention.Recurrence comprises to be found to be used for outcome variable (dependent variable y) and one or more fallout predictors (independent variable x
1, x
2, etc.) relevant function.The function of following form is supposed in simple linear regression:
Y=c
0+ c
1* x
1+ c
2* x
2+ ... equation (1)
And find c
0, c
1, c
2Deng value (c
0Be called as " intercept " or " constant term ").In the context of the present invention, each fallout predictor variable x
1, x
2, x
3Deng corresponding to the different sessions feature that records during the advertisement selection.Logistic regression is the distortion of common recurrence, when the result who observes is defined as two values is of great use, the generation of its certain result event of ordinary representation or not generation, (being encoded as 1 or 0 usually respectively) is such as good advertisement or difference advertisement in the context of the present invention.
Logistic regression produces the formula of the probability that takes place being predicted as the function of independent prediction variable.Logistic regression meets specific sigmoid curve by taking linear regression (above-mentioned equation (1)) (it will generate any y value between positive infinity and minus infinity) and with following function it being carried out conversion:
P=exp (y)/(1+exp (y)) equation (2)
Wherein produce the P value that is positioned between 0 (when y reaches minus infinity) and 1 (when y reaches positive infinity).With equation (1) substitution equation (2), like this, the probability of good advertisement becomes as follows:
Equation 3
C wherein
G0Be the constant of equation, c
GnBe session characteristics predictive variable x
nCoefficient.Similarly, can determine the probability of difference advertisement by following equation (4):
Equation 4
C wherein
B0Be the constant of equation, c
BnBe session characteristics predictive variable x
nCoefficient.
Can the test statistics model meet is to determine which session characteristics is with good or to differ from the quality advertisement relevant.If use the logistic regression technology to determine statistical model, then the purpose of this logistic regression is correctly to predict the result of each situation by using the most thrifty model.In order to realize this purpose, create a model, comprising prediction dependent variable y as a result the time useful all fallout predictor variablees (for example session characteristics).In order to make up statistical model, logistic regression can be at each coefficient (c
n) be increased or delete meeting of back test model, be called as progressively recurrence.For example, can use oppositely progressively to return, wherein model construction is from complete or saturated model, and eliminates fallout predictor variable and their coefficient in iterative process from model.After eliminating each variable, test meeting of this model, to guarantee the still enough and data fit of this model.In the time can't eliminating the fallout predictor variable again from model, the structure of this model has just been finished.Stay fallout predictor variable (each is corresponding to the session characteristics of being surveyed) identification and the good or relevant session characteristics of difference advertisement in the model.Thereby logistic regression can provide the relation between the different fallout predictor variablees and the understanding of intensity.Comprise or the importance eliminated and the process of testing coefficient and their corresponding fallout predictor variablees can comprise several different known technologies in order to understand from model.Such technology can comprise the Wald test, similarity ratio testing or Hosmer-Lemshow Goodness of Fit test.These coefficient measuring technologies are known in this area, and will be not described further here.In other are realized, can use existing cross validation and independent training technique, the technology that replaces aforesaid classification to estimate and test regression coefficient.
Replace or, can use other existing statistical techniques to derive and the corresponding to statistical model of principle of the present invention except logistic regression.For example, use " branch end " model of " (boosting) promotes to a higher rank " technology can be used to the statistical model of deriving.What those skilled in the art will recognize that is, " promoting to a higher rank " is a kind of machine learning techniques, is used for setting up statistical model by the statistical model that improves continuously a little less than other.Its basic thought is repeatedly to use identical algorithm to whole training data set, but in each stage training data is carried out differently weighting.This weighting is feasible to receive relative little weight with the fine situation about meeting of model at stage k+1 by stage k, and receives relative big weight with the situation that model not too meets at stage k+1 by stage k.
The branch end is the weak statistical model that can both use in each stage.The branch end is 2 leaf classification trees, and it is made of root node and binary rules, and it is divided into two subclass of repelling mutually (that is leaf node) with situation.Rule can be taked form " click duration (ClickDuration)＜120 second ", and clicks the duration and satisfy this regular all situations and enter a leaf node, does not enter another leaf node and do not satisfy this regular situation.Another rule can be taked form " advertisement selection is last advertisement selection ", and advertisement selection satisfies this regular all situations and enter a leaf node, does not enter another leaf node and do not satisfy this regular situation.
Can use various algorithms to meet " promote to a higher rank branch end " model, for example comprise method based on gradient.Such algorithm can followingly carry out: given one group of weight, from all possible scale-of-two decision rule, (from the session characteristics that this situation is divided into two leaves, shift) the minimized rule of (weighting) loss function that one of selection will be relevant with this algorithm onto.Some examples of the loss function corresponding with maximum likelihood method " Bai Nuli formula (Bernoulli) loss " and " the index loss " corresponding with known ADABoost method.After selecting best scale-of-two decision rule in this stage, can recomputate this weight, and can repeat this process, selecting whereby will the new minimized best binary rules of (weighting) loss function.This process can be repeated many times (for example, hundreds of is to several thousand) and can use resampling method (for example, cross validation) to define stopping rule, so that prevented to meet.
The branch end of promoting to a higher rank has been shown as approximate additional logic regression model, so each feature is all made additional non-linear contribution (about logic levels) to meeting model.The sequence definition session characteristics and the advertisement of this end is rated for the relation between the probability of " good ".This sequence can be represented with following statistical model:
If wherein session characteristics x satisfies k binary rules then Bk (x)=1, if perhaps session characteristics x does not satisfy k binary rules then Bk (x)=0.This coefficient ck, k=1 ..., be the secondary product of algorithm and relevant with possibility in the good advertisement of k binary rules.In fact, given session characteristics x just can estimate each binary rules, and corresponding coefficient is by accumulative total, to have obtained the prediction probability of advertisement.Can derive similarly and the similar statistical model of top equation (5), it has defined session characteristics and advertisement is rated for relation between the probability of " poor ".
Though as the exemplary technique of structure statistical model, those skilled in the art will recognize that, the logistic regression described above and the branch end of promoting to a higher rank also can use other existing statistical methods (for example regression tree) statistical model consistent of deriving with principle of the present invention.
Be used for determining the example procedure of the predicted value relevant with ad quality
Figure 14 is the process flow diagram according to the example procedure of the realization consistent with principle of the present invention, is used for determining the predicted value relevant with the quality of advertisement.It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, the process of Figure 14 illustrated can suitably be realized and be stored in software in the computer-readable memory, such as primary memory 430, ROM 440 or server 320 or 330 or the memory storage 450 of client 310.
This example procedure can be from receiving search inquiry (frame 1400).The user can send search inquiry to server 320, is used for being carried out by search engine system 325.Can obtain one group of advertisement (frame 1405) of being complementary with the search inquiry that received by search engine system 325.Search engine system 325 can be carried out search according to the search inquiry that is received, determining this group advertisement, and with other documents of this search inquiry coupling.Search engine system 325 can offer the tabulation of this group advertising aggregator and other documents the user who sends this searching request.
Can obtain and the session characteristics (frame 1410) of from this group advertisement, selecting advertisement to be associated.Can during user advertising is selected, measure session characteristics in real time, perhaps can from the daily record of the behavior of recording user that is associated with advertisement selection, obtain session characteristics.As shown in Figure 15, the user can select 1500 with document 1510 (document that for example, comprises Search Results and relevant advertisements) associated advertisement 1505.Can document 1515 be being decided in advertisement in response to advertisement selection 1505 and offered the user.As shown in Figure 15, can measure the session characteristics 1520 that is associated with the selection 1500 of advertisement 1505.Measured session characteristics can comprise the user behavior of any type that is associated with advertisement selection, such as top about frame 510 described (Fig. 5).
Statistical model of deriving in the top frame 520 and the session characteristics that is obtained can be used to determine that this advertisement of expression has been the predicted value (frame 1415) of advertisement and/or difference advertisement.This predicted value can comprise probable value (for example, the equation (3) above using or (5) are obtained), and it has been the probability of advertisement that expression has the given session characteristics of selecting to be associated with the user of this advertisement.This predicted value can also comprise probable value (top equation (4)), and it is the probability that differs from advertisement that expression has the given session characteristics of selecting to be associated with the user of this advertisement that records.Therefore, the session eigenwert can be input to equation (3), (4) and/or (5), be good or the predicted value of difference advertisement to obtain this selected advertisement.For example, can session characteristics x will be used for
1, x
2, x
3And x
4Value be input to equation (3), to obtain P (good ad|session feature x
1, x
2, x
3, x
4) probable value.As shown in figure 15, session characteristics 1520 that can this is measured is input to statistical model 130, and this statistical model 130 can be exported the predicted value 1530 for advertisement 1505.
Can obtain and advertisement selection associated advertisement/query characteristics (frame 1420).As shown in figure 15, can obtain selection 1500 associated advertisement/query characteristics 1535 with advertisement 1505.This advertisement/query characteristics 1535 can comprise advertisement 1505 in the key word of the identifier (for example, gray visual URL(uniform resource locator) (URL)) that is associated with the advertiser of advertisement 1505, advertisement 1505 orientations, the search inquiry that the user sends do not have advertisement in the search inquiry that directed speech and/or user send not have directed but with speech like the part of speech of advertisement 1505 orientations.Can use the top advertisement or the query characteristics that do not have the other types of description consistent with principle of the present invention.For example, can all be used as single advertising inquiry/feature with seeing any above-mentioned advertisement/query characteristics of looking in the combination (for example, two object/query characteristics to).
For advertisement/query characteristics (that is, obtaining in the frame 1420 in the above) that each obtained, can be with determined predicted value and sue for peace corresponding to the storing value of advertisement/query characteristics (frame 1425).Can with determined predicted value be stored in the data structure value summation of (such as in the data structure shown in Figure 16 1600 for example).As shown in figure 16, data structure 1600 can comprise a plurality of advertisement/query characteristics 1610-1 to 1610-N, and wherein " sum of advertisement selection " 1620, total " good " predicted value 1630 and total " difference " predicted value 1640 are associated with each advertisement/query characteristics 1610.Can and be stored in clauses and subclauses 1630 or 1640 with each definite in the frame 1405 predicted value, sue for peace corresponding to the currency of each advertisement/query characteristics 1610, this advertisement/query characteristics 1610 further be associated with the inquiry of advertisement and issue.As an example, suppose the advertisement of " 1800flowers.com " to be offered the user in response to search inquiry " flowers for mother ' s day (fresh flower of the Mother's Day) ".It is 0.9 that the session characteristics that is associated with this advertisement selection returns probability P (good ad|ad selection).Three advertisement/query characteristics are associated with this advertisement and inquiry: the visual URL of query length (quantity of term in the inquiry), advertisement and in inquiry but not with key word that this advertisement is associated in the quantity of speech.For in these three advertisement/query characteristics each, corresponding " advertisement selection sum " value adds 1 in the clauses and subclauses 1620, and is added to each value that is stored in the total good predicted value 1630 corresponding with each advertisement/query characteristics with 0.9.
As shown in Figure 15, each determined predicted value 1530 and the currency in the data structure 1600 can be sued for peace.One or more users can be selectively select repeat block 1400 to 1425 to each of advertisement, with utilize with a plurality of summations that one or more advertisement/query characteristics are associated after predicted value expand this data structure 1600.
Exemplary possibility estimation procedure
Figure 17 and 18 is the process flow diagram of example procedure, is used for by using total predicted values 1630 or 1640 of determining at the frame 1425 of Figure 14 to estimate the possibility of getting well or differing from quality that is associated with advertisement.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that, the process of model shown in Figure 17 and 18 can suitably realize with software and can be stored in the computer-readable memory, such as primary memory 430, ROM 440 or server 320 330 or the memory storage 450 of client 310 on.
Given advertisement be estimated possibility good or difference be this given advertisement be good or the possibility formerly of difference and with the function of the one or more model parameters that are associated with given advertisement selection associated advertisement/query characteristics.Can use iterative process to calculate this model parameter, wherein this iterative process is attempted to solve and is used to produce or the parameter value of the best-fit of the actual, historical data that the prediction possibility of difference advertisement and training are used.
The aspect of model that is associated with each advertisement/query characteristics can be made of single parameter, such as about good advertisement or the difference probability of advertisement or the amplification coefficient of possibility.Alternately, each advertisement/query characteristics can have a plurality of model parameters that are associated with it, and these a plurality of model parameters can influence prediction probability good or the difference advertisement in more complicated mode.
In the following description, various possibilities and probability have been used.The probability that possibility that incident takes place and incident take place is associated by equation: probability=possibility/(possibility+1).For example, if the possibility that incident takes place is 1/2 (that is, according to the frequent mode of writing, possibility is 1:2), then the corresponding probability of incident generation is 1/3.According to this agreement, can think that possibility and probability can change mutually.Because possibility can be got any nonnegative value, and probability must be easily so express calculating with possibility rather than probability between 0 and 1.However, it should be understood that, only need carry out minimum change following explanation, promptly can unique probability of use or use logarithm (possibility) for example certain other similarly expression carry out following realization.
Figure 17 shows the process flow diagram of a realization of forecast model, and wherein this forecast model is used for estimating based on generating for given advertisement or poor possibility with this advertisement selection associated advertisement/query characteristics.According to a realization of principle of the present invention, can be by the (q of possibility in advance with good advertisement or difference advertisement
0) multiply by and each advertisement/query characteristics (k
i) model parameter (m that is associated
i) calculate or differ from the possibility of advertisement, after this be called as the possibility multiplier.Such scheme can be represented as:
q＝q
0·m
1.m
2·m
3....m
m。
In essence, the possibility multiplier m for each advertisement/query characteristics k can be the statistical representation of the predictive ability of this advertisement/query characteristics during determining advertisement or difference.
In a realization consistent with principle of the present invention, can constantly make amendment to above-mentioned model parameter, be good or the relative influence of the estimation possibility of difference to reflect each advertisement/query characteristics k for advertisement.Can carry out such modification in the following way, the advertisement that is about to have this inquiry/characteristic of advertisement is good or bad consensus forecast possibility (given advertisement/query characteristics is ignored) and the estimation of the historical quality of the advertisement with this advertisement/query characteristics compares.In this way, the correlation that can discern and extract the advertisement/query characteristics k that is analyzed.
Turn back to Figure 17 particularly, for each selected advertisement/query characteristics (k
i), can initial calculation or the average probability (P that gets rid of certainly of identification
i) (action 1700).In one implementation, this gets rid of probability (P certainly
i) be the value of the correlativity of the selected advertisement/query characteristics of expression, and can measure as the model parameter (m that from estimated possibility is calculated, removes selected advertisement/query characteristics
i) time advertisement be the possibility of result good or difference.For example, for advertisement/query characteristics 3, this can be expressed as:
P
3n+((q

2.m
3....m
n)/m
3/(((q

3+1)
In one embodiment, the probability of eliminating certainly of each advertisement/query characteristics can be retained as moving average, and that is discerned to guarantee gets rid of probability convergence faster after identification is used for the model parameter of each selected advertisement/query characteristics certainly.Moving average can be expressed as like this:
P
in(avg)＝αP
i(n-1)(avg)+(1-α)P
in
Wherein α is the statistical definition variable, the half life period that it is in close proximity to 1 (for example, 0.999) and is used to control moving average.Shown in top expression formula, by as former advertisement selection (for example, n-1) definite P
iValue (for example, is used for advertisement/query characteristics k to the current number (n) that is used for advertisement selection
iThe currency of " advertisement selection sum " 1620) P
iThe value weighted sum is average.
Then, can be with average from getting rid of probability (P
i(avg)) with relate to the quantity of the advertisement selection of being observed and be used for the selection of being observed and the historical information of the possibility of the good or difference advertisement observed compares (action 1710).Then, can relatively generating or modification and selected advertisement/query characteristics k based on action 1710
iThe model parameter m that is associated
i(action 1720) (as what will further describe with reference to the frame among Figure 18 1820 and 1830 below).
Figure 18 shows the process flow diagram of an exemplary realization of the frame 1710-1720 of Figure 17.Initially, can determine the fiducial interval (action 1800) relevant with the possibility of good advertisement or difference advertisement.Using the fiducial interval technology to make can more accurate and estimation stably when use has the advertisement of less amount historical data/query characteristics k.In one implementation, this fiducial interval comprises than low value L
iWith high value U
i, and based on the quantity (n of advertisement selection
i) (for example, be used for advertisement/query characteristics k
iData structure 1600 in " sum of advertisement selection " 1620 in currency) and to the always good/poor (j of selected advertisement/query characteristics observation
i) (for example, be used for advertisement/query characteristics k
iData structure 1600 in current total " good " predicted value 1630 or total " poor " predicted value 1640).For example, this fiducial interval can be 80% fiducial interval [L
i, U
i], its quantity that is based on advertisement selection (for example, is being used for advertisement/query characteristics k
iData structure 1600 in " sum of advertisement selection " 1620 in currency) and observed total good or poorly (for example, be used for advertisement/query characteristics k
iData structure 1600 in current total " good " predicted value 1630 or total " poor " predicted value 1640) calculating in a usual manner.After calculating fiducial interval, can determine that then this is average from getting rid of probability (P
i(avg)) whether drop on (action 1810) in this interval.If drop in the interval, then can determine selected advertisement/query characteristics (k
i) do not influence for the possibility of good advertisement or difference advertisement, and its model parameter (mi) can be set to 1, this removes it (action 1820) very effectively from estimated possibility is calculated.But, if determine this P
i(avg) drop on outside the fiducial interval, then can will be used for selected advertisement/query characteristics k
iModel parameter (m
i) be set to this from getting rid of probability (P
i(avg)) place necessary minimum adjustment of fiducial interval (action 1830).This calculating can mathematically be expressed as:

mEstimated the possibility (action 1750) of advertisement or difference advertisement.Estimated good advertisement possibility (for example, ODDS (good ad|ad/query feature)) can be stored in " good " advertisement possibility clauses and subclauses 1650 of the data structure 1600 corresponding with this advertisement/query characteristics 1610.Estimated poor advertisement possibility (for example, ODDS (bad ad|ad/query feature)) can be stored in " poor " advertisement possibility clauses and subclauses 1660 of the data structure 1600 corresponding with this advertisement/query characteristics 1610.
In a realization consistent with principle of the present invention, can by when the daily record data arrive, it is handled and to above-mentioned statistics add up (for example, advertisement selection, always good or poor, comprise probability etc. certainly) train the possibility forecast model.When additional advertisement selection took place, the fiducial interval that is associated with each advertisement/query characteristics can be shunk, and this parameter estimation can become more accurate.In additional realization,, can quicken training by handling old daily record data again.When daily record data is handled again, can recomputate the estimation possibility of advertisement or difference advertisement by using up-to-date parameter or possibility multiplier value.This allows forecast model to restrain quickly.
Exemplary ad quality forecasting process
Figure 19 is the process flow diagram of example procedure that is used to predict ad quality according to the realization consistent with principle of the present invention.The process shown in Figure 19 that it will be understood by those skilled in the art that can suitably realize and be stored in software in the computer-readable memory, such as primary memory 430, ROM 440 or server 320 330 or the memory storage 450 of client 310 in.
This example procedure can be to receive search inquiry (frame 1900) from the user.The user can send search inquiry to server 320, to be carried out by search engine system 325.Search engine system 325 can obtain one group of advertisement (frame 1910) of being complementary with the search inquiry that received.Search engine system 325 can be carried out search based on the search inquiry that is received, to confirm this group advertisement and other documents that mate with this search inquiry.For each advertisement in this group advertisement, can determine each advertisement/query characteristics corresponding (frame 1920) with search inquiry that is received and advertisement.Be used for not having in the search inquiry that does not have directed speech and/or user to send in key word that the right advertisement/query characteristics of each search inquiry and advertisement can comprise the identifier (for example, gray visual URL(uniform resource locator) (URL)), the advertisement orientation that are associated with the merchant that advertises, the search inquiry that the user sends directed but with speech like the part of speech of advertisement orientation.Also can use the top advertisement or the query characteristics that do not have the other types of description consistent with principle of the present invention.For example, can be with any above-mentioned advertisement/query characteristics of observation in the combination (for example, two advertisement/query characteristics to) as single advertising inquiry/feature.
For each advertisement in this group advertisement, can from data structure 1600, retrieve the ODDS that is stored that is used for determined advertisement/query characteristics i
i(for example, ODDS (good ad|ad/query feature) 1650, ODDS (bad ad|ad/query feature) 1660) (frame 1930).As shown in Figure 20, data structure 1600 can be an index with advertisement/query characteristics 2000, and wherein this advertisement/query characteristics 2000 is corresponding to search inquiry and advertisement, to retrieve the one or more ODDS that are associated with each advertisement/query characteristics
