Embodiment
This document has been described system and the technology that is used to help to manage based on the advertising campaign of flashing.Such technology can comprise the following televiewer's who generates advertisement estimation, may spend how much (because cost is whenever the flash price and the total product that flashes) so that the advertiser can understand the broadcast advertisement.In addition, described technology and system can determine whether may win the position in the time spot auction from advertiser's particular offer.Such technology can comprise that user application is at being used in the quotation of the advertisement of broadcasting with the corresponding time in the past position, time position that is intended for use in advertisement and the quotation that provides.If the quotation that is provided is enough to win the time position in the advertisement deployment point (pod) of time in the past section, can suppose that then described quotation also will win time position in the following time spot section (may carried out some revise to adjust after past period mates the following period).
Fig. 1 is the concept map of example process 100 that is used for the cost of estimating ad activity.Usually, process 100 illustrates the application of historical ad data to the planning data that the user provided so that can relate to by from the user advertisement obtained flashes and relate to the estimation that obtains those costs of being produced of flashing.For example, the user can be an advertising representative of seeking to throw in the company of video commercial advertisement in China on various TV network.Described advertisement by inch of candle process joint network is thrown in, the advertiser is undertaken for making its commercial advertisement be shown the specific quantity of offering by described auction process, and the advertiser with highest quotation is the advertiser that its commercial advertisement is shown.
Be used to show the payment of commercial advertisement and be used to show that the quotation of its commercial advertisement can calculate at network aspect the actual number that flashes that the advertiser provided.For example, the various mechanism such as set-top box, papery report list and other similar mechanism can be used to measure program and what of the spectators of the commercial advertisement of broadcasting during program.The advertiser may be with meaning per 1000,10000 or 100000 spectators or flashing payment setting quantity.Described setting quantity can be constant for each extra spectators, perhaps can follow various formula, such as the formula that the every user price that successively decreases at each extra spectators is provided.
Utilize this process, the advertiser can more closely carry out related with the income that they obtain from described advertisement its advertising expenditure.Especially, if almost there are not spectators to watch commercial advertisement, then the advertiser will spend proportional few money and broadcast described commercial advertisement.If mass viewer audiences has been watched commercial advertisement, then the advertiser can pay more expenses and broadcast described commercial advertisement, but advertisement will have better effect.By this way, advertiser and broadcaster be shared risk and repayment when advertisement delivery, and the cost of advertisement has reflected the income that the advertiser obtained more exactly.
Because the quantity that will pay of advertiser changes with the factor in future and is not subjected to advertiser's control (televiewer of program or advertisement), how much will spend broadcast specific advertisement so the advertiser may be difficult to definite its.As a result, even it knows the payment of flashing and being carried out of being willing to mean given number, but the advertiser also possibly can't learn easily whether it can afford the quotation for the particular advertisement position.
Here shown process 100 can be used to help advertiser or the opposing party that the cost of throwing in one or more following advertisements is estimated, so that the advertiser can select to carry out the program and the time position of advertisement better, and can understand its advertising budget better and how long will continue as the part of advertising campaign.In addition, this process can advise that the advertiser should be the quotation that advertisement delivery carries out, and wherein said quotation has reasonably good chance of success and need not overspending money.Given advertiser's particular offer and/or budget, this process can also provide the success that will broadcast advertisement possible indication for the advertiser.
Move to its input backward from the net result of process 100, process 100 provides the estimated number that flashes, the advertiser that will produce as the advertisement of output 116 or advertising campaign to broadcast the estimated cost of such advertisement and is to present the quotation that advertisement is recommended for the advertiser.This information may be helpful for advertiser or the opposing party, how much will spend because it can help the advertiser to understand advertising campaign approx, and utilize described advertising campaign will obtain which type of effect.In addition, the various inputs to system that below are discussed in more detail can be changed in response to such output 116 by the advertiser, and other possibility cost and the spectators that can obtain with the identification advertising campaign flash.By this way, the advertiser can determine the combination of advertisement factor easily and utilize it to experimentize, so that maximize for the investment in advertising repayment (ROI) of activity.
Illustrated output can by process 100 by to the particular historical data relevant with the advertisement that has shown, those advertisements provided prolongs and (reach) or flash and costs of those advertisements are early used a plurality of inputs that the advertiser provided and produced.For example, the advertiser imports 114 and can be the data imported of advertiser and can comprise very important a plurality of factors for typical advertiser.For example, the advertiser can provide movable master budget, does not wish the indication of the cost level that exceeds as the advertiser.The advertiser can also comprise the one or more quotations that are used to broadcast advertisement.For example, the advertiser can indicate it to be willing to mean the dollar for per 1000 the spectators' specific quantities of Ad spends on particular network in special time window or time.Such quotation can be in auction process with respect to adopting from the quotation of seeking during identical time position, on identical network, to throw in other advertiser of content, wherein the highest quotation person wins auction, and its advertisement is broadcasted during described time position.
Various forms can be taked in the time spot position.For example, the time position can comprise the time range of program broadcast day, such as the time range of two hours or four hours.Exemplary such time range comprises the prime time TV, and hour can changing with the time zone of being covered of described time position.And the particular commercial break period (break) during the programming can be pointed in the time position.Such commercial break time can comprise one or more commercial advertisements, and can be known as " deployment point ".Usually, though can broadcast short or long commercial advertisement, the deployment point is divided into the commercial advertisement segmentation in a series of 30 seconds.Also can use position At All Other Times, during such as stack advertisement on the program that broadcasts.For example, can be when broadcasting the name table (credit) of TV programme display ads.And advertisement can be rolled as the bottom that news ticker (news ticker) is striden screen, perhaps may be provided in the flaw (bug) that appears at one jiao of program and then disappear over time.The start and end time of display ads can be considered to the time position in this manner.The different modes of these display ads-such as the commercial advertisement of different length, in the covering at the buffer position place of program or in originally on one's body covering-can be known as the type or the form of advertisement of program, and specify also can support multiple such adline in system by the advertiser time.
Advertiser in this example provides the indication of the specific deployments point of being ready that its advertisement occurs therein.As shown below, the advertiser can also select extra time position-be used for single advertisement or a plurality of different advertisement.In addition, the advertiser can indicate it to wish to broadcast the network of advertisement thereon during the special time position.Such network can comprise specific radio network, such as ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN, WB and various cable channel.Usually, the advertiser will seek to discern its televiewer and add up consistent network with the target demographic of advertising campaign.For example, the company of advertisement male health-care product can be identified as objective network with ESPN.
Input 114 can be at the single advertisement of single time position or at a plurality of advertisements of the complicated advertising campaign that runs through a plurality of time positions and network.The combination of time position and network can be known as " target ", and it can discern specific TV programme example from all many other program instance.
Each indication advertiser (perhaps by certain other entity or mechanism) in the various inputs 114 is the parameter of the expectation that its advertisement provided.Process 100 then can be to using the particular historical data so that export 116 for the advertiser generates from advertiser's input 114.Usually, described historical data comprises and the televiewer of similar time position, advertiser's times selected position or the quote data of flashing data and seeking and obtaining to make each quoter that its advertisement thrown in during the historical time position.
Televiewer's data have been shown in Figure 102, and it has shown three networks between at 7 o'clock in afternoon October 1 and 7: 30 afternoon.For each network, the timeline between at 7 o'clock in afternoon and 7: 30 afternoon is divided into segmentation, and wherein the demonstration of program or the demonstration of commercial advertisement are represented in each segmentation.In this example, the shadow region is illustrated in the time period of wherein broadcasting commercial advertisement, and white portion is then represented program.As can be seen, each network comprises the commercial break time usually during the time period of similar (though and inequality).And, for each network, show figure for the televiewer's data during this time period, the line chart type of the viewership (perhaps TV number) of special time promptly is shown.Such televiewer's data can be obtained by various mechanism, such as other mechanism that set-top box, other electronics are followed the tracks of, the televiewer of definite TV programme is followed the tracks of, investigates and be used for to artificial papery.
As seeing for 104 on Gtv network, program has high relatively grading at first, grading descends at the first commercial break time durations, they recover after program restarts, they the second time commercial break time durations descend once more, and described grading reduces during the last segmentation of program usually.Ever-increasing grading-in commercial break time durations-still decline when finishing, this may be because spectators dislike described program even the program on the CBS 106 has in its early stage grading usually.It is low relatively during in early days that program on the ESPN 108 indicates spectators' interest, spectators' interest height subsequently, and it then fails at the second commercial break time durations.For example, possible ESPN broadcasting in match ending very near (driving grading raises) but result of the match is just in time determined the competitive sports of (causing people to turn off TV) in the second commercial break time.
Corresponding deployment point can be selected in every way so that they will approach or expect to approach the watching mode in future.For example, in simple example, can select from the deployment point on elder generation's identical on the same day time of last phase and the identical network.And, also can when analyzing the televiewer, use from the deployment point of several weeks before.Under the situation of using a plurality of such deployment points, described deployment point can be weighted, so that more approaching televiewer's number is more important than farther televiewer's number.By this way, the nearest performance of internet program may have bigger influence for the following televiewer who estimates program.
And, in case obtained historical televiewer's number, just can provide various modifications to the televiewer.For example, run through the duration of deployment point and under the situation about changing, in the shutdown of business interruption time durations, then can use the average televiewer of running through described deployment point in televiewer's level such as spectators.Replacedly or in addition, when particular commercial having been determined the position in the deployment point, can use the data of flashing of this specific part of described deployment point that estimation is provided.
And televiewer's number is normally seasonal, has more televiewer during month in the fall, then has less televiewer during the summer months that program is repeated.As a result, can carry out seasonality to televiewer's data revises.For example, if the advertiser attempts the televiewer during September is estimated that and historical data is from August, then can use pondage factor with the typical seasonal variety between expression televiewer in August and September televiewer to described data.For example, can learn that in history, existing sitcom televiewer between August And September increases by 20%, thereby can use such adjustment 100 data recovered of process.
Process 100 can also determine whether the advertiser may make its advertisement be selected as showing during the following time period, determine where advertisement will (for example showing in the deployment point, when the deployment point has the space that is used for several advertisements), and the possible cost of definite display ads.Such information can be used from the information of old before auction 112 and determine.For example, such information can comprise and makes its advertisement in the selected quotation that the advertiser provided that shows in historical time position before.For example, comprise three dollars quotation if import 114, and the commercial advertisement that to show four its range of quoted price during deployment point before be the 2-5 dollar, can suppose that then the advertiser is successful quotation side, thereby its advertisement can prevent any variation of advertiser's behavior from the historical time section shown in the following time position.
Needed certain price can be the cost that is lower than bid price before advertisement will be broadcasted.Especially, quotation can be considered to the quoter and be ready the maximum quantity that spends, but to the actual quantity that the quoter collects can be the highest failure quantity that the quoter offered or similar quantity (for example, slightly more than the highest described failure quoter), or the next highest quotation person quantity of being offered.
As an example, following form shows the quotation of being carried out for four advertisement deployment points from five different quoters, and under three different Offer Model the quantity of each actual delivery.In first model, the quoter pays next highest quotation person's quantity, and the highest quotation person is rendered to very first time position (supposing that it has maximum spectators and maximum effect power).In second model, the identical quantity of the quoter Zhi Fuyu of each triumph the highest failure quoter, and the time position is specified at random, even perhaps the highest quotation person also can obtain very first time position under the situation of any extra cost of nonpayment, as the repayment of bearing more risk.In the 3rd model, each price exceeds 7% than next highest quotation, but and is no more than the quantity of quoter's actual price.
Use one or other model in these three models, the advertiser can be with respect to from the quotation of time position before and be inserted in the ad auction for the given quotation of following advertisement, and its position in the deployment point can be determined.If advertisement is success in auction, then can determine flashing of advertisement according to the suitable network 104-108 among Figure 102.Described flashing can be carried out with various granular level.For example, can use grading for program (and according to the number of having expressed grading therein, can to described grading make amendment with reflection be used to express quotation at the technology of flashing).Replacedly, can regularly measure, be measured as the grading that approaches related deployment point most so that can use by program to grading.With granularity very closely, can use the grading of particular advertisement time position in the deployment point.The estimation of determining then to can be used as following televiewer like this, it may be attended by and make them more reflect the modification of actual general televiewer's condition.
Can make amendment to the rank of quotation in every way.In one example, the quality of advertisement may influence the rank of advertisement.Especially, seldom have spectators to change channel-then can give than high score described advertisement for the rank purpose when broadcasting this advertisement if advertisement is " viscosity "-mean, wherein its score value will then become the combination of the price quote and the quality of described advertisement.The viscosity advertisement is good, and reason is that it is that program has kept spectators, and such advertisement can give their repayment than high score by broadcaster thus.The viscosity advertisement also is good for spectators, and reason is to suppose that spectators are bonded to around it owing to enjoying described advertisement.And the viscosity advertisement also is good for the advertiser, and reason is that those spectators may pay close attention to described advertisement, and more may be converted into the actual purchase of institute's advertised product or service thus.
Can determine the viscosity of advertisement in every way.As a kind of simple mode, under the situation that high granularity ratings data can be used, begin to reduce number percent from advertisement and can be used as determining viscosity to the spectators of its end.Increase some complexities; when advertisement is broadcasted in the deployment point for the first time its televiewer's variation may than its in the deployment point variation the during later stage even more important; reason is that spectators can stay or converted channel usually in decision immediately in the deployment point; and reason is that also in fact the advertisement in deployment point later stage has spectators' increase; this be not because advertisement have how good, but since the spectators of converted channel attempt when its star turn begins once more, in time to return.When all advertisements are broadcasted in shared deployment point, also can use various statistical mechanisms to remove related between the data relevant of user reflection and other advertisement with advertisement.By these various mechanism, can determine the quality of advertisement, and such quality can be rendered to better advertisement location in the ability aspect of its maintenance aspect flashing.The repayment of such quality can be considered to GOOGLE ADWORDS program in the quotation for advertisement and the point that combine advance to mark similar.
Under specific circumstances, can return the quotation of being recommended to the quoter.Such recommendation quotation can use historical data to calculate, thereby produces the quotation that may win following auction.In simple examples, can service time the quotation-such as 50 percent or 75 percent of past success of particular percentile of position.Also can generate a plurality of different quotations, and each can with quotation will possibility of success be associated (that is, can return quotation and successful possibility) to the user.And under specific circumstances, the quotation of initial suggestion may be modified, such as in order to reflect that the generality of quotation between the time of the time position that the time and the quotation of historical data takes place increases.
What then, each was such determines and can be returned to the user in output 116.As the above mentioned, the cost that flashes of the per unit of being calculated can be multiplied by flashing of estimation or otherwise combinedly determine that the advertiser broadcasts the estimated cost of advertisement with it.Describe in more detail as following, the user can be presented (expressed by various measurements) that receive with the advertisement prediction and flash, broadcasts the forecast cost of advertisement, and the quotation of recommendation under specific circumstances.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of illustrative advertising expenditure estimating system 200.Usually, described system comprises television advertising server 204, it comprises a plurality of construction packages, and described construction package is used to estimate televiewer and other factor relevant with the following television advertising that will broadcast, and is used for generating its real cost after advertisement is broadcasted.Advertisement Server 204 communicates with a plurality of external modules by the network 208 such as the internet when carrying out action like this, described external module comprises advertiser's terminal 202 and spectators' rating server 206, the advertiser can carry out alternately at described advertiser's terminal 202 places and system 200 when setting up one or more advertising campaign, and described spectators' rating server 206 can be reported and watch specific program or the actual spectators of program part or the number of family.
Advertiser's terminal 202 can be taked various forms, is connected to the personal computer of Advertisement Server 204 such as the web browser that uses application-specific or display application.Use terminal 202, advertiser or other can come the managing advertisement activity with the quotation by input budget information and broadcast advertisement.Described side can also discern time position and the network that they wish to broadcast advertisement, and position (for example, pointer URL) that can upload the e-file of advertisement extraly or provide pointing system 200 can visit advertisement.Can carry out also that various other is mutual from terminal 202, those are mutual shown in Fig. 5 A-5D and discussed below.
Estimator front end 212 and other assembly in the Advertisement Server 204 can utilize various data sources.Such source comprises the source of user data 222, and it can storage and specific user and the relevant information of advertisement account thereof.For example, except that other, the identifying information that user data 222 can the stores advertisements master, can during it, arrange the identifier of the time position that advertisement broadcasts and fully follow the tracks of other such information that advertisement is predetermined and the advertisement payment is required from its commercial accounts number, advertiser who takes out advertiser's money.
Conception of history mode can comprise the reflection data of televiewer's level of various programs in the past according to 224 storage.Described data can be represented the televiewer in every way, such as investigating determined viewership by papery or at the TV number (may be modified with the viewership before reflecting those TVs) of section manipulate preset time.Can use spectators' data module 216 to carry out the electron collection of televiewer's data, it is assembled the data that receive from one or more spectators' rating servers 206 and formats.Described spectators' rating server 206 can be operated by various entities, such as wired or satellite television provider.Described server can be from head end 211 reception information, described head end 211 and then be connected to large number quipments such as set-top box 210.(described set-top box need not to be positioned at conscientiously the TV top, and can be mutually integrated with the TV self of reality.) described set-top box can be with various known way regular reporting televiewer activity, and spectators' rating server 206 can be assembled the information that is received so that whole televiewer's number of program to be provided.Such televiewer can report at various increments, such as for whole program, reports with five minutes increments or with 30 seconds or still less increment.Except that other, the time quantum between the reporting event can be to carry out so required width of report, allow the storage space of report data and about the factor of the system requirements of the data of such collection.
Spectators' rating server 206 can be to the various forms of televiewer's data of spectators' data module 216 reports.For example, can be the original televiewer's number of each network-reporting during special time period.In addition, can report the consensus data, such as the personal data relevant (for example, subscriber's general demography, bag (subscriber who infers the high-quality channel has more disposable income) and other this information that those subscribers received) with spectators group.And, can report other channel of watching with particular set-top box relevant data, thereby allow during a time period where and they are from where analyzing spectators' whereabouts.For example, such tracking data determine which advertisement be viscosity and which is useful when not being.
Televiewer's data that spectators' rating server 206 is reported can be anonymous.For example, can use and to carry out data report to the identifier that the specific user follows the tracks of, perhaps can carry out data report by group rather than specific user are reported.
The relevant information in time spot position during schedule data storehouse 220 storage and TV programme scheduling and those are dispatched.Such information can comprise in the past and following scheduling.For example, dispatching database 220 can comprise and the relevant typical data of program that can obtain from commerce services, describes, carries sequential and other the such information of commercial break time during the network (and channel) of program, the featured performer, program in the program such as program duration, program title, program.Dispatching database 220 (perhaps has other data source as described herein, one or more databases in addition) can also comprise with program in the deployment point and the relevant information of the advertisement of being carried in the program in the past (and in some instances, quotation for following mid-roll ad, with after End of Auction but the advertisement that will carry in the following program before program broadcasts), such advertising message can comprise advertisement and advertiser's sign, the advertiser is for the real price (that is, before or after may having used group or other discount) of broadcast advertisement quotation of carrying out and the carrying advertisement that the advertiser paid.
Information in the various data sources can be used for determining the plan of flashing of the advertisement of broadcasting in future or the price (the perhaps success of the price that the user provided or failure) of predicted number and this advertisement by spectators' estimator 214 and auction simulator 218.For example, spectators' estimator 214 can be such as being directed to the special time position by estimator front end 212, and the televiewer's data that can query history spectators data 224 obtain described time position are such as televiewer's data of the various advertisements of broadcasting during the time position.Spectators' estimator 214 then can use above and following described technology to be provided at the estimation televiewer level of the advertisement of broadcasting during the user-selected following time position.
For its part, auction simulator 218 can be visited the historical quotes data to the time position, the time position that described time position is discerned such as estimator front end 212.Described historical quotes data can comprise that success makes advertiser that its advertisement broadcasted for broadcasting the given quotation of advertisement during described time position, and under specific circumstances, also comprise from successful advertisement master's quote data not.Auction simulator 218 can adopt described historical quotes, can also be adopted as the quotation that auction presented of following time position, and described quotation can be compared so that whether determine can be successful under it has been presented at the situation in the auction of time position before to the quotation of following time position.The auction simulator then can return various data to estimator front end 212 or another module, such as quotation whether will be successfully, other successfully or not quotation and other similar information of successful quoter.
Estimator front end 212 can determine when carrying out various estimation which time position or deployment point analyze, as just described, and can be at other assembly of visit guidance system server 204 during such information, for example, if estimator front end 212 determines that the advertiser has been chosen in network XYZ and has gone up in 7:00 broadcast advertisement on 21 afternoon of Dec, then it can be comparable historical time position with the program identification that 7:00 begins afternoon Dec 14 on network XYZ, and Dec 7 also may be so.Estimator front end 212 can also be carried out additional analysis, such as by being identified in the TV programme of playing on advertiser's times selected and finding out the nearest broadcast on identical network of described program, the broadcast that perhaps described program mates the most with following reproduction time on identical network.
Estimator front end 212 can also receive the information of returning and presents so that checked by the user from other module.Presenting like this can comprise possible televiewer's level that advertisement is shown, and the cost that broadcasts advertisement.In addition, estimator front end 212 can comprise such information of a plurality of different advertisements in single advertising campaign or a plurality of advertising campaign.
Estimator front end 212 can also be provided in response to providing of the information relevant with advertisement by the special time position of advertisement.For example, the advertiser can import the particular demographic information relevant with advertisement, broadcast the planned budget of advertisement and the planned target of advertising campaign (for example, making brand recognition maximize, attract target audience etc.).Estimator front end 212 and then can discern a plurality of various time spot positions when keeping being a part of the budget, to realize described target.Under the advertisement example number condition with higher that will broadcast, system 200 can also be programmed to reduce advertiser's risk, such as by more manying spectators' the protection that advertisement provided at receiving than expection.
In addition, estimator front end 212 can be carried out follow-up function, such as by returning obtaining the actual number that flashes afterwards, and such information be multiply by the definite cost that is used to broadcast advertisement of auction process of advertisement from spectators' data module 216.Front end 212 then can be so that advertiser account be deducted fees for broadcasting advertisement.Also can adopt various other methods that are used for the broadcast of advertisement is dispatched, provided (for example, via auctioning or other) and record keeping by using system 200.
Fig. 3 A and 3B are the process flow diagrams of the example process 300,320 of the data of flashing that are used to provide movable relevant with television advertising.Fig. 3 A generality shows system and determines the prediction input of commercials and the process 300 of cost by it, and described commercials are based on the televiewer's of advertisement measurement and charge (billing).Process 300 comprises reception such as from advertiser or other user or from a plurality of inputs of automatic launch process, and then the relevant historical data in time spot position looked for of use and advertiser or other user is calculated such as a plurality of prediction factors that flash with cost.
At frame 302, process 300 receives ownership goal, quotation and budget.Except that other, ownership goal can comprise time position and network.The time position can begin in every way, and can be selected for the number of its pot life position that presents according to process 300 by user or program.For example, the time position can comprise specific program during time of broadcasting, comprising may be more than the set point of one program, perhaps the time position in specific deployments point or the deployment point.Quotation is that the advertiser is willing to mean advertisement is broadcasted and the quantity of whenever flashing of paying or other similar measurement.Be that the advertiser is ready the maximum quantity paid in advance, and can indicate whole advertising campaign, carrying particular advertisement and/or the single instance of carrying advertisement or the quantity of broadcast in a plurality of examples.Use such information, and more specifically be target, process 300 can be discerned a plurality of deployment points that wherein advertiser's advertisement can be play.
At frame 304, process 300 begins to discern specific objective and each such target is carried out specific definite repetitive process.For example, can calculate each advertisement that will carry and flash or the number of similar indication, such as by determine advertisement before the flashing or number that other this grading is measured of corresponding broadcast or a plurality of such broadcasts, and if any, provide adjusting to number before such.Also can between the quotation that the advertiser is provided for similar time spot position in the past for the quotation of broadcasting its advertisement in future and provide and advertiser, carry out the supposition auction.If described auction indication advertiser may win, then can calculate the cost that broadcasts advertisement in auction.For example, described cost can be the quotation that is lower than advertiser's next highest quotation person.
According to such information, can determine the forecast cost of advertisement delivery, such as multiplying each other by number that will flash and the cost that whenever flashes.The cost of Ji Suaning also can be made amendment like this, such as considering account group discount, according to time period change prediction televiewer or other such factor.Along with the numerical value of each advertisement is determined, those numerical value can be saved and can calculate whole broadcast and flash and cost.In case checked all advertisement examples, process 300 just can to the user or with user's system associated (for example, analyze the system of TV data dispatching with automatic selection heterogeneous networks and time position) return all data and be used to check, the sum that flashes that comprises advertising campaign or movable interior each advertisement, and the whole cost of each advertisement in movable and/or movable.
Fig. 3 B shows the process flow diagram of the process 320 of the quotation incremental data that is used to obtain the advertiser.Usually, process 320 comprises that advertiser or advertiser agency (comprising auto-programming) provides the parameter of advertising campaign to process 320, and the suggestion quotation submitted to for the input of winning in the time spot position of the time spot position of process 320 identification advertisement puttings and advertiser.
Described process is provided the budget and the consensus data of advertising campaign in frame 322 beginnings by user or other entity.For example, the user can indicate them to have 200000 dollars to can be used for activity, and can indicate them to attempt to reach and active the retired.At frame 324, be complementary a plurality of TV programme of (perhaps at least at the demography of being discerned) of its televiewers of process 320 identification and the demography of being discerned.Such coupling can determine by the simple search function, and wherein database is included in the tabulation of all programs that the specific following time period broadcasts and to a plurality of demographic keyword that each program distributed.
If initial interrupt procedure is from dispute eliminating program or deployment point, thereby then described process can the auction data before 328 pairs of frames be analyzed the required price of auction of the particular advertisement time position during determining to win program or deployment point.For example, the quotation of specific number percent can be selected or weighting quotation (that is, if the great majority quotation is all very high and only have the quotation of winning lower, then the suggestion quotation can be to high-end weighting) can be calculated.At frame 330, can determine to use the suggestion quotation during the time period before, to broadcast the cost of advertisement.For example, can determine every spectators' cost, and can be from conception of history mode according to obtaining televiewer's level.
If the cost that is calculated (for example, every spectators' cost multiply by estimates viewership) has exceeded advertiser's budget, then can from consider, get rid of specific objective (frame 332), and can begin circulation once more with new target.If the cost that is calculated is enough low, then specific objective and the desired tabulation of flashing and advising the possible advertisement putting of the quotation quantity activity of can being added to.
In case all possible targets are all checked, process 320 just can present all acceptable targets (frame 336) to the user.Such report can comprise the form that target information (for example, network and time position), televiewer's level is shown and broadcasts advertisement whole cost once with described target.The user can also carry out alternately with such information, such as use AJAX technology in web browser embodiment, and can select to be used to broadcast the specific objective of advertisement with souning out.Can provide the budget counter to follow the tracks of such selection and they are shown and the accumulative total of target be selected the budget of being used up to the user.In addition, also can provide out of Memory, spectators' covering level that selection is provided such as all types of target (for example, if identical crowd watch the advertiser directed various programs, then cover narrow and dark, if and the advertiser has selected the various programs that require spectators extensively to watch, will be wideer narrower) but then cover.Also can provide other such advertistics to the user.And in this example, the user can be the individual such as advertiser representative, or such as the system of automatic advertisement delivery system.
