Definitions
- Various network-based search applications allow a user to enter search terms and receive a list of search results. Such applications commonly use ranking algorithms to ensure that the search results are relevant to the user's query. For example, some systems rank such results based on reliability and safety of the search result, location of the user and search result, etc. These services may also provide business listings in response to a particular search query.
- the business listing search results may be displayed on a map such that a user may easily identify which businesses are located within a particular area.
- some businesses may employ methods to include multiple listings in different geographic locations where the business does not actually exist. The customer may be defrauded by contacting an entity believed to be located nearby only to learn later that the business is actually operating from a completely different location. Such fraudulent marketing tactics are commonly referred to as “map spam”.
- a search entity may determine the likelihood that a business listing search result corresponds to a business that seeks to lure potential customers by assigning a location to the listing where the business does not actually operate.
- the search entity may determine the likelihood that the business listing is map spam by executing a process that weighs different factors. The factors may be considered with reference to a particular geographic region.
- map spam One factor to be considered when identifying map spam is whether the business listing is associated with a business category that appears as search results for a particular geographic area in amounts that exceed average proportions for the same business category density in similarly situated geographic areas. Most service-based businesses usually operate within a limited geographic area. When such businesses seek to lure potential customers using map spam, they may fraudulently indicate that their business is located at several different locations within an area when, in fact, they are operating out of a smaller number of sites that may not be located in the same area. Given an average density for business categories in geographic regions having similar characteristics (e.g., an average of ten business listings for plumbers in towns having a population between 75,000-100,000 people), this type of map spam creates a disproportionate number of business listings for an area. Accordingly, it is likely that at least one of the businesses within the category is generating map spam.
- Each business listing may include identifying data such as a title, a telephone number and a web site address. If different business listings include the same identifying data, it is likely that the listing is map spam. For example, a search for an event planner in a particular town may produce four different mapped results. If three of the event planner listings include the same title, phone number and/or web site, there is a high likelihood that these event planner listings are map spam.
- Specific neighborhood characteristics provide an additional factor for identifying whether a mapped search result for a business listing is spam. For example, if a particular listing corresponds to an address that is located in an area that is zoned for residential use, the likelihood that the business listing is map spam is increased. Similarly, if the listing address can be mapped to a commercially zoned location, the likelihood that the listing is map spam is decreased. In another example, if a listing corresponds to an address located near a particularly well-known location, such as a popular tourist attraction, the likelihood that the business listing is map spam is increased.
- a computer-implemented method comprises accessing, by a processor, data corresponding to a geographic region.
- the processor accesses entries in a searchable group. Each entry includes location data corresponding to the geographic region.
- the processor determines if an entity corresponding to each entry likely does not exist at a location identified by the location data by identifying whether a criteria exceeds a threshold. Each entry that likely exists at the location identified by the location data is stored in a set of candidates.
- the search results that are included in the set of candidates are provided to the client device.
- each entry corresponds to a business listing and the entity comprises a business identified by the business listing.
- a computer-implemented method determines a likelihood that a business listing in a searchable group of entries maps to a location where a business associated with the business listing is operable.
- the method includes accessing, by a processor, data corresponding to a geographic region.
- the processor accesses business listings in a searchable group.
- Each business listing includes location data that identifies a location within the geographic region.
- the processor determines a likelihood that each business listing corresponds to a business that exists at the location.
- the likelihood corresponds to a value associated with each business listing.
- a business listing that is associated with a value that exceeds a threshold is identified as spam.

Although FIG. 1 functionally illustrates the processor and memory as being within the same block, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the processor and memory may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, memory may be a hard drive or other storage media located in a server farm of a data center. Accordingly, references to a processor or computer will be understood to include references to a collection of processors or computers or memories that may or may not operate in parallel.
- the computer 110 may be at one node of a network 150 and capable of directly and indirectly receiving data from other nodes of the network.
- computer 110 may comprise a web server that is capable of receiving data from client devices 160 and 170 via network 150 such that server 110 uses network 150 to transmit and display information to a user on display 165 of client device 170 .
- Server 110 may also comprise a plurality of computers that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting data to the client devices. In this instance, the client devices will typically still be at different nodes of the network than any of the computers comprising server 110 .
- Network 150 may comprise various configurations and use various protocols including the Internet, World Wide Web, intranets, virtual private networks, local Ethernet networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, cellular and wireless networks (e.g., WiFi), instant messaging, HTTP and SMTP, and various combinations of the foregoing.
- cellular and wireless networks e.g., WiFi
- instant messaging HTTP and SMTP, and various combinations of the foregoing.
- FIGS. 1-2 Although only a few computers are depicted in FIGS. 1-2 , it should be appreciated that a typical system can include a large number of connected computers.
- Each client device may be configured similarly to the server 110 , with a processor, memory and instructions as described above.
- Each client device 160 or 170 may be a personal computer intended for use by a person 191 - 192 , and have all of the components normally used in connection with a personal computer such as a central processing unit (CPU) 162 , memory (e.g., RAM and internal hard drives) storing data 163 and instructions 164 , an electronic display 165 (e.g., a monitor having a screen, a touch-screen, a projector, a television, a computer printer or any other electrical device that is operable to display information), end user input 166 (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen or microphone).

- client device 170 may include a GPS receiver to determine the device's latitude, longitude and altitude.
- the GPS receiver may determine a new current location.
- the component 168 may also comprise software for determining the position of the device based on other signals received at the client device 170 , such as signals received at a cellular phone's antennas from one or more cellular phone towers if the client device is a cellular phone.
- client devices 160 and 170 may each comprise a full-sized personal computer, they may alternatively comprise mobile devices capable of wirelessly exchanging data, including position information derived from position component 168 , with a server over a network such as the Internet.
- client device 160 may be a wireless-enabled PDA or a cellular phone capable of obtaining information via the Internet.
- the user may input information using a small keyboard (in the case of a Blackberry-type phone), a keypad (in the case of a typical cellular phone) or a touch screen (in the case of a PDA).
- Data 134 of server 110 may include geographic data 136 and business listing data 138 .
- the geographic data 136 may include map data that identifies any type of information that may be useful to identify specific characteristics of a region.
- the map data may include specific location information such as block, street, neighborhood, town, zip code, city, county, district, state, province, country, and global data.
- the map data may also include zoning information that identifies whether any particular region is residential, commercial, or zoned for mixed-use.
- the map data may further include information that identifies where a particular region is rural, suburban, urban, or uninhabitable.
- Other examples of the map data may include population data for a region including total population and population density information, climate statistics particular to a region, and locations of well-known sites of interest such as tourist attractions and natural wonders.
- the geographic data 136 may also include information regarding geographic locations of businesses. Typically, the location of any business is identified by address. However, the location of a business may be identified in other ways such as by latitude and longitude coordinates.
- the business listings may also be grouped in any number of ways such as by geographic location or category of business. Such groupings are helpful especially considering the large number of businesses that may exist in any particular region or in any particular industry. In one example, businesses may be grouped in accordance with which businesses are located in any particular neighborhood, town, zip code, city, county, or any other district within a geographic boundary or region. In another example, businesses may be grouped based on which businesses are operating within the same industry.
- the industry may be broadly defined (e.g., restaurants, retail outlets, home repair services, legal services, etc.) or narrowly defined (e.g., Mexican restaurants, camera shops, luxury or used car dealerships, locksmiths, plumbers, electricians, personal injury attorneys, etc.)
- the business listing data 138 includes data that identifies a particular business at a specific location.
- the business listing data 138 may identify the location of the business listing on a map and a category in which the business listing may be included.
- the business listing data 138 may also include a title for the business and contact information such as a physical address, a telephone number, and a web site address.
- the business listing data 138 identifies whether the business operates as a local business, a regional business, a national business or an international business.
- FIG. 3 demonstrates a process 300 of determining a likelihood of whether a business listing provided in response to a search is identified by a location where the business is actually operating. In other words, the process 300 detects the likelihood of whether a particular business is attempting to defraud potential customers by generating map spam.
- Each business listing is associated with at least one particular business category that identifies the type of industry that the business is operating within (step 305 ).
- the business listing categories may be identified by a business entity. For example, a business owner may submit a listing to an entity that operates a search engine.
- the business listing may include a name of the business (e.g., “Apex Nursery and Garden Supply”), an address, a telephone number and (if applicable) a web site address.
- the business entity may also identify specific business categories (e.g., landscaping products, garden supplies, etc.).
- the business listing may be associated with a particular category or categories after the business listing is submitted by the business entity.
- the search entity may assign additional categories to the nursery business (e.g., florist, landscaping services, etc.).
- the geographic data 136 stored on the server 110 may identify the business category for every searchable business listing entry.
- an average proportion of the type of business relative to all businesses in different geographic regions may be determined and subsequently accessed (step 310 ).
- the business categories may be broadly or narrowly defined.
- the geographic regions may each cover a large area of land (e.g., a county including a populous city) or a relatively small district (e.g., a neighborhood occupying a few city blocks). This information may be accessed to determine the average density of a particular business category in different geographic regions.
- the different geographic regions have similar characteristics. Accordingly, the average density of particular business categories may be determined in similarly situated geographic regions.
- a number of locksmiths can be identified in a particular zip code (e.g., five), and the total number of business listings in the zip code may also be identified (e.g., eight thousand). Accordingly, the density of locksmiths in the zip code would be 0.0625%.
- an average density may be identified. By way of example, the average density of locksmiths in a particular state may be determined to be 0.05%.
- the average density of each business category may be further categorized according to regional characteristics. For example, the average density of each business category in different urban neighborhoods may be categorized separately from the same business category density in suburban or rural areas. In this way, business categories can be grouped to reflect that business density may vary widely depending on the characteristics of a region (e.g., livestock veterinary services in rural areas, electricians in urban areas, landscapers in suburban areas).
- the data associated with the average density of a particular business category may be stored as geographic data 136 .
- each business listing that may be identified in response to a search result may be stored as business listing data 138 in the server 110 . Both the geographic data 136 and the business listing data 138 may be subsequently retrieved to identify which business listings may be attempting to defraud potential customers by providing false operation locations.
- the process 300 continues by identifying a geographic region that includes at least one business listing (step 315 ).
- a search entity may process each business listing in the identified geographic region to identify which businesses may be defrauding potential customers.
- the geographic region may be defined in any specific or arbitrary way.
- the geographic region may be defined as a neighborhood, town, zip code, city, county, area code or local exchange prefix, or metropolitan statistical area vicinage.
- the geographic region may be defined as all urban areas within a particular county.
- the geographic region may be defined using the map data stored on the server 110 as geographic data 136 .
- the geographic region may be identified as Union County in New Jersey which has a population of approximately 525,000 residents.
- the search entity may execute an algorithm that assigns each business listing a value that corresponds to a likelihood that the business listing is map spam.
- the value is referred to as a “spam score”.
- the spam score may be between the values of one and zero, where one strongly identifies the business listing as map spam and where zero strongly identifies the business listing as operating from a valid location.
- the spam score may be set at an initial value of 0.5.
- the spam score may lie within any range of values, and a high spam score may denote a likely valid entry and a low spam score may indicate a strong likelihood that the business listing is map spam.
- the algorithm for assigning each business listing with a spam score that identifies the likelihood that the listing is map spam begins by identifying a number of business listings in the geographic region that are assigned to the same category (step 320 ).
- the business category may pertain to natural gas suppliers, and it may be determined that there are five natural gas suppliers listed as operating in Union County.
- the business category may be residential landscape services, and it may be determined that there are five hundred residential landscape services listed as operating in Union County.
- the determination of what is regarded as “significantly higher” may be based on a threshold percentage. For example, if the density of business listings in the same category is more than 25%-30% higher than the average business category density, then the proportion for that region may be determined to be significantly higher than the average.
- the threshold may be higher or lower in accordance with selectable design parameters and the context within which the algorithm is intended to be used.
- the spam score for each business listing in the corresponding business category is increased (step 330 ).
- the average density of residential landscape services that are listed as operating in other similar counties i.e., similar size, population, and number of business listings; located in the northeastern United States, etc.
- the spam score for the business listings in the corresponding business category is decreased (step 335 ).
- the spam score for the business listings in the corresponding business category is decreased (step 335 ).
- there are five natural gas providers listed as operating in Union County out of a total of 50,000 business listings e.g., a density of 0.01% for natural gas providers
- the average density of natural gas providers that are listed as operating in other similar counties is 0.009%, then it is unlikely that at any of the natural gas providers in Union County is generating map spam.
- the process 300 continues by determining whether other categories of businesses are to be checked for the likelihood that any of the businesses in the category may be generating map spam (step 340 ). If additional business categories are to be processed by the algorithm, the process 300 returns to step 325 ; otherwise, the process 300 continues to step 345 .
- Each business listing may include data representing a title for the business, a telephone number, and a web site.
- the data that is associated with each business listing may be used to identify the likelihood that the business is generating map spam. Specifically referring to the process 300 , a determination is made whether different business listings in the same area are associated with the same business title, the same phone number and/or the same web site. If so, then there is a strong likelihood that this business is generating map spam (step 345 ).
- a likelihood that business listings in an area that share identifying data are map spam may depend on the number of businesses listings that share the data and a size of the area. For example, if there are twenty different business listings in a two mile radius of an urban area that are associated with “Joe's Plumbing”, then there is a strong likelihood that the business named “Joe's Plumbing” is generating map spam. Similarly, if there are two business listings on the same block that are identified as “Joe's Plumbing”, then there is a strong likelihood that these listings are map spam. Accordingly, if different business listings in the same area are associated with the same data, the spam score for each business listing is increased (step 350 ).
- national or international business listings may include the same identifying data.
- a pest control service may operate in several different states.
- different business listings for different locations where the service is present may include the same identifying data (e.g., the same toll free number and the same web site address).
- the process 300 may recognize the business listing as being a national business such that the spam score may not be increased due to different business listings including the same identifying data.
- the process 300 continues by determining whether the business listing is located in an area specifically zoned for residential use (step 360 ). Since it is unlikely that a business would be operating in a residential area, a business listing that purports to be located in a residential area may be generating map spam. In this case, the spam score for the business listing would be increased (step 365 ). For business listings that include an address that is located within an area that is zoned for commercial use, there is a likelihood that the business is actually operating at the address. Accordingly, the spam score for this business would be decreased (step 370 ).
- a business may attempt to attract customers by providing a searchable listing near a well-known site of interest, such as a popular tourist destination. Since visitors to such a location may not be familiar with the area, they may be more susceptible to fraudulent business practices. Accordingly, business listings near popular sites of interest may be more likely to be map spam than business listings located in other areas.
- the process 300 continues by determining whether other business listings are to be checked for the likelihood that they may be generating map spam (step 375 ). If additional business listings are to be processed by the algorithm, the process 300 returns to step 360 ; otherwise, the process 300 proceeds to step 380 .
- a determination of whether each business listing is likely a result of map spam is made by referencing the final spam score. Specifically, a business listing that is associated with a spam score that exceeds a predetermined threshold is identified as map spam (step 380 ). Similarly, a business listing that is associated with a spam score that does not exceed a threshold is not identified as being associated with a business that generates map spam.
- a search entity may have a policy that prevents any business that knowingly and willfully misrepresents itself to potential customers by preventing that business from appearing as a result in any search. In effect, the business that is identified as generating map spam is blacklisted from the search engine. In some cases, the search entity may be satisfied that the business is longer generating map spam and may return the listing to the group of searchable listings.
- the process 300 has been described by weighing three different factors that are used to identify the likelihood that a business is engaging in practices aimed at defrauding potential customers. In addition to factors of business category density, shared identifying data and location characteristics, other factors may be taken in consideration to determine the likelihood that a business is generating map spam. As discussed in additional detail below, an accurate determination of whether a business listing is map spam may be difficult based on only one such factor.
- spam factor may be increased or decreased by varying amounts depending on specific facts associated with any of the factors.
- a spam score having a range between zero and one will be used in the examples below. In this case, a spam score of 0.5 is neutral such that the score does not indicate any likelihood of whether the corresponding business listing is spam.
- the spam score in the event that a business category density is between 25%-50% higher than an average density, the spam score may be increased by 0.1.
- the spam score may be increased by 0.2.
- the spam score may be increased by 0.3 when the business category density more than 75% higher than the average business category density.
- the spam score may be decreased by 0.1.
- the spam score may be decreased by 0.15.
- the spam score may be decreased by 0.2 when the business category density more than 50% less than the average business category density.
- the varying spam scores may also be applied to business listings that share the same data and are located in the same region. For example, if two business listing share the same title in a geographic region that includes one hundred business listings, the spam score may be increased by 0.1. For thirty business listings that share the same telephone number in an area that includes one thousand five hundred business listings, the spam score may be increased by 0.2. The spam score may be increased by 0.3 when eighty business listings share the same website in a region that includes twenty five hundred business listings.
- the varying spam scores may also be applied to business listings that are located in a residential area. For example, if one business listing is located in a residential area, the spam score may be increased by 0.1. In the event that more than two of the same business listings are in a residential area, the spam score may be increased by 0.2. If the business listing is located in a region known to be uninhabited (e.g., on a desert road), the location may have been input with an error.
- any particular factor may be inconclusive.
- a business listing may identify a location in an area that has been zoned for both commercial and residential use. In this case, the spam score is neither increased nor decreased.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example screen shot 400 that may be viewed by a user operating a client device that is executing the algorithm to perform the process 300 .
- the screen shot 400 depicts a geographic area illustrated as a map showing several street blocks. Each pin on the map identifies a business listing that may be identified as a result of a search. As shown on the map, there are fifty-six different pins corresponding to fifty-six different business listings.
- Map pins that are identified by the same reference letter correspond to business listings in the same category. As shown on the map, fourteen different pins are identified with reference “A”. Accordingly, fourteen different business listings are included in the same business category.
- the map also shows four pins identified as either “B” or “B 1 ” (where B and B 1 refer to the same business category); three pins identified for each of the pins labeled with a “C”, “D” or “L”; two pins each for those labeled “E”, “G”, “H”, “I”, “J” or “T”; and one pin each for the remainder of the identifying reference letters.
- a disproportionately high incidence of a particular business category in a given geographic area is one factor to consider when identifying which businesses may be generating map spam.
- the business category identified by reference letter “A” is a private snow removal service and the map depicts a location that receives an average annual snowfall of twenty inches.
- an average incidence of category “A” is determined for similar locations. Since the example business category is snow removal and the map refers to a location having a moderate amount of snowfall each year, locations having a relatively mild winter season (e.g., Tampa, Fla.; Arlington, Ariz.) and locations having a relatively large amount of snowfall (e.g., Anchorage, Ak.; Fargo, N. Dak.) should not be used when calculating an average. Locations that are more useful would have about the same amount of average snowfall (e.g., Boise, Id.; Topeka, Kans.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Springfield, Ill.). Using locations that receive about twenty inches of snow per year, a determination might be made that one in five thousand businesses in such areas are private snow removal services. In other words, the business category density for snow removal services in these areas is 0.02%.
- each business listing in category “A” is identified as being a potential map spammer.
- a potential spammer may be identified by adjusting a spam score associated with the business listing.
- identifying a business listing as map spam Another factor to consider when identifying a business listing as map spam is whether any business listings are repeated at different locations. Repeated business listings may be determined by shared identifying data. Examples of identifying data may include a title of the business, a telephone number and a web site address.
- business listing “B” and “B 1 ” are in the same category.
- Business listing “B” is differentiated from the three “B 1 ” listings because the business listing identified as “B” does not share any identifying data as the “B 1 ” entries. As such, it is unlikely that the “B” listing is map spam, and the corresponding spam score is adjusted to reflect the unlikelihood.
- Each “B 1 ” business listing includes identifying data that is shared with the other “B 1 ” listings.
- the “B 1 ” business listing may refer to a business named “Acme Electricians”, a telephone number listed as (908)555-1234, and/or a web site identified as “acmeelectricians.com”. It is likely that this listing is map spam because it is unlikely that an electrician would have a physical presence at three different locations within ten blocks from each other. Thus, the spam score for each of the three “B 1 ” listings is adjusted to indicate a likelihood that the listings are map spam.
- An additional factor to consider when determining if a business listing may be map spam is whether an address of the listing corresponds to a location in an area that is zoned solely for residential use. A shown in FIG. 4 , the left portion of the map corresponds to a residential area. Three different business listings are located in this area: two instances of “C” and one instance of “Z”. Accordingly, since it is unlikely that a business operates out of a location that is zoned solely for residential use, the three business listings in this are area identified as possibly being map spam. Thus, the corresponding spam scores are adjusted accordingly.
- the factors for identifying whether a business listing may be spam can be used in conjunction with each other in order to further adjust the corresponding spam score.
- business category “C” corresponds to carpet cleaning services
- business category “Z” corresponds to house cleaning services. Since it is unlikely that two carpet cleaning services would operate out of the same residential area especially since there is another carpet cleaning service located in a nearby commercially zoned area, these business listing would be more likely to be map spam. In contrast, it would not be unusual for a house cleaning service to operate out of a person's home, especially considering that no other business in the area provides the same service. In this case, the spam score for business listing “Z” may be adjusted to indicate that it may not be map spam.
- a search entity may determine a threshold spam score at which a business listing must exceed in order to be considered as spam. For a spam score between zero and one, a suitable threshold may be 0.7. The search entity identifies all of the business listings that exceed the threshold. These business listings may be removed from the set of searchable listings such that a user of the search engine would not receive map spam from these businesses as search results. Alternatively, the search entity may contact the businesses having spam scores that exceed the threshold to present the business with an opportunity to provide legitimate reasons for why their listings appear to be map spam. If the business is, in fact, generating map spam, the search entity may provide them with an opportunity to rectify the situation by halting their deceptive marketing practices.
