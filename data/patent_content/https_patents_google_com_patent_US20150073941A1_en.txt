Abstract
Description
- This specification relates to information retrieval.
- Users can use various web sites to plan travel including reserving hotel stays. Conventionally, a user navigates to either a web site corresponding to a particular entity (e.g., a site belonging to a specific hotel or hotel brand) or to a web based travel booking site that provides access to several different hotels. Once the user has identified an itinerary for travel (e.g., a particular hotel for a particular date range), they can typically purchase the itinerary directly through the web site.
- This specification describes technologies relating to information retrieval.
- Users can search for hotels by submitting a search query to a search system, where the search query includes a location. The location can be a geographic region (e.g., a city, state, neighborhood, or address), a particular hotel, or a point of interest. Particular locations can be suggested in response to a search query. The suggested locations can include geographic regions, hotels, and points of interest that are associated with the submitted query. Users can select a suggested location to obtain information (e.g., particular search results) responsive to the selected location.
- In some implementations, a user selects a geographic region from the suggested locations. Selecting a geographic region can result in hotel locations responsive the suggested location being provided for display on a map interface. The hotel locations can be displayed using, for example, graphics or icons. Hotel locations shown on a map can include some (e.g., a subset of all hotels) or all hotels within in the geographic region or particular hotels within the geographic region that satisfy a user's search criteria. Filters can be drawn to encompass areas based on hotel locations. For example, polygon-shaped filters can be drawn around a particular geographic region. Users can manipulate the drawn polygon-shaped filters (e.g., by dragging the polygon to different regions on the map or by adjusting the polygon vertices) to restrict or to enlarge the polygon-shaped filters which reduces or increases, respectively, the number of hotel locations displayed on a map.
- In some implementations, a user selects a hotel from the suggested locations. Selection of a hotel can result in a search being performed to identify hotels located within a geographic region and that are associated with the selected hotel. Additionally, selection of a hotel can result in the selected hotel being added to a shortlist of user selected hotels. The shortlist can be provided in a hotel results interface, which the user can use to compare the hotels in the shortlist prior to making a purchasing decision.
- In some implementations, a user selects a point of interest from the suggested locations. Selection of a point of interest can result in a display of a map interface for a geographic region associated with the point of interest. Additionally, a map indicator can be displayed over the map interface to identify the selected point of interest together with hotels located within the same geographic region that is associated with the point of interest. Users can select hotels displayed on the map interface based in part on their proximity to the map indicator identifying the selected point of interest. In some implementations, users can add and/or delete map indicators identifying points of interest on a geographic region.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search query, where the search query includes one or more terms; identifying one or more locations associated with the one or more terms prior to execution of the search query; providing the one or more locations as query suggestions; receiving a selection of a location; and in response to the selection, determining that the selected location references a hotel and providing a hotel search results interface, the hotel search results interface including a first region displaying one or more hotel listings, where the hotels listings include hotels located within a geographic region containing the selected hotel, and a second region, where the second region is configured to present one or more user selected hotels from the one or more hotel listings. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- These and other embodiments can optionally include one or more of the following features. The hotel search results interface includes a third region that is configured to present a hotel card for the hotel corresponding to the selected location as an overlay to the first and second regions. The hotel corresponding to the selected location is added to a shortlist of user selected hotels.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample system 100. Thesystem 100 includes amapping system 104 in communication with one ormore users 102 through anetwork 112. In particular, themapping system 104 receives information from amap database 106 in order to provide mapping data for displaying particular geographic regions. Themap database 106 can store, for example, different types of maps for geographic regions (e.g., two-dimensional maps, three-dimensional maps, and satellite maps). Themapping system 104 can receive information from various other databases (e.g., a traffic database) and can display the received information. - A user can interact with the
mapping system 104 through a client device. For example, the client device can be a computer coupled to themapping system 104 through anetwork 112. Thenetwork 112 can be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony or wireless networks, or a combination thereof. The client device will generally include a random access memory (RAM) and a processor. A user can submit a query to themapping system 104. When the user submits a query, the query is transmitted through a network to themapping system 104. Themapping system 104 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. - Additionally, the
mapping system 104 obtains information pertaining to points of interest from a points ofinterest database 108. The points ofinterest database 108 can store, for example, points of interests located in various geographic regions. Further, themapping system 104 receives hotel information from ahotel database 110, for example, to determine locations of hotels for identification on a map, e.g., when the hotels are responsive to particular hotel search parameters. Thehotel database 110 can store, for example, a listing of hotels for a geographic region, corresponding pricing information, dates of availability, and location. The term “hotel” as used in the specification can refer generically to various types of accommodations including hotels, motels, lodges, or resorts. Information pertaining to various accommodations (e.g., hotels, motels, lodges, and resorts) can be stored in different databases, the same database, or as a combination of databases. - The
mapping system 104 uses the obtained map information and points of interest information to identify areas containing points of interest on a map of a geographic region. The areas containing points of interest can be identified in advance or in response to a user request for a particular geographic region. In some implementations, themapping system 104 can display a map indicator identifying a point of interest on a map of a geographic region in response to a search query for that point of interest. Themapping system 104 uses the obtained map information, points of interest information, and hotel information to display geographic regions, hotel locations, and points of interest on a map. In some implementations, the hotels displayed on a map are determined based on additional user specified search criteria (e.g., hotel price, location, class, and reviews). -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for providing locations. For convenience, the process 200 will be described with respect to a system (e.g., system 100) including one or more computing devices that performs the process 200. - The system provides a search interface (202). The search interface can be part of a separate travel site or initiated through a particular search interface. The search interface can be accessed directly by the user, for example, by accessing a travel search web page. Alternatively, a user can enter a query “hotels” or “hotels San Francisco” in a search interface and be directed to the travel search interface. In another example, the user can provide a query to a map search interface that specifies a request for hotels in a particular geographic location (e.g., “hotels san Francisco” or “hotels 94107”). In some implementations, user provides a query to a map search interface that specifies a request for hotels in proximity to a particular point of interest (e.g., “hotels empire state building”).
- The provided search interface can include one or more search parameters particular to the travel type. For example, for a hotel search, the search parameters can include a location and one or more travel dates. The location can be a particular geographic region, for example, a particular neighborhood, city, region, or country. The travel dates can include both a check-in and check-out date or a check-in date and a number of nights. Other parameters can also be provided by the search interface, for example, indicating a type of room (e.g., king, double), smoking preferences, hotel class, or reviewer rating.
- The system receives a search query (204). Search queries can be received from a client device communicating over a network, where the client device interacts with the system using an interface, such as a network interface. The search query can include one or more terms received from a user. For example, the search query can be “Eiffel.” In some implementations, a user enters a search query including one or more terms, where the terms include a location. In some implementations, the location is a name for a geographic region. In some other implementations, the location is a hotel. In yet some other implementations, the location is point of interest.
- During entry of the search query to the system, suggestions can be provided to the user (e.g., in a drop-down menu) so that the user can select from different options. The suggestions can be suggested queries including the same or additional autocompleted query terms. In some implementations, the suggestions are based on other users' search activities. The suggestions can be algorithmically determined based on a number of objective factors (e.g., popularity of search terms) without human intervention. For example, the user can enter “xyz hotel,” and the system can provide suggested queries “XYZ Hotel, New York, N.Y.,” “XYZ Hotel, San Francisco, Calif.,” “XYZ Hotel, Dublin, Ireland,” and/or “XYZ Hotel, Shanghai, China.” The system can provide the suggestions based on a word-completion algorithm. Alternatively, the system can provide the suggestions based on historical data from prior search terms.
- In some implementations, the system provides suggestions for one or more locations that correspond to terms received from the user. The one or more locations can include geographic regions, names of hotels, and points of interest. For example, the user input of “empire” can result in suggested queries for “Empire State Building, New York, N.Y.,” “Empire Hotel Roof Top Bar, West 63rd Street, New York, N.Y.,” “Empire Landmark Hotel, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada,” and “Empire, CA.”
- In some implementations, instant search results are provided based in part upon entry of one or more characters in the search query. For example, the user can enter a search query for “ma,” and search results provided can include search results with phrases “Massachusetts,” “Maine,” and “Maryland,” each matching the search term “ma.” The user can continue with the search by inputting more characters and the search results can be updated instantly based on the entered characters. In some implementations, the search results are instantly updated based in part on the user hovering over one of the suggestions provided in the drop-down menu.
- The system receives a selection of a location (206). The user can select a location by selecting a suggested query from one or more suggested queries. The suggested query can include a reference to a query for a location (e.g., geographic regions, hotels, or points of interest). In response to the selection, the system can present one or more interfaces based on the selected location. For example, selecting a geographic region can result in the system providing a map interface containing a map of the geographic region for display. Selecting a particular hotel can result in the system providing a hotel search results interface. Further, selecting a point of interest can result in the system providing a map interface containing a map of a geographic region that contains the point of interest. In some implementations, a search query including a name for a particular location is entered and submitted without selecting a suggested location, and, in response, the system identifies resources related to the particular location.
- The system provides information responsive to the selected location (208). In some implementations, the system determines a type corresponding to the selected location and provides information based at least in part on the type of the selected location. For example, the system can provide different information depending on whether the type of the selected location is a geographic region, a hotel, or a point of interest. In some implementations, the system determines a type corresponding to the selected location by performing a database lookup using the selected location. For example, the system can determine a type by looking up a selected location (e.g., Manhattan, XYZ Hotel, or Empire State Building) using one or more of a map database, a hotel information database, and a points of interest database, and determining which database contains information responsive to the selected location.
- In some implementations, in a scenario where the selected location is a geographic region, the system provides a map interface containing a map of the geographic region for display. The map interface can include one or more bounding filters that encompass areas that contain a threshold number of points of interest. Additionally, the map interface can indicate geographic locations of that are hotels located within the selected geographic region. Moreover, the map interface can identify the selected geographic region using an indicator. For example, the geographic region can be identified using an icon (e.g., a balloon-shaped pin), a text box containing a name for the geographic region, a thumbnail image of the geographic region, or a combination thereof.
- In some other implementations, in a scenario where the selected location is a particular hotel, the system provides a hotel search results interface. The hotel search results interface can include a region that displays hotel listings for hotels that are located within a geographic region corresponding to the particular hotel. The hotel search results interface can also include a second region that is configured to present a hotel shortlist containing one or more user selected hotels from the displayed hotel listings. In some implementations, the hotel search results interface includes a third region that is configured to present a hotel card for the selected hotel as an overlay to the first and second regions. The hotel card can contain details pertaining to the particular hotel selected by the user (e.g., ratings, reviews, amenities, price, and reservations available). In some implementations, the particular hotel is added to the hotel shortlist, which can be used to compare hotels prior to making a purchasing decision.
- In yet some other implementations, in a scenario where the selected location is a point of interest, the system provides a map interface containing a map of a geographic region that contains the point of interest. The point of interest can be identified on the map using various indicators. For example, the point of interest can be identified using an icon (e.g., a balloon-shaped pin), a text box containing a name for the point of interest, a thumbnail image of the point of interest, or a combination thereof. In particular, points of interest can include places visited by tourists, places visited by locals, restaurants, shopping locations, entertainment locations, and particular geographic locations. Additionally, the map interface can display hotels located near the selected point of interest. Users can use the point of interest as a reference point when deciding between candidate hotels.
- In some implementations, the map indicator for the point of interest is updated by revising the search query to include a different geographic region or point of interest. In some other implementations, searching for additional geographic regions or points of interest results in additional map indicators being displayed on the map. In various implementations, users can refine the number of hotels displayed on a map by selecting a map indicator identifying a geographic region or a point of interest. For example, a user can click on a map indicator to specify that only hotels located within a specified distance from the map indicator should be displayed on the map interface.
- For example, a user wanting to book a hotel stay near the Empire State Building can search for “empire state building.” In response to the query, the system can provide a map interface containing a map of a geographic region that contains the Empire State Building (e.g., Manhattan). The system can identify the Empire State Building on the map using a map indicator (e.g., a balloon-shaped pin). The system can also indicate on the map locations of hotels that are located within the geographic region that contains the Empire State Building.
- In some implementations, the system indicates on the map a subset of all hotel locations based at least in part on specified criteria. For example, the system can indicate locations of hotels that satisfy user specified filtering parameters (e.g., show only hotels with a hotel rating of 4 or more stars). In some other implementations, the user can refine the query to filter the displayed hotels. For example, a map showing hotel locations in a geographic region can be updated to show hotel locations for particular hotels (e.g., XYZ Hotel) by refining the query (e.g., as “empire state building xyz hotel” or “xyz hotel”). In to response to the query revision, the system can provide hotel locations for all XYZ Hotels available in the geographic region (e.g., “XYZ Hotel, 11 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y.,” “XYZ Hotel, 55 Park Ave., New York, N.Y.,” and “XYZ Hotel, 913 Columbus Ave., New York, N.Y.”).
- Using the map interface, the user can visually determine geographic locations of candidate hotels in relation to the Empire State Building. The user can obtain additional information about a particular hotel by selecting the hotel from the map interface (e.g., view pictures or videos associated with the particular hotel, check hotel availability, and see average prices for selected travel dates). In some implementations, users are directed to one or more travel sites, where the users can book hotel stays at selected hotels. Alternatively, the user can add a particular hotel to a hotel shortlist, which can be used to compare hotels prior to making a purchasing decision using various criteria (e.g., hotel class, user ratings, price, and hotel deal).
-
FIG. 3 is an examplehotel search interface 300. Thehotel search interface 300 includes alocation search box 302, which can be used to search for locations (e.g., a geographic region, a hotel, or a point of interest). A suggested locations drop-down menu 304 is shown. The suggested locations drop-down menu 304 can provide to a user suggested locations that match the user's input during entry of a search query to the system. For example, the user has typed “empire” in thelocation search box 302. In response to the typing, the system has provided suggested locations in the drop-down menu 304. In particular, the suggested locations include one or more geographic regions (e.g., “Empire, CA”), one or more hotels (e.g., “Empire Landmark Hotel, Robson Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada”), and one or more points of interest (e.g., “Empire State Building, NY,” “Empire Hotel Roof Top Bar, West 63rd Street, New York, N.Y.”). The user can complete the search query by selecting one of the suggested locations from the suggested entities drop-down menu 304. -
FIG. 4 is an example hotel results interface 400. The hotel results interface 400 includes afirst region 402 displaying a listing ofhotel results 404, asecond region 406 for displaying a hotel shortlist, dates 408, andfiltering parameters 410. The hotel results interface 400 also shows an location search box 401 and a suggested locations drop-down menu 403. - The suggested locations drop-
down menu 403 can provide to a user suggested locations that match the user's search query during entry of a search query to the system using the location search box 401. For example, the user has typed “XYZ Hotel” in the location search box 401. In response to the typing, the system has provided suggested locations in the drop-down menu 403. In particular, the suggested locations include various hotels matching “XYZ Hotel” (e.g., “XYZ Hotel, New York, N.Y.”, “XYZ Hotel, Edinburgh, United Kingdom”, and “XYZ Hotel, Jhongjheng District, Taiwan”). The user can complete the search query by selecting one of the suggested locations from the suggested locations drop-down menu 403. - In some other implementations, the system provides a hotel search results interface that includes a region that displays hotel listings for hotels that are located within a geographic region corresponding to the selected hotel. For example, selection of “XYZ Hotel, New York, N.Y.” can result in display of hotel listings for hotels that are located within New York, N.Y. The hotel search results interface can also include a second region that is configured to present a hotel shortlist containing one or more user selected hotels from the displayed hotel listings. For example, the “XYZ Hotel, New York, N.Y.” hotel can be added to the hotel shortlist, since it was selected by the user. In some implementations, the hotel search results interface includes a third region that is configured to present a hotel card for the selected hotel “XYZ Hotel, New York, N.Y.” as an overlay to the first and second regions. The hotel card can contain details pertaining to the “XYZ Hotel, New York, N.Y.” (e.g., ratings, reviews, amenities, price, and reservations available).
- The listing of
hotel results 404 includes a number of separate listings for hotels responsive to a search query. For example, the hotel results 404 include hotel listings responsive to a geographic region, New York, N.Y., for the dates of October 18 to October 19 (as shown in dates 408). The listing can include additional hotel results not shown, but accessible though user interaction with the hotel results interface 400 (e.g., using scroll bar or links to additional pages of results). - Each of the individual listings includes summary information about the particular hotel. For example,
hotel result 412 includes the hotel name, a representative image, a hotel rating, a user rating, a price per night, and a comparison of the price per night to the hotel's typical price. Thehotel result 412 also includes an excerpt (e.g., a snippet) of a review. Thehotel result 412 can be selected by the user and added to ahotel shortlist 406. Adding the hotel result to the shortlist adds the particular hotel to thesecond region 406. The user can then assemble one or more hotels from the listing ofhotel results 404 within thesecond region 406. In some alternative implementations, a user can drag and drop hotel results to thesecond region 406 to add them to the shortlist. Additionally, the user can order the hotels within the shortlist. - The listing of
hotel results 404 also includes a number of sortingheaders 414 that the user can select in order to modify the ordering of the hotels included in the listing of hotel results 404. The sortingheaders 414 include the hotel class, the user rating, the price per night, and the relative price comparing the price per night to the hotel's typical price. - The map region, which is not visible because of the suggested location drop-
down menu 403, can display the geographic locations for one or more of the hotels displayed in the listing of hotel results 404. A bounding polygon can define a region in which all the hotels are located. In some implementations, selection of the map allows the user to view additional details about the location or to modify the selected area in which hotel results are located (e.g., as bound by the polygon), as discussed in more detail in connection withFIG. 5 . - The
dates 408 are editable so that the user can modify the dates for the hotel stay. For example, the user can modify the check in date, the check-out date, or both. Thefiltering parameters 410 include a number of separate filtering parameters that can be used to refine the provided results. Thefiltering parameters 410 shown include filters for price, hotel class, user rating, and amenities. Selection of a particular type of filtering parameter can results in an expansion displaying one or more filtering options for that filtering parameter. A subsequent selection of the filtering parameter can collapse the filtering options. - While the example listing of hotel results shown in
FIG. 4 includes, for example, prices and hotel ratings, other hotel results interfaces can present listings of hotel results that have some, all, or none of these features. For example, prices may not be shown and/or hotel ratings may not be shown. -
FIG. 5 is anexample map interface 500 including a map indicator identifying ageographic region 510. Themap 500 is displayed in response to a user search query for a geographic region for “Manhattan.” Themap 500 includes a search filter 502, which has been populated with “Manhattan.” The search filter 502 can be used to input a search query or to refine an existing query (e.g., based on geographic region, a particular hotel, or a point of interest). For example, a user can enter a query “XYZ hotel” and then refine the provided results by entering the query “XYX hotel new york.” The user can also refine a query for “XYZ hotel” to “XYZ hotel empire state building” to identify a particular XYZ Hotel that is located near the Empire State Building. - The
map region 504 displays map results responsive to the query. This includes both a geographic representation of the location identified by the query (in this case, New York) as well as additional markers. In particular, themap region 504 includeshotel markers 506 for identifying the location of specific hotels within the geographic region. In some implementations, a marker is directly selectable by a user in order to obtain additional information about the hotel. In addition, themap region 504 shows an adjustable polygon-shaped filter 508. The polygon-shaped filter 508 encompasses an area identified to contain a threshold number of points of interests. Only hotels within the polygon-shaped filter 508 are indicated. In addition, the polygon-shaped filter is adjustable to increase or decrease the number of hotels shown. In particular, themap region 504 indicates the geographic location for “Manhattan” using amap indicator 510. Themap indicator 510 provides a reference point for the user when deciding between candidate hotels. -
FIG. 6 is anexample map interface 600 including a map indicator identifying a point ofinterest 610. Themap 600 is displayed in response to a user search query for a point of interest for “Old Town Triangle Theater, Chicago.” Themap 600 includes asearch filter 602. Thesearch filter 602 can be used to input a search query or to refine an existing query (e.g., based on geographic region, a particular hotel, or a point of interest). For example, a user can enter a query “XYZ hotel” and then refine the provided results by entering the query “XYX hotel new york.” The user can also refine a query for “XYZ hotel” to “XYZ hotel empire state building” to identify a particular XYZ Hotel that is located near the Empire State Building.” - The
map region 604 displays map results responsive to the query. This includes both a geographic representation of the location corresponding to the point of interest identified by to the query (in this case, Chicago, Ill.) as well as additional markers. In particular, themap region 604 includeshotel markers 606 for identifying the location of specific hotels within the geographic region. In some implementations, a marker is directly selectable by a user in order to obtain additional information about the hotel. In addition, themap region 604 shows an adjustable polygon-shapedfilter 608. The polygon-shapedfilter 608 encompasses an area identified to contain a threshold number of points of interests. Only hotels within the polygon-shapedfilter 608 are indicated. In addition, the polygon-shaped filter is adjustable to increase or decrease the number of hotels shown. In particular, themap region 604 indicates the geographic location for the point of interest “Old Town Triangle Theater” in Chicago using amap indicator 610. Themap indicator 610 provides a reference point for the user when deciding between candidate hotels. In particular, the user can use themap region 604 to determine which candidate hotels are closest to the point of interest. In some implementations, users can refine the number of hotels displayed on a map by selecting themap indicator 610. For example, a user can click on themap indicator 610 to specify that only hotels located within a specified distance from themap indicator 610 should be displayed on the map interface 600 (e.g., display hotels located within 10 blocks of the map indicator). - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
