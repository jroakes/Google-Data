After project (or " abstract to be intended to "), which requests the active manager run in equipment to identify setting in user
Whether standby upper (" executing runing time binding ") has the application (" target ", " app disposer " or " component ") being more suitable available
To check (or " parsing is intended to ") content item.If the application not being more suitable in the equipment of user is available, activity
Manager creates hashed value (" hash prefix " from the constrained portions (for example, hash of the host of URL) of the information in relation to content item
Or " keyed hash is abstract to be intended to "), and a part of the hashed value (for example, n first) is provided to resolver interface.The solution
Parser interface is by the similar portion (example of the hashed value of the useful application in the part of the hashed value of content item and application database
Such as, preceding n of the hash of the host of URL) project that can be checked based on those useful applications is compared, and for it
The useful application that the part of hash value part (for example, preceding n of corresponding hashed value) and the hashed value of content item matches,
The full hash value (for example, all positions of the hash of the host of URL) for checking project corresponding to the useful application is resolved
Device interface is provided to active manager.The resolver interface then compares the full hash value (hash of the host of URL of content item
All positions) and identify which useful application (if there is) have match with the full hash value of the content item it is corresponding
Full hash value.When identifying has the useful application with the matched full hash value of full hash value of content item, the solution

Block diagram.
Client 110 and server 130 are attached via respective communication module 218 and 238 by network 150.
Communication module 218 and 238 is configured as docking with network 150 to send and receive information, and that such as goes on network other sets
Standby data, request, response and order.Communication module 218 and 238 for example can be modem or Ethernet card.Client
End 110 further includes the input equipment 216 of such as touch screen, keyboard or mouse and the output equipment 214 of such as display.
Client 110 further comprises processor 212, communication module 218 and memory 220.Memory 220 includes initial
Using 222, content item 224, active manager 226, resolver interface 228, erector interface 230 and the application 240 being suitble to.It is suitable
Why the application 240 of conjunction is because it is optionally being determined the memory 220 suitable for access client 110 with dotted line diagram
In content item 224 after the memory 220 of client 110 is downloaded to from the application database 234 on server 130.
Content item 224 for example can be URL, webpage, the document of such as text document, electrical form, media file (example
Such as, audio, image, video perhaps their any combination) or be configured as being interacted by the user of client 110
Any other data object.In some aspects, content item can be more general intention, such as action which be to be,
Such as it shoots photo or listens to audio file.Original application 222 can be configured as internally holding any of the offer access of item 224
Using such as web browser, mobile application, document editor or image viewer.In some aspects, original application 222 is by office
It is limited to provide access to content item, such as identifies the position of content item 224, but do not allow for checking content item 224 by user
Or it modifies to it.
Active manager 226 is the process that runs in the operating system of client 110 (for example, software extensions or work
Tool), it is configured as receiving from the application in client 110 in relation to such as content in the memory 220 for client 110
The request of the access of 224 data object and it is made a response.As described in further detail below, active manager
226 are configured as reading in certain aspects with setting value to determine which application or service to resolver interface 228 and installation
Device interface 230 makes a response.Active manager 226 is additionally configured to determine whether enabled or invalid resolver interface 228 and peace
Device interface 230 is filled, and provides the energy of management resolver interface 228 and erector interface 230 for the user of client 110
Power.Active manager 226 be configured to it is determined that when and for which type selected content item
(for example, abstract be intended to) consulting resolver interface 228, and resolver interface 228 is then called in due course.In certain sides
Face, certain form of content item can be analytically excluded in the assessment of device interface 228, such as certain domains or certain form of
File.
In some aspects, active manager 226 is additionally configured to generate the related content for being provided to resolver interface 228
The constrained portions (or " clue ") of the information of item 224, and determine how the limited portion for generating the information in relation to content item 224
Point.Such as and as will be described in details further below, if content item be URL (for example, " https: //
En.websiteencyclopedia.com/diabetes "), then the information can be by abandoning scheme (for example, " https ")
Only retain host (for example, " en.websiteencyclopedia.com ") next life with path (for example, "/diabetes ")
At.Active manager 226 can dissipate " en.websiteencyclopedia.com " using such as SHA-256 hashing algorithm
Column algorithm, and select first 23 as the information for being provided to resolver interface 228.Thus, it is supposed that the O rank (1B) on internet
URL host, 23 will allow about 100 other hosts to hash to this numerical value of the information.
In some aspects, active manager 226 is also further configured as in response to for letter provided by content item 224
Analytically device interface 228 receives the list (or " candidate is intended to disposer ") applied to breath, and is in case of presence content
Item 224 selects the application of best match.Assuming that there are best match, active manager 226 be subsequently responsible for be for content item 224
No can be accessed by matching application generates successfully with failure scenario (" pending intention ") and by them together with matching application
Mark is sent together to erector interface 230 to be installed.
Such as active manager 226, resolver interface 228 is the process run in the operating system of client 110.Such as
It is further detailed below, resolver interface 228 is configured as receiving from active manager and have been selected therewith with user
The interactive relevant information of content item 224 (for example, the abstract intention to be parsed), and resolver interface 228 is to resolver
Interface 228 returns to the list (for example, the set of candidate " app disposer ") of the potential application for interacting with the project.It is related
The constrained portions of the information of content item 224 can be a part of the abstract intention of keyed hash.In some aspects, resolver connects
Mouth 228 does not receive the completely abstract intention (for example, entire URL) that active manager 226 attempts the content item 224 of disposition.With
In the data structure format that the list of the potential application interacted with the project can be used with the operating system inside of client 110
It provides, such as intention filter.Resolver interface 228 is intended to make a response with low delay (< 200ms), and for making
Implement cache policies in the case where 130 infrastructure of server.Resolver interface 228 may be implemented as in client

The processor 212 of client 110 is configured as executing instruction, such as by physical code to the finger in processor 212
It enables, from the received instruction of software or combination in memory 220.For example, the processor 212 of client 110 executes
Instruction is identified and is used for and content item to provide secure access by constrained portions to the information in relation to content item 224
The suitable application (for example, the application 240 being suitble to) of 224 interactions.
Particularly, the processor 212 of client 110 executes so that processor 212 (uses input in original application 222
Equipment 216) receive (example from the user for selecting to interact with the content item 224 that can be accessed with the original application 222
Such as, from original application 222) instruction.For example, user can click, touches or be selected in other ways in original application
(using output equipment 214) in 222, what is shown is directed toward the link of content item 224.Interaction can be various types, including but not
It is confined to open URL, load webpage, edits or check document, or scanning bar code.
The processor 212 of client 110 also executes so that processor 212 is from the limited portion of the information in relation to content item 224
Mitogenetic (for example, from active manager 226) instruction at hashed value.Various cryptographic Hash functions can be used in the hashed value
It generates, as an example, such as 256 hash function of secure hash algorithm (SHA) (" SHA-256 "), is counted using 32 words
It calculates.For example, being URL in some terms, the hashed value is generated from the host from the URL in wherein content item 224.
The processor 212 of client 110 further executes so that processor will be from the limited of the information in relation to content item 224
A part of part hashed value generated at least one suitable 240 institute of application available in application database 234
(for example, from resolver interface 228) instruction that the corresponding part of the hashed value of generation is compared.110 quilt of client
It is configured so that the corresponding communication module 218 and 238 of client 110 and server 130 accesses server by network 150
Application database 234 on 130.
It in some aspects, is processing for suitable 240 hashed values generated of application available in application database 234
Device 212 in application database 234 using one of multiple hashed values generated.Particularly, the processor of client 110
212 execute (for example, from resolver interface 228) to give an order: being answered using identification from the corresponding of application database 234
With the information for the content for being configured as interacting for each application in application database 234 (including suitable application
240) corresponding hashed value is generated.
Alternatively, the processor 236 of server 130 is configured as generating for the application in application database 234 and dissipate
Train value, and client 110 can request hashed value generated to execute and being limited from the information in relation to content item 234
The comparison of the part of part hashed value generated.
In these areas, the processor 212 of client 110 also executes (for example, from resolver interface 228) and refers to below
Enable: by the part of the hashed value of content item 224 and the corresponding part of the hashed value of the application from application database 234 into
Row compares, and determines the part of the hashed value of content item 224 and dissipating at least some applications from application database 234
(parts of the hashed value including the application 240 being suitble to) at least some in the corresponding part of train value match.For example, content item
First 23 of the hashed value in the domain of 224 URL and the URL for being configured as being disposed by each application in application database 234
First 23 of each hashed value in domain be compared, and have in application database 234 with the hash of content item this 23
The application of those of 23 hashed values that position matches is identified as to be able to access that the application of content item 224.Content item 224
Entire hashed value (for example, whole positions of hash) is then (for example, by the processor 212 and on client 110 of client 110)
With in application database 243 before be confirmed as having the entire hashed value using subset of the compatible portion of hashed value into
Row compares, and the hashed value of content item 224 compared with the hashed value of suitable application 240 between matching it is identified.It is special
Not, the processor 212 of client 110 executes (for example, from resolver interface 228) further to give an order: in content
It the part of the hashed value of item 224 will be interior when indicating to match compared with the corresponding part of the hashed value for the application 240 being suitble to
The hashed value (that is, full hash value) of the hashed value (that is, full hash value) and the application 240 being suitble to of holding item 224 is compared.
For example, if first 23 of hashed value of first 23 of the hashed value of content item 224 and the application 240 being suitble to match, in
Hold whole 32 of the hashed value of item 224 to be compared with whole 32 of the hashed value for the application 240 being suitble to.In certain sides
The ratio of the hashed value (that is, full hash value) of face, the hashed value (that is, full hash value) of content item 224 and the application 240 being suitble to
It executes more on client 110, to limit the access of 130 pairs of institute's comparison informations of network 150 or server.If using data
A part (for example, first 23) of the hashed value of application in library 234 not with the part phase of the hashed value of content item 224
Match, then the application in application database 234 is identified as the non-suitable candidate for access item 224.
In some aspects, processor 212 executes so that processor 212 is by the part of hashed value and needle application data
The corresponding part of available suitable 240 at least one hashed value generated of application determines before being compared in library 234
