- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment for delivering content.
- FIG. 2A shows an example system for creating groups.
- FIGS. 2B and 2C collectively show an example system for targeting content to groups of users in a user network.

- FIG. 3C is a flowchart of an example process for a content sponsor to target content to users in cliques.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- an inferred group can be determined for users who are well-connected to each other and/or who share common interests.
- the inferred group is not one of a user's user-defined groups or circles (e.g., friends, family, etc.).
- a content sponsor can specify (e.g., using targeting criteria) to target content (e.g., advertisements) to one or more inferred groups, and thus to the users in those groups.
- the inferred groups can be of the form of a clique.
- a clique is a subset of individuals in which every person is connected to every other person.
- the connections can be through a network, such as a connection in a social network, or by way of sharing a common interest or trait.
- Example cliques include cliques of 18- to 24-year-olds, cliques of middle-aged men, cliques of working young women, etc., each of which may be of interest to content sponsors for targeting purposes.
- one of the users receives targeted content, it can include content that is served because the user is a member of a particular inferred group or clique. While cliques are used as an example of inferred groups, the methods, processes and systems described in this document can apply to any other groups of users, inferred or otherwise.
- Inferred groups can be determined in various ways. For example, intersections of two or more users' groups or circles (e.g., social groups or social circles) can be formed where all the users (or virtually all of the users) communicate with each other. The determination of inferred groups can further be based on the subject matter of communications among the users. For example, a “yoga” inferred group can be formed among users in a user network (e.g., a social network) who have communicated extensively about yoga such as through postings, email or other communications in the user network. Demographic information (e.g., age, gender, etc.) can also be used in determining inferred groups. For example, another “yoga” inferred group can be an “under-40, female yoga” inferred group that is formed because several women under 40 who are connected in a network have discussed yoga with each other on a networking site.
- a user network e.g., a social network
- Demographic information e.g., age, gender, etc.
- inferred groups can be determined from a social graph, which is composed of one or more edges connecting the users (e.g., users are represented as nodes in the graph).
- a clique can be a subset or a sub-group of users who have edges connecting each other.
- two users can be connected to each other if they are part of each other's circles or if they have mutually agreed to form a social network connection. Users can be connected in other ways.
- determining a sub-group of users in the social graph can depend on the number of communications between the users and/or the subject matter of the communications.
- inferred groups can be determined independently of a user's circles. For example, an inferred group can be formed for a set of users who actively engage in conversation around a particular topic on a social networking site, even if the users are not friends or followers of each other. An example is an inferred group that includes users from the entire United States who have discussed a new video game that is about to be released to the public. Other inferred groups can rely greatly on a user's circles, such as if a user repeatedly shares many technical articles with users in a particular circle.
- Inferred groups can be characterized in different ways. For example, the characteristics of an inferred group can be based on explicit information that can include information specified by users on their social network profile (e.g., age, gender, etc.). In another example, the characteristics of an inferred group can be based on implicit information, including information about an inferred group of users that is learned or inferred based on user behavior (e.g., posts or other communications by fans of action movies).
- Content sponsors can target content to users based on inferred groups.
- a content sponsor C can submit offers (e.g., bids for use in an auction or an offer that is part of a reservation, hereinafter collectively referred to as an “offer”) for subsequent impressions of content items (e.g., advertisements) in a campaign to users in selected inferred groups G.
- the offers can depend, for example, on whether users to whom the content is to be presented are members of the selected inferred groups G.
- the user's inferred groups can be looked up or determined, and corresponding offers for content can be identified (e.g., from offers made by the content sponsor C and other content sponsors). For example, if the user is a member of selected inferred groups G associated with the offer, then the bid for the content item can be identified. Depending on the terms of the offer, the content item associated with the content sponsor C can be provided in response to the request for content.
- targeting to inferred groups can be used, consider an advertiser who has a social product such as a social game, a social app, or some other product that users in a user network (e.g., a social network) may use and/or discuss (e.g., in posts, email or other communications). Because of the social nature of the product, the advertiser would like the product to be adopted by a set of users who may be more likely to engage with each other, i.e., users who are connected to each other or otherwise related in a social sense. The advertiser can want this because a social product can be more successful if it is used by N friends rather than by N strangers. By targeting content to users in cliques or inferred groups who, for example, have discussed the subject matter of the product, advertisers (e.g., content sponsors) may be able to achieve better results (e.g., a higher conversion rate).
- a social product such as a social game, a social app, or some other product that users in a user network (e.g.
- users may not be grouped together unless they opt in to policies that group users based, for example, on inferred groups.
- users can opt out of being targeted for content, including advertisements, based on any inferred groups to which they belong.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), content publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and content publishers 109 .
- the example environment 100 further includes at least one user network, e.g. social network 130 , an inferred group engine 121 for associating groups of users in the social network 130 with one or more inferred groups, and a sponsor interface 120 that the content sponsor 108 can use to create campaigns for content items, including to target content items to users who are associated with inferred groups selected for targeting by the content sponsor 108 .
- user network e.g. social network 130
- inferred group engine 121 for associating groups of users in the social network 130 with one or more inferred groups
- a sponsor interface 120 that the content sponsor 108 can use to create campaigns for content items, including to target content items to users who are associated with inferred groups selected for targeting by the content sponsor 108 .
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores that are used in various stages to create the inferred groups.
- network communications 122 can store information (e.g., in an anonymized way) about each user's interactions and communications within the social network 130 .
- the information can include, for example, information regarding the times and frequencies that users have communicated with other users and the subject matter of those communications.
- a data store of inferred groups 124 can include information about each inferred group.
- the information can include, for example, lists of users who are in the inferred group.
- Other information stored for each inferred group can include the number of members in the inferred group, the criteria used to determine the inferred group, demographic information associated with users in the inferred group, and the type of inferred group (e.g., whether the inferred group is based on subject matter, intersections of users' circles, a frequency of communications, or some combination).
- a data store of campaigns 126 can store campaigns that are created by content sponsors 108 , e.g., using the sponsor interface 120 .
- the campaigns 126 can include targeting criteria specified by content sponsors 108 to target content to users in inferred groups.
- the inferred group engine 121 can update the inferred groups 124 over time, for example, as changes occur in the network communications 122 or for other reasons. For example, the inferred group engine 121 can be invoked on a scheduled basis or as needed to keep the information for the inferred groups 124 up-to-date.
- the content management system 110 includes a request handler that can receive a request for content from a user, identify one or more eligible content items, and provide a content item responsive to the request. More specifically, the request handler can determine, for campaigns 126 that include targeting criteria defined to target to users in inferred groups, if the user who provided the request for content is a member of one of the inferred groups selected by the content sponsor 108 . In some implementations, the request handler can access the inferred groups 124 to determine the inferred groups to which a user belongs.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a reservation process a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation) and information related to inferred groups.
- Information related to inferred groups can include, but is not limited to, whether a content item has been displayed to other members of the inferred group, a response of other members of the inferred group to the content item, and the history of responses of members of the inferred group to content items similar to, for example, one that is being considered for selection.
- the content item can be an advertisement that appears while the users are visiting or otherwise interacting with a social network site.
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, performance with respect to the inferred group, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by serving content that is more likely to be of interest to the user.
- content items e.g., ads
- content items can be selected in part based on inferred groups to which the user belongs, which can also be an indication of how likely the user is to react positively to a content item, e.g., leading to a conversion.
- the inferred groups to which a user belongs can also be an indication of a likelihood that the user will discuss or share the content with other users within the inferred groups.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- opt out features related to social networking systems can allow the user to specify that the user's activity stream content is not to be used in ads, or to anonymize the information in some way. Further, in situations in which information is gathered and stored related to the subject matter of communications among users, the information can be aggregated (e.g., to a keyword level), personal information can be omitted (e.g., not stored), and the information can be associated with users using anonymized user identifiers.
- FIG. 2A shows an example system 200 for creating groups.
- an example inferred group 202 is shown in FIG. 2A that includes users Abby 204 a , Bart 204 b , Carl 204 c and Dave 204 d .
- Users 204 a - 204 i are represented in FIG. 2A as nodes in a graph 208 , and relationships (e.g., friendships, communications, etc.) among the users are represented by edges 210 in the graph 208 .
- the set of edges 210 that connect to any one of the users 204 a - 204 i can represent that user's relationships (e.g., friendships, communications, etc.) with other users in a social network 130 .
- inferred groups can be created that are based on other information, such as frequency of communication among users, the subject matter of each communication, user demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.), and/or other factors.
- the users Abby 204 a through Dave 204 d are users in both of Abby's circle of friends 206 a and Dave's circle of friend 206 b .
- the inferred group 202 is an intersection of Abby's circle of friends 206 a and Dave's circle of friends 206 b .
- not included in the inferred group 202 are user Gary 204 g (e.g., who is in Abby's circle of friends 206 a but not in Dave's circle of friends 206 b ) and users Emma 204 e , Fran 204 f and Hank 204 h (e.g., who are in Dave's circle of friends 206 b but not in Abby's circle of friends 206 a ).
- Dave's circle of friends 206 b can be, for example, one of several social circles that user Dave 204 d has within the social network 130 .
- user Dave 204 d can have separate circles of coworkers and family members in the social network 130 that are not depicted in the graph 208 .
- inferred groups that are created by the inferred group engine 121 can be created based, at least in part, on determining the intersections of one or more circles for each user with all other users in the plurality of users within the social network 130 .
- the inferred group engine 121 can create inferred groups 124 using information from network communications 122 .
- the inferred group engine 121 can identify the users 204 a - 204 i as users in the same user network.
- the inferred group engine 121 can determine the inferred group 202 , which can include, for example, a group of users in the social network 130 that is not, by itself, a user-defined circle in the user network.
- Lines 214 a indicate an example association between network communications 122 and the edges 210 in the graph 208 .
- Lines 214 b indicate an example association between network communications 122 and Abby's circle of friends 206 a and Dave's circle of friends 206 b.
- an inferred group can be a group of users that, among other criteria, are determined to have communicated at least a pre-determined number of times.
- the inferred group 202 can be the users that are in both of Abby's circle of friends 206 a and Dave's circle of friends 206 b and who have communicated at least twice, five times or more, or some other pre-determined number of times that can be used by the inferred group engine 121 to determine inferred groups.
- determining that users are in an inferred group can require, in addition to communication amount, that the user communications have occurred significantly recently (e.g., in the last year, month, etc.) or with sufficient frequency.
- the users Abby 204 a through Dave 204 d can be users who have communicated frequently within the last few months.
- Demographics can be used to determine inferred groups in some implementations.
- the creation of inferred groups of users can include determining users that are members of a same demographic (e.g., age, gender, etc.) who are also in cliques or connected socially in some way.
- a same demographic e.g., age, gender, etc.
- one example inferred group that can be created is an inferred group that includes users Bart 204 b , Carl 204 c and Dave 204 d , all of whom can be male between the ages of 18 and 24.
- the inferred group can also include other users not depicted in the graph 208 .
- inferred groups can be limited to users whose communications with other users are related to a single subject matter.
- an “environmentalist” inferred group can include members in Dave's circle of friends 206 b who are also members of the social circles of the users Hank 204 h and Izzy 204 i who have discussed global warming.
- Content sponsors can use the resulting “environmentalist” inferred group to target content related to environmental concerns (e.g., advertisements for electric cars) to users in the inferred group who may also share the content with other users within their circles (e.g., social circles) of the social network 130 .
- determining an inferred group can result from determining a sub-group of a social circle for a user and identifying users of the sub-group as belonging to the inferred group. For example, assume that user Abby 204 a has more than 1000 friends.
- the inferred group engine 121 can create an inferred group that can include a sub-group of Abby's friends who are under the age of 40, where the inferred group does not depend on the intersection of Abby's social circles with the social circles of other users.
- determining a sub-group of users can further comprise identifying the users of the sub-group based on a number of communications between the users.
- the inferred group of Abby's friends under 40 can be limited to users who have communicated with other users in the group at least a predetermined number of times (e.g., ten times or more).
- inferred groups based on sub-groups can be further limited based on subject matter of communications between the users.
- the inferred group of Abby's friends under 40 who have communicated at least a predetermined number of times can be limited to users who have discussed yoga.
- an inferred group e.g., a “tech” group
- Any of these example inferred groups can be chosen by content sponsors 108 to target content because members of the inferred groups may be more likely to share or discuss the content with others, including other members in the group.
- Combinations of relationships can be used to create inferred groups, e.g., based on relationships described in the previous examples.
- One example inferred group can be a “yoga” inferred group that includes female members, under age 40, who are members of Abby's, Emma's and Fran's social circles, and who have discussed the subject of yoga in the last three months.
- Another example includes an inferred group of users who have frequently discussed two subject matters: global warming and coffee.
- content sponsors can target content (e.g., packages of organic, rainforest-grown, Fair Trade coffee) to users in an inferred group whose membership in the inferred group is based on frequent discussions of subject matter related to the coffee.
- the graph 208 is just one of many graphs that can represent relationships among users in the social network 130 .
- any number of inferred groups, such as the inferred group 202 can be created.
- FIGS. 2B and 2C collectively show an example system 220 for targeting content to groups of users in a user network.
- FIG. 2B shows an example sponsor campaign interface 222 for specifying targeting criteria in a campaign that is used to target users in inferred groups 124 .
- the content sponsor 108 can use the sponsor campaign interface 222 to create one or more campaigns 126 (e.g., advertising campaigns) for presenting content (e.g., advertisements), including campaigns that are targeted to users in the social network 130 who are also members of inferred groups 124 .
- the sponsor interface 120 can provide the sponsor campaign interface 222 and/or other interfaces and screens for targeting content to users in inferred groups.
- FIG. 2C shows an example user interface 224 in which targeted content is provided based on the user's association with inferred groups 124 .
- the user interface 224 is one example of how the system 220 can provide targeted content to inferred groups of users in a user network (e.g., a social network). For example, advertisements from the content sponsor's advertising campaign (e.g., campaigns 126 ) can be provided in response to received requests to deliver content to the user interface 224 .
- the inferred groups 124 used by the system 220 can be created by the system 200 described with reference to FIG. 2A .
- the sponsor campaign interface 222 can include a targeting criteria area 226 from which the content sponsor 108 can select targeting parameters for a campaign.
- the targeting criteria area 226 can be one of multiple targeting areas within the sponsor campaign interface 222 .
- the targeting criteria area 226 can include one or more controls for receiving an indication from the content sponsor 108 to target one or more inferred groups of users.
- the content sponsor 108 can select a clique-targeting option 228 , e.g., by checking a “Target to users in Cliques” checkbox, as an indication to target content to inferred groups.
- the term “cliques,” for example, can be the term associated with inferred groups and displayed in various sponsor campaign interfaces.
- selection of the clique-targeting option 228 can result in the presentation of an options area 230 .
- the options area 230 can include individual controls, e.g., checkboxes 232 a - 232 c , for targeting different types of inferred groups.
- Example types of inferred groups can include female yoga enthusiasts under forty years old, male environmentalists, and sports enthusiasts with ages 18-25.
- inferred groups of female yoga enthusiasts under forty years old including, for example, the “Yoga” inferred group described above that includes users in Abby's, Emma's and Fran's social circles.
- Other inferred groups that can be included in this group of inferred groups can be created from other users not represented by the graph 208 .
- the content sponsor 108 can check the checkbox 232 c to target inferred groups of users that include under-40, female yoga enthusiasts. Having the checkbox 232 c checked, for example, can result in targeting users in the “Yoga” inferred group described above that includes users Abby 204 a , Emma 204 e and Fran 204 f.
- the sponsor campaign interface 222 can allow the content sponsor 108 to provide separate bids for the corresponding inferred groups.
- a bid area 234 can be displayed.
- the content sponsor 108 can enter a bid amount in a bid amount field 236 , e.g., to specify a dollar amount (e.g., $42) for 1000 impressions to users who are in inferred groups of users that include under-40, female yoga enthusiasts.
- bid areas and controls can be presented if the content sponsor 108 checks the checkboxes 232 a and 232 b to target content to users in inferred group of Southeast High School graduates and 18- to 25-year-old male sports fans, respectively.
- Other inferred groups can appear in the options area 230 and can be selected by the content sponsor 108 for targeting.
- the sponsor campaign interface 222 can include a filter control 238 that the content sponsor 108 can use to search for and/or discover inferred groups that can then be targeted.
- the content sponsor 108 by selecting the filter control 238 , can be presented with another interface (now shown in FIG. 2B ).
- the content sponsor 108 can select or enter terms to find inferred groups such as “a clique of users who play the same video game,” “a clique of users who went to the same school,” etc.
- the inferred groups that appear in the options area 230 and for which controls such as checkboxes 232 a - 232 c appear can be determined automatically based on selections made by the content sponsor 108 on other parts of the sponsor campaign interface 222 .
- other ways can be used to specify targeting to inferred groups.
- other checkboxes similar to the checkboxes 232 a - 232 c and other controls can be used for selecting targeting for other types of inferred groups.
- Other targeting parameters not shown in FIG. 2B can be stored with other information for the campaign in the campaigns 126 for later use in delivering content.
- affected content sponsors 108 can be notified automatically. Notification can be made, for example, to content sponsors 108 whose targeting keywords correspond to the subject matter of particular inferred groups. For example, when one or more “Yoga” inferred groups are created, content sponsors 108 associated with campaigns that use “yoga” as a targeting keyword can be notified.
- the content sponsor 108 selects a particular inferred group (e.g., by checking one of the checkboxes 232 a - 232 c )
- additional controls can be presented by which the content sponsor 108 can select a sub-group of the inferred group for targeting. For example, after checking the checkbox 232 a (to target Southeast High graduates), the content sponsor 108 can provide other inputs to specify that the targeting further applies to males who graduated in 1977 (e.g., based on an age demographic).
- the sponsor campaign interface 222 can include additional controls for the content sponsor 108 to define a custom inferred group.
- the content sponsor 108 can request that a new inferred group be determined from users who have discussed the subject matter X, Y and X on the social network 130 . Then, if an indicator indicates that the number of users in the group is sufficient (e.g., greater than 1000 users), then the content sponsor 108 can elect to target the campaign to that custom inferred group. In this way, for example, the content sponsor 108 can reach potential customers with advertising for a new product that the content sponsor 108 believes would be liked by users who have discussed X, Y and Z.
- the user interface 224 can be, for example, a social networking web page or some other interface (e.g., a web browser) that a user 250 is running on the user device 106 .
- the user interface 224 can include one or more content item slots 252 , e.g., for displaying advertisements on the social networking web page.
- the user interface 224 can provide a request for content 254 to the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide content items 256 that are responsive to the request, as described above.
- the content items 256 that are provided can be selected based on any inferred groups (e.g., inferred group 202 ) with which the user 250 is associated.
- the user 250 can belong to one or more inferred groups, e.g., the inferred group 202 .
- the content management system 110 can access information in the campaigns 126 to identify content items that are responsive to the request.
- Some campaigns 126 can be defined to target users in inferred groups. For example, if one or more content sponsors selected the checkbox 232 b to targeted to users in inferred groups that include 18- to 25-year-old male sports fans, then one or more of those content sponsors' content items can become an eligible content item that can be selected by the content management system 110 .
- advertisements 258 a and 258 b can be eligible because the user 250 is a member of an inferred group to which the campaign that includes the advertisements is targeted.
- the one or more eligible content items 256 can be evaluated by conducting an auction.
- the auction can include one or more bids associated with the content sponsors 108 that elected to target users who are associated with inferred groups.
- the content items 256 that are provided can be based at least in part on the auction and the inferred group information, as well as other information that can typically be used for selecting content items, e.g., including the relevance of content items to keywords, or criteria for selecting content to fulfill, to name a few examples.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for targeting content based on inferred groups.
- the process 300 can be performed by the content management system 110 , for example, using the request handler and the inferred group engine 121 .
- FIGS. 2A-2C are used to provide examples for steps of the process 300 .
- Users in a user network are identified ( 302 ).
- the inferred group engine 121 can use information from network communications 122 to identify users (e.g., users Abby 204 a through Izzy 204 i ) in the same social network 130 .
- An inferred group of users in the user network is determined, where the inferred group is not a user-defined circle in the user network ( 304 ).
- the inferred group engine 121 can identify the inferred group 202 based on an intersection of Abby's circle of friends 206 a and Dave's circle of friends 206 b , which can be, for example, social circles in a social network.
- Other inferred groups can be determined, such as under-40 female yoga enthusiasts, 18- to 25-year-old male sports fans, groups of users who play the same video game, and users who went to the same high school.
- the inferred group is used to either target content to users in the inferred group or promote content associated with a campaign targeted at the inferred group ( 306 ).
- the content sponsor 108 can use the sponsor campaign interface 222 or other interfaces to target content to users in inferred groups.
- content that is promoted by a user can be promoted to users in the inferred group.
- targeting can include boosting scores associated with advertisements that are targeted to inferred groups. For example, consider a user (e.g., a sports fan) who is viewing a web page (e.g., in a social networking application) that includes a content item slot for which a request for content occurs to fill the slot. If the user is a member of an inferred group (e.g., related to sports), then the content management system 110 can select an advertisement that is targeted to that inferred group over one or more advertisements that are not targeted to inferred groups. The selection can occur, for example, as a result of boosting a score (e.g., a quality score) of the advertisement that is targeted to sports-related inferred groups.
- a score e.g., a quality score
- the result of boosting scores in this way can be to favor advertisements that are targeted at an inferred group of users (e.g., over advertisements that are not) which can prove to have a multiplier effect because, for example, of potential subsequent interactions among users in the inferred groups.
- Targeting can include enabling content sponsors 108 to bid on impressions of content to users that are in inferred groups.
- the content item 256 targeted to the user 250 can be selected from advertisements 258 a and 258 b that have targeting criteria that require that the user be a member of at least one of the inferred groups to which the campaign (e.g., that includes the advertisement) is targeted.
- the content item 256 that is provided can be based on conducting an auction.
- the auction can use the one or more bids associated with the content sponsors, some of which specified to target content to one or more inferred groups. Some bids can include no preference for targeting content to one or more inferred groups and can be evaluated along with the bids of content sponsors that do target content to one or more inferred groups.

- the selections made by the content sponsor 108 can include checking any of the checkboxes 232 a - 232 c and providing any other targeting information.
- the campaign is stored ( 326 ). For example, based on the selections and inputs provided by the content sponsor 108 on the sponsor campaign interface 222 , the campaign (including targeting information for inferred groups) can be stored in the campaigns 126 .
- the content is delivered to users in the inferred group in accordance with the campaign and responsive to requests for content received from users in the inferred group ( 328 ).
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more content items 256 that are selected based at least in part on inferred groups with which the user 250 is associated. More specifically, the content items 256 provided, for example, can be from campaigns that target one or more inferred groups to which the user 250 belongs.
- FIG. 3C is a flowchart of an example process 340 for a content sponsor to target content to users in cliques.
- the inferred group engine 121 can perform at least some of steps of the process 320 .
- FIGS. 2A and 2B are used to provide examples for steps of the process 340 .
- a user network is identified that includes one or more connected users ( 342 ).
- the inferred group engine 121 can identify the social network 130 that includes connected users Abby 204 a through Izzy 204 i.
- a clique of users in the user network is identified, where the clique of users includes users that are highly-connected yet are not included in a specific group or social circle designated by any users in the user network ( 344 ).
- the inferred group engine 121 can identify the inferred group 202 using information from network communications 122 .
- Content is targeted to users in the clique ( 346 ).
- the content sponsor can use the sponsor campaign interface 222 to target content to users in one or more inferred groups, as described above.

The method comprises determining at least in part based on analysis of user interaction data of a plurality of users in a user network, an inferred group of users that interact together, including two or more users from the users in the user network. The method further comprises receiving a request to present an advertisement to each of two or more users of a group of users that interact together, and based at least in part on the received request, providing for display, to each of two or more of the users in the inferred group of users that interact together, the requested advertisement.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation. More specifically, this specification relates to presenting content to users.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Content item slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing advertisements. The method comprises determining, using one or more computing devices, at least in part based on analysis of user interaction data of a plurality of users in a user network, an inferred group of users that interact together, where the inferred group of users that interact together includes two or more users from the plurality of users in the user network. The method further comprises receiving, using the one or more computing devices, a request to present an advertisement to each of two or more users of a group of users that interact together. The method further comprises, based at least in part on the received request to present an advertisement to each of two or more users of a group of users that interact together and the determined inferred group of users that interact together, providing for display, to each of two or more of the users in the inferred group of users that interact together, the requested advertisement.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The method can further comprise analyzing, using the one or more computing devices, the user interaction data for the plurality users in the user network. The user network can be a social network and the group of users that interact together can be a user-defined social circle. Determining the inferred group of users can comprise determining users that have communicated at least a pre-determined number of times. Determining the inferred group of users can comprise determining users that are members of the same demographic and including the users in the inferred group. Using the inferred group to either target content to users in the inferred group or promote content associated with a campaign targeted at the inferred group can comprise boosting scores associated with advertisements that are targeted to inferred groups. Communications between group members in the inferred group can relate to a single subject matter. Determining an inferred group can further comprise identifying, for each user in a plurality of users, one or more social circles, and determining an intersection of the one or more social circles for each user with all other users in the plurality of users to determine users to be included in the inferred group. Determining an inferred group can further comprise determining a sub-group of a social circle for a user and identifying users of the sub-group as belonging to the inferred group. Determining a sub-group of users can further comprise identifying the users of the sub-group based on a number of communications between the users. Determining a sub-group of users can further comprise identifying the users of the sub-group based on subject matter of communications between the users. Determining an inferred group can further comprise determining a sub-group of users within a social graph, where the social graph contains an edge between two users if the two users have mutually agreed to be connected with each other. Determining a sub-group of users can further comprise identifying the users of the sub-group based on a number of communications between the users. Determining a sub-group of users can further comprise identifying the users of the sub-group based on a subject matter of communications between the users. Targeting can further comprise enabling a content sponsor to target the inferred group. Targeting can comprise enabling one or more content sponsors to discover the inferred group and enabling the one or more content sponsors to target content to the inferred group. Targeting can comprise targeting content to users of the inferred group upon receipt of a request for content from one of the users. Targeting can content further comprise targeting content to one or more types of inferred groups including bidding on one or more inferred groups of a given type. The one or more types of inferred groups can be inferred groups that are specified by a content sponsor for a campaign.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for delivering content to users. The method comprises receiving an indication from a content sponsor to create a campaign for presenting content to one or more users in a user network responsive to received requests to deliver content. The method further comprises receiving targeting criteria for the campaign including receiving an indication to target one or more inferred groups of users where an inferred group of users is a group of users that share a common characteristic, relationship or interest and where the inferred group of users does not represent a user-defined circle in the user network. The method further comprises storing the campaign. The method further comprises delivering the content to users in the inferred group in accordance with the campaign and responsive to requests for content received from users in the inferred group.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The user network can be a social network and where the user-defined circle is a user-defined social circle. Receiving targeting criteria can further comprise receiving separate bids for each of the one or more targeted inferred groups indicated by the content sponsor. The inferred groups can be based on demographic information. Receiving targeting criteria can comprise receiving an indication to target inferred groups, and the method can further comprise identifying, by a processor, one or more appropriate inferred groups to target based on one or more criteria. The targeting criteria can relate to content that is to be displayed along with the content from the content sponsor. The targeting criteria can be specified by the content sponsor. The method can further comprise presenting a control for discovery of one or more inferred groups that can be targeted, and receiving targeting criteria for the campaign can comprise receiving a selection of one or more discovered inferred groups.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for targeting content to users. The method comprises identifying a user network including one or more connected users. The method further comprises identifying a clique of users in the user network, where the clique of users includes users that are highly-connected yet are not included in a specific social circle designated by any users in the user network. The method further comprises targeting content to users in the clique.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The user network can be a social network and the clique is a subset of users in a social circle in the social network. The clique can represent an intersection of social circles associated with a plurality of users in the user network. The clique can be represented by a graph where each node in the graph is connected to all or nearly all other nodes in the graph.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems that include a system for providing content. The system comprises an inferred group engine that determines inferred groups of users in a user network. The system further comprises a sponsor interface that allows a content sponsor to target content in a campaign to one or more users that are members of the inferred groups. The system further comprises a content management system that provides content items responsive to received requests. The content management system comprises a request handler enabled to receive a request for content from a user, identify one or more offers, including offers for a given impression of content items in campaigns targeted to users in inferred groups, and provide a content item responsive to the request and the at least one or more offers.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to identify users in a user network, determine an inferred group of users in the user network where the inferred group is not a user-defined circle in the user network, and use the inferred group to either target content to users in the inferred group or promote content associated with a campaign targeted at the inferred group.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to receive an indication from a content sponsor to create a campaign for presenting content to one or more users in a user network responsive to received requests to deliver content, receive targeting criteria for the campaign including receiving an indication to target one or more inferred groups of users where an inferred group of users is a group of users that share a common characteristic, relationship or interest and where the inferred group of users does not represent a user-defined circle in the user network, store the campaign, and deliver the content to users in the inferred group in accordance with the campaign and responsive to requests for content received from users in the inferred group.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to identify a user network including one or more connected users, identify a clique of users in the user network, where the clique of users includes users that are highly-connected yet are not included in a specific social circle designated by any users in the user network, target content to users in the clique.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method, executing on one or more computing devices, for targeting or promoting content. The method comprises identifying users in a user network. The method further comprises determining, using the one or more computing devices, an inferred group of users in the user network where the inferred group is not a user-defined circle in the user network. The method further comprises using the inferred group to either target content to users in the inferred group or promote content associated with a campaign targeted at the inferred group.

- This document describes methods, processes and systems for targeting and delivering content to users in a user network (e.g., a social network) who are members of a group. For example, an inferred group can be determined for users who are well-connected to each other and/or who share common interests. In some implementations, the inferred group is not one of a user's user-defined groups or circles (e.g., friends, family, etc.). When creating a campaign, a content sponsor can specify (e.g., using targeting criteria) to target content (e.g., advertisements) to one or more inferred groups, and thus to the users in those groups. In some implementations, the inferred groups can be of the form of a clique. In some implementations, a clique is a subset of individuals in which every person is connected to every other person. In some implementations, the connections can be through a network, such as a connection in a social network, or by way of sharing a common interest or trait. Example cliques include cliques of 18- to 24-year-olds, cliques of middle-aged men, cliques of working young women, etc., each of which may be of interest to content sponsors for targeting purposes. As a result, when one of the users receives targeted content, it can include content that is served because the user is a member of a particular inferred group or clique. While cliques are used as an example of inferred groups, the methods, processes and systems described in this document can apply to any other groups of users, inferred or otherwise.
- Inferred groups can be determined in various ways. For example, intersections of two or more users' groups or circles (e.g., social groups or social circles) can be formed where all the users (or virtually all of the users) communicate with each other. The determination of inferred groups can further be based on the subject matter of communications among the users. For example, a “yoga” inferred group can be formed among users in a user network (e.g., a social network) who have communicated extensively about yoga such as through postings, email or other communications in the user network. Demographic information (e.g., age, gender, etc.) can also be used in determining inferred groups. For example, another “yoga” inferred group can be an “under-40, female yoga” inferred group that is formed because several women under 40 who are connected in a network have discussed yoga with each other on a networking site.
- In some implementations, inferred groups can be determined from a social graph, which is composed of one or more edges connecting the users (e.g., users are represented as nodes in the graph). In such a social graph, a clique can be a subset or a sub-group of users who have edges connecting each other. In some implementations, two users can be connected to each other if they are part of each other's circles or if they have mutually agreed to form a social network connection. Users can be connected in other ways. In some implementations, determining a sub-group of users in the social graph can depend on the number of communications between the users and/or the subject matter of the communications.
- In some implementations, inferred groups can be determined independently of a user's circles. For example, an inferred group can be formed for a set of users who actively engage in conversation around a particular topic on a social networking site, even if the users are not friends or followers of each other. An example is an inferred group that includes users from the entire United States who have discussed a new video game that is about to be released to the public. Other inferred groups can rely greatly on a user's circles, such as if a user repeatedly shares many technical articles with users in a particular circle.
- Inferred groups can be characterized in different ways. For example, the characteristics of an inferred group can be based on explicit information that can include information specified by users on their social network profile (e.g., age, gender, etc.). In another example, the characteristics of an inferred group can be based on implicit information, including information about an inferred group of users that is learned or inferred based on user behavior (e.g., posts or other communications by fans of action movies).
- Content sponsors, for example, can target content to users based on inferred groups. For example, a content sponsor C can submit offers (e.g., bids for use in an auction or an offer that is part of a reservation, hereinafter collectively referred to as an “offer”) for subsequent impressions of content items (e.g., advertisements) in a campaign to users in selected inferred groups G. The offers can depend, for example, on whether users to whom the content is to be presented are members of the selected inferred groups G. Consequently, when content is requested for a particular user (e.g., to fill an advertisement slot on a web page), the user's inferred groups can be looked up or determined, and corresponding offers for content can be identified (e.g., from offers made by the content sponsor C and other content sponsors). For example, if the user is a member of selected inferred groups G associated with the offer, then the bid for the content item can be identified. Depending on the terms of the offer, the content item associated with the content sponsor C can be provided in response to the request for content.
- In one example scenario in which targeting to inferred groups can be used, consider an advertiser who has a social product such as a social game, a social app, or some other product that users in a user network (e.g., a social network) may use and/or discuss (e.g., in posts, email or other communications). Because of the social nature of the product, the advertiser would like the product to be adopted by a set of users who may be more likely to engage with each other, i.e., users who are connected to each other or otherwise related in a social sense. The advertiser can want this because a social product can be more successful if it is used by N friends rather than by N strangers. By targeting content to users in cliques or inferred groups who, for example, have discussed the subject matter of the product, advertisers (e.g., content sponsors) may be able to achieve better results (e.g., a higher conversion rate).
- In some implementations, users may not be grouped together unless they opt in to policies that group users based, for example, on inferred groups. In some implementations, users can opt out of being targeted for content, including advertisements, based on any inferred groups to which they belong.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),content publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andcontent publishers 109. - The
example environment 100 further includes at least one user network, e.g.social network 130, aninferred group engine 121 for associating groups of users in thesocial network 130 with one or more inferred groups, and asponsor interface 120 that thecontent sponsor 108 can use to create campaigns for content items, including to target content items to users who are associated with inferred groups selected for targeting by thecontent sponsor 108. - In some implementations, the
environment 100 can include plural data stores that are used in various stages to create the inferred groups. For example,network communications 122 can store information (e.g., in an anonymized way) about each user's interactions and communications within thesocial network 130. The information can include, for example, information regarding the times and frequencies that users have communicated with other users and the subject matter of those communications. - A data store of
inferred groups 124, for example, can include information about each inferred group. The information can include, for example, lists of users who are in the inferred group. Other information stored for each inferred group can include the number of members in the inferred group, the criteria used to determine the inferred group, demographic information associated with users in the inferred group, and the type of inferred group (e.g., whether the inferred group is based on subject matter, intersections of users' circles, a frequency of communications, or some combination). - A data store of
campaigns 126 can store campaigns that are created bycontent sponsors 108, e.g., using thesponsor interface 120. For example, thecampaigns 126 can include targeting criteria specified bycontent sponsors 108 to target content to users in inferred groups. - In some implementations, the
inferred group engine 121 can update theinferred groups 124 over time, for example, as changes occur in thenetwork communications 122 or for other reasons. For example, theinferred group engine 121 can be invoked on a scheduled basis or as needed to keep the information for theinferred groups 124 up-to-date. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 includes a request handler that can receive a request for content from a user, identify one or more eligible content items, and provide a content item responsive to the request. More specifically, the request handler can determine, forcampaigns 126 that include targeting criteria defined to target to users in inferred groups, if the user who provided the request for content is a member of one of the inferred groups selected by thecontent sponsor 108. In some implementations, the request handler can access theinferred groups 124 to determine the inferred groups to which a user belongs. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. In some implementations, content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation) and information related to inferred groups. Information related to inferred groups can include, but is not limited to, whether a content item has been displayed to other members of the inferred group, a response of other members of the inferred group to the content item, and the history of responses of members of the inferred group to content items similar to, for example, one that is being considered for selection. For example, the content item can be an advertisement that appears while the users are visiting or otherwise interacting with a social network site. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, performance with respect to the inferred group, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In some implementations, the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by serving content that is more likely to be of interest to the user. For example, content items (e.g., ads) that are served can be selected in part based on inferred groups to which the user belongs, which can also be an indication of how likely the user is to react positively to a content item, e.g., leading to a conversion. The inferred groups to which a user belongs can also be an indication of a likelihood that the user will discuss or share the content with other users within the inferred groups.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. In some implementations, opt out features related to social networking systems, for example, can allow the user to specify that the user's activity stream content is not to be used in ads, or to anonymize the information in some way. Further, in situations in which information is gathered and stored related to the subject matter of communications among users, the information can be aggregated (e.g., to a keyword level), personal information can be omitted (e.g., not stored), and the information can be associated with users using anonymized user identifiers.

FIG. 2A shows anexample system 200 for creating groups. For example, an exampleinferred group 202 is shown inFIG. 2A that includesusers Abby 204 a,Bart 204 b,Carl 204 c andDave 204 d.Users 204 a -204 i are represented inFIG. 2A as nodes in agraph 208, and relationships (e.g., friendships, communications, etc.) among the users are represented byedges 210 in thegraph 208. The set ofedges 210 that connect to any one of theusers 204 a -204 i can represent that user's relationships (e.g., friendships, communications, etc.) with other users in asocial network 130. While some of the examples that follow are based on intersections of circles of friends, inferred groups can be created that are based on other information, such as frequency of communication among users, the subject matter of each communication, user demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.), and/or other factors. In the example shown inFIG. 2A , theusers Abby 204 a throughDave 204 d are users in both of Abby's circle offriends 206 a and Dave's circle offriend 206 b. As a result, theinferred group 202 is an intersection of Abby's circle offriends 206 a and Dave's circle offriends 206 b. Not included in theinferred group 202 are user Gary 204 g (e.g., who is in Abby's circle offriends 206 a but not in Dave's circle offriends 206 b) andusers Emma 204 e,Fran 204 f andHank 204 h (e.g., who are in Dave's circle offriends 206 b but not in Abby's circle offriends 206 a). - Dave's circle of
friends 206 b can be, for example, one of several social circles thatuser Dave 204 d has within thesocial network 130. For example,user Dave 204 d can have separate circles of coworkers and family members in thesocial network 130 that are not depicted in thegraph 208. In some implementations, inferred groups that are created by theinferred group engine 121 can be created based, at least in part, on determining the intersections of one or more circles for each user with all other users in the plurality of users within thesocial network 130. - In some implementations, the
inferred group engine 121 can createinferred groups 124 using information fromnetwork communications 122. For example, theinferred group engine 121 can identify theusers 204 a -204 i as users in the same user network. Theinferred group engine 121 can determine theinferred group 202, which can include, for example, a group of users in thesocial network 130 that is not, by itself, a user-defined circle in the user network.Lines 214 a indicate an example association betweennetwork communications 122 and theedges 210 in thegraph 208.Lines 214 b indicate an example association betweennetwork communications 122 and Abby's circle offriends 206 a and Dave's circle offriends 206 b. - In some implementations, an inferred group can be a group of users that, among other criteria, are determined to have communicated at least a pre-determined number of times. For example, the
inferred group 202 can be the users that are in both of Abby's circle offriends 206 a and Dave's circle offriends 206 b and who have communicated at least twice, five times or more, or some other pre-determined number of times that can be used by theinferred group engine 121 to determine inferred groups. In some implementations, determining that users are in an inferred group can require, in addition to communication amount, that the user communications have occurred significantly recently (e.g., in the last year, month, etc.) or with sufficient frequency. For example, theusers Abby 204 a throughDave 204 d can be users who have communicated frequently within the last few months. - Demographics can be used to determine inferred groups in some implementations. For example, the creation of inferred groups of users (e.g., by the inferred group engine 121) can include determining users that are members of a same demographic (e.g., age, gender, etc.) who are also in cliques or connected socially in some way. As a result, one example inferred group that can be created is an inferred group that includes
users Bart 204 b,Carl 204 c andDave 204 d, all of whom can be male between the ages of 18 and 24. The inferred group can also include other users not depicted in thegraph 208. - In some implementations, inferred groups can be limited to users whose communications with other users are related to a single subject matter. For example, an “environmentalist” inferred group can include members in Dave's circle of
friends 206 b who are also members of the social circles of theusers Hank 204 h andIzzy 204 i who have discussed global warming. Content sponsors, for example, can use the resulting “environmentalist” inferred group to target content related to environmental concerns (e.g., advertisements for electric cars) to users in the inferred group who may also share the content with other users within their circles (e.g., social circles) of thesocial network 130. - In some implementations, determining an inferred group can result from determining a sub-group of a social circle for a user and identifying users of the sub-group as belonging to the inferred group. For example, assume that
user Abby 204 a has more than 1000 friends. Theinferred group engine 121 can create an inferred group that can include a sub-group of Abby's friends who are under the age of 40, where the inferred group does not depend on the intersection of Abby's social circles with the social circles of other users. In some implementations, determining a sub-group of users can further comprise identifying the users of the sub-group based on a number of communications between the users. For example, the inferred group of Abby's friends under 40 can be limited to users who have communicated with other users in the group at least a predetermined number of times (e.g., ten times or more). In some implementations, inferred groups based on sub-groups can be further limited based on subject matter of communications between the users. For example, the inferred group of Abby's friends under 40 who have communicated at least a predetermined number of times can be limited to users who have discussed yoga. In another example, an inferred group (e.g., a “tech” group) can be formed if Abby, for example, repeatedly shares many technical articles with the same set of users in one of her particular circles. Any of these example inferred groups can be chosen bycontent sponsors 108 to target content because members of the inferred groups may be more likely to share or discuss the content with others, including other members in the group. - Combinations of relationships can be used to create inferred groups, e.g., based on relationships described in the previous examples. One example inferred group can be a “yoga” inferred group that includes female members, under age 40, who are members of Abby's, Emma's and Fran's social circles, and who have discussed the subject of yoga in the last three months. Another example includes an inferred group of users who have frequently discussed two subject matters: global warming and coffee. In this example, content sponsors can target content (e.g., packages of organic, rainforest-grown, Fair Trade coffee) to users in an inferred group whose membership in the inferred group is based on frequent discussions of subject matter related to the coffee.
- Other relationships among users can also exist that are not shown in the
graph 208. For example, thegraph 208 is just one of many graphs that can represent relationships among users in thesocial network 130. As a result, any number of inferred groups, such as theinferred group 202, can be created. -
FIGS. 2B and 2C collectively show anexample system 220 for targeting content to groups of users in a user network.FIG. 2B , for instance, shows an examplesponsor campaign interface 222 for specifying targeting criteria in a campaign that is used to target users ininferred groups 124. For example, thecontent sponsor 108 can use thesponsor campaign interface 222 to create one or more campaigns 126 (e.g., advertising campaigns) for presenting content (e.g., advertisements), including campaigns that are targeted to users in thesocial network 130 who are also members ofinferred groups 124. In some implementations, thesponsor interface 120 can provide thesponsor campaign interface 222 and/or other interfaces and screens for targeting content to users in inferred groups. -
FIG. 2C shows anexample user interface 224 in which targeted content is provided based on the user's association withinferred groups 124. As will be described in more detail later, theuser interface 224 is one example of how thesystem 220 can provide targeted content to inferred groups of users in a user network (e.g., a social network). For example, advertisements from the content sponsor's advertising campaign (e.g., campaigns 126) can be provided in response to received requests to deliver content to theuser interface 224. In some implementations, theinferred groups 124 used by thesystem 220 can be created by thesystem 200 described with reference toFIG. 2A . - Referring again to
FIG. 2B , in some implementations, thesponsor campaign interface 222 can include a targetingcriteria area 226 from which thecontent sponsor 108 can select targeting parameters for a campaign. The targetingcriteria area 226 can be one of multiple targeting areas within thesponsor campaign interface 222. In some implementations, the targetingcriteria area 226 can include one or more controls for receiving an indication from thecontent sponsor 108 to target one or more inferred groups of users. For example, thecontent sponsor 108 can select a clique-targetingoption 228, e.g., by checking a “Target to users in Cliques” checkbox, as an indication to target content to inferred groups. The term “cliques,” for example, can be the term associated with inferred groups and displayed in various sponsor campaign interfaces. In some implementations, selection of the clique-targetingoption 228 can result in the presentation of anoptions area 230. In some implementations, theoptions area 230 can include individual controls, e.g., checkboxes 232 a-232 c, for targeting different types of inferred groups. Example types of inferred groups can include female yoga enthusiasts under forty years old, male environmentalists, and sports enthusiasts with ages 18-25. In some implementations, there can exist multiple inferred groups of female yoga enthusiasts under forty years old, including, for example, the “Yoga” inferred group described above that includes users in Abby's, Emma's and Fran's social circles. Other inferred groups that can be included in this group of inferred groups can be created from other users not represented by thegraph 208. - The
content sponsor 108, for example, can check thecheckbox 232 c to target inferred groups of users that include under-40, female yoga enthusiasts. Having thecheckbox 232 c checked, for example, can result in targeting users in the “Yoga” inferred group described above that includesusers Abby 204 a,Emma 204 e andFran 204 f. - In some implementations, when any of the
checkboxes 232 a -232 c are checked, thesponsor campaign interface 222 can allow thecontent sponsor 108 to provide separate bids for the corresponding inferred groups. For example, when thecheckbox 232 c is checked, abid area 234 can be displayed. Thecontent sponsor 108, for example, can enter a bid amount in abid amount field 236, e.g., to specify a dollar amount (e.g., $42) for 1000 impressions to users who are in inferred groups of users that include under-40, female yoga enthusiasts. Other bid areas and controls can be presented if thecontent sponsor 108 checks thecheckboxes options area 230 and can be selected by thecontent sponsor 108 for targeting. - In some implementations, the
sponsor campaign interface 222 can include afilter control 238 that thecontent sponsor 108 can use to search for and/or discover inferred groups that can then be targeted. For example, thecontent sponsor 108, by selecting thefilter control 238, can be presented with another interface (now shown inFIG. 2B ). Using the interface, for example, thecontent sponsor 108 can select or enter terms to find inferred groups such as “a clique of users who play the same video game,” “a clique of users who went to the same school,” etc. In some implementations, the inferred groups that appear in theoptions area 230 and for which controls such ascheckboxes 232 a -232 c appear can be determined automatically based on selections made by thecontent sponsor 108 on other parts of thesponsor campaign interface 222. - In some implementations, other ways can be used to specify targeting to inferred groups. For example, other checkboxes similar to the
checkboxes 232 a -232 c and other controls can be used for selecting targeting for other types of inferred groups. Other targeting parameters not shown inFIG. 2B can be stored with other information for the campaign in thecampaigns 126 for later use in delivering content. - In some implementations, whenever a new inferred group (e.g., the inferred group 202) is created, affected content sponsors 108 can be notified automatically. Notification can be made, for example, to
content sponsors 108 whose targeting keywords correspond to the subject matter of particular inferred groups. For example, when one or more “Yoga” inferred groups are created, content sponsors 108 associated with campaigns that use “yoga” as a targeting keyword can be notified. - In some implementations, if the
content sponsor 108 selects a particular inferred group (e.g., by checking one of thecheckboxes 232 a -232 c), additional controls can be presented by which thecontent sponsor 108 can select a sub-group of the inferred group for targeting. For example, after checking thecheckbox 232 a (to target Southeast High graduates), thecontent sponsor 108 can provide other inputs to specify that the targeting further applies to males who graduated in 1977 (e.g., based on an age demographic). - In some implementations, the
sponsor campaign interface 222 can include additional controls for thecontent sponsor 108 to define a custom inferred group. For example, thecontent sponsor 108 can request that a new inferred group be determined from users who have discussed the subject matter X, Y and X on thesocial network 130. Then, if an indicator indicates that the number of users in the group is sufficient (e.g., greater than 1000 users), then thecontent sponsor 108 can elect to target the campaign to that custom inferred group. In this way, for example, thecontent sponsor 108 can reach potential customers with advertising for a new product that thecontent sponsor 108 believes would be liked by users who have discussed X, Y and Z. - Referring to
FIG. 2C , theuser interface 224 can be, for example, a social networking web page or some other interface (e.g., a web browser) that auser 250 is running on theuser device 106. Theuser interface 224 can include one or morecontent item slots 252, e.g., for displaying advertisements on the social networking web page. To fill thecontent item slots 252, for example, theuser interface 224 can provide a request forcontent 254 to thecontent management system 110. Upon receipt of the request forcontent 254, thecontent management system 110 can providecontent items 256 that are responsive to the request, as described above. As an example, thecontent items 256 that are provided can be selected based on any inferred groups (e.g., inferred group 202) with which theuser 250 is associated. - For example, the
user 250 can belong to one or more inferred groups, e.g., theinferred group 202. For each request forcontent 254 that is received, thecontent management system 110 can access information in thecampaigns 126 to identify content items that are responsive to the request. Somecampaigns 126, for example, can be defined to target users in inferred groups. For example, if one or more content sponsors selected thecheckbox 232 b to targeted to users in inferred groups that include 18- to 25-year-old male sports fans, then one or more of those content sponsors' content items can become an eligible content item that can be selected by thecontent management system 110. For example,advertisements user 250 is a member of an inferred group to which the campaign that includes the advertisements is targeted. - In some implementations, the one or more
eligible content items 256 can be evaluated by conducting an auction. For example, the auction can include one or more bids associated with the content sponsors 108 that elected to target users who are associated with inferred groups. As a result, thecontent items 256 that are provided can be based at least in part on the auction and the inferred group information, as well as other information that can typically be used for selecting content items, e.g., including the relevance of content items to keywords, or criteria for selecting content to fulfill, to name a few examples. -
FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for targeting content based on inferred groups. The process 300 can be performed by thecontent management system 110, for example, using the request handler and theinferred group engine 121.FIGS. 2A-2C are used to provide examples for steps of the process 300. - Users in a user network are identified (302). For example, the
inferred group engine 121 can use information fromnetwork communications 122 to identify users (e.g.,users Abby 204 a throughIzzy 204 i) in the samesocial network 130. - An inferred group of users in the user network is determined, where the inferred group is not a user-defined circle in the user network (304). For example, the
inferred group engine 121 can identify theinferred group 202 based on an intersection of Abby's circle offriends 206 a and Dave's circle offriends 206 b, which can be, for example, social circles in a social network. Other inferred groups can be determined, such as under-40 female yoga enthusiasts, 18- to 25-year-old male sports fans, groups of users who play the same video game, and users who went to the same high school. - The inferred group is used to either target content to users in the inferred group or promote content associated with a campaign targeted at the inferred group (306). For example, as described above, the
content sponsor 108 can use thesponsor campaign interface 222 or other interfaces to target content to users in inferred groups. In another example, content that is promoted by a user can be promoted to users in the inferred group. - In some implementations, targeting can include boosting scores associated with advertisements that are targeted to inferred groups. For example, consider a user (e.g., a sports fan) who is viewing a web page (e.g., in a social networking application) that includes a content item slot for which a request for content occurs to fill the slot. If the user is a member of an inferred group (e.g., related to sports), then the
content management system 110 can select an advertisement that is targeted to that inferred group over one or more advertisements that are not targeted to inferred groups. The selection can occur, for example, as a result of boosting a score (e.g., a quality score) of the advertisement that is targeted to sports-related inferred groups. The result of boosting scores in this way can be to favor advertisements that are targeted at an inferred group of users (e.g., over advertisements that are not) which can prove to have a multiplier effect because, for example, of potential subsequent interactions among users in the inferred groups. - Targeting can include enabling content sponsors 108 to bid on impressions of content to users that are in inferred groups. For example, the
content item 256 targeted to theuser 250 can be selected fromadvertisements - In some implementations, the
content item 256 that is provided can be based on conducting an auction. The auction can use the one or more bids associated with the content sponsors, some of which specified to target content to one or more inferred groups. Some bids can include no preference for targeting content to one or more inferred groups and can be evaluated along with the bids of content sponsors that do target content to one or more inferred groups. -
FIG. 3B is a flowchart of anexample process 320 for serving content to users in inferred groups. Theinferred group engine 121, for example, can perform at least some of steps of theprocess 320.FIG. 2B is used to provide examples for steps of theprocess 320. - An indication is received from a content sponsor to create a campaign for presenting content to one or more users in a network (322). For example, the
content sponsor 108 can select a particular campaign using controls in thesponsor campaign interface 222. - Targeting criteria is received for the campaign including an indication to target one or more inferred groups of users (324). For example, as described above, the
content sponsor 108 can make selections in theoptions area 230 to target the campaign to users in one or more inferred groups. The selections made by thecontent sponsor 108 can include checking any of thecheckboxes 232 a -232 c and providing any other targeting information. - The campaign is stored (326). For example, based on the selections and inputs provided by the
content sponsor 108 on thesponsor campaign interface 222, the campaign (including targeting information for inferred groups) can be stored in thecampaigns 126. - The content is delivered to users in the inferred group in accordance with the campaign and responsive to requests for content received from users in the inferred group (328). For example, in response to a request for
content 254 that is received to fill one or morecontent item slots 252 on theuser interface 224, thecontent management system 110 can provide one ormore content items 256 that are selected based at least in part on inferred groups with which theuser 250 is associated. More specifically, thecontent items 256 provided, for example, can be from campaigns that target one or more inferred groups to which theuser 250 belongs. -
FIG. 3C is a flowchart of anexample process 340 for a content sponsor to target content to users in cliques. Theinferred group engine 121, for example, can perform at least some of steps of theprocess 320.FIGS. 2A and 2B are used to provide examples for steps of theprocess 340. - A user network is identified that includes one or more connected users (342). For example, the
inferred group engine 121 can identify thesocial network 130 that includesconnected users Abby 204 a throughIzzy 204 i. - A clique of users in the user network is identified, where the clique of users includes users that are highly-connected yet are not included in a specific group or social circle designated by any users in the user network (344). For example, as described above, the
inferred group engine 121 can identify theinferred group 202 using information fromnetwork communications 122. - Content is targeted to users in the clique (346). For example, the content sponsor can use the
sponsor campaign interface 222 to target content to users in one or more inferred groups, as described above. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices 400, 450 that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.

Each of thecomponents processor 402 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 400, including instructions stored in the memory 404 or on thestorage device 406 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 416 coupled tohigh speed interface 408. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The memory 404 stores information within the computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units.
- The
storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 400. In one implementation, thestorage device 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 406 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 404, thestorage device 406, or memory onprocessor 402. - The
high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while thelow speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled to memory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled tostorage device 406 and low-speed expansion port 414. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth™, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a
standard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 424. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device 400, 450, and an entire system may be made up ofmultiple computing devices 400, 450 communicating with each other. -
Computing device 450 includes aprocessor 452,memory 464, an input/output device such as adisplay 454, acommunication interface 466, and atransceiver 468, among other components. Thedevice 450 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 452 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 450, including instructions stored in thememory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 450, and wireless communication bydevice 450. -
Processor 452 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 458 anddisplay interface 456 coupled to adisplay 454. Thedisplay 454 may be, for example, a TFT LCD display or an OLED display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 456 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 452. In addition, anexternal interface 462 may be provided in communication withprocessor 452, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 450 with other devices.External interface 462 may provide, for example, for wired communication (e.g., via a docking procedure) or for wireless communication (e.g., via Bluetooth™ or other such technologies). - The
memory 464 stores information within thecomputing device 450. In one implementation, thememory 464 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 464 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 464 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 474 may also be provided and connected todevice 450 throughexpansion interface 472, which may include, for example, a subscriber identification module (SIM) card interface. Such expansion memory 474 may provide extra storage space fordevice 450, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 450. Specifically, expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module fordevice 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include for example, flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 464, expansion memory 474, or memory onprocessor 452. -
Device 450 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 466, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 466 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 468. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth™, Wi-Fi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition,GPS receiver module 470 may provide additional wireless data todevice 450, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 450. -
Device 450 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 460, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 460 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 450. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating ondevice 450. - The
computing device 450 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 482, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions.
