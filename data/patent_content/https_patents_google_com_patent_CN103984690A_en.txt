Similarity engine 206 can comprise suitable circuit, logic and/or code, and can be used for generating playlist based on seed-song or from the metadata of this seed-song.More specifically, receiving the seed-song metadata of this seed-song (or from) afterwards, similarity engine 206 can as recommended engine with recommend (or generation) for example have from the DMI120 in digital media library 104 ..., the playlist of the song of selected quantification in 122.Can be based on selecting the song of these quantifications with the similarity of received seed-song.In the time selecting the song similar to seed-song, can use the various technology such as acoustics similarity, school (or theme) similarity, artist's similarity and other technology etc.
In addition, this similarity engine can be used for calculating the similarity score of given song.For example, after media library receives song, this similarity engine can generate the interim playlist of the song with the quantification similar to received song.Then, between each song that this similarity engine can be based in interim playlist and received song, have seemingly heterogeneously, calculate the similarity score of this received song.Determined similarity score for example can be used with the song in playlist and be carried out rank by rank device 205.
Although select filtrator 202, selector module 204, rank device 205 and similarity engine 206 to be illustrated as in the interior realization in media rear end 106, the disclosure is not limited to this.More specifically, can will select filtrator 202, selector module 204 and similarity engine 206 be embodied as independent functional module or be embodied as the part of other network equipment in framework 100.
At work, can present to user the user interface (for example, as shown in Figure 3A) that comprises " immediately mixing " function 302.After user activates instant mixed function 302, select filtrator 202 can to the DMI120 in user's media library ..., 122 application one or more selection parameters or standards (for example, playing maximum songs or up-to-date song).Result, PGM112 can generate exceed the specific threshold for example, being associated with this choice criteria (, at least play the song of 10 times within last week, be no more than before month the song buying/download etc.) song 210 ..., the first playlist of 212.
Selector module 204 can select each song 210 ..., 212, wherein similarity engine 206 can check each song 210 ..., 212 to check which song in playlist 208a generates the instant mixing of high-quality.For example, for example, for the given song in the first playlist 208a (, 210), similarity engine 206 can locate Y similar track (DMI216 ..., 218), thereby create interim playlist 224.Then, can based on these similar songs 216 ..., 218 have heterogeneously seemingly to come these similar songs to give a mark to seed (210).Can to DMI216 ..., 218 similarity score is added, thereby generate total similarity score of song 210.All the other songs in the first playlist 208a are repeated to identical processing, thereby produce interim playlist 224 ..., 226, wherein use these interim playlists 224 ..., 226 calculate each song 210 in the first playlist 208a ..., total similarity score of 212.Then, rank device 205 can the similarity score based on each song come to the song 210 in the first playlist 208a ..., 212 carry out rank, thereby generate have song 230 ..., the first playlist of 232 rank after version 2 08b (for example, except based on similarity score to song 230 ..., 232 carried out beyond rank, song 230 ..., 232 and song 210 ..., 212 identical; For example, song 230 can have high or minimum similarity score).
In the situation that user selects instant mixed function 302, selector switch 204 can select wherein one (for example, the song 230) of popular song as seed from playlist 208b.Then, similarity engine 206 can generate second playlist 236 with Z song, this second playlist comprise seed 230 and the song 232 similar to seed 230 ..., 234.Then, as shown in Figure 3 B, can make user enter instant playlist picture 310.
With reference to figure 3B, playlist picture 310 can comprise the demonstration 314 of next song in demonstration 312 and second playlist 236 of the current played songs in the second playlist 236.Keep listening to the song in playlist 236 in the case of user, the song of listening to along with user approaches the Z song (for example, last song 234) in this playlist, can add an additional Z track to playlist 236.In order to add more songs, media rear end 106 can check the similarity score of an ensuing Z track (for example, ensuing Z the track similar to song 230 that return of the similarity engine 206 in playlist 236).Then, similarity engine 206 can calculate additional Z track similarity score separately.If these similarity scores are more than specific threshold, an additional Z track can be added into playlist 236, and can after track 234, utilize additional Z track to continue to play.But if similarity score is below threshold value, similarity engine 206 returns to Z the track similar to last song (234) in the second playlist 236.In this respect, playlist 236 may depart from its primordial seed, but because user does not select seed (that is, generating automatically without planting playlist) at first, therefore this departing from playlist 236 may seem small and may keep can not noticed by user.
According to exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, selecting initial seed (for example, song 230) situation under (but user may not know), PGM112 also may search with selected seed (230) dissimilar (for example, the similarity score of dissimilar song and selected seed-song may wide apart in the vector space based on acoustic model) more than two user's hot topic songs (for example, more than two song in playlist 208b).In the path of automatically selecting (, song in playlist 236) not that user wants in the situation in the path of listening to, the seed of these two (dissmilarities) can be offered to user's (for example, options 316,318 in Fig. 3 B).For example, if user (at any time, by selecting song 316 or 318) select alternative route, can create the first instant mix songs of Z based on this seed, then, in the situation that again wanting to change path, can provide more than two dissimilar seed to user.
In some instances, can be based on selecting this two (dissmilarity) seeds 316 and 318 with the distinctiveness ratio of current played songs (instead of based on the distinctiveness ratio of main seed 230).In this respect, play the situation of new song from playlist 236, dissimilar song path (for example, song 316,318) will change according to current played songs at every turn.
For example, user can select instant mixed function 302 to listen to automatic playlist, and popular song one can be wherein Metallica-Ride the Lightning.Can generate the playlist (for example, 236) of the THRASH METAL song of the eighties similar to Metallica.In playlist picture 310, can show the song 316,318 of other two most popular (but dissimilar), wherein a head can be Kanye West-Monster, another head can be Bon Iver-Holocene.All these three tracks are all the songs that user likes, if but user does not want to listen to the THRASH METAL of the eighties, and these users can click the song of Kanye West and listen to the instant mixing based on Kanye West.
Select the potential seed list that will use in the situation of instant mixed function 302 (for example about user, playlist 208a and 208b) generation, once PGM112 created there is potential seed playlist (for example, playlist 208a or 208b), if specific seed song is similar to the song that user plays recently, PGM112 can consider these songs more.For example, if user likes rock music and plays and breathe out music but only listened in upper one week and play the in the situation that of breathing out music, PGM112 can automatically select to play and as seed (for example breathe out music song, song 230), the automatic playlist (for example, 208b) being created to guarantee is more relevant to user.
About playlist picture 310 (Fig. 3 B), different routing items 316,318 not only can illustrate single selection but also some follow-up selections can be shown, if therefore user switch to different paths one of them (for example, 316), it can be seen and will play subsequently which artist/song.In addition, can by from the additional information of these " different " path-dependents (for example, this path be the artist that average BPM is how many, occurrence number is maximum that is about to the song of playing in which kind of school, this path have which etc.) be set to options 316,318.
For example select user, under the certain situation of different paths (, 316 or 318), new (different) path can be selected to guide to gradually by playing in media rear end 106.For example, for example, if song and the user of the current A of the listening to school of user (select different playlist path, the options 316 of B school), this media rear end can start the song of broadcasting and A school and the two all similar of B school most, then switches to only similar to the song of B school song.
Fig. 4 illustrates according to process flow diagram exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, use the illustrative steps of the method for song for automatic selection consumption in music libraries.With reference to figure 4, illustrative methods 400 can be since 402, wherein, can divide and from music libraries (for example be used in 402 at this, DMI120 ..., 122) in carry out song selection (for example, select filtrator 202 use) one or more choice criteria.In 404, select filtrator 202 can based on this choice criteria come to each song (120 ..., 122) distribute select score.In 406, can the selection score based on each song generate first list (playlist 208a) of song.In 408, similarity engine 206 can generate the similarity score of the each song in the first list (208a).In 410, can carry out rank to the song in playlist 208a by the similarity score based on each song.In 412, PGM112 can generate the second playlist (236) according to one or more popular song and the corresponding song similar to each popular selection song selected in the first playlist (208a).In 414, can in the time that selecting instant mixed function 302, user start the broadcasting of the second playlist (236).
