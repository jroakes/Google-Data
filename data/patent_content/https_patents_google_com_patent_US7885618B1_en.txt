- a value of a maintained command parameter may be maintained at a nominal value, while the values of a scanned command parameter are varied, and the value of the scanned command parameter that yields a minimum signal feature value may be designated as the null value of the scanned command parameter. Then, a value of a next maintained command parameter may be maintained at a nominal value, while the values of a next scanned command parameter are varied.
- the set ⁇ I, Q>: I I nom , Q min ⁇ Q ⁇ Q max ⁇ , where I nom represents a nominal I-value, may be scanned to establish the null Q-value.

- the values of a scanned command parameter may be varied in any suitable manner.
- the values of a scanned command parameter may be varied starting from the maximum candidate value of the scanned command parameter and varying the values in the direction of the minimum candidate value. For example, the I-value is held at I nom , while the Q-value is varied starting from Q max . Then, the Q-value is held at Q nom , while the I-value is varied starting from I max . Starting at the maximum candidate value and varying the values in the direction of the minimum candidate value generally yields signal feature values that decrease until a null point is reached. Accordingly, the null point may be identified as the point at which the signal feature values cease to decrease.

If the current test value yields a desired measurement, then a next test value is selected by moving in the same direction. If the current test value does not yield a desired measurement, then the next test value is selected by moving in the another direction, for example, the opposite direction.
- Steps 172 and 176 describe scanning through command parameter values and measuring the signal features resulting from the command parameter values.

Abstract
Description
R 12 [db]=10*log 10(|P 1 /P 2|)
where R12 represents the power ratio, P1 represents the power of the first signal, and P2 represents the power of the second signal.
ΔΦ=Φ1−Φ2
where ΔΦ represents the phase difference, Φ1 represents the phase of the first signal, and Φ1 represents the phase of the second signal.
Vector d(k,m) has an amplitude A(k,m) that corresponds to the amplitude ratio between one output and a reference output, and a phase Φ(k,m) that corresponds to the phase difference between the output and the reference output:
According to the exhaustive search technique, control combinations (k,m) are scanned, and the output vectors
In existing vector modulators, this is not always the case. Assuming the minimum output power from each branch is sufficiently close to zero, the following holds for the general case:
The separate sweep of the I-branch with Q=Qnull and Q-branch with I=Inull, yields:
I(k)Qnull :
I(k)Qnull :
Q(m)Qnull :
Accordingly, vector d(k,m) for any k,m may be expressed as follows:
TABLE 1 | ||||
Quadrant/ | ||||
Value | I value | Q value | I-range | Q-range |
1: Φ = | Il | Ql | Inull − Imax | Qnull − |
0-90° | Qmax | |||
2: Φ = | 2 * | Ql180-Φ | Imin − Inull | Qnull − |
90-180° | Inull − Il180-Φ | Qmax | ||
3: Φ = | 2 * | 2 * Qnull − QlΦ-180 | Imin − Inull | Qmin − |
180-270° | Inull − IlΦ-180 | Qnull | ||
4: Φ = | Il | 2 * Qnull − Ql360-Φ | Inull − Imax | Qmin − |
270-360° | Qnull | |||
According to the example, the values of one quadrant, for example, Quadrant 1, may be scanned. Measurements of the other quadrants, for example, Quadrants 2 through 4, may be determined from the measurements of the scanned quadrant.
