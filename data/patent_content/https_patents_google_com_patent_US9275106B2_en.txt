Definitions
- Implementations relate generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to providing potential refinements and optimizations for query submissions.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) to the user based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are identified as search results and are returned to the user as links.
- an add-on toolbar may permit a user to perform a search right from the toolbar, permit terms to be highlighted on a web page, provide pop-up protection, and do other things to assist the user in finding information of interest.
- a method may include receiving one or more terms of a search query; automatically identifying prior search queries including the one or more terms of the search query from a history of prior search queries; and presenting query refinement options including the prior search queries as suggested queries for possible selection by a user.
- a system may include means for presenting a toolbar in a web browser, the toolbar may include a search box; means for receiving one or more terms of a search query into the search box; means for automatically identifying prior search queries that include the one or more terms of the search query from a history of prior search queries; means for spell-checking the one or more terms of the search query to identify potential corrections to the one or more terms of the search query; and means for presenting query refinement options associated with the search box, the query refinement box configured to include the previously received search queries and the identified potential corrections as suggested queries for possible selection by a user.
- a method, performed by a device may include providing a dynamic search box selectable object within a web browser application window; receiving a search query within the dynamic search box selectable object; identifying local historical search queries matching at least a portion of the received search query; identifying possible spelling corrections to the received search query; identifying server-based historical search queries beginning with the received search query; and populating a refinement box associated with the dynamic search box selectable object with the identified local historical search queries, the identified possible spelling corrections, and the identified server-based historical search queries.
- a method may be provided.
- the method may include receiving a search query; identifying query tokens within the search query, wherein the query tokens relate to query operations and syntax; and graphically presenting the search query to represent differences in the identified query tokens.
- a computer-readable medium that stores instructions executable by a client device.
- the computer-readable medium may include instructions for causing the client device to receive one or more terms of a search query; instructions for causing the client device to automatically identify prior search queries including the one or more terms of the search query from a history of prior search queries; instructions for causing the client device to automatically identify possible spelling corrected queries based on the one or more terms of the search query; and instructions for causing the client device to present query refinement options to the user, the query refinement options including the previously received search queries as suggested queries and the possible spelling corrected queries for possible selection by a user.

In either case, toolbar software 430 may take the form of a user interface object, as described above. Toolbar software 430 may include dynamic search box software 440 for presenting and implementing the dynamic search box functionalities described herein.
- FIG. 5 is an exemplary diagram of a graphical user interface 500 that illustrates various implementations of the search box feature.
- Graphical user interface 500 may, for example, correspond to a web browser window that currently displays a document 502 .
- the dynamic search box may be implemented as a text entry box 504 within an add-on toolbar 506 .
- add-on toolbar 506 may include additional search boxes, software buttons, and/or menu elements selectable by a user to initiate different functions performed by add-on toolbar 506 .
- a user may initiate features of the dynamic search box by selecting (e.g., clicking on) text entry box 504 on the add-on toolbar 506 .
- the dynamic search box may be implemented as text entry box 508 embedded within the document currently being displayed within a web browser window. It should be appreciated to those skilled in the other art that in yet other implementations, other mechanisms—which may or may not be integrated within a web browser—for providing functionality of the dynamic search box feature described herein may be used without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
- Text entry box 504 may be configured to receive one or more characters that the user wishes to include as a basis for a search query. As shown in FIG. 5 , in the present example, the user has initially input “2007 ford mus” as a start for a potential search query.
- dynamic search box software 440 may identify the input terms and initiate a query refinement search based on the received terms even as the user continues to add to the search query.
- the results of the query refinement search may be automatically presented to the user in a refinement box 510 .
- the content of the refinement drop-down box 510 also dynamically adjusts accordingly.
- text entry box 504 and/or refinement drop-down box 510 may be dynamically resized based on the information included therein. For example, in situations where a user submits a search query longer than the text entry box may initially display, text entry box 504 may be resized to allow complete display of the received terms. Similarly, refinement drop-down box 510 may be dynamically resized in both width and length to allow for display of suggested queries or search results exceeding an initial box size.
- refinement drop-down box 510 may be configured to display several types of query refinement information. More particularly, query refinements based upon potential misspellings or other typographical errors within the received terms may be presented to the user in a “did you mean” section 512 . Query refinements relating to the received terms and identified within a prior history of client 210 may be presented to the user in a “history” section 514 . Query refinements relating to the received terms and identified based on non-user-specific historical search information may be presented to the user in a “suggestions” section 516 .
- refinement drop-down box 510 may also provide users with several additional search related functions.
- a context section 518 may inform the user of the present search context and enable the user to select a different search context.
- various search contexts may be displayed in context section 518 with an active context being highlighted.
- users may select an alternate search context in various ways. For example, a user may select an alternate search context by using a mouse to click on the desired context. Alternately, users may scroll through the various search contexts by using pre-defined keystrokes on a user input device. In one implementation, selection of the page up and page down keys enables users to progress forward and backward through the listing of available search contexts.
- context section 518 is displayed upon selection of a context icon 519 included within text box 504 .
- actions section 520 may present additional options relating to the operation of dynamic search box software 440 .
- actions section 520 may include an explain query option 522 , a clear history option 524 , and a return to a web search option 526 . Additional details regarding options 522 - 526 will be set forth in additional detail below.
- additional search-related information may be presented to the user in refinement drop-down box 510 .
- a complete or partial listing of search results may be presented in response to specific types of queries or queries received for selected search contexts. For example, where a user has selected local bookmarks as a search context, terms received into text entry box 504 may result in matching bookmarks being retrieved and displayed in refinement drop-down box 510 . Selection of an identified bookmark may then result in the display of the web page associated with the selected bookmark.
- search results may be provided in response to traditional web searches as well, with the result listing dynamically changing upon receipt of additional terms or selection of an available query refinement suggestion. In this manner, users may more quickly access search results associated with input or selected query terms.
- FIGS. 6 and 7 are flowcharts of an exemplary process for implementing a dynamic search box feature.
- the processing of FIGS. 6 and 7 may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within client 210 , server 220 , or a combination of client 210 and server 220 .
- the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or including client 210 and/or server 220 .
- processing may begin with text entry box 504 receiving one or more terms from a user to form the basis for a search query (act 610 ).
- term may include one or more characters of a search query or possibly less than the entire search query.
- dynamic search box software 440 may perform spell-checking on the received terms (act 612 ).
- the spell-checking may be performed either locally at client 210 or remotely using resources, such as server 220 .
- spell-check processing may be performed asynchronously to other query processing, thereby providing enhanced performance.
- spell-check processing may be requested following expiration of a predetermined time period after a last query term is input. This prevents continuous server requests when the user has not yet completed their initial character submission.
- the identified corrected search queries are presented to the user in “did you mean” section 512 of refinement drop-down box 510 (act 615 ).
- the corrected portions of the identified corrected search queries may be highlighted using, for example, bolded, italicized or other suitable highlighting. If no corrected search queries are identified, “did you mean” section 512 may be removed from refinement drop down box 510 .
- dynamic search box software 440 may examine a history of prior search queries associated with the selected search context (act 616 ) and determine whether any history entries beginning with the same sequence of received terms exist (act 618 ).
- the history may be a local history of user search queries maintained at client device 210 .
- the history may be a shared history including prior search queries for a number of different users.
- the shared history may include prior search queries for a number of friends or related individuals.
- the identified history entries are presented to the user in “history” section 514 of refinement drop-down box 510 (act 620 ).
- Dynamic search box software 440 may also request query completion suggestions from server 220 based on the received terms (act 626 ).
- the server-based query completion request may identify popular search queries beginning with the received terms. In one embodiment, as many as 10 query suggestions may be requested from server 220 .
- dynamic search box software 440 may receive query completion suggestions from server 220 (act 628 ). The received query completion suggestions may be ranked and/or sorted based on popularity of the suggestion or respective number of search results. The suggestions may then be presented to the user in “suggestions” section 516 of refinement drop-down box 510 (act 630 ).
- dynamic search box software 440 may also present a listing of available search contexts to the user in a context section 518 of refinement drop-down box 510 (act 632 ). As described above, a currently applied context may be highlighted within the listing of available search contexts. Additionally, a listing of available query options may be presented to the user in an actions section 520 of refinement-drop down box 510 (act 634 ).
- refinement drop-down box 510 is presented to the user (act 700 ).
- Dynamic search box software 440 may then receive a user selection of a search context from within the available search contexts included within context section 518 of refinement drop-down box 510 (act 710 ).
- user selection of search context may be received in multiple ways, including, mouse or suitable pointing device selection of a link associated with a selected context and keyboard based selection of an available context.
- a web search is the default search context.
- modifications to the default search context may be temporarily maintained for the current query, a predetermined time period, or made persistent for all future queries, until a subsequent change is made.
- Dynamic search box software 440 may then receive a user selection of a query refinement or suggestion provided within refinement drop-down box 510 (act 715 ).
- the user selection may be performed by using a mouse or suitable pointing device to click or otherwise select an available query refinement.
- the user selection may be performed by using a keyboard or other input device to scroll through the listing of available refinements. Specifically in the keyboard embodiment, users may easily return to an unmodified query by reversing the keyboard commands previously used to select an available query refinement.
- dynamic search box software 440 Upon receipt of the selection of an available query refinement, dynamic search box software 440 transmits the selected query and selected search context to server 220 for search performance (act 720 ).
- Dynamic search box software 440 may also receive a user selection of explain query option 522 provided in action section 520 of refinement drop-down section 510 (act 725 ). In response, dynamic search box software 440 may present a tool-tip or other notification window providing an explanation of the syntax of the current query (act 730 ). For example, a web search query for “apple—computer” may result in an explain query notification window content of ‘search the web for “apple” but not “computer”’.
- Dynamic search box software 440 may receive a user selection of clear history option 524 provided in action section 520 of refinement drop-down section 510 (act 735 ). In response, dynamic search box software may clear or otherwise delete the user's query history (act 740 ).
- FIG. 8 is an exemplary diagram of a graphical user interface 800 that illustrates a context highlighting feature provided by dynamic search box software 440 .
- Graphical user interface 800 may, for example, correspond to a web browser window that currently displays a web document 802 .
- the dynamic search box may be implemented as a text entry box 804 within an add-on toolbar 806 .
- add-on toolbar 806 may include additional search boxes, software buttons, and/or menu elements selectable by a user to initiate different functions performed by add-on toolbar 806 .
- a user may initiate features of the dynamic search box software 440 by inputting one or more search terms into text entry box 804 on add-on toolbar 806 .
- the dynamic search box may be implemented as text entry box (not shown) embedded within the document currently being displayed within a web browser window. It should be appreciated to those skilled in the other art that in yet other implementations, other mechanisms—which may or may not be integrated within a web browser—for providing functionality of the dynamic search box feature described herein may be used without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
- searches performed in response to terms received into text entry box may be complex searches.
- complex searches may include various keyword modifiers or tokens operable to modify the manner in which searches including the tokens are performed.
- complex Boolean operations, grouping structures, or other query operations may be incorporated into a search query.
- Suitable query tokens may include a minus sign to designate a keyword to be excluded; quotation marks to designate an exact phrase; a tilde sign to designate to include synonyms for the following keyword; a “site:” prefix to designate a domain specific search; an OR or * to designate a logical or'ing for adjacent keywords or groups; various mathematical operators; ellipses between numbers to designate the range of all numbers; and parentheses to designate keyword groupings.
- different types of highlighting may be used on different query tokens and their associated keywords to enable rapid identification of each tokens affect on the complete query.
- the syntax for the search terms may be automatically highlighted to provide easy recognition of the associated syntax functions. For example, by using different colors, highlighting, bolding, etc., various functions may be identified.
- the query ((apple—computer) gala) OR (“granny smith apples”—computer) may represent a search for documents containing “apple” but not “computer' AND gala, OR the exact phrase “granny smith apples” but not “computer”.
- tool-tips may be used to provide explanations to the various tokens included with a query.
- an explanation of the effect of the token may be provided.
- dynamic search software 430 in response to a user hovering over “granny smith apples” in the query, dynamic search software 430 generates tool-tip 808 indicating that the query tokens “ ” require that search results include the exact phrase “granny smith apples”.
- an explanation of the entire query may be provided.
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may provide a dynamic search box for quickly and unobtrusively providing search refinements based on received search terms.
- the dynamic search box may provide query syntax highlighting for assisting users in readily identifying query components.
- exemplary user interfaces have been described with respect to FIGS. 5 and 8 .
- the user interfaces may include more, fewer, or different pieces of information.
- a “user” is intended to refer to a client, such as a client 210 ( FIG. 2 ), or an operator of a client 210 .
