Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate generally to fact databases, and more particularly, to corroboration of facts extracted from multiple sources.
- Web search engines may be unhelpful to users in this regard, as they generally do not provide a simple, succinct answer to factual queries such as the ones described above. Rather, Web search engines provide to the user a list of Web pages that are determined to match the query, and the user has to sort through the matching Web pages to find the answer.
- search engines draw their facts from a single source, such as a particular encyclopedia. This limits the types of questions that these engines can answer. For instance, a search engine based on an encyclopedia is unlikely to be able to answer many questions concerning popular culture, such as questions about movies, songs or the like, and is also unlikely to be able to answer many questions about products, services, retail and wholesale businesses and so on. If the set of sources used by such a search engine were to be expanded, however, such expansion might introduce the possibility of multiple possible answers to a factual query, some of which might be contradictory or ambiguous. Furthermore, as the universe of sources expands, information may be drawn from untrustworthy sources or sources of unknown reliability.
- a method for corroborating facts includes identifying one or more attribute-value pairs associated with a common subject; identifying a subset of the attribute-value pairs associated with the common subject, each of the attribute-value pairs in the subset meeting one or more predefined corroboration requirements; and performing a predefined action with respect to status of the identified subset of attribute-value pairs in a fact repository.
- a method for corroboration facts includes identifying one or more attribute-value pairs associated with a common subject; identifying a set of attributes from the identified attribute-value pairs, each of the attributes of the identified set meeting a first corroboration requirement; identifying a subset of the attribute-value pairs associated with the common subject, each of the attribute-value pairs in the subset having an attribute in the set of identified attributes and meeting a second corroboration requirement; and performing a predefined action with respect to the status of the identified subset of attribute-value pairs in a fact repository.
- a method for corroboration facts include identifying one or more attribute-value pairs associated with a common subject; identifying a set of candidate attributes from the identified attribute-value pairs; for each of the set of candidate attributes, determining a first score; identifying a subset of the set of candidate attributes, each of the subset of the set of candidate attributes having a respective first score exceeding a first predefined threshold; and for each of the subset of the set of candidate attributes: identifying one or more first candidate values associated with the respective candidate attribute; for each of the first candidate values, determining a second score; selecting a second candidate value of the first candidate values, the second candidate value being an only member of the first candidate values or having a respective second score exceeding second scores of other first candidate values by at least a predefined margin; and performing a predefined action with respect to a respective attribute-value pair having both the respective candidate attribute and the selected second candidate value.

- Factual information from web pages may be extracted and stored in a facts database.
- the facts database may be used to provide answers to factual questions such as the ones described above.
- factual questions such as the ones described above.
- Some web pages may have facts that are unintentionally erroneous, due to typographical errors or outdated information, for example.
- Other web pages may have facts that are trivial, uninteresting or of potentially doubtful veracity.
- some web pages may purposely include outright falsehoods as “facts.”
- content from a web page that is not factual information may be misidentified and extracted as facts. Storing these “facts” in the facts database would diminish the quality of the fact database.
- Facts, associated with a particular subject, that are proper for inclusion in the fact repository may be identified by a process that corroborates the facts across documents that include facts associated with the particular subject. Furthermore, the number of corroborated facts in a document may be a basis for reducing the corroboration requirements for other facts in the same document.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a network 100 , according to some embodiments of the invention.
- Network 100 includes one or more document hosts 102 and a fact repository engine 106 .
- the network 100 also includes one or more networks 104 that couple these components.
- the document hosts 102 store documents and provide access to the documents.
- a document may be any machine-readable data including any combination of text, graphics, multimedia content, etc.
- a document may be a combination of text, graphics and possible other forms of information written in the Hypertext Markup Language, i.e., web pages.
- a document may include one or more hyperlinks to other documents.
- a document may include one or more facts within its contents.
- a document stored in a document host 102 may be located and/or identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Web address, or any other appropriate form of identification and/or location.
- Each document may also be associated with a page importance metric.
- the page importance metric of a document measures the importance, popularity or reputation of the document relative to other documents.
- the page importance metric is the PageRank of the document.
- PageRank metric For more information on such the PageRank metric and its computation, see, for example, Lawrence et al., “The PageRank citation ranking: Bringing order to the web,” Stanford Digital Libraries Working Paper, 1998; Haveliwala, “Topic-sensitive PageRank,” Proceedings of the Eleventh International World Wide Web Conference, 2002; Richardson and Domingos, “The Intelligent Surfer: Probabilistic Combination of Link and Content Information in PageRank,” volume 14.
- the fact repository engine 106 includes an importer 108 , a repository manager 110 , a fact index 112 , and a fact repository 114 .
- the importer 108 extracts factual information from documents stored on document hosts 102 .
- the importer 108 analyzes the contents of the documents stored in document host 102 , determines if the contents include factual information and the subject or subjects with which the factual information are associated, and extracts any available factual information within the contents.
- the repository manager 110 processes facts extracted by the importer 108 .
- the repository manager 110 builds and manages the fact repository 114 and the fact index 112 .
- the repository manager 110 receives facts extracted by the importer 108 and stores them in the fact repository 114 .
- the repository manager 114 may also perform operations on facts in the fact repository 114 to “clean up” the data within the fact repository 114 .
- the repository manager 110 may look through the fact repository 114 to find duplicate facts (that is, facts that convey the exact same factual information) and merge them.
- the repository manager 110 may also normalize facts into standard formats.
- the repository manager 110 may also remove unwanted facts from the fact repository 114 , such as facts related to pornographic content.
- the fact repository 114 stores factual information extracted from a plurality of documents that are located on the document hosts 102 .
- a document from which a particular fact may be extracted is a source document (or “source”) of that particular fact.
- Sources documents may include, without limitation, Web pages.
- entities, concepts, and the like for which the fact repository 114 may have factual information stored are represented by objects.
- An object may have one or more facts associated with it.
- Each object is a collection of facts; an object that has no facts associated with it (an empty object) may be viewed as a non-existent object within the fact repository 114 .
- each fact associated with the object is stored as an attribute-value pair.
- Each fact also includes a list of source documents that include the fact within its contents and from which the fact was extracted. Further details about objects and facts in the fact repository are described below, in relation to FIG. 2 .
- the fact index 112 provides an index to the fact repository 114 and facilitates efficient lookup of information in the fact repository 114 .
- the fact index 112 may index the fact repository 114 based on one or more parameters.
- the fact index 112 may have an index that indexes unique terms to locations within the fact repository 114 .
- each of the components of the fact repository engine 106 may be distributed over multiple computers.
- the fact repository 114 may be deployed over N servers, with a mapping function such as the “modulo N” function being used to determine which facts are stored in each of the N servers.
- the fact index 112 may be distributed over multiple servers, and the importer 108 and repository manager 110 may each be distributed over multiple computers.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary data structure for an object within the fact repository 114 , according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the fact repository includes objects, each of which may include one or more facts.
- Each object 200 includes a unique identifier, such as the object ID 202 .
- the object 200 includes one or more facts 204 .
- Each fact 204 includes a unique identifier for that fact, such as a Fact ID 210 .
- Each fact 204 includes an attribute 212 and a value 214 .
- facts included in an object representing George Washington may include facts having attributes of “date of birth” and “date of death,” and the values of these facts would be the actual date of birth and date of death, respectively.
- a fact 204 may include a link 216 to another object, which is the object identifier, such as the object ID 202 of another object within the fact repository 114 .
- the link 216 allows objects to have facts whose values are other objects. For example, for an object “United States,” there may be a fact with the attribute “president” whose value is “George W. Bush,”, with “George W. Bush” being another object in the fact repository 114 .
- the value field 214 stores the name of the linked object and the link 216 stores the object identifier of the linked object.
- facts 204 do not include a link field 216 because the value 214 of a fact 204 may store a link to another object.
- Each fact 204 also may include one or more metrics 218 .
- the metrics may provide indications of the quality of the fact.
- the metrics include a confidence level and an importance level.
- the confidence level indicates the likelihood that the fact is correct.
- the importance level indicates the relevance of the fact to the object, compared to other facts for the same object.
- the importance level may optionally be viewed as a measure of how vital a fact is to an understanding of the entity or concept represented by the object.
- Each fact 204 includes a list of sources 220 that include the fact and from which the fact was extracted.
- Each source may be identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Web address, or any other appropriate form of identification and/or location, such as a unique document identifier.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- some facts may include an agent field 222 that identifies the module that extracted the fact.
- the agent may be a specialized module that extracts facts from a specific source (e.g., the pages of a particular web site, or family of web sites) or type of source (e.g., web pages that present factual information in tabular form), or a module that extracts facts from free text in documents throughout the Web, and so forth.
- an object 200 may have one or more specialized facts, such as a name fact 206 and a property fact 208 .
- a name fact 206 is a fact that conveys a name for the entity or concept represented by the object 200 . For example, for an object representing the country Spain, there may be a fact conveying the name of the object as “Spain.”
- a name fact 206 being a special instance of a general fact 204 , includes the same parameters as any other fact 204 ; it has an attribute, a value, a fact ID, metrics, sources, etc.
- the attribute 224 of a name fact 206 indicates that the fact is a name fact, and the value is the actual name.
- the name may be a string of text.
- An object 200 may have one or more name facts, as many entities or concepts can have more than one name.
- an object representing Spain may have name facts conveying the country's common name “Spain” and the official name “Kingdom of Spain.”
- an object representing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may have name facts conveying the agency's acronyms “PTO” and “USPTO” and the official name “United States Patent and Trademark Office.”
- a property fact 208 is a fact that conveys a statement about the entity or concept represented by the object 200 that may be of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, a property fact may convey that Spain is a country in Europe.
- a property fact 208 being a special instance of a general fact 204 , also includes the same parameters (such as attribute, value, fact ID, etc.) as other facts 204 .
- the attribute field 226 of a property fact 208 indicates that the fact is a property fact, and the value field is a string of text that conveys the statement of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, the value of a property fact may be the text string “is a country in Europe.”
- Some objects 200 may have one or more property facts while other objects may have no property objects.
- each object may have additional special facts aside from name facts and property facts, such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object.
- name facts and property facts such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object.
- an object's name(s) and/or properties are represented by special records that have a different format than the facts records 204 associated with the attribute-value pairs of an object.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process for corroborating facts, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- the corroboration process may be performed on facts that have been extracted from sources but are awaiting storage into the fact repository 114 .
- facts that have been corroborated are stored in the fact repository 114 .
- the corroboration process may be performed on facts already stored in the fact repository 114 .
- the corroborated facts may be marked for retention or accessibility in the fact repository 114 , or the uncorroborated facts may be marked for removal or denial of access.
- One or more sources that include one or more facts associated with a common subject are identified ( 302 ).
- documents that include factual information are grouped according to the subject of the factual information included in each document.
- the subject with which the facts included in a source are associated may be identified by analyzing the source' content, such as the title text.
- the subject with which the facts included in a source are associated may be identified by analyzing the anchor text of hyperlinks from other documents to the source.
- Each distinct anchor text (or each distinct subject extracted from the anchor text of the hyperlinks to the source) may be given a weighted score based on how many documents have a hyperlink to the source with the same anchor text (or the same subject extracted from the anchor text) and the page importance metrics of those documents.
- the anchor text (or the subject extracted from the anchor text) with the highest score is determined to be the subject (or object name) associated with the facts extracted from the source.
- A-V pairs attribute-value pairs associated with the common subject are extracted ( 304 ).
- A-V pairs attribute-value pairs associated with the common subject are extracted ( 304 ).
- this document may use the shorthand phrase “A-V pairs in a selected source” (and other similar phrases) to mean facts or attribute-value pairs extracted from or otherwise derived from the selected source.
- One or more attributes are identified from the extracted A-V pairs ( 306 ).
- the first corroboration requirement is based on the number of sources that include at least one A-V pair that has the particular attribute.
- the first corroboration requirement looks for facts about the common subject with attributes that may be important with regard to the common subject, based on the frequency of appearance of facts with particular attribute across sources.
- the first corroboration requirement may be that at least four (or more generally, N, where N is an integer greater than 1) independent sources (e.g., from different web sites) be the source of A-V pairs having the same attribute.
- each attribute identified at 306 is given a first source count score and the first source count score is tested against a first predefined threshold.
- the first source count score for an attribute is the number of independent sources that include at least one A-V pair that has the particular attribute.
- the first predefined threshold represents the first corroboration requirement, namely a minimum number of sources that includes an A-V pair with the particular attribute.
- the count of sources may exclude documents (e.g., web pages) from the same web site as a document already included in the count, and may also exclude duplicates and near-duplicates of documents already included in the count.
- Other techniques may also be used to reduce gaming of the facts repository, and some of these techniques may be incorporated into the first corroboration requirement and/or the second corroboration requirement (discussed below). For example, the incorporation of a page importance-weighted score in the second corroboration requirement (as discussed below) may help to reduce gaming of the facts repository by favoring facts from sources of higher importance (with importance being a proxy for the reliability of a source).
- the first corroboration requirement may be based on a number of sources that include at least one A-V pair that has the particular attribute or any of its synonymous or equivalent attributes.
- Synonymous or equivalent attributes of an attribute convey the same concept as the respective attribute. For example, attributes “birthdate” and “birthday” are synonymous with or equivalent to the attribute “date of birth,” because they both convey the same concept, namely the date when a person was born.
- synonymous or equivalent attributes are identified by comparing the attributes identified at 306 to each other and determining a degree of similarity based on each comparison. Attributes whose degrees of similarity are above a predefined similarity threshold are deemed to be synonymous or equivalent.
- one of the attributes is selected ( 310 ). For that selected attribute, an A-V pair that includes the selected attribute and satisfies a second corroboration requirement is identified ( 312 ). The identified A-V pair that satisfies the second corroboration requirement (and also satisfies the first corroboration requirement because it includes an attribute that satisfies the first corroboration requirement) may be said to be an “accepted” A-V pair.
- the second corroboration requirement is based on the number of sources that include the particular A-V pair and on a comparison of the page importance-weighted score of the particular A-V pair against page importance-weighted scores of other A-V pairs that include the selected attribute but a different value.
- the second corroboration requirements looks for the “most correct” value for the selected attribute, with regard to the common subject, based on the frequency of appearance of the particular value in A-V pairs that include the selected attribute across documents and the importance of the sources that include the A-V pair with the selected attribute and the particular value.
- the second corroboration requirement is that the A-V pair with the selected attribute and the particular value appears in at least a minimum number of sources and has a page importance-weighted score that is “lopsided” compared to page importance-weighted scores of other A-V pairs with the selected attribute but different values.
- one or more values are identified.
- the identified values are values that are included in A-V pairs that include the selected attribute.
- a second source count score that is the number of sources that includes the A-V pair having the selected attribute and the particular identified value is determined.
- the second source count score is the number of sources that includes the A-V pair having the selected attribute (or its synonymous/equivalent attributes) and the particular identified value or its synonymous/equivalent values.
- Synonymous/equivalent values are similar to synonymous/equivalent attributes. Grouping of synonymous/equivalent values are based on degrees of similarity determined from comparisons of the identified values to each other, similar to the grouping of synonymous/equivalent attributes, as described above.
- the function for computing the second source count score is:
- the sources of an A-V pair included in the score computations may be restricted in various ways to reduce gaming of the facts repository.
- the second source count score is tested against a second predefined threshold. For those A-V pairs whose second source count scores satisfy the second predefined threshold, a page importance-weighted score is determined.
- the page importance-weighted score is the sum of the page importance metrics of the sources that include the A-V pair having the selected attribute (or its synonymous/equivalent attributes) and the particular value (or its synonymous/equivalent values).
- the function for computing the page importance-weighted score is:
- Score ⁇ ( A - V ) ⁇ sources ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ A - V ⁇ page - importance ⁇ ( source )
- the page importance-weighted score may be the average of the page importance metrics of the sources that include the A-V pair having the selected attribute (or its synonymous/equivalent attributes) and the particular value (or its synonymous/equivalent values).
- the function for computing this version of the page importance-weighted score is:
- Score ⁇ ( A - V ) 1 K ⁇ ⁇ sources ⁇ ⁇ of ⁇ ⁇ A - V ⁇ page - importance ⁇ ( source ) , where K is the number of sources of the A-V pair included in the score computation.
- the page importance-weighted scores of the A-V pairs whose second source count scores exceed the second predefined threshold are compared against each other.
- the A-V pair having the largest page importance-weighted score over each of the other page importance-weighted scores by at least a predefined margin is the A-V pair that satisfies the second corroboration requirement, i.e., the accepted A-V pair.
- the predefined margin may be defined by the inequality S> ⁇ C+ ⁇ , where S is the page importance-weighted score of an A-V pair, C is the page importance-weighted score of another A-V pair, and ⁇ and ⁇ are predefined constants.
- ⁇ may be set to a positive number greater than 1, such as a number between 2 and 5, inclusive, and ⁇ may be set to 0.
- the second corroboration requirement is both that the second source count score is above the second predefined threshold and that the page importance-weighted score is greater than other page importance-weighted scores by at least the predefined margin.
- an A-V pair is the only one whose second source count score exceeds the second predefined threshold. In some embodiments, such an A-V pair may be accepted without performing the comparison of page importance-weighted scores.
- a predefined action may be performed ( 316 ) with respect to the A-V pair and/or with respect to its status in the fact repository 114 .
- the predefined action is to store the A-V pair in the fact repository 114 as a fact 204 associated with an object 202 .
- the predefined action may be to mark the A-V pair, if already stored in the fact repository 114 , as proper for retention in the fact repository 114 and/or proper for access. Other A-V pairs having the same attribute may be marked for deletion from the fact repository, or may be marked as being unavailable for retrieval in response to a fact search query.
- the reason for this may be that no A-V pair with that particular attribute has a second source count score greater than the second predefined threshold, or that no A-V pair with that particular attribute has a page importance-weighted score that is greater than the page importance-weighted scores of other A-V pairs with that particular attribute by the predefined margin.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary process for corroborating facts under reduced requirements, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a source that includes extracted A-V pairs is selected ( 402 ). If that source has at least a predefined number M of accepted A-V pairs ( 404 —yes), then the first corroboration requirement for attributes in non-accepted A-V pairs in the selected source is reduced ( 406 ).
- the first corroboration requirement is reduced by counting the selected source as two sources in the first source count scores of attributes in A-V pairs derived from the selected source. More generally, the selected source may be treated as N sources for purposes of evaluating the first corroboration requirements, where N is a value (not necessarily an integer) greater than 1. This adjustment may be performed for attributes that otherwise failed to pass the first corroboration requirement. In other words, the first source count scores of those attributes are positively adjusted.
- the first corroboration requirement may be reduced by lowering the first predefined threshold.
- A-V pair that includes the selected attribute and meets a reduced second corroboration requirement is identified ( 412 ). If one is identified ( 414 —yes), a predefined action may be performed with respect to it and/or with respect to its status in the fact repository 114 ( 416 ).
- Operations 412 , 414 , and 416 are the same as operations 312 , 314 , and 316 , respectively, as described above, except that in operation 412 the second corroboration requirement is reduced for A-V pairs having the selected attribute.
- the second corroboration requirement is reduced by counting a source that include the A-V pair having the selected attribute and at least M accepted A-V pairs as two sources (or more generally, as N sources, where N is a value greater than 1). In other words, the second source count scores and the page importance-weighted scores of those A-V pairs with the selected attribute are positively adjusted.
- the second corroboration requirement may be reduced by lowering the second predefined threshold or reducing the predefined margin.
- FIG. 4B illustrates another exemplary process for corroborating facts under reduced requirements, according to some embodiments of the invention.
- a source of extracted A-V pairs is selected ( 422 ). If that source has at least a predefined number P of accepted A-V pairs ( 424 —yes), then the (previously) non-accepted A-V pairs in the selected source are accepted and the predefined action may be performed with respect to them and/or with respect to their status in the fact repository 114 ( 426 ).
- P may be any appropriate value greater than 1; for example, P may be a predefined value between four and ten. In other words, for the non-accepted A-V pairs derived from the selected source, the first and second corroboration requirements are eliminated entirely.
- the process may end ( 430 ).
- the acceptance of facts in the initial processing may be used as an indication of the reliability and trustworthiness of a source.
- a source meets a predefined reliability requirement, other facts extracted from the same source that have not yet been accepted may be accepted, or given a second opportunity to be accepted, even though those facts would otherwise fail to meet one or more corroboration requirements.
- that a source includes at least a certain number M of accepted facts is an indication of the relative reliability and trustworthiness of the source. Based on that indication of reliability and trustworthiness, corroboration requirements for other facts in the same source are reduced and those facts are provided a second opportunity at being accepted for the fact repository 114 .
- a source includes at least certain number P of accepted facts is an indication that the source is of such high reliability and trustworthiness that the corroboration requirements for other facts from the same source may be eliminated entirely.
- P is a number greater than M, to reflect a more stringent threshold required for outright elimination of corroboration requirements for facts derived or extracted from a source.
- the corroboration process may be performed in three phases.
- the processes described above, in relation to FIGS. 3 , 4 A, and 4 B may be performed sequentially, with an initial fact acceptance phase (represented, for example, by FIG. 3 ), a second phase (represented, for example, by FIG. 4A ) where corroboration requirements are reduced for some facts, and a third phase (represented, for example, by FIG. 4B ) where the corroboration requirements are eliminated for some facts.
- the corroboration process may be performed on facts already stored in the fact repository 114 , rather than before the extracted facts are stored in the fact repository 114 .
- the process is similar to that described above.
- the predefined action may be to mark an accepted fact as accepted. Afterwards, the repository manager, while removing unwanted facts, may keep accepted facts in the fact repository 114 unless other criteria mandate removal.
- the predefined action may be to mark the fact as accessible. Facts that are so marked may be accessed (for example, while processing a search query), while facts not marked are not accessible, even if they remain in the fact repository 114 .
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a fact repository system 500 in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.
- the fact repository system 500 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 502 , one or more network or other communications interfaces 510 , memory 512 , and one or more communication buses 514 for interconnecting these components.
- the fact repository system 500 optionally may include a user interface 504 comprising a display device 506 and a keyboard/mouse 508 .
- the memory 512 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.
- Memory 512 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 502 . In some embodiments, the memory 512 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof:
- memory 512 of system 500 includes the fact index instead of an interface 532 to the fact index.
- the system 500 also includes a fact storage system 540 for storing facts. Each fact stored in the fact storage system 540 includes a corresponding list of sources from which the respective fact was extracted.
- modules 526 , 528 , and 534 may be grouped into a first corroboration module.
- Each of the above identified elements may be stored in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices, and corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above.
- the above identified modules or programs i.e., sets of instructions
- memory 512 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified above.
- memory 512 may store additional modules and data structures not described above.
- FIG. 5 shows a “fact repository system,” FIG. 5 is intended more as functional description of the various features which may be present in a set of servers than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein.
- items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated.
- some items shown separately in FIG. 5 could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers.
- the actual number of servers used to implement a fact repository system and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part of the amount of information stored in the facts repository, in part on the number of sources or potential sources of facts to be processed, and in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
