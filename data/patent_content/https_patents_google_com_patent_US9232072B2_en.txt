- AEC spatial acoustic echo cancellation
- the present disclosure describes in detail a new approach to combat the non-identifiability issue in multiple loudspeaker arrangements with shared echo cancellation processing.
- the methods and techniques described herein allow for continued use of mono AEC.
- the present disclosure provides a straightforward speaker detection scheme for identifying different speakers in a stereo loudspeaker arrangement.
- Echo cancellation in this scenario is accomplished using the signals from the loudspeaker(s) and microphone(s) at the location of person Y.
- One step in an example process of echo cancellation is estimating the channel from a loudspeaker to a microphone. Since each microphone involved in echo cancellation may be treated separately, for purposes of the present explanation it is general enough to consider one microphone only, and focus instead on the number of loudspeakers. For example, consider the case of two loudspeakers and one microphone, as illustrated in the example arrangement of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 1 illustrated is an example stereo audio environment including far-end audio capture devices (e.g., microphones) 120 a and 120 b , near-end audio render devices (e.g., loudspeakers) 110 a and 110 b , and near-end audio capture device (e.g., microphone) 125 .
- Microphones 120 a and 120 b may capture audio signals at the far-end of the audio transmission path from users “E” and “F” and transmit the audio signals to near-end loudspeakers 110 a and 110 b , where the audio signals are played out. It should be noted that audio from both users E and F may be captured and transmitted by either and both of the far-end microphones 120 a and 120 b.
- Render devices 110 a and 110 b may be any of a variety of audio output devices, including a loudspeaker or group of loudspeakers configured to output sound from one or more channels.
- Far-end capture devices 120 a and 120 b , and near-end capture device 125 may be any of a variety of audio input devices, such as one or more microphones configured to capture sound and generate input signals.
- render devices 110 a and/or 110 b and capture device 125 may be hardware devices internal to a computer system, or external peripheral devices connected to a computer system via wired and/or wireless connections.
- render devices 110 a and/or 110 b , and capture device 125 may be components of a single device, such as a microphone, telephone handset, etc.
- one or more of render devices 110 a and 110 b , and capture devices 120 a , 120 b , and 125 may include analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog transformation functionalities.
- the signals from loudspeakers 110 a and 110 b can be respectively denoted as x L (t) and x R (t), and the signal from microphone 125 denoted as y(t).
- the channel from loudspeaker 110 a be H L (q)
- the channel from loudspeaker 110 b be H R (q).
- one microphone signal e.g., signal x R (t)
- One step in the process of echo cancellation is estimating the channels H L (q) and H R (q) (e.g., from loudspeakers 110 a and 110 b , respectively, to microphone 125 , as shown in FIG. 1 ) using measurements of y(t) and x L (t), x R (t). It should be noted from equations (1) and (4) that the same system as described above may be written from x L (t), x R (t) to y(t) in two alternative ways, and that the above manner is merely an example of one of the ways. However, this illustrates that there is no unique solution, which is known as a “non-identifiable system.”
- one result of extending the mono AEC system with parameters for an additional channel is that the system becomes over-parameterized.
- the extra parameters present in the extended mono AEC system may be used to suppress the speech from a user located at the near-end, thereby degrading overall performance.
- increasing the number of parameters in the mono AEC system increases convergence time as a result.
- One approach used to combat the correlation between loudspeakers is to pre-process the audio signals.
- Such pre-processing adds (hopefully) non-audible, non-linear effects to reduce the correlation between the loudspeakers.
- manipulating the loudspeaker signals in an attempt to de-correlate the signals adds computational complexity, can be audible as distortion, can remove the phase between the signals that gives the room/stereo effect, and can also degrade performance since the adaptation/estimation processes may try to find the coupling between the original signals.
- Another example scenario in which echo cancellation will likely perform better with a signal in stereo than with a signal in mono is where the loudspeakers are widely separated.
- the acoustic channel from one loudspeaker to the microphone may differ significantly between the loudspeakers. If the signal is then converted from stereo to mono, the result may be an echo channel impulse response longer than what can be captured with the adaptive filter, thus losing performance. Such a result could be avoided by staying with the stereo signal and allowing the loudspeaker signals to align separately.
- An additional scenario where echo cancellation is likely to perform better with a signal in stereo than with a signal in mono is when there are multiple participants to a conference in the same room. For example, consider communication between user “X” and user “Y”, where audio is transmitted from one user to the other and user X is actually a conference room (e.g., multiple participants speaking) with multiple microphones (e.g., two microphones for purposes of simplicity). The audio from user X is transmitted in stereo to user Y, who has two loudspeakers. Every time someone at user X speaks, there is a mono system as in equation (4) above, with a different G(q) for each speaker. Like in the conference mixing scenario described above, there will be a need to readapt each time there is a switch between speakers, which will result in degraded echo cancellation performance. If the signals are instead processed in stereo, then there will be improved performance in echo cancellation.
- the microphone signal may be expressed as a function of the actual sources (e.g., s(t)) instead of a function of the loudspeaker signals. Further, the actual sources may be expressed as functions of the loudspeaker signals.
- embodiments of the present disclosure provide a solution to the non-identifiability situation by implementing speaker separated echo cancellation.
- “speaker separated” refers to associating one echo channel per speaker (e.g., individual, user, etc.) rather than one echo channel per loudspeaker (e.g., audio output device).
- the speaker separated echo cancellation approach described herein also results in improved convergence.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example model of speaker separated stereo AEC according to one or more embodiments described herein. It should be noted that while FIG. 2 shows a “model” of speaker separated AEC, the actual system remains similar to that illustrated in FIG. 1 , described above.
- the example shown in FIG. 2 includes far-end audio capture devices (e.g., microphones) 220 a and 220 b , near-end audio render devices (e.g., loudspeakers) 210 a and 210 b , and near-end audio capture device (e.g., microphone) 225 .
- far-end audio capture devices e.g., microphones
- near-end audio render devices e.g., loudspeakers
- near-end audio capture device e.g., microphone
- Microphones 220 a and 220 b may capture audio signals at the far-end of the audio transmission path from speakers “E” and “F” (e.g., participants, users, talkers, individuals, etc.) and transmit the audio signals to near-end loudspeakers 210 a and 210 b , where the audio may be played out (e.g., to one or more participants located at the near-end). It should again be noted that audio from both users E and F may be captured and transmitted by either or both of the far-end microphones 220 a and 220 b.
- speakers “E” and “F” e.g., participants, users, talkers, individuals, etc.
- one or more of the various components illustrated in FIG. 2 may be similar to corresponding components illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- one or both of far-end capture devices 220 a and 220 b , and/or near-end capture device 225 may include one or more similar features as capture devices 120 a , 120 b , and/or 125 described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- one or both of near-end render devices 210 a and 210 b as shown in FIG. 2 may include one or more similar features as render devices 110 a and 110 b described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- any additional render and/or capture devices that may be used in the example arrangement shown in FIG. 2 may also have one or more features similar to render devices 110 a and 110 b , and/or capture devices 120 a , 120 b , and 125 as shown in FIG. 1 .
- a source separation/classification algorithm is overly complex. Instead, a low-complexity alternative is to assume a panning structure and estimate the panning parameter to identify the speakers. However, if the participants are located too close to one another, the differences in echo channels are likely to be minimal and there may be little gain in performance.
- determining the active speaker may also be used. For example, algorithms from antenna array signal processing may be used.
- a linear array structure may be used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) from which the speech is coming (it should be noted that use of such a linear array structure may depend on all of the loudspeakers being located on a line). This may require knowledge of the relative distance.
- DOA direction of arrival
- a more general setup e.g., no linear constraint
- the panning parameter, DOA, and/or time delay is associated with each of the speakers, and the current value may be used to determine which of the speakers is active.

In at least one embodiment, the copied state of the speaker and the index may be stored/updated in a channel database 330 . From block 320 the process may return to block 315 .

Abstract
Description
y(t)=H L(q)x L(t)+H R(q)x R(t) (1)
x L(t)=G LE(q)s E(t) (2)
x R(t)=G RE(q)s E(t)=G RE(q)G LE −1(q)x L(t) (3)
where GLE(q) is the channel from speaker E to the far-
y(t)=(H L(q)G LE(q)+H R(q)G RE(q))s E(t)=G(q)s(t)=G(q)G LE −1(q)x L(t) (4)
It is now understood that the system illustrated in
w 2*(x R −x L)T(x R +x L)−w*(x L T(x R −x L)+x R T(x R +x L))+x L T x R=0 (5)
In the above equation (5), the data is stacked into vectors for a more compact notation. The panning parameter estimate may then be chosen as the solution that satisfies 0≦w≦1. If no such solution exists, then the closest boundary value may be selected as the estimate (e.g., if both solutions are negative, then set w=0).
