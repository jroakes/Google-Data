- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example networked environment in which a system configured to prioritize content items based on a user frequency score may exist, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example system configured to prioritize published content items based on a user frequency score, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example user interface that includes prioritized content items, according to various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating an example process for prioritizing published content items based on a user frequency score, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating an example computer system with which any of the devices, servers, or systems discussed herein may be implemented, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- Content items may include articles, photos, videos, music, blog entries, reviews, search results, messages, status updates, notifications (e.g., check-in notifications), or any other content that can be communicated.
- These services can prioritize the content items for display based on a date associated with each content item (e.g., when the content item was published or created) and an importance score for the content item.
- the importance score may be calculated based on, for example, a popularity score, an importance score, how many users have selected or read the content item, the topic of the content item, or other characteristics of the content item.
- prioritizing content items based on when the content items were published and importance scores for the content items may not be optimal in all situations. For example, a users that retrieves published content items from a service very frequently (e.g., several times a day) may need to skip over important content items that the user has already seen in order to view less important, but more recent, content items that the user has yet to see. Another user that retrieves published content items less frequently (e.g., once a month) may need to scroll past several content items that have been published more recently to get to content items of higher importance.
- the user frequency score may be a score that indicates how frequently a user interacts with the service (e.g., by visiting a website associated with the service), how frequently a service delivers content items to a user, how frequently a user retrieves the content items from a service, or how frequently the user performs another action.
- aspects of the subject technology are able to provide the user with a personalized prioritization of published content items. For example, if the user frequently retrieves published content items or frequently visits a website that publishes the content items, the prioritization of the published content items may be based more heavily on how recent the content items were published. If, on the other hand, the user retrieves published content items less frequently or visits the website less frequently, the prioritization of the published content items may based more heavily on the importance scores calculated for the content items.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example networked environment 100 in which a system configured to prioritize content items based on a user frequency score may exist, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a client-server network environment 100

- mobile devices e.g., smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart displays, etc.
- PDAs personal digital assistants
- the client device 105 may also include an application 110 , such as a web browser or a dedicated program (e.g., an “app” for a mobile device), that is configured to interact with one or more services hosted by the content servers 120 .
- an application 110 such as a web browser or a dedicated program (e.g., an “app” for a mobile device)
- the application 110 is a web browser
- the user can instruct the web browser to visit a webpage, hosted by the content servers, that contains published content items.
- the web browser may request the webpage, receive the webpage from the content servers 120 , and display the webpage to the user in a user interface.
- the application 110 is a program associated with the one or more services (e.g., a social networking service or a news aggregator service) hosted by the content servers 120 , the user may use the program to request and receive published content items from the content servers 120 .
- the content servers 120 may be systems or devices having a processor, a memory, and communications capability that may be used host one or more services that store and provide client devices with digital content.
- the services may include a social networking service or a news aggregator service, however, they are not limited to those services.
- the services may also include a messaging or communications service or any other service configured to provide content items to the user.
- the content servers 120 may also host a system that is configured to prioritize published content items based on a user frequency score.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example system 200 configured to prioritize published content items based on a user frequency score, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- the system 200 may include a request module 205 , a content module 210 , a priority module 215 , and a delivery module 220 . In other aspects, however, the system 200 may include additional components, fewer components, or different components.
- the request module 205 is configured to receive a request for content items for a user.
- the request may be received from an application 110 on a client device 105 and be in the form of a request for a webpage containing content items, a query for content items that match certain query parameters, or another request for content items.
- the request module 205 may also store a record of the request in a user database 225 .
- the user database 225 may include request histories for a number of users and the request module 205 can create an entry in the request history for the user submitting the request that includes a timestamp for when the request was received and, in some cases, request details such as the type of content items being requested or a universal resource identifier (URI) for the website that is being requested.
- the entries in the request history for the user may later be used to determine a frequency of a certain action associated with the user.
- the content module 210 can retrieve a set of content items to be delivered to the user.
- the set of content items may be retrieved from a data repository (e.g., a database or other memory) storing content items.
- the set of published content items may or may not be related to the request.
- the content items may be for a requested web page or the content items may have been identified by the content module 210 based on the query parameters.
- the content items may be any content items that the user submitting the request is authorized to view.
- the priority module 215 may be configured to prioritize the retrieved set of content items by, for example, calculating a priority score for each content item.
- the priority score may represent a measure of where each content item should be displayed to the user. As such, those content items with high priority scores may be placed in a position or location (e.g., higher in a list, with a visual indicator, or in a special area) of greater importance or visibility relative to content items with lower priority scores.
- the priority score may be calculated based on a number of different signals or variables. As will be discussed in more detail further below, the priority score may be calculated based on, for example, user preferences, how recently a content item was created, uploaded, or published, measures of how popular a content item is, the topic or content of a content item, the source of the content item, or any other characteristics associated with the content items. The priority score is also calculated based on how frequently a user visits a website and/or how frequently the user requests or retrieves content items from the system 200 .
- the priority score may be calculated such that if a user's frequency in visiting a website or retrieving content items is high, the ages of the content items (e.g., how recently each content item was created, uploaded, or published) will be more heavily weighted when calculating the priority score relative to other factors. If the user's frequency is low, the ages of the content items will be weighted less when calculating the priority score relative to other factors.
- the delivery module 220 is configured to transmit the requested content items to the application 110 on the client device 105 according to the priority scores for the content items. For example, the delivery module 220 may transmit the requested content items as a list of content items prioritized or ordered based on the priority score for each of the content items. The application 110 may use the prioritized list to display the content items to the user. In another example, the delivery module 220 may generate a webpage that includes the requested content items and the content items may be positions and/or locations of the content items in the generated web page may be based on the priority scores for the content items. Once the webpage is delivered to the application 110 , the application 110 may render the webpage on a display.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example user interface 300 that includes prioritized content items, according to various aspects of the subject technology. In other aspects, however, other user interfaces may be used.
- the user interface 300 may be displayed to a user via an application 110 on a client device 105 and be in the form of a web browser user interface or other application user interface.
- the interface 300 includes a user information panel 310 that may contain a profile picture for the user, the name of the user, and a number of options to for content items to view. For example, the user may select one or more of the options in order to view content items of a particular type or from a particular source.
- the option to view news content items is selected in the user interface 300 shown in FIG. 3 .
- the interface 300 can also include a user interface element 320 that enables the user to select a category for the selected content option.
- the categories for the news option include, U.S. news, world news, sports news, and others.
- a number of content items may be displayed to the user in a content interface 330 .
- the content items in the content interface 330 are prioritized based on the priority score for each of the content items shown.
- the content items may be displayed in other ways, in the content interface 330 in FIG. 3 , the content items are shown as an ordered list where the content item with the highest priority score is shown first (e.g., at the top) and other content items with lower priority scores are ordered below.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating an example process 400 for prioritizing published content items based on a user frequency score, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology.
- the blocks in process 400 are shown in a particular order, certain blocks may be executed in different orders or at the same time.
- the process blocks of FIG. 4 are described with reference to the components of the system 200 in FIG. 2 , the blocks are not limited to being performed by these components.
- the request module 205 can receive a request for content items for a user from a client device and store an entry for the request in a request history for the user at block 410 .
- the entry includes date and time information (e.g., a timestamp) that corresponds to when the request was made or received.
- the entry may also include other characteristics of the request for content items such as the webpage requested if one is requested, query parameters for the requested content items, or other characteristics.
- the request history for the user may be stored in a user profile and/or a user database and contain a number of entries that correspond to the user's request for content items.
- the content module 210 can retrieve a set of content items for the user that correspond to the user's request at block 415 .
- the priority module 215 can determine whether there is more than one entry in the request history for the user such that those entries may be used to calculate a user frequency.
- the priority module 215 can calculate a user frequency for the user based on the entries in the request history at block 425 .
- the user frequency score may be a score that indicates how frequently a user interacts with the system 200 , how frequently a service delivers content items to a user, how frequently a user retrieves the content items from a service, or how frequently the user performs another action.
- the priority module 215 can calculate a user frequency score based on the timestamps in the entries stored in the request history.
- the user frequency score may be based on the average number of requests received for a particular period of time (e.g., 6 times a week, 2.3 times a day, 10 times a month).
- only timestamps that occur after a particular date or during the recent past may be used (e.g., for the past year).
- a weighted average that favors more recent timestamps (e.g., timestamps from the past three months) over older timestamps (e.g., timestamps from last year up till three months ago) may be used.
- different user frequency scores may be calculated based on the type of content requested or the characteristics of the interaction with the system 200 . For example, if the request for content items received by the request module 205 is a request for a particular webpage containing content items, the user frequency score may be calculated based on entries in the request history corresponding to requests with the same universal resource locator (URL), requests with a matching component of the URL (e.g., a webpage domain or sub-domain), or requests for a webpage containing similar content items. If the received request for content items is in the form of a query, the user frequency score may be calculated based on entries in the request history corresponding to queries of the same type, queries with similar parameters, or queries of the same content sources.
- URL universal resource locator
- the priority module 215 can calculate a priority score for each content item in the set of content items based on a user frequency for the user and other factors.
- one of the user frequency scores calculated in block 425 may be selected and used to calculate the priority score for each content item.
- multiple user frequency scores may be combined to form a global user frequency score that is used to calculated the priority score for each content item.
- the priority score for each content item is also calculated based on other different signals, factors, or variables associated with the content item.
- the priority module 215 can also calculate an age score and an importance score for the content item.
- the age score is a measurement of the time that elapsed since the content item was created or published and may be calculated based on the difference between the current time and date and the time and date when the content item was created or published.
- the importance score for each content item may be assigned by an administrator or determined based on a number of factors associated with the content item. For example, the system can calculate the importance score based on the topic of the content item or how many users viewed the content item. In the context of social networking content, the importance score can also be calculated based on how many other users share or republish the content item, how many times the content item was socially endorsed (e.g., liked or given a +1 indication) or commented on, the sentiment associated with those social stream items, which may be based on positive or negative words found in the comments, who authored or published the content item (e.g., whether the author of the content item has a relationship with the user), or any other characteristic of the content item.
- the system can calculate the importance score based on the topic of the content item or how many users viewed the content item. In the context of social networking content, the importance score can also be calculated based on how many other users share or republish the content item, how many times the content item was socially endorsed (e.
- additional operations may be performed on one or more of the scores.
- the age scores for the content items, the importance scores for the content items, and/or the user frequency score for the user may be adjusted before being used to calculate the priority score.
- the priority module 215 can calculate a priority score for each of the content items based on those scores.
- the priority score may be calculated such that the higher the frequency score, the more heavily the age score for a content item is weighted or the importance score may be weighted less in calculating the priority score. If the frequency score is lower, the age score may be weighted less or the importance score may be weighted more in calculating the priority score.
- One example calculation may be in the format provided below:
- Priority ⁇ ⁇ Score i ⁇ ( c ) ( f ⁇ ( u ) ) a ⁇ ( c ) Equation ⁇ ⁇ ( 1 )
- i(c) is the importance score of the content item c
- a(c) is the age score of the content item c
- f(u) is the user frequency score for the user u. Accordingly, as the importance score increases, so does the priority score for the content item. As the age score increases and the age of the content item increases the priority score decreases. Furthermore, the age score affects the priority score more as the user frequency score increases.
- Priority ⁇ ⁇ Score i ⁇ ( c ) a ⁇ ( c ) + f ⁇ ( u ) Equation ⁇ ⁇ ( 4 ) In other variations, however, other calculations may be used.
- the delivery module 220 may provide the retrieved content items for display to the user based on the priority scores for the content items. For example, the delivery module 220 arrange the content items in a user interface (e.g., a webpage for display in a browser or application display interface) based on the priority score for each of the content items and transmit the user interface to the user's client device. The content items may be placed in different areas in the user interface or ranked based on their priority scores. In other aspects, the delivery module 220 may transmit a list of prioritized content items to the client device where it may be arranged by a web browser or application on the client device and displayed to the user.
- a user interface e.g., a webpage for display in a browser or application display interface
- the priority module 215 can calculate a priority score for each content item based on other factors without using a frequency score for the user such as the age score and the importance score. Once the priority scores are calculated, the delivery module 220 may provide the prioritized content items to the client device for display to the user. As additional user requests are received by the system 200 , however, eventually, enough entries in the request history may be made such that the priority module 215 may calculate a frequency score for the user and prioritize the content items based on the user's frequency score.

Abstract
Description
where i(c) is the importance score of the content item c, a(c) is the age score of the content item c, and f(u) is the user frequency score for the user u. Accordingly, as the importance score increases, so does the priority score for the content item. As the age score increases and the age of the content item increases the priority score decreases. Furthermore, the age score affects the priority score more as the user frequency score increases.
Priority Score=i(c)−a(c)f(u) Equation (2)
In other variations, however, other calculations may be used.
