Abstract
An encoder/decoder architecture including an arithmetic encoder that encodes the MSB portions of a Factorial Pulse Coder output, and that encodes an output of a first-level source encoder, e.g., MDCT. Sub-parts (e.g., frequency bands) of portions (e.g., frames) of the signal are sorted in increasing order based on a measure related to signal energy (e.g., signal energy itself). In a system that overlays Arithmetic Encoding on Factorial Pulse coding, the result is bits re-allocated to bands with higher signal energy content, yielding higher signal quality and higher bit utilization efficiency.
Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to digital coding and decoding efficiently.
Background technology
Recent two decades comes, and the speed of microprocessor has improved some orders of magnitude, and digital signal processor (DSP) is omnipresent.Carry out the transition to digital communication from analog communication and become practical and attractive.Digital communication provides the main advantage that can utilize bandwidth more efficiently, and allows to use error correcting technique.Therefore, through using digital technology, people can send more information, and send information more reliably through the spectrum space of given distribution.Digital communication can be used radio link (wireless) or physical network medium (for example, optical fiber, copper networks).
Digital communication can be used in dissimilar communication, such as audio frequency, video or remote measurement.Digital communication system comprises transmitting apparatus and receiving equipment.Can carry out in the system of two-way communication, each equipment all has transmission and receiving circuit.In numeral transmission or receiving equipment, there is multistage processing, through these processing, data are transmitted and are sent out between through input unit (for example microphone, camera, transducer) stage of importing and the stage that is used to modulated carrier.Be transfused to and then after the digitlization, some initial noise filtering can be used in (2), is the final chnnel coding in (3) source code and (4) subsequently in (1).The description of in continued page, the present invention being carried out can be considered to belong to the source code stage.
The main purpose of source code is when keeping perceived quality within the possible range, reduces bit rate.To dissimilar media, developed different standards.For example, Joint Photographic Experts Group is applied to still image, and the IS-127 standard application is in audio frequency.As compromise, use the vector length corresponding usually, the even-multiple of perhaps a plurality of DSP register capacitys (for example, 128 bits), design source encoder with the DSP register capacity to practicality.Use for each now, the channel width of distributing is had certain limitation.Based on this restriction, the designer of source encoder/decoder decides the possible code of some with all degrees of freedom of each part of the medium of considering to be encoded.For example, at the given number of the tonepulse that possibly have determined particular frame size (for example, 160 samples long) under the situation of audio coding, in each audio frame, allow and the given number of waiting to be assigned to the total amplitude quantum of pulse.The selection purpose that the designer did is in distributing bandwidth range, the maximization perceived quality.Because each be disperse and quantize, so can enumerate the sum of unique frames.The sum of unique possibility of each frame and the bandwidth of distribution are closely connected, because during the time interval of audio frame, must send enough information with identification and the corresponding unique frames of audio frequency the best in this image duration through channel.The sum of unique frames is big more, and it is many more to discern the needed information of particular frame uniquely.Now, the sum (n) that unique frames possibly occur is not 2 power, i.e. n ≠ 2
k, wherein k is an integer.For example, suppose n<2
k, in this situation,, will always exist near 2 if use the k bit integer to represent each frame
kThe high value integer of certain scope be sent out never.This expression system effectiveness is low, because distributed the k bit, but the k bit is not fully utilized.
United States Patent (USP) NO.7; 230; 550 disclose a kind of through bit codewords more than a group being divided into highest significant position (MSB) part and least significant bit (LSB) part; And make up MSB part and LSB part to reduce this mode of organizing needed total bit size of expression, solve aforementioned inefficient method.Regrettably, if handle a large amount of code words by this way, it possibly need high bandwidth, high fidelity system, and the method for ' 550 patents will be carried out the multiplying of pinpoint accuracy.This is very big aspect amount of calculation, thereby is disadvantageous.
Though above-mentioned exemplary reference audio frequency and frame is discussed; More broadly; Dissimilar medium (for example, image, video, remote measurement and audio frequency) possibly (in whole or in part) have the characteristic of one of n possibility code, and wherein n is integer (possibly select based on bandwidth constraints); But not 2 power, i.e. n ≠ 2
k, wherein, k is an integer.Similarly, in this general situation, also poor efficiency can appear.

Fig. 1 is the block diagram of communication system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.Communication system 100 comprises first communication equipment 102 and N the communication equipment 104 through communication network or reciprocity channel 106 communicative couplings.At least one of communication equipment 102,104 comprises reflector, and at least one of communication equipment 102,104 comprises receiver.Some embodiment supports two-way communication, and in this case, two communication equipments 102,104 all comprise reflector and receiver.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of the reflector 200 of the equipment 102,104 that in communication system shown in Figure 1, uses.Reflector comprises input unit 202, and it can take various forms according to the information type of launching.Under the situation of audio frequency, input unit 202 suitably adopts the form of microphone, and under the situation of video, input unit 202 is suitably taked the form of imageing sensor; And under the situation of remote measurement, input unit can be taked the form of transducer.
A/D 206 is coupled to digital filter 208, and digital filter 208 is used to carry out the other filtering in numeric field.
Digital filter is coupled to first order source encoder 210.For example, first order source encoder 210 can comprise Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP) encoder (it is the type of audio coder), revise the signal coder that discrete cosine transform (MDCT) encoder (it can be applied to many dissimilar signals) perhaps can serve as any kind of precoder or pretreatment stage.Now first order source encoder will be divided into discrete area (such as the audio frame (corresponding to the sample of some) of specifying the duration or the fritter of image) getting into data usually, and whenever next, with these block encodings.(it should be noted that this does not get rid of the differential coding with respect to previous frame or piece.) this point in system, everything is by quantization and discretization, thus for each discrete area, having that limited number is different maybe signal phasor.Based on actual consideration such as the register capacity of the digital signal processor that is used to realize this system (DSP), can discreteization and quantized solution.The discretization of first order source encoder 210 and quantization and other aspects also suitably consider based on perception, perhaps more generally, and based on the demand on signal quality of emission.At the far-end of reflector 200, that is, there is another constraint in the output 228 to channel,, also must consider the maximum channel bandwidth that is.Realize that signal quality is considered and available bandwidth between fine balance will cause usually wherein maybe signal phasor number possibly not be 2 integer power (that is n ≠ 2, just
k, wherein, n be possible signal phasor number, and k is any integer) the design of source encoder 210,212.Under this common situation,, then in system, will exist significantly inefficient if emission k bit codewords is used for one of n possibility signal phasor of each discrete data piece with identification.This poor efficiency will be conspicuous for the those of ordinary skill in information theory field, and the reason of its appearance is because n<2
k, some value of k bit integer (code word) will be sent out never, although all k bits need be sent out.In this case, the k bit codewords of one of n signal phasor representes to be considered to have " non-integer " length.
Refer again to Fig. 2, can find first order source encoder 210 is coupled to factorial pulse coder (FPC) 212.FPC can produce one type the encoder of k bit codewords with expression n bit signal vector.The same with the present invention, in the United States Patent(USP) No. 6,236,960 of authorizing people such as Weimin Peng, early stage factorial pulse coder has been described.Basic FPC comes work through setting up the ordering that institute might signal phasor and the integer code word of the signal specific vector in this ordering of generation sensing.The characteristic of signal specific vector is certain unique combination of non-zero position, amplitude and symbol.Therefore, replace transmitting vector, emission integer code word.The United States Patent (USP) 7 that is entitled as " Apparatus and Method for Low Complexity Combinatorial coding of Signals "; 461; 106 provide the improvement of FPC; It uses the approximation of the composite function of describing in ' 960 patents, to reduce assessing the cost of Code And Decode.In the output of FPC 212, still exist because the described poor efficiency of non-integer preceding text that length codewords causes.Through this paper is provided the successive stages with the reflector of describing, solve inefficient.
According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the code word that receives from FPC is not all to be equal length (for example, k bit long).In this situation, according to a selection, the number that is grouped into the bit of MSB part is fixed, and allows to be grouped into the number of variations of LSB bit partly.Wherein, the application that code word size can change is an audio communication system, and in this system, the source encoder 210 of the first order is encoded to independent voiced band respectively, and for each distributes the bit of different numbers.This is reasonably, because the spectrum energy that different voiced band contains based on frequency range that they covered and/or they, has Different Effects for the audio quality of perception.
Refer again to Fig. 2, can find out, MSB/LSB resolver 214 is coupled to many MSB buffer 216 and many LSB buffer 218.Because LSB partly is fully utilized, therefore simply these LSB are partly linked together.For example, in voice applications,, can the LSB from whole derivation of one group of frequency band partly be linked together an audio frame cycle.Many LSB buffer 218 is coupled to the connector 222 that many LSB are partly linked together.
Refer again to Fig. 2, can find out, arithmetic encoder 220 and connector 222 are coupled to packet assembler 224.Packet assembler 224 is coupled to channel encoder 226, channel encoder 226 is coupled to the output for channel 228 successively.Also can other information such as frequency band energy be offered packet assembler.
Fig. 3 is the block diagram of the receiver 300 of the equipment 102,104 that in communication system shown in Figure 1, uses.Receiving the grouping of sending, channel decoder 304 is coupled to resolver 306 successively by reflector 300 from the input that comes self-channel 302 of being coupled to channel decoder 304.Packet parsing device 306 is coupled to n-LSB register 312 and arithmetic code register 308.Packet parsing device 306 extracts the LSB that connects, and they are delivered to n-LSB register 312.Packet parsing device 306 also extracts arithmetic code, and it is delivered to arithmetic decoder 310.Arithmetic decoder 310 is coupled to n-MSB register 314.Arithmetic decoder 310 reverse codings, and export the sequence of MSB part to n-MSB register 314.At the flow chart of arithmetic decoder shown in Fig. 5 310, and hereinafter is described.
N-LSB register 312 and n-MSB register 314 are coupled to multiplexer 316.Multiplexer 316 is coupled to the FPC register.Multiplexer 316 is related again with LSB with corresponding MSB, and to reformulate complete FPC code word, it is delivered to factorial pulse code register 318.FPC register 318 is coupled to factorial constant-delay discriminator 320 successively.The coding of factorial constant-delay discriminator 320 reconstruct first order source encoders 210 is exported, and it is delivered to first order source decoder 322, first order source decoder 322 reconstruct raw informations (for example, audio frequency, view data).First order source decoder 322 is coupled to digital to analog converter (D/A) 324, digital to analog converter (D/A) 324 is coupled to output device 326 (for example, display, audio tweeter) successively.
Fig. 4 is used for the flow chart of coding by the arithmetic encoder 220 of the MSB part of the code of previous coding device (for example, factorial pulse coder) output.In piece 402, initialization index i, index j, variable x, variable y and variable rl, variable n and variable n-tilda.The variable i that is identified in the MSB part in the MSB partial sequence is initialized as 0, to point to the MSB part in this sequence.The variable j that points to the successive bits in the code word that is produced by arithmetic encoder 310 is initialized as-2 (not using preceding two code bits).The variable x that is illustrated in the position in the arithmetic coding spatial dimension is initialized as 0.The variable y of the variable of readjusting of representing the subrange width is initialized as 2
wConceptive, code space can be considered to scope (0,1], but in practice, code space is represented as scope 0 to 2
wW in fact also is corresponding precision parameter by arithmetic encoder 310 employed arithmetic precision.Though W fixes in the flow chart of Fig. 4-6, optional is for each i symbol W to be set independently.I is initialized as 0 with the running length variable R.N is initialized as G
i Max, and i to be set to its initial value be 0.G
i MaxIt is the maximum of i MSB part.According to the design of first order source encoder 210, the MSB part can have different maximums.For example, be allocated for the coding different frequency bands different bits can cause different G
i MaxValue.N-tilda is initialized as G
i, the actual value of i MSB.
After piece 402, decision block 404 is loop termination standards, and whether its check all MSB parts to be encoded are processed.If the result is (it is pending to mean more MSB parts) negating, then flow chart proceeds to piece 406.First step at piece 406 will calculate the next son range size.The next son range size is by G
iValue (i MSB part) and G
i MaxThe part of the size of the previous subrange that value (maximum of i MSB part) is definite, in this point, G
iValue and G
i MaxValue is represented by n-tilda and n respectively.Calculating the employed formula of this subrange size is:
After to front formula evaluation, i increases progressively, and n and n-tilda are set to G respectively
i MaxAnd G
i
Next, in piece 408, the position in the code space represented by variable x has increased the rounded value with the part of the proportional previous subrange size of the ratio of the new value of n-tilda and n.In other words, G
iApart from G
i MaxNear more, the reposition in code space is high more.Also in piece 408, the subrange size of being represented by variable y now is set to the new value that is set at the variable z that piece 406 calculates.
Next, whether the value of decision block 410 test variable y is less than 2
WIf then flow chart is branched off into piece 412.It should be noted that if the result of decision block 404 is sure, then this flow chart also is branched off into piece 412.
In piece 412, with factor 2, the big or small variable y of expression subrange is readjusted (in binary arithmetic, moving through left dislocation, can reach).And in piece 412, the value of sending variable e is set to equal code space position x divided by 2
WDownward bracket function.Next, consistent with readjusting of y in piece 412, the value of position is re-set as x mod 2 in code space
WTwo times of value.
Next, whether the decision block 414 check value of sending variablees equal 1.If then flow chart proceeds to piece 416, wherein, running length variable rl increases progressively, and then, decision block 410 is got back to by flow chart branch.When the result of decision block 410 whether regularly, decision block 404 is got back to by flow chart branch.
When the result of decision block 414 be negate the time, flow chart is branched off into decision block 418.Whether decision block 418 checks send variate-value greater than 1.If then flow chart proceeds to piece 420.In piece 420, next bit variable nb increases progressively 1, and operation bit variable rb is set to equal 0, and sends variate-value e and successively decrease 2.On the other hand, if the result of decision block 418 negates that then flow chart is branched off into piece 422, in piece 422, moves bit variable rb zero and is set to equal 1.After piece 420 or 422, flow chart arrives piece 424.In piece 424, the variable j that points to continuous code bit increases progressively 1, the j code bit V
jBe set to equal next bit variable nb, and the nb variable is set to equal to send variable e.
Next, whether decision block 426 check running length variable rl are greater than 0.If then the flow chart execution block 428, in piece 428, variable j increases progressively, j code bit V
jBe configured to equal to move bit variable rb, and the running length variable successively decreases.After each execution block 428, flow chart loops is got back to piece 426.When the result of piece 426 for not the time, flow chart is jumped out this circulation, and arrives decision block 430.
Whether decision block 430 checks i=M,, in the sequence of the MSB part that is encoded, whether has the MSB part of any remainder that is.If it is pending to remain more MSB parts, then flow chart loops is got back to decision block 410, and continues to carry out aforesaid flow process.When in piece 430, confirming that more MSB parts are not pending, then flow chart is branched off into decision block 432.Whether decision block 432 test variable j wait L, the length of L indication arithmetic code.If not, then flow chart carries out 434, in 434, and j code bit V
jBe set to equal 1, and j increases progressively 1.From piece 434, flow chart loops is got back to decision block 432.As the result of piece 434 when being sure, arithmetic code is complete, and flow chart stops.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart of arithmetic decoder 310, and arithmetic decoder 310 is used to the MSB part of decoding by the code of another encoder (for example, factorial pulse coder) generation.In piece 502, the index i that quotes decoded continuous symbol is initialized as 0 (to point to first symbol); The integer j that points to continuous code bit is initialized as 0 (to point to first code bit); The variable x that specifies in the position in the arithmetic code space is initialized as 0 (x will be increased based on the code place value); The variable y that specifies in the interval width in the code space is initialized as 1, and variable n is set to equal G
i MaxPiece 504 is decision blocks, and its result depends on that whether y is less than 2
WW is by decoder 310 employed fixed precision.When initial, the result of decision block 504 will be for negating, thereby flow chart will be branched off into decision block 506, and whether its test variable j is less than the regular length parameter L.The length of L indication arithmetic code.When initial, the result of decision block will be sure (j < L), thereby flow chart will be branched off into piece 508.In piece 508, x's is on duty with 2 (position moves to left), and increases the value of code bit.(it should be noted that when initial, x is arranged to the value of code bit simply, because x is initialized to 0.After handling all code bits, when the result of piece 506 becomes when negative, flow chart is branched off into piece 510, and wherein, x multiply by 2 (and not increasing code bit) simply.After piece 508 or piece 510, flow chart arrives piece 512, and wherein, y multiply by 2.Whether after piece 512, flow chart loops is got back to piece 504, to check y less than 2 once more
WHandling all code bits, and after possibly in 510, the move to left x and the y that further in 512, moves to left, when confirming that in piece 504 y surpasses 2
WThe time, flow chart is branched off into piece 514.In piece 514, variable n-tilda (temporary variable that is used for coded identification) is set to equate with the downward bracket function of (2xn+n-1)/2y.In piece 516,, the variable z of the width in the interim storage code space is set according to the above-mentioned equality that is used for z that provides.
Also in piece 516, G
i, i code word is configured to equate with n-tilda; Index i increase progressively 1 and variable n be configured to and i G
i MaxValue equates.In piece 518, variable x is set to successively decrease-removed basically because the part of " highly " (position) in code space that previous code bit causes with the value of round (y*n-tilda/n).Also in piece 518, the variable y that is illustrated in the interval in the code space is re-set as z, the interval in the code space that z representes to be selected by previous code bit.Whether decision block 520 check i still equal M, that is, whether all symbols are decoded.If then flow chart returns piece 504 not.On the other hand, if all symbols are resumed, then flow chart stops.
Recall about the description to encoder in conjunction with preceding text, having illustrated the arithmetic code word is the L bit long.In theory, for the MSB that representes number M, scope up to G
i MaxG
i, L is set makes 2
LSurpass G
i MaxAmassing of the sequence of value should be enough.In the practice, when using limited precision arithmetic to carry out arithmetic coding, (for example, use processor register), for the increase in demand of additional code position such as 32 bit widths.Through following equality, the loose border (over-evaluating) that provides the arithmetic coding that is used for a plurality of additional code position (LBAC).
In fact the number that it should be noted that the extra bits that had before provided is worth and possibly in this case, only needs an extra bits less than 1.It shall yet further be noted that can be incrementally to the previous equations evaluation, that is, and and for being less than M G
i MaxThe local sequence of value.
The process of the minimum subrange through recursively selecting code space can be confirmed the strict border (more accurate) of arithmetic coding, the minimum subrange of choice of location code space that can be through each symbol in the conventional letter sequence.The size of minimum subrange and the G that is used for each i character position
i MaxRelevant.Fig. 6 shows the flow chart of the process that is used for definite TBAC.In piece 602, will point to continuous maximum MSB and partly be worth G
i MaxVariable i be initialized as 0; Y is initialized as 2 with code space subrange width variable
W, wherein, W is a precision parameter; The variable k that readjusts (moving to left) number that calculates y is initialized as 0; Will be at log
2In the territory with G
i MaxThe long-pending variable s of value is initialized as 0; And will be used to store G
i MaxThe temporary variable n of value is initialized as the 0th G
i MaxValue G
0 Max
(M the is individual) G whether decision block 604 check is treated last
i MaxValue.MSB for being less than full sequence partly is worth, and can carry out the TBAC flow chart, in this case, and the sum that the M in the piece 604 will partly be worth less than MSB.If i still is not equal to M, then flow chart advances to piece 606, and in piece 606, the temporary variable z of representative code spatial sub scope width is configured to equal and can be assigned to i symbol G according to its value
iThe minimum subrange width of all subrange width.As following in the expression formula of the z shown in the flow chart:
In fact, z and n (G can be shown
i Max) reverse relevant, and equal:
And in piece 606, s increases progressively log2 (n); I increases progressively 1, and n is set to G
i MaxNew value.In piece 608, y is set to equal z.Next, whether decision block 610 check y are less than 2
WIf then flow chart loops multiply by 2 (y moves to left) at piece 612 with y, and makes k increase progressively 1 through piece 612.When confirming that in piece 610 y is not less than 2
WThe time, then flow chart loops is returned decision block 604.When in piece 604, confirming i=M, flow chart advances to piece 614, and the number η of the code bit of extra needs is set to equal k+w-s-log
2(y).
Fig. 7 is a kind of flow chart of audio coder efficiently, and it uses factorial pulse code and arithmetic coding combination, with the sequence of frequency bands coding of the measurement storage that basis is relevant with spectrum energy.This method allows to use arithmetic coding that the FPC code word with non-integer length is encoded efficiently, simultaneously, supports to be redistributed to from the bit that original allocation is saved the distribution again of other frequency bands.Though, it should be noted that this processor be equally applicable to encode information of other types with reference to the voiced band among Fig. 7.In other are used, can use another type signal energy, replace spectrum energy.
In piece 704, call the self-contained process (not shown) and distribute so that sequence of frequency bands is carried out bits of original.(in this point, putative signal has been transformed into frequency domain, and frequency coefficient has been separated into a plurality of frequency bands.) can use the known procedure that is used for Bit Allocation in Discrete to frequency band." Optimum Bit Allocation and Decomposition for High Quality Audio Coding " (icassp at X, Wei, M.Shaw, M.Varley; Vol.1, pp.315,1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics; Speech; And Signal Processing (among ICASSP ' the 97) – Volume 1,1997, has described a kind of such known method.The bit number that is dispensed to frequency band possibly be the function of energy in the frequency band.In the situation of other types information (for example, image, video, remote measurement), (similar with audio frame) part will be subdivided into subdivision (for example, the division of frequency band or other types).
In piece 706,, frequency band is sorted again (classification) according to the measurement relevant with spectrum energy.This measurement can be a spectrum energy itself.Alternatively, the Weighted spectral energy can multiply by the pre-programmed weight that is associated with this frequency band through the spectrum energy that will be used for each frequency band and reaches.Frequency band rearrangement is had certain advantage, so as will to have frequency band than the low frequency spectrum energy be arranged on the ordering beginning near.The result of this ordering is that bit trends towards being redistributed into the frequency band with higher-energy content, forms the higher fidelity to the expression of this frequency band.
This circulation is repeated for each j frequency band (according to new ordering, being got in order) in the top of piece 708 mark cycle.In piece 710, calculating can be encoded into the number of unit magnitude pulsed quantity that is illustrated in j the frequency spectrum in the frequency band.The number of supposing the pulse quantum is set at integer value m, through use enumerate might pulse configuration equality calculate this number.In the factorial coding pulse multiple, the number N of possible pulse configuration equals the highest code value.With the equality (15) of the United States Patent(USP) No. 6,236,960 of co-assigned of the present invention in provided such equality, and instructed factorial pulse code method.The equality (15) of ' 960 patents is clearly write out as follows:
Wherein, n is the number of the frequency window in j frequency band;
M is the number of pulse quantum;
I is the summation index;
Paper " Low Complexity Factorial Pulse Coding Of MD CT Coefficients Using Approximation Of Combinatorial Functions " at Udar Mittal, James P.Ashley and Edgardo M.Cruz-Zeno; ICASSP, the equality (21) in 2007 have provided from more advanced, the similar equality of the factorial pulse code of calculating strength type still less.No matter use these which or similar equality, need not reverse, obtaining m according to N, but can use the look-up table of calculated value or use rooting method, find the solution them such as bisection method to them.These equalities are not continuous, therefore, in finding the solution their process, in this context, seek to produce the m value of N value, and this N value is by the maximum less than the N that equality produced of the Bit Allocation in Discrete of j the frequency band that is used for discussing.Log
2(N) value is to be used for the feasible bit number that bits of original is distributed.Therefore, will there be some additional bits number usually in the Bit Allocation in Discrete that is used for allocated frequency band.The piece 712 of the back one side reference flow sheet of this solution procedure.
If based on the energy measurement in the frequency band with Bit Allocation in Discrete to frequency band, so, corresponding to the number m of the pulse quantum of the bit number that is allocated for frequency band also with frequency band in energy relevant.This is following situation: can promptly based on pulsed quantity subnumber order m, with the frequency band rearrangement, replace based on frequency band energy frequency band being resequenced based on tolerance.A selection is based on m itself frequency band is resequenced.These frequency bands can be resequenced according to the ascending order of m.Do like this and mean that bit trends towards being redistributed into the have higher-energy frequency band of (more information content).Another selection be with based on tolerance log
2(N (n, m+1))-log
2(N (n, m)) rearrangement, wherein, N and m are as defined in the equality formerly.This tolerance quantized fractional bits how with pulse quantum m increased by 1 increase relatedly.If use the tolerance of back,, can arrange frequency band again with descending based on this tolerance.This result who arranges again is; Usually the bit of tremendous amount (all numbers) will be reassigned to the frequency band with high m value (high-energy) from the frequency band with low m value (low-yield); If these bits than they are used for they from frequency band; For improving admissible m value, will have more significant effect.
In piece 714, the highest significant position (MSB) that is chosen in the highest code value N that obtains in the piece 712 is partly (with G
i MaxExpression).(it should be noted that band index becomes j from i, with avoid with equality formerly in the summation index obscure mutually.) (according to some embodiment of the present invention, the length that is used for the MSB part of all frequency bands is fixed as the bit of predetermined number.If do like this, be less than or equal in the situation of bit of predetermined number at the whole bit length of N, then whole value N is regarded as the MSB that is used for special frequency band).
In piece 716, call subprocess, whether will surpass the added bit of original allocation to confirm arithmetic coding up to the MSB of this frequency band.The subprocess of indication carries out evaluation to above-mentioned LBAC or TBAC here, in the latter's situation, describes with reference to figure 6.Whether decision block 718 checks need added bit.If the extra bits of confirming through arithmetic coding efficient outnumber use the factorial pulse code enumerate formula set up the number of pulse quantum m after the number of extra bits of remainder, then will need added bit.If in piece 718, need to confirm added bit, then flow chart is branched off into piece 720, and piece 720 resets to m than low value.For example, can be with fixed amount or based on the expression formula of the number of the extra bits that relates to m and the needs m that successively decreases.After m is successively decreased, in piece 722, recomputate the highest code value N, and select MSB part G
i MaxWhether after piece 722, flow chart loops is got back to piece 716, recomputating arithmetic coding efficient, and reexamine arithmetic coding and drop in the distribution up to the needed total bit number of the MSB of j frequency band.When the result of decision block 718 be negate the time, meaning does not need added bit, and need not adjust the number of pulse quantum, flow chart is branched off into piece 724, in piece 724, exceed the quata (residue) bit remaining from allocation is assigned to other frequency bands.The Bit Allocation in Discrete that will exceed the quata can change for the mode of other frequency bands.A kind of method is between remaining frequency band, to divide bit equably.Another kind method is that skewness distributes, thereby the more terminal frequency band of ordering of multiple spectra energy receives relative more bits near containing more.
In piece 726, calculate factorial pulse code code word, with the expression frequency band.Paper " Low Complexity Factorial Pulse Coding Of MDCT Coefficients Using Approximation Of Combinatorial Functions " according to ' 960 patents or aforesaid Udar Mittal, James P.Ashley and Edgardo M.Cruz-Zeno; ICASSP; 2007 instruction can realize this point.In piece 728, select the MSB of code word, and in piece 730, call the arithmetic encoder subprocess, represent MSB to start (situation that perhaps after first carries out, continues execution block 730) generation arithmetic code.Can use the arithmetic encoder of describing with reference to figure 4.Therefore, will incrementally be carried out, because produce each new MSB (G by the process shown in Fig. 7 in the process shown in Fig. 4
i) value.In piece 732, the least significant bit (LSB) of FPC code word is outputed to connector.
Whether decision block 734 check remains more multiband will be handled.If then in piece 736, this process is incremented to the sequential frequency band in the ordering, and flow chart loops returns piece 710, to begin to handle next frequency band.When confirming that in piece 734 all frequency bands have been processed, flow chart is branched off into piece 738, in piece 738, spectrum energy and/or other information of frequency band is outputed to packet assembler.
Following example shows under the condition of frequency band being resequenced and frequency band not being resequenced, and between frequency band, carries out the bit reallocation.At first supposition is not resequenced to frequency band, and respectively to j and j+1 bandwidth assignment 24.0 and 20.5 bits.In addition, suppose that for j and j+1 frequency band, frequency bandwidth (number of position) is fixed on n=20.For j frequency band, can confirm that to distribute the maximum number m of the pulse quantum that can use in 24.0 be 6 keeping below bits of original, and 6 the needed bit numbers of pulse quantum of in j frequency band, encoding are log
2(N (20,6))=22.48 bits.In this example, m=6 is with log
2(N (n, m)) remains on the maximum integer under the bit budget of 24 bits; Increase a pulse quantum m=7 and will need log
2(N (20,7))=25.02 bits.Now, move to J+1 frequency band through the bit residue with the 24.0-22.48=1.52 bit, the bit budget that we will be used for j+1 frequency band is increased to the 20.5+1.52=22.02 bit.The process of number m that is used for the pulse quantum of j+1 frequency band in calculating, we find that we can use log
2(N (20,5))=19.72 bits are encoded to m=5 pulse.
In this point, we can easily observe 2 points.At first, the redistributing of 1.52 bits from j to a j+1 frequency band do not have good effect.That is, the bit of interpolation does not allow in j+1 frequency band, to increase the number m of pulse quantum.Secondly, suppose that j+1 frequency band is the last frequency band in sequence of frequency bands, so, bit residue (22.02 – 19.72=2.30 bit) can be wasted.
Now, let us is considered wherein to exist based on certain function of frequency band energy frequency band is resequenced according to embodiments of the invention.If we suppose that j is the last frequency band in sequence of frequency bands with j+1 frequency band; And the monotone increasing function based on frequency band energy is classified; And we suppose multiband more is assigned to have the more frequency band of multipotency; Then, we suppose that these frequency bands will contain the bit of maximum number.For example, suppose that the bit that is assigned to these frequency bands is respectively 60.5 and 64.0 bits.As formerly in the example, let as assume that frequency bandwidth is fixed on n=20.For j frequency band, can confirm, can the maximum number m of pulse quantum be confirmed as m=33, and 33 the needed bit numbers of pulse quantum of encoding are log
2(N (20,33))=59.80.Bit residue through with the 60.5-59.80=0.70 bit is re-assigned to j+1 frequency band, and the bit budget that we will be used for this frequency band is increased to the 64.0+0.70=64.70 bit.Be used for the number process of the pulse quantum of j+1 frequency band in calculating, we find that we can use log
2The pulse of (N (20,39))=64.18 bits of encoded m=39.In this case, opposite with previous situation, the bit that adds second frequency band to allows m to increase really, thereby to rising to effect on the signal quality.
Generally speaking, be such situation: along with bit number increases, the needed bit number of the other pulse quantum of encoding reduces.Therefore, when the rearrangement that combines based on certain function of energy, the problem of redistributing of remaining bits is eased; In addition; The waste bit of coding after all frequency bands possibly become lower because in the frequency band of higher-energy, the cost of every pulse quantum is lower.
In the above-described embodiments, the real allocated of the frequency band that in the rearrangement sequence, is used at first handling trends towards being less than the original allocation of carrying out at piece 704, and in rearrangement, bit is redistributed to the frequency band that is in the back.And according to above-mentioned piece 710-712, the number of pulse quantum is set to maximum, m needed bit number log of pulse quantum of feasible coding
2(N) be less than original allocation.According to optional embodiment, can put upside down the order of frequency band rearrangement, make to have higher-energy or higher pulsed quantity subnumber order or than low metric log
2(N (m+1))-log
2It is the first that the frequency band of (N (m)) occupy.In this embodiment, not to find out to make that corresponding N is the m value that is lower than the maximum feasible number of bits of original distribution, makes corresponding log but find out
2(N) value is distributed (the minimum value log that for example, distributes greater than bits of original greater than bits of original
2The m value of (N (m)).For such embodiment, this log
2(N) but value will be the line number of bit.In these embodiment, not with the bit distribution that exceeds the quata frequency band after leaning in the ordering, but can the frequency band of bit after ordering, leaning on be taken out, to remedy at log
2Poor (residual error) between (N (m)) value and bits of original are distributed.The rearrangement of carrying out in certain embodiments is based on priority, but can be the order so that priority rises or priority descends.
The spectrum energy of frequency band and/or other information are (for example; The frequency band weight) will be sent to receiver; Make ordering and the Bit Allocation in Discrete that the decoder of receiver can reconstruct be carried out by encoder, thus decoder its coded message that receives of decipher rightly.Receiver is with execution block 702-724, to obtain G
i MaxValue.Then, receiver uses G
i MaxValue and the G that receives through channel
jValue carry out preceding text with reference to figure 5 described arithmetic decodings, to obtain the MSB of FPC code word again, then, it is recombined into a sequence that is connected with LSB from transmitter receipt.Then, decoding FPC code word is with reconstruct band spectrum Energy distribution.
