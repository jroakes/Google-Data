Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to wireless communications, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for carrier frequency synchronization between a transmitter, implemented at an apparatus such as a base station, and a receiver, implemented at another apparatus, such as a femtocell or user equipment (UE).
- a transmitter implemented at an apparatus such as a base station
- a receiver implemented at another apparatus, such as a femtocell or user equipment (UE).
- UE user equipment
- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is a digital modulation technique that divides the available bandwidth into a large number of closely-spaced (or narrow band) orthogonal sub-carriers.
- Each sub-carrier is modulated individually using a conventional digital modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)) at a low symbol rate (i.e., where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics).
- QAM quadrature amplitude modulation
- QPSK quadrature phase-shift keying
- CP cyclic prefix
- a modulated bit stream can then be communicated over a communication channel on individual orthogonal subcarriers as sequence of OFDM/OFDMA symbols, and the CP allows intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation to be reduced or eliminated.
- OFDM supports only one user on a channel (i.e., the group of evenly spaced subcarriers) at any given time.
- OFDM can be combined with multiple access using time, frequency, or coding separation of the users to provide multi-user channel access.
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
- OFDM/OFDMA are used in various existing and upcoming communication standards including IEEE 802.1 In, IEEE 802.16d, the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile communication standard, and DVB-T/H.
- any OFDM-based communication system requires very accurate time and frequency synchronization between the receiver (e.g., at user equipment) and the transmitter (e.g., at a base station or access point).

Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary, or the following detailed description.
- the embodiments reside primarily in methods and apparatus are for synchronizing a wireless receiver with a transmitter.
- the wireless receiver can be implemented in user equipment or a femtocell
- the transmitter can be implemented in a femtocell or a base station.
- methods are provided for frequency synchronizing the wireless receiver with a base station.
- FCFO Fractional Carrier Frequency Offset
- P-SCH Primary Synchronization Channel
- CAZAC constant amplitude zero auto-correlation
- the wireless receiver receives a signal that includes the OFDM/OFDMA symbol.
- the OFDM/OFDMA symbol includes a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) sequence that is generated based on a constant amplitude zero auto-correlation (CAZAC) sequence.
- the original transmitted time-domain P-SCH sequence is generated based on a frequency-domain Zadoff-Chu sequence mapped to sub-carriers.
- the original transmitted time-domain P-SCH sequence of a transmitted OFDM/OFDMA symbol has a first-half and a second-half.
- the received time-domain OFDM/OFDMA symbol has a received time-domain P-SCH sequence with a first- half and a second-half.
- the estimated FCFO value provides an estimate of the FCFO between the wireless receiver and the transmitter.
- the wireless receiver generates an estimated FCFO value by computing a differential phase of a cross-correlation between a first-half of the received time-domain OFDM/OFDMA symbol and a second-half of the received time-domain OFDM/OFDMA symbol. Using this approach, the estimated FCFO value can be estimated to within +/- one sub-carrier spacing.
- the wireless receiver computes a first cross-correlation between the first-half of the received time-domain P-SCH sequence and the first-half of the original transmitted time-domain P-SCH sequence, determines a complex conjugate of the first cross-correlation, and computes a second cross-correlation between the second-half of the received time-domain P-SCH sequence and the second-half of the original transmitted time-domain P-SCH sequence.
- the wireless receiver then computes a product of the complex conjugate of the first cross-correlation and the second cross-correlation to generate a value, computes a complex phase angle of the value, and scales the complex phase angle via a scaling factor to generate the estimated FCFO value.
- the wireless receiver generates a compensation signal based on the estimated FCFO value, and applies the compensation signal to the received time- domain OFDM/OFDMA symbol to generate a compensated received time-domain OFDM/OFDM A symbol.
- the compensated received time-domain OFDM/OFDMA symbol can then be transformed from the time-domain to the frequency-domain to generate a frequency-domain symbol that can be used to generate an estimated integer carrier frequency offset (ICFO) value.
- ICFO integer carrier frequency offset
- the estimated ICFO value estimates an integer part of a carrier frequency offset to within an integer number of sub-carrier spacings that a carrier frequency of the wireless receiver is offset from that of the transmitter.
- the wireless receiver generates the estimated ICFO value by determining a maximum absolute value of a correlation between a received frequency-domain P-SCH sequence and a complex conjugate of a frequency shifted version of the original transmitted frequency-domain P-SCH sequence to compute the estimated ICFO value. For example, the wireless receiver can correlate, over a possible range of ICFO values as a shift value of the ICFO is varied, samples of the received frequency-domain P-SCH sequence against corresponding samples of a complex conjugate of the frequency shifted version of the original transmitted frequency-domain P-SCH sequence to generate correlation values, and then determine a maximum absolute value of the correlation values to generate the estimated ICFO value.
- the estimated FCFO value and the estimated ICFO value can be added to generate a total estimated CFO value that provides an estimate of the CFO between the wireless receiver and a transmitter that transmitted the signal.
- the total estimated CFO value can then be used to adjust a reference frequency of a digital output signal generated by an oscillator.
- a digital baseband signal can then be multiplied by the digital output signal to adjust the frequency of the digital baseband signal to the reference frequency to correct for CFO between the receiver and the transmitter
- FCFO estimates are accurate over a large range, and can be estimated using a single OFDM/OFDMA symbol. The greatly improves processing efficiency in comparison to conventional methods used to estimate FCFO.
- the disclosed methods and apparatus for computing estimated FCFO are not sensitive to fading channel timing selectivity and multipath delay.

- a description of LTE downlink radio frame structures will be provided with reference to FIGS. 2A and 2B, and a description of a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) used in that downlink radio frame structure will be provided with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4.
- P-SCH primary synchronization channel
- LTE Downlink Radio Frame Structure Per the 3GPP LTE specification, downlink transmissions are organized into radio frames. Each radio frame is 10 ms in duration.
- the LTE specifications define two radio frame structures: frame structure type 1, which uses both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD), and frame structure type 2, which uses TDD.
- FIG. 2A illustrates a radio frame structure type 1 200 for a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) implementation.
- radio frame structure type 1 is used for the downlink and is optimized to co-exist with 3.84 Mcps UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) systems.
- UTRA 3.84 Mcps UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access
- LTE frame structure type 1 downlink transmission is partitioned into units of radio frames 200 each having a predetermined duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds
- Each radio frame 200 is partitioned into 10 subframes (1 10), and each subframe
- each downlink radio frame 200 includes 20 slots.
- Each slot includes a number of OFDM/OFDMA symbols in the time-domain, and each OFDM/OFDMA symbol in that slot is preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP).
- the number of OFDM/OFDMA symbols in each slot varies depending on whether the base station is operating in a "normal" or "extended” cyclic prefix (CP) mode.
- CP cyclic prefix
- a CP is a guard interval that is prefixed to a symbol that is a repetition of the end of that symbol.
- the CP extends the symbol so that is separated from adjacent symbols. Within the CP, it is possible to have distortion for the preceding symbol.
- the CP is of sufficient duration (e.g., the duration is greater than the maximum channel delay), then preceding symbol will not spill over into the current symbol, and inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multi-path delay can be reduced/eliminated.
- ISI inter-symbol interference
- the length of the CP must be at least equal to the anticipated length of the multipath channel.
- normal and extended CP modes can be used in different radio environments depending on the expected multipath delays.
- the CP mode that is set varies depending on different coverage areas, channel conditions, or any other performance affecting variables.
- the LTE specification suggests a long or extended CP mode, and for less reliable communication links a short or normal CP mode can be used.
- the number of OFDM/OFDMA symbols in each slot varies depending on a CP mode that is implemented. In the long or extended CP mode each slot has six (6) OFDM/OFDMA symbols, whereas each slot has seven (7) OFDM/OFDMA symbols in short or normal CP mode. For instance, FIG.
- each slot 230 includes seven symbols (and therefore each sub-frame/TTI consists of 14 symbols).
- each slot 240 consists of 6 symbols (and therefore each sub-frame/TTI consists of 12 symbols).
- orthogonality is achieved by making the symbol length equal to the reciprocal of the sub-carrier spacing ( ⁇ ), which is 15 kHz, which means that the symbol length is 66.7 ⁇ .
- Each downlink slot corresponds to a time-frequency resource grid.
- FIG. 2B depicts an example of a downlink slot 230 (in normal CP mode) and its corresponding time- frequency resource grid of subcarriers and OFDM/OFDMA symbols.
- Data that are to be transmitted are mapped to basic elementary units called resource elements.
- Each resource element is a modulation symbol that is uniquely identified by a transmit antenna, a sub- carrier position, and the OFDM/OFDMA symbol index within a radio frame.
- Each resource element can be used to send one modulation symbol, which may be a real or complex-valued.
- a resource element may cover one subcarrier in one symbol period and is the smallest time- frequency unit for downlink transmission. As illustrated in FIG.
- the available time frequency resources may be partitioned into resource blocks.
- a resource block is defined as N ⁇ din b consecutive OFDM/OFDMA symbols in the time-domain and consecutive subcarriers in the frequency-domain.
- a resource block consists of N ⁇ b x
- N w resource elements corresponding to one slot in the time-domain and 180 kHz in the frequency-domain.
- a RB includes a group of 12 contiguous sub- carriers in frequency and one slot in time forms a resource block (RB) (i.e., each resource block may cover 12 subcarriers in one slot). Stated differently, a RB spans 12 consecutive sub-carriers at a sub-carrier spacing of 15 kHz, and 7 consecutive symbols over a slot duration of 0.5 ms. (Although not illustrated in FIG.
- a CP is appended to each symbol as a guard interval.
- a RB has 84 resource elements (12 sub-carriers x 7 symbols) corresponding to one slot in the time-domain and 180 kHz (12 sub-carriers x 15 kHz spacing) in the frequency-domain.
- the size of a RB is the same for all bandwidths, therefore, the number of available physical RBs depends on the transmission bandwidth. In the frequency-domain, the number of available RBs can range from 6 (when transmission bandwidth is 1.4 MHz) to 100 (when transmission bandwidth is 20 MHz).
- a UE seeking to access a cell performs a cell search procedure that allows the UE to identify different types of information including: symbol and radio frame timing, frequency, cell identification, overall transmission bandwidth, antenna configuration, and cyclic prefix length.
- Synchronization signals are used during cell search to perform a series of synchronization stages that allow the UE to determine time and frequency parameters that are necessary to demodulate the downlink signals and to transmit uplink signals with the correct timing.
- PSS Primary Synchronization Signal
- SSS Secondary Synchronization Signal
- P-SCH primary synchronization channel
- S-SCH secondary synchronization channel
- the SSS 210/212 and PSS 220/222 are downlink physical signals that are transmitted or broadcast two times per radio frame. Specifically, the SSS 210/212 and PSS 220/222 are both periodically transmitted once every 5 ms using the last two OFDM/OFDMA symbols of the first slot of the first sub-frame (sub-frame index 0) and in the last two OFDM/OFDMA symbols of the first slot of the sixth sub-frame (sub- frame index 5). In one implementation, applicable to an FDD cell, the SSS is located in the symbol immediately preceding the PSS.
- the 3GPP standard specifies use of multiple (three) P-SCH signals to support the OFDM/OFDMA symbol timing synchronization at the UE.
- the three P-SCH signals are tied to the cell identities within a cell identity group.
- Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation (CAZAC) sequence is a periodic complex-valued mathematical sequence with modulus one and out-of-phase periodic (cyclic) autocorrelation equal to zero.
- CAZAC sequences include: Chu sequences, Frank-Zadoff sequences, and Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences.
- Zadoff-Chu sequences (ZCS) also known as Generalized Chirp-Like (GCL) sequences
- GCL Generalized Chirp-Like
- the circular cross- correlation between two ZCSs is low with constant magnitude for prime number lengths.
- a ZCS also exhibits zero or nearly zero circular autocorrelation meaning that the correlation with the circularly shifted version of itself is a delta function.
- the average and peak values of the cross-correlation are low relative to the autocorrelation, and therefore any residual cross- correlation signal can be considered as white noise with low variance.
- This nearly ideal cyclic autocorrelation property is important when the received signal is correlated with a reference sequence and the received reference sequences are misaligned.
- cyclically-shifted versions of the ZCS remain orthogonal to one another.
- ZCSs also have a low-frequency offset sensitivity, which can be defined as the ratio of the maximum undesired autocorrelation peak in the time-domain to the desired correlation peak computed at a certain frequency offset.
- the flat frequency-domain autocorrelation property and low frequency offset sensitivity allows for the PSS to be easily detected during the initial synchronization (e.g., PSS detection with a frequency offset up to ⁇ 7.5 kHz).
- ZCSs are used to define the PSS and P-SCH as will now be described with reference to FIG. 3.
- the P-SCH signals are OFDM signals with up to 72 active subcarriers, centered around the DC subcarrier.
- FIG. 3 is diagram 300 that schematically illustrates a mapping of an example Zadoff-Chu sequence (ZCS) dge(n) to available subcarriers in the frequency-domain used in accordance with some of the disclosed embodiments. This mapping is used to generate a primary synchronization signal (PSS) sequence that is modulated according to the ZCS, and eventually transmitted as the P-SCH twice in each downlink radio frame.
- ZCS Zadoff-Chu sequence
- the P-SCH occupies 62 center sub-carriers located symmetrically around a DC sub-carrier (sub-carrier index of zero) that is left unused to avoid transmitting on the DC-subcarrier.
- the last five resource elements (not shown) at each extremity of each synchronization sequence (-36, -35, -34, -33, -32, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) are not used and therefore not illustrated in FIG. 3.
- This structure enables the UE to detect the PSS using a size-64 FFT and a lower sampling rate than would be necessary if all 72 subcarriers in the central resource block were used.
- a generated ZCS that has not been shifted is known as a "root sequence.”
- three ZCSs are generated that correspond to a particular root sequence index (u) of the ZCS sequence.
- the Zadoff-Chu root sequence indices ( u ) are specified in Table 1 , which shows a cell-identity group ( N ) in the first column, and a corresponding Zadoff-Chu root sequence index (u) that can be used for the P-SCH signal in the second column.
- the frequency- domain ZCS that is used to generate the primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) signal can be specified according to equation (1) as follows:
- the sequence length (Nzc) of the ZCS is 63
- n is an index that ranges from 0 to 61 or (between 0 and N zc .-1)
- the three ZCSs that are generated are of length 62 and are orthogonal to each other.
- a k l is a resource element (k,l)
- k is sub-carrier index corresponding to one subcarrier (k) that ranges from -31 to +30

- the sequence indices n -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 are reserved and not used for generation of the P-SCH signals.
- the three resulting P-SCH signals are tied to the cell identities (V / z>) 0, 1 , or 2 within a cell identity group.
- the BS selects one of the three primary synchronization sequences (PSSs) that is linked to a particular sector or cell identifier, and can transmit the selected PSS in the P-SCH.
- PSSs primary synchronization sequences

- the horizontal axis represents the time delay index, which ranges between 0 and 1023, and represents the 1024 possible unique offsets between two copies of the same sequence of 1024 values.
- the time delay index is a delayed sampling number (or end-around shift number) needed for autocorrelation for N equal to 1024.
- FIG. 4 demonstrates that the sequences used to generate the P-SCH signals (e.g., generated through mapping illustrated in FIG. 3) have very good/strong periodic autocorrelation properties as the peak autocorrelation values are located near the extreme time delay indices of 0 and 1024. As will be described below, these strong periodic autocorrelation properties help cancel or reduce the impact of multipath interference when estimating FCFO thus improving the accuracy of the FCFO estimate.
