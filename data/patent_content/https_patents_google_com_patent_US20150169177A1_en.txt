- the system determines a visual similarity score for each of the images in the particular web page, which may be referred to as “page images”, with reference to the thumbnail images ( 306 ).
- the system determines whether the thumbnail images are visually similar to each other. In these implementations, if the thumbnail images are not determined to be visually similar to each other, the system determines a visual similarity score for the page image such that the page image will not be identified as a primary image, or simply ends the process for identifying a primary image with respect to the current page image.
- Visual similarity between two images can be determined using conventional image analysis techniques, e.g., by detecting and comparing edges in a first and second image or by keypoint matching one or more regions in a first and second image.
- Visual similarity between two images can be measured using a numeric similarity value, as determined by a similarity function.
- the similarity value can range from 0.0 to 1.0, where a value of 0.0 indicates that the images are very different, and a value 1.0 indicates that the images are identical. Other ranges of values can also be used.

- the thumbnail images are required to include no pair of images with a similarity value that is less than a predetermined threshold, e.g., 0.90, 0.95, or 0.98 on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.
- the threshold value which determines whether the system considers two images to be similar or not, can be determined empirically based on evaluations by human raters.
- all but a predetermined small percentage, e.g., 10%, 5%, or 1%, of the thumbnail images must be identical or within a threshold similarity of each other.
- the system determines that two thumbnails are visually similar only if the image tags reference the same resource.
- the system determines a visual similarity score for the page image with reference to the thumbnail images.
- the system can determine a visual similarity score for the image from a similarity value representing the similarity of the page image and one of the visually similar thumbnail images.
- the system determines a visual similarity score for the page image by determining a respective similarity value for the page image and each of the thumbnail images, which represents the similarity of the pair of images to each other, and using those similarity values to determine the visual similarity score for the page image.
- the median value of the similarity values, a geometric, arithmetic, or harmonic mean of the similarity values, a lowest similarity value of the similarity values, or other statistic derived from the similarity values can be selected as the visual similarity score for the image.
- the system identifies a page image, if there is one, having a highest visual similarity score that also satisfies a minimum similarity threshold ( 308 ).
- the system labels the page image, if there is one, as a primary image for the web page ( 310 ).
- images identified as primary images are labeled as such in an index, e.g., the index 200 described in reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system identifies one or more hyperlinks in other web pages that each (i) link to the particular web page and (ii) include a respective image tag for a respective thumbnail image.
- the system then identifies a video identified in the particular web page that has a highest similarity visual score that satisfies a visual similarity test with reference to the thumbnail images.
- the system determines whether a visual similarity test is satisfied, the system (i) evaluates a similarity function with (a) a frame, e.g., the first frame, of a video included in the web page and (b) a thumbnail image as arguments to determine a similarity value, and (ii) determines that the similarity value satisfies a similarity threshold.
- a frame e.g., the first frame
- a thumbnail image as arguments to determine a similarity value
- the similarity value satisfies a similarity threshold.
- the video with a frame having the highest visual similarity score in comparison to other frames in videos that were identified in the particular web page is identified as a primary video of the particular web page.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of another example process 400 for identifying a primary image in a web page.
- the process 400 will be described as performed by a computer system that can be made up of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- the system identifies web pages in a web site that each have an image labeled as a primary image of a respective web page ( 402 ).
- the system identifies respective object paths that describe locations of each of the identified primary images ( 404 ) in their respective web pages.
- the object paths can be DOM paths.
- the system can find object paths for the identified primary images in an index, e.g., the index 200 described above in reference to FIG. 2 .
- the system identifies a most frequently occurring object path from among the identified object paths and defines that path as the primary image path for the web site ( 406 ).
- a primary image path is defined only when a ratio of the number of occurrences of the most frequently occurring object path and the total number of identified object paths satisfies a predetermined threshold value, e.g., 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, or 0.9 on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.
- a predetermined threshold value e.g. 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, or 0.9 on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.
- the system identifies, in the web site, a web page that has no image labeled as a primary image and that does have an image at the location identified in the web page by the primary image path ( 408 ). For example, the system can identify in the web site W 1 a web page P 5 that has no image labeled as a primary image. The system can also determine whether the web page P 5 has a particular image whose location in the web page matches the primary image path “/html/body/div/div/a/img”. If these conditions are satisfied, the system identifies the particular image as the primary image for the web page P 5 .
- the system labels the particular image as the primary image for the web page ( 410 ).
- the system identifies the particular image as a primary image for the web page in an index, e.g., the index 200 described in reference to FIG. 2 .

- This specification describes how a system can classify a particular image on a web page as being a primary image for the web page.
- The system can identify an image on the web page that is sufficiently similar to, and most similar to, thumbnail images in links to the web page, and classify the identified images as a primary image on the web page.
- Alternatively, the system can identify an image on the web page that is at a location in the web page defined by a primary object path for the web page, and classify the identified images as a primary image on the web page.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a plurality of web page images in a target web page; identifying a plurality of hyperlinks in other web pages, wherein each of the hyperlinks (i) links to the target web page and (ii) includes a respective image tag for a respective thumbnail image; determining a visual similarity score for each of the plurality of web page images with reference to the thumbnail images; identifying a first web page image in the plurality of web page images that has a highest visual similarity score with reference to the thumbnail images that satisfies a minimum similarity threshold; and labeling the first web page image as a primary image for the target web page.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 depictinghyperlinks web pages target web page 106 and (ii) include animage tag target web page 106. Theweb pages FIG. 1 , thetarget web page 106 is depicted as having been rendered by a web browser. Thetarget web page 106 includes images “A” 108, “B” 110, and “C” 112. - The
example environment 100 includesweb servers data communication network 120, e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks. Theweb servers data communication network 120. Theweb servers storage devices -
Web pages index 200 that will be described in reference toFIG. 2 , a variety of information about web pages and other addressable resources on the Internet. The system 160 can store the indices in one ormore storage devices 162. The system 160 can be implemented on one or more computers operating in one or more locations with thestorage devices 162. - The search system 160 gathers and stores, in an index, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for
web pages respective web pages - The system 160 gathers and stores, in the index, respective object paths for the images identified in a web page. In some implementations, the object path is a Document Object Model (DOM) path that describes the location of the corresponding image in the web page. In other implementations, other kinds of location information are used to specify a path. In the former implementations, the system 160 determines a DOM path for an image using operations provided in a DOM Application Programming Interface (API), e.g., libxml2, MSXML, or Xerces.
- In addition, the system 160 can gather and store, in the index, any hyperlinks in the
web pages - For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 1 , the system 160 gathers and stores, in the index,data identifying images target web page 106,hyperlinks web pages target web page 106 and include thumbnail image tags 138, 148, and 158 that each reference theimage 108 in thetarget web page 106. - The system 160 identifies primary images for web pages using the process that will be described in reference to
FIG. 3 . Further, the system 160 can label, in the index, primary images identified for web pages, together with respective object paths for the identified primary images. The labeling can take any convenient form; for example, the system can maintain an index of primary images and, for each primary image, a list of the web pages for which the image is a primary image. - Images identified as primary images for web pages can be used by the search system 160 to rank image search results. An image search result can be, for example, a reference to an image resource that is identified by a search system as satisfying a query, e.g., a text query or an image query. For example, an image search result referencing an image that is visually similar to a primary image for a particular web page can be given a higher rank than image search results referencing images that are not visually similar to any primary image.

In some implementations, theindex 200 stores data identifying aweb site 202, e.g., a URL, acorresponding web page 204 in theweb site 202, aprimary image 206 for theweb page 204, and anobject path 208 of theprimary image 206. InFIG. 2 , theindex 200 is depicted as storing data describing a web page P1 in a website W1, a primary image “image.jpg” for the web page P1, and a primary image DOM path “/html/body/div/div/a/img” for the web page P1. Theindex 200 is also depicted as storing data describing a web page P2 in the website W1, a primary image “logo.jpg” for the web page P2, and a primary image DOM path “/html/body/div/div/a/img” for the web page P2. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for identifying a primary image in a web page. For convenience, theprocess 300 will be described as performed by a computer system that can be made up of one or more computers located in one or more locations. - The system identifies images included in a particular web page (302).
- The system identifies one or more hyperlinks in other web pages that each (i) link to the particular web page and (ii) include a respective image tag for a respective image, which will be referred to as a thumbnail image (304).
- The system determines a visual similarity score for each of the images in the particular web page, which may be referred to as “page images”, with reference to the thumbnail images (306).
- In some implementations, as a preliminary step in determining a visual similarity score for an image with reference to the thumbnail images, the system determines whether the thumbnail images are visually similar to each other. In these implementations, if the thumbnail images are not determined to be visually similar to each other, the system determines a visual similarity score for the page image such that the page image will not be identified as a primary image, or simply ends the process for identifying a primary image with respect to the current page image.
- Visual similarity between two images can be determined using conventional image analysis techniques, e.g., by detecting and comparing edges in a first and second image or by keypoint matching one or more regions in a first and second image. Visual similarity between two images can be measured using a numeric similarity value, as determined by a similarity function. The similarity value can range from 0.0 to 1.0, where a value of 0.0 indicates that the images are very different, and a value 1.0 indicates that the images are identical. Other ranges of values can also be used.
- In some such implementations, the system requires that all thumbnail images be identical. In other implementations, the thumbnail images are required to include no pair of images with a similarity value that is less than a predetermined threshold, e.g., 0.90, 0.95, or 0.98 on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. The threshold value, which determines whether the system considers two images to be similar or not, can be determined empirically based on evaluations by human raters. In other implementations, all but a predetermined small percentage, e.g., 10%, 5%, or 1%, of the thumbnail images must be identical or within a threshold similarity of each other.
- In some implementations, the system determines that two thumbnails are visually similar only if the image tags reference the same resource.
- In any of the implementations in which the system determines that the thumbnail images are visually similar to each other, the system determines a visual similarity score for the page image with reference to the thumbnail images. The system can determine a visual similarity score for the image from a similarity value representing the similarity of the page image and one of the visually similar thumbnail images.
- In implementations in which the system does not preliminarily determine whether the thumbnail images are visually similar to each other, the system determines a visual similarity score for the page image by determining a respective similarity value for the page image and each of the thumbnail images, which represents the similarity of the pair of images to each other, and using those similarity values to determine the visual similarity score for the page image. Depending on the implementation, the median value of the similarity values, a geometric, arithmetic, or harmonic mean of the similarity values, a lowest similarity value of the similarity values, or other statistic derived from the similarity values can be selected as the visual similarity score for the image.
- The system identifies a page image, if there is one, having a highest visual similarity score that also satisfies a minimum similarity threshold (308).
- The system labels the page image, if there is one, as a primary image for the web page (310). In some implementations, images identified as primary images are labeled as such in an index, e.g., the
index 200 described in reference toFIG. 2 . - The technique described above can be applied to videos included in a particular web page to identify a primary video of a web page. In some implementations, the system identifies one or more hyperlinks in other web pages that each (i) link to the particular web page and (ii) include a respective image tag for a respective thumbnail image. The system then identifies a video identified in the particular web page that has a highest similarity visual score that satisfies a visual similarity test with reference to the thumbnail images. In determining whether a visual similarity test is satisfied, the system (i) evaluates a similarity function with (a) a frame, e.g., the first frame, of a video included in the web page and (b) a thumbnail image as arguments to determine a similarity value, and (ii) determines that the similarity value satisfies a similarity threshold. In such implementations, the video with a frame having the highest visual similarity score in comparison to other frames in videos that were identified in the particular web page is identified as a primary video of the particular web page.

FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of anotherexample process 400 for identifying a primary image in a web page. For convenience, theprocess 400 will be described as performed by a computer system that can be made up of one or more computers located in one or more locations. - The system identifies web pages in a web site that each have an image labeled as a primary image of a respective web page (402).
- The system identifies respective object paths that describe locations of each of the identified primary images (404) in their respective web pages. As noted above, the object paths can be DOM paths. The system can find object paths for the identified primary images in an index, e.g., the
index 200 described above in reference toFIG. 2 . - The system identifies a most frequently occurring object path from among the identified object paths and defines that path as the primary image path for the web site (406).
- In some implementations, a primary image path is defined only when a ratio of the number of occurrences of the most frequently occurring object path and the total number of identified object paths satisfies a predetermined threshold value, e.g., 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, or 0.9 on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.
- The system identifies, in the web site, a web page that has no image labeled as a primary image and that does have an image at the location identified in the web page by the primary image path (408). For example, the system can identify in the web site W1 a web page P5 that has no image labeled as a primary image. The system can also determine whether the web page P5 has a particular image whose location in the web page matches the primary image path “/html/body/div/div/a/img”. If these conditions are satisfied, the system identifies the particular image as the primary image for the web page P5.
- The system labels the particular image as the primary image for the web page (410). In some implementations, the system identifies the particular image as a primary image for the web page in an index, e.g., the
index 200 described in reference toFIG. 2 . - Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in tangibly-embodied computer software or firmware, in computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
