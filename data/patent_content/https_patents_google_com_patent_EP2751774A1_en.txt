- the system may then generate and distribute posts related to the belonging to one or more contacts of user 130.
- user 130 selects one or more contacts and/or groups of contacts, which the user wishes to share the user's belonging activities with.
- adding the belonging is detected as a belonging-related activity and thus the system may initiate the process for generating and sharing a post related to the belonging with the contacts selected by the user.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a flow chart illustrating a process 600 for generating a belonging- related post and sharing the post with contacts of a user.
- the process 600 begins when the system detects a belonging-related activity by a user, for example user 130.
- the belonging-related activity may include a new belonging being added.
- Other examples of belonging-related activity may include a user modifying a belonging, deleting a belonging, adding a new post regarding a belonging and adding a new comment regarding the belonging.
- the system retrieves sharing preferences with respect to the belonging.
- the sharing preference of a belonging may be stored within the belonging profile of the belonging generated in step 504 of process 500.
- a user e.g., user 130
- User 130 may also modify the sharing preferences for a belonging already added and stored within the social graph of belongings, for example by selecting to modify the belonging, or by setting the sharing preference upon receiving a prompt when a post is being shared with contacts of the user.
- step 603 based on the retrieved sharing preferences, the system may determine whether the activity detected in step 601 is associated with a private belonging. When a user selects to not share any posts regarding a belonging with contacts, the belonging may be stored as a private belonging. Similarly, the post may also be private if no contacts are selected. [0143J If in step 603, the system determines that the belonging is a private belonging, then the process ends in step 604. Otherwise, in step 605, the system generates a post regarding the belonging-related activity detected in step 601. Generating a post may comprise generating text regarding the activity and appending an image of the belonging to the text to generate a post. The text may be system generated and pre-stored text.
- the system may store pre- generated text associated with each specific action, and upon detecting the action, may retrieve the pre-stored and pre-generated text associated with the specific action detected in step 601.
- the text may include user-generated text, for example, text entered within a post entry box (e.g., post entry box 214 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 2 or post entry box 314 of the graphical user interface of FIG. 3).
- the image may, in some examples, correspond to the main image selected by user 130 and stored within the belonging profile of the belonging associated with the detected belonging-related activity.
- each post may be assigned a unique identifier.
- the unique identifier may be associated with a belonging the post is related to and/or a user associated with the belonging.
- the system may track the post through the unique identifier.
- the post may be linked with the unique identifier such that after distribution the post may be retrieved and modified using the link, even after the post has be distributed and displayed to contacts.
- a link associated with user 130 and a link associated with the belonging may further be included within the post generated in step 605.
- the generated post may include the name of user 130 and the name of user 130 may include a link to user 130.
- the link to user 130 may be selectable and upon selection may access and display the belonging profile of user 130 (e.g., the user belonging profile illustrated in the graphical user interface of FIG. 2).
- a link to the belonging may be included within the post.
- the link may be inserted within the text or image of the post.
- the link to the post may be selectable and upon selection may access and display the belonging profile of the belonging.
- step 607 the system may determine whether user 130 should be prompted before the post is shared. For example, the system may look at the sharing preference retrieved in step 602 to determine whether user 130 has selected the prompt to post option. If it is determined that user 130 should be prompted, the process 600 continues to step 608 and prompts user 130, for example by displaying a prompt window. The user may in some instances view and modify the post, before authorizing that the post be shared with contacts.
- step 609 the system determines whether user 130 has authorized sharing the post with contacts selected by user 130. If it is determined that user 130 has not authorized the post, then the system continues to step 604 and ends the process.
- step 610 the system determines contacts to share the post with.
- the contacts may be stored within the belonging profile.
- the determined contacts may be associated with one or more remote social networking sites.
- step 61 1 the system distributes the post to the one or more remote social networking sites, and requests that the post be displayed to the selected users identified in step 610.
- step 607 it is determined that that user 130 should not be prompted, the process 600 continues to step 610 and then to step 61 1 where the post is distributed to the one or more remote social networking sites, requesting that the post be displayed to the determined contacts at the one or more remote social networking sites.
- the one or more remote social networking sites may provide API functionality for receiving and posting posts.
- the system generates an API call to each of the one or more remote social networking sites to display the post.
- the post may be displayed along with other posts by user 130 within the one or more remote social networking sites and shared with the one or more determined contacts.
- the post may be retrieved and modified using the unique identifier, the link to the user and/or the link to the belonging. For example, a user may modify information regarding the belonging, may delete the belonging or may perform other activity with respect to the belonging. In such instances, it may be beneficial to update the posts related to the belonging in view of the action performed by the user.
- the post may further be stored within a database maintained by the system. A date and time associated with the posts (e.g., the time the post was created, generated or stored) may be stored with the post for later retrieval and display within a belonging-related stream.
