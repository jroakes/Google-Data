Example embodiment relates to air communication network, and it uses multiple balloons with signal equipment to promote
Radio communication between balloon and with the ground station and/or the radio communication of other ground subscriber.Balloon can
Be there is the air bag of the payload of power supply, data storage device and one or more transceiver by support
(envelope) being formed, the one or more transceiver is for by wireless for the information balloon network of conveying to
Other member and/or be positioned at the wireless station on ground.For the time aloft and ground station and/or other ground
Subscri er communication, balloon may be provided with and is installed to balloon payload with the one or more radio frequencies towards ground
(RF) antenna.
Specifically, one or more transceivers can be by balloon for being positioned at below balloon at ground level
The ground station and/or other ground subscriber in specific region send communication data and/or from described ground base station
Stand and/or other ground subscriber receives data.In some instances, balloon may be provided in Horizon near one group
Face adjoin covering.Such as, service can provide to being positioned at one from least one balloon in balloon network
Ground subscriber Anywhere in region.
Generally, the beam angle towards the RF signal of communication on ground can strong with the signal at ground level
Degree is inversely proportional to.The wave beam (such as, from the high-gain aerial on balloon) of narrower focusing can provide higher
Signal, and power can be diffused to by broader wave beam (such as, from the low-gain antenna on balloon)
In larger area, thus it is not provided that the strongest signal.Therefore, in some instances, one group of balloon
Can be provided in the covering on a region, in order to provide strong signal (and/or to have high noise to ground subscriber
The signal of ratio), between the region that the most nearby balloon is covered, there is minimum overlay.
In some instances, the one or more balloons in network can be with can be in the covering at ground level
The mode producing gap changes position.Such as, one or more in balloon can to change level (horizontal
To and/or longitudinally) position and/or height.Balloon can based on be partially or completely in balloon network control with
Outer factor (such as, wind) changes position, and/or can be controlled to based on can be used for positioning network
The formation planning algorithm of interior balloon changes position.The change of (one or more) position can based on by
It is every that the current beam width of the communication beams towards ground that balloon uses changes on ground by balloon
One region covered.In some instances, (before position change occurs, during position change, or
Person is after position change) may determine that and be likely to occur gap in the covered ground that balloon network is provided.
In this case, the signal of communication towards ground from one or more balloons can be adjusted
To attempt, maintenance is ground adjoins covering to beam angle.Such as, if neighbouring balloon is away from specific gas
Advance in ball ground, then this balloon can increase its beam angle to increase its overlay area (such as, to provide
The covering in the region for previously having been covered by other balloon).In other example, neighbouring balloon can lean on
Advancing in nearly specific balloon ground, such as is designated as helping to provide for high density people when each in balloon
During the covering of port area (such as, sport event).In such instances, specific balloon can reduce it
Towards the beam angle of the signal of communication on ground, to reduce the size of its overlay area, and such as to ground
Smaller area on face provides higher signal.
Balloon can be equipped as adjusting by different way the beam angle of the RF communication beams towards ground.
In one example, can by from each can with different beams width send signal two or more
Individual separate antennas carries out selection to adjust beam angle.Such as, balloon may be provided with two different RF
Antenna: one for sending the high-gain aerial of narrow RF wave beam, and one is used for sending broader RF
The low-gain antenna of wave beam.In other example, balloon may be provided with each can send has difference
Three or more different antennas of the RF signal of beam angle.In other example, the ripple of balloon
Beam width can be continuously controllable, such as by adjusting irradiator and towards between the reflector on ground
Interval, described reflector can operate with by communication beams towards ground return.
In extra example, balloon network can service ground with the demand levels changed based on position
Face subscriber (such as, territory, high-density population areas can have greater demand than the region with less people).?
In this example, can control and/or adjust the beam angle of one or more balloon so that based on demand level
The specific region not coming to go up earthward provides the covering of specified quantitative.Such as, each balloon can have it and can send out
Deliver to the data (such as, 10MB/s) of the limited capacity of ground subscriber.With particular demands rank (such as,
100MB/s) one or more balloons of overlay area may change position so that balloon is no longer able to make
The covering enough meeting demand levels is provided with current beam width.In this case, one or more
Balloon can adjust it towards the beam angle of the signal of communication on ground to meet at ground level
The demand covered.
Therefore example system and method can allow to order from one group of balloon to the ground station and/or other ground
The RF communication at family.Balloon can adjust towards ground based on the one or more position change in balloon
The beam angle of the communication beams in face.

A. mesh network function
As noted, balloon 102A to 102E can serve as mesh network generally.More specifically,
Because balloon 102A to 102E may utilize free space optical link and communicates with one another, so these balloons can
Serve as Free Space Optics mesh network generally.
In mesh network configures, each balloon 102A to 102E may act as the node of mesh network, should
Node may operate to receive and is sent to its data and routes data to other balloon.So, it is determined by
Data can be routed to mesh from source balloon by the suitable sequence of the optical link between source balloon and destination's balloon
Ground balloon.These optical links may be collectively referred to herein as " light for the connection between source balloon and destination's balloon
Road (lightpath) ".It addition, " jumping (hop) " that each optical link is referred to alternatively as in light path.
It addition, in order to as mesh network operation, balloon 102A to 102E can use various route technology
With self-regeneration algorithm.In certain embodiments, balloon network 100 can use self adaptation or dynamic routing,
Wherein the light path between source balloon and destination's balloon is determined when needs connect and sets up, and with
The rear some time is released from.It addition, when use self adaptation route time, can according to the current state of balloon network,
Past state and/or predicted state dynamically determine light path.
Additionally, along with balloon 102A to 102E is relative to each other and/or relative to ground moving, network
Topology alterable.Therefore, exemplary balloon network 100 can apply MESH protocol along with the topology of network
Change and update the state of network.Such as, in order to solve the mobility of balloon 102A to 102E, balloon
Network 100 can use and/or revise adaptively mobile self-grouping network (mobile ad hoc network,
MANET) the various technology used in.Other example is also possible.
In some implementations, balloon network 100 can be configured to transparent mesh network.More specifically and
Speech, in transparent balloon network, balloon can include the assembly of the physical exchange for complete optics, its
In optical signal physics route in be not related to any electric component.Thus, there is the saturating of optics exchange
In bright configuration, signal is passed through the multi-hop light path of complete optics.
In other implementation, balloon network 100 can realize opaque Free Space Optics mesh network

Transparent configuration is also possible.
In another aspect, the balloon in exemplary balloon network 100 can realize wavelength-division multiplex
(wavelength division multiplexing, WDM), this can help to increase link capacity.When with thoroughly
When bright exchange realizes WDM, the physics light path through balloon network can be subject to " wavelength continuity constraint ".
More specifically, because the exchange in transparent network is complete optics, it is possible that be necessary to
Determine all optical links in light path and assign identical wavelength.
On the other hand, opaque configuration can avoid wavelength continuity to retrain.Specifically, opaque balloon net
Balloon in network can include the OEO exchange system that can be used to wavelength convert.As a result, balloon can be on edge
The wavelength of transmitting photo-signal at each jumping of light path.
It addition, various routing algorithm can be used in opaque configuration.Such as, for the connection for giving
Determining main optical path and/or one or more different standby light path, exemplary balloon can be applied or consider the shortest
Path route technology, the algorithm of such as Dijkstra and k shortest path, and/or edge and node diverse or
Disjoint path is by, algorithm of such as Suurballe etc..Additionally or alternatively, can when determining light path

Network topology.Such as, the station keeps can relate to each balloon 102A to 102E maintenance and/or moving to
(and may be relative to ground relative to the ad-hoc location of other balloons one or more in network
Ad-hoc location).As a part for this process, each balloon 102A to 102E can realize the station and keep
Function is to determine its expected location in expectation topology, and if necessary, it is determined that how to move to
Desired locations.
Expect that topology can be different according to specific implementation.In some cases, balloon can be real
The existing station keeps providing the most homogeneous topology.In this case, given balloon 102A
Can realize the station to 102E keeps function himself to be positioned at and the neighbouring balloon in balloon network 100
At a distance of substantially same distance (or in the range of certain distance).
In other cases, balloon network 100 can have non-homogeneous topology.Such as, exemplary embodiment
Can relate to following topology: in these topologys, for various reasons, balloon is distributed in some region
Obtain more dense or less dense.As example, in order to help to meet typical more high bandwidth in urban area
Demand, balloon can more densely packed cluster on urban area.For a similar reason, the distribution of balloon
Side can be more more dense than above big water body on land.Other example of many of non-homogeneous topology is possible
's.
In another aspect, the topology of exemplary balloon network can be dynamic and adaptability amendment.
Specifically, the station of exemplary balloon keeps function that balloon can be allowed according to the change of the expectation topology of network
Adjust its respective location.Such as, one or more balloons are movable to new position to increase or to subtract
The density of balloon in little given area.It addition, in certain embodiments, balloon can be at continuously or almost
In continuous print motion, and the station keeps relating to mobile balloon to attempt meeting such as each
The particular demands of the covering in region.
In certain embodiments, balloon network 100 can use energy function to determine whether balloon should move
Move and/or should how to move and desired topology is provided.Specifically, the state of given balloon and some or
Near all, the state of balloon can be the input of energy function.Energy function can by given balloon and near
The current state of balloon is applied to desired network state (such as, corresponding with expectation topology state).
The gradient that can be determined by energy function subsequently determines the vector expecting movement of the given balloon of instruction.Give

Although the most not shown, but can be in conjunction with the other type of ground station (such as, access point, gateway
Etc.) realize the control system shown in Fig. 2.
In centerized fusion is arranged, all the most that, central control system 200 (and
And area control system 202A to 202C is likely to) can be that balloon network 204 coordinates some netted networking
Function.Such as, balloon 206A to 206I can send some status information to central control system 200,
Central control system 200 can utilize these status informations to determine the state of balloon network 204.Come self-supporting
The status information determining balloon can include that (such as, light chain set up therewith by balloon for position data, optical link information
Wavelength on the identity of other balloon on road, the bandwidth of link, link uses and/or availability etc.),
The wind data of balloon collection and/or other type of information.Therefore, central control system 200 can assemble to come
Some or all of status information in balloon 206A to 206I is to determine the integrality of network.
The integrality of network is subsequently used in coordination and/or promotes some netted network savvy, such as even
Connect and determine light path.Such as, central control system 200 can be based on from balloon 206A to 206I
A little or whole coherent condition information determines present topology.Topology can provide available working as in balloon network

The balloon network of large geographical area can be useful.In certain embodiments, dcs is very
To supporting the most each local global balloon network providing covering.Certainly, distributed AC servo system cloth
Putting can also be useful in other scene.
In addition, it will be appreciated that it is possible that other control system is arranged.Such as, some implementations can
Relate to the distributed control with extra layer (such as, subregion system in area control system etc.)
System processed.Alternatively, controlling function can be provided by single Centralized Control System, and this system can be with one
Or multiple downlink balloon directly communicates.
In another aspect, depend on implementation, can be by ground control to balloon network-based control and coordination
Share to varying degrees between system processed gentle net network.It practice, in certain embodiments, permissible
There is no ground control system.In such an embodiment, all-network controls and coordination function can be by balloon net

State information.It addition, the relays status information that it can be received from neighbouring balloon of each balloon to some or
Balloon near all.When all balloon all do so, each balloon can be individually determined the shape of network
State.Alternatively, some balloon can be designated as the given moiety aggregation status information into network.These gas
Ball coordinated with each other can determine the integrality of network subsequently.
It addition, in certain aspects, balloon network-based control can partially or completely be localized,
So that it does not relies on the integrality of network.Such as, individual balloon can realize only considering neighbouring gas
The station of ball keeps function.Specifically, each balloon can realize himself state and the shape of neighbouring balloon
The energy function that state is taken into account.This energy function can be used for maintaining and/or moving to relative to neighbouring balloon
Desired locations, without consider network on the whole expectation topology.But, when each balloon is for platform
When holding of standing realizes this energy function, balloon network can maintain desired topology and/or on the whole towards the phase
The topology hoped is mobile.

III. example tunable whole air-to-ground communication wave beam
In some instances, the communication system of balloon can use two or more different beams width
Send RF signal to the ground station and/or other ground subscriber.Such as, balloon may be provided with and can send
The high-gain camera of narrow beam signal and the low gain camera of broad beam signal can be sent.By using
More wide beamwidth, balloon may get at the ground subscriber in the larger area reached on ground below balloon.
But, more broad beam can not provide signal of communication strong as narrow beam, because power may be dispersed in
In larger area.In other example, balloon may be provided with the antenna of more than two, each can send out
Send the RF communication beams with different beams width.
Balloon then can by the subscriber selecting different antennae to go up earthward tomorrow send RF signal of communication with
Adjust the beam angle of the signal of communication towards ground.Such as, in order to cover ground bigger region,
The balloon using high-gain aerial to send narrow beam signal can increase ripple by switching to low-gain antenna
Beam width.In other example, balloon may be provided with the transceiver comprising multiple antenna, the plurality of
Antenna can send the RF signal of communication with different beams width to be come will pass through switching between antennas
Promote to adjust the process of beam angle.
In other example, balloon can send the RF communication with continuously controllable beam angle
Wave beam.Such as, balloon can comprise the antenna towards ground, and described antenna includes being located towards reflection
The radiating element of device radiation.Reflector can be dish-like, can be such as that the quasi-parabolical that ball is constant is dish-like.
Radiating element can be towards reflector signal, and this causes the radiation launched from antenna to have directive
Penetrate pattern.The transmitting pattern of directivity substantially can be positioned at the conical region near antenna in summit.Launch figure
The directivity of case thus by being determined by the width or narrow degree of launching the region that pattern irradiates, and can
Characterize by limiting the subtended angle of the taper surface of irradiated area.Subtended angle (thus antenna directivity) can be extremely
Partially determined by the spacing between radiating element and reflector.Usually, the biggest spacing is corresponding
In the narrowest transmitting pattern, and the least spacing is corresponding to the widest transmitting pattern.In this example, because of
This can by by the radiating element in antenna closer to or further from reflector mobile dynamically adjustment send out
Penetrate the width of pattern.
Fig. 5 A illustrate have be positioned as being radiated at ground level geographic area 506 towards ground
The example aerostat 502 of antenna.Balloon 502 can be similar to contact balloon 300 described by Fig. 3, and
And the RF communication system being installed to payload for operating surface antenna earthward, this RF can be included
Communication system is similar with the RF communication system 318 in the payload 306 of balloon 300.Towards ground
Antenna can launch RF communication beams 504, this RF communication beams 504 makes the signal at ground level big
Geographic area 506 is crossed on body.It is big that communication beams 504 can have with ground geographic area 506
Little corresponding angular span θ1, the circumference of the most ground border circular areas.
In some instances, the angular span of the communication beams of balloon may be adjusted so that change wave beam exists
The size of the geographic area arrived on ground level.Such as, balloon may be provided with two or more RF
Antenna, each RF antenna can send the RF communication beams with different beams.RF towards ground
Then the beam angle of communication beams can be revised by switching between two different antennae.Show at some
In example, it is interior to promote antenna (with communication beams width) that multiple antennas can be integrated into single transceiver
Between switching.Or, in other example, balloon may be provided with RF camera, and it can send can
Continuously adjustable RF signal of communication.
Fig. 5 B illustrates the balloon 502 sending the communication beams with broader beam angle than Fig. 5 A.
More specifically, balloon 502 can irradiate ground by sending communication beams 508 from the antenna towards ground
Reason region 510, in order to generally cross over the geographic area 510 on ground level.Communication beams 508 can have
Angular span θ2, it is corresponding to the size of ground geographic area 510.By increasing communication beams 508
Width and corresponding angular span θ2, communication beams 508 can cover larger area at ground level.Though
Contact aerostat 502 for the sake of the most herein for convenience and describe adjustable communication beams 504,508, but
Especially it should be noted that have can send have adjustable beam angle RF communication beams (one or
Multiple) communication system of antenna may be mounted to multiple High Altitude Platform, and multiple High Altitude Platform can be contacted make
With, described High Altitude Platform such as other lighter-than-air equipment etc..
Additionally, it is to be noted, that discussion herein is generally mentioned (or launches having adjustable beam angle
Pattern) radio signal transmission with irradiate geographic area (such as, by communication beams 504,508 shine
The geographic area 506,510 at ground level penetrated).But, due to radio in antenna theory and design
The transmitting of signal and the general reciprocity between receiving, therefore it would be recognized that discussion in full generally
It is equally applicable to receive signal from the geographic area of specifically plane.I.e., it is possible to additionally or alternatively make
With (one or more) antenna with adjustable beam angle receive from launch pattern (such as, from
Inside the geographic area 506,510 of ground level) come signal.In such examples, wave beam width is adjusted
Degree can allow (being installed to aerostat) reception antenna from from ground different geographic regions
The ground station and/or other ground subscriber receive signal of communication, shown in such as Fig. 5 A and Fig. 5 B.
IV. exemplary method
Fig. 6 is the block diagram of the method according to example embodiment.Method 600 can by be positioned at single balloon and/
Or the one or more calculating systems on the multiple balloons communicated with one another perform.In other example, side
All or some of method 600 can be performed by balloon network-based control system.Such as, in method 600
A bit or all can be performed by central control system and/or district system, as above for described in Fig. 2 being
System.(one or more) control system can be with the balloon communication in balloon network.In some instances,
Each several part in method 600 can be combined, and is separated into extra part, and/or presses and shown order
Different orders performs.Other configuration is also possible.
More specifically, method 600 initially can relate to determining is adjoined covered ground by one group of balloon service
Region, as illustrated in block 602.Terrestrial coverage area of adjoining on one region can be with origin in this region
Each overlay area of each balloon is formed.Specified point in terrestrial coverage area can by balloon extremely
A few service so that balloon can send and/or receive the RF communication letter arriving the point at ground level
Number.
Such as, specific balloon can cover be positioned at ground specific region below balloon (such as, with
The ground circle of point centered by immediately below the skyborne horizontal level of balloon).The district that specific balloon covers
The size in territory except based on balloon towards in addition to the communication beams on ground, it is also possible to height based on balloon.
More wide beamwidth can cover ground larger area.Extraly, if the most higher balloon with
The lowest balloon uses same beam width, and the most higher balloon can be than the lowest gas
Ball covers ground larger area.In some examples, balloon may be provided with RF antenna, and it will letter
Number project and to have on the individual overlay area of the difformity (such as, oval) in addition to circle.
In some instances, when being added together from each overlay area of each in balloon
(such as, when ground circle combines), can be formed on the specific area adjoin earth coverage area
Territory.Terrestrial coverage area can be adjoined to, because (such as, it does not comprise any gap in covering
The point not serviced by any one balloon on ground).Adjoin terrestrial coverage area and such as can cover specific geographic
Region, city or country.
In some instances, adjoining terrestrial coverage area can be by being positioned at specific by the balloon in network
Horizontal level and/or height place, then select be used for from balloon in order to cover whole region towards ground
The beam angle of the signal of communication in face determines.In other example, adjoining terrestrial coverage area can be only
Determine for the beam angle of signal of communication by selecting, such as when balloon position the most not
When can be controlled by balloon network.In some examples, beam angle can be selected (to cover with corresponding individuality
Lid scope) to provide with the minimum overlay amount between each coverage and adjoining covering on region.
In other example, for redundancy benefit, multiple balloons can cover some overlapping region ground.
Fig. 7 A illustrates the top view of the example arrangement of three balloons and corresponding individual overlay area.More
Specifically, the first balloon 702 may be provided with the communication system 704 including the RF antenna towards ground, should
RF signal of communication can be projected on the ground region 706 below balloon 702 by RF antenna.Volume
Other places, the second balloon 708 may be provided with the communication system 710 including the RF antenna towards ground, should
RF signal of communication can be projected in a ground zones of different 712 by RF antenna.Additionally, the 3rd
Balloon 714 may be provided with the communication system 716 including the RF antenna towards ground, and this RF antenna is permissible
RF signal of communication is projected in another zones of different 718 ground.
Adjoin terrestrial coverage area then to be formed by region 706,712,718.Ground in overlay area
Any point on face can be covered by least one in balloon 702,708,714.In this simplification example
In, it is shown that three balloons, but terrestrial coverage area can also include coming in automatic network hundreds of or thousand of
Each overlay area of individual balloon.Extraly, the communication system 704,710,716 of balloon is shown at some
Example can be entirely identical, or they can also be not on different balloons in other example
With.
In other example, terrestrial coverage area can include based on demand levels for the difference in region
The covering of the different stage of part.Such as, some region can have more dense population or for other
Reason has bigger demand for services.Each balloon can be for the appearance of its data that can send to ground subscriber
Measure restricted (such as, 1MB/s, 10MB/s or 100MB/s).Therefore, in some instances, certain
The balloon of a little numbers may be located on a region, in order to meets the demand in this region at ground level.Cause
This can be provided the different demands of each section that rank enough meet terrestrial coverage area by balloon network
Cover.
Then method 600 can relate to the change determining the position of at least one in balloon, such as block 604
Shown in.More specifically, level (laterally and/or longitudinally) position of each balloon in network and/or height
Can change over.Such as, wind or other environmental factors can cause balloon to change position.Extraly,
In some instances, covering and/or the purpose of other task for providing, each balloon can be by periodically
The region reassigned to different is specified on ground.
In some instances, it is contemplated that the movement of the one or more balloons in network causes at ground level
Covering in gap.Such as, the unique balloon covered is provided as the specific region immediately below balloon
Balloon may be blown in the horizontal direction so that balloon side the most on the specific area, and use
It currently no longer provides to this region towards the beam angle on ground and covers.In some instances, can be with base
(such as, weather forecast can in the prediction in gap possible in expection balloon moves and makes in advance about covering
Wind on prediction specific direction).In other example, it was predicted that midway can be moved at balloon and occur, or
Can also move at some balloon and occur occurring afterwards.
Fig. 7 B shows the example arrangement of three balloons from Fig. 7 A, wherein in these balloons
Move horizontally.More specifically, balloon 714 can be moved into right side so that balloon 702 covers
Ground region 706 no longer contacts the region 718 that balloon 714 is covered.In this case, exist
The gap being likely to occur in terrestrial coverage area between balloon 702 and balloon 714.In some instances,
Before balloon 714 starts to move or when balloon 714 midway changes position, gap can be made possible
The determination occurred.
Then method 600 can relate to the adjustment determining the individual overlay area in balloon, with
Attempt maintenance and adjoin covered ground, as indicated at block 606.More specifically, one or more in balloon
Beam angle can increase or reduce, in order to one or more in balloon tie up after having changed position
Hold and adjoin covered ground.By increasing the beam angle of specific balloon, the individuality that can increase this balloon covers
Cover region territory (such as, ground circle), in order to prevent in the ground covering being otherwise likely to occur
Gap.
In some instances, it may be determined that the minimum increase in the individual overlay area of balloon, in order to maintain
Adjoin covered ground.Such as, the individual overlay area of balloon will not unnecessarily increase to avoid reducing
Signal intensity at ground level.In other example, the individual overlay area of multiple balloon can be adjusted.
Such as, the overlay area of two or three different balloons can each increase in case prevent in covering can
Can gap.In some examples, the individual overlay area of some balloons can be increased, can also subtract simultaneously
The individual overlay area of other balloon little.
Method 600 may also refer to adjust the width of the communication beams towards ground of balloon to adjust this gas
The individual overlay area of ball, as shown in block 608.More specifically, can by adjusting the beam angle of balloon
To adjust the individual overlay area of balloon the most definitely, in order to one or more in balloon change
Displacement is put to maintain afterwards and is adjoined covered ground.In some instances, position can have been changed at balloon to arrive
Complete before being likely to occur the point to the gap in the service in region the communication from balloon is believed
Number the adjustment of beam angle.
Can make to adjust any one of in aforementioned manners the ripple of the communication beams towards ground of balloon
Beam width.Such as, the communication system of balloon can switch between two or more RF antennas, its
Each can send the signal with different beams width.Or, balloon may be provided with to be had and can adjust continuously
The antenna of whole beam angle, the most such as can be by adjusting anti-with towards ground of irradiator
Interval between emitter adjusts beam angle.
Fig. 7 C shows another configuration of three balloons from Fig. 7 B.More specifically, gas can be increased
The beam angle of ball 714 is so that the larger area 718 covered on ground level.By increasing balloon 714
Individual overlay area 718, can avoid the result of the position change as balloon 714 to be likely to occur
Any gap in covering.In other example, can alternatively increase the individual area of coverage of balloon 702
The individual overlay area 712 of territory 706 or balloon 708 is to maintain and adjoining covering.In other example
In, it is also possible to increase the combination of individual overlay area 706,712 and 718 to avoid the gap in covering.
In some examples, the different sections of terrestrial coverage area can be from the different need from ground subscriber
Rank is asked to be associated, as previously noted.In such examples, therefore covered ground will can be adjoined
It is defined as meeting the cover grade of the demand levels on whole region.For example, it is possible to as method 600
A part determines the adjustment of the individual overlay area to balloon, to attempt avoiding the seeervice level to specific region
Not enough (except or substitute the gap in literal covering).Such as, the demand levels of specific region can
The service from least two balloon can be needed.In such examples, if the one level in balloon is remote
Move (such as, as in Fig. 7 B) from this region, then can increase this balloon or different balloons
Beam angle, in order to guarantee that this region continues to have enough service class at ground level.
In other example, the position change of one or more balloons can include the change of height.In vacation
If in the case of fixed beam width, if balloon altitude rises, then the individual terrestrial coverage area of balloon
Can increase.Similarly, in the case of assuming fixed beam width, if balloon altitude declines, then
The individual terrestrial coverage area of balloon can reduce.In some instances, therefore it is desired that in region
One or more Level Change in balloon cause by one group of balloon in the covering that ground level provides between
Gap.
In some examples, the beam angle of balloon can be adjusted to change along with balloon altitude and keeping
The individual overlay area of balloon fixing or the most approximately fixed on the ground.Such as, along with balloon altitude
Increasing, the angular span towards the communication beams on ground can narrow so that wave beam is crossed at ground level
More or less the same region.Extraly, along with balloon altitude reduces, towards the angle of the communication beams on ground
Span can broaden so that wave beam crosses over more or less the same region at ground level.In some instances,
The antenna of balloon can be configured such that transmitting pattern the most substantially cross over identical ground level geographic area and
No matter the height above sea level of balloon how.Thus, balloon can be configured to maintain and generally fixing geographic area
Communication, even if the most such when balloon is elevated to Different Altitude.
Additionally, the narrower communication beams towards ground can have bigger directional gain.So, ripple
The directional gain of the increase launching pattern of bundle can compensate at least in part when balloon is in high height
Relatively large distance between balloon and ground level.Such as, at the ground level in the geographic area covered
Radiation can have suitable intensity, and no matter this radiation is wider from the balloon at lower height
Launch pattern, or from the narrower transmitting pattern with the balloon in high height.Come comfortable higher
The pattern of launching more oriented of the balloon of height and then can compensate the radiation at ground level at least in part
Intensity depends on the change of height.
Fig. 7 D shows the top view of the example arrangement of three balloons, and one of them balloon is the lowest
In other two balloons.More specifically, balloon 714 can be by reducing relative to balloon 702 and 708
Highly change position.The communication beams towards ground if from the communication system 716 of balloon 714
Beam angle keep fixing, then balloon can reduce in the size of the individual overlay area 718 of ground level.
In some instances, it is contemplated that the Level Change of balloon 714 causes the gap in covered ground, such as
Ground between the region 706 covered by balloon 702 and the region 718 covered by balloon 714
Gap in section.
Adjoin covered ground to maintain, the beam angle of balloon 714 can be adjusted to tackle balloon 714
Level Change.Specifically, in some instances, the beam angle of balloon 714 can be adjusted to protect
Individual overlay area 718 size holding balloon 714 is relatively fixed, regardless of the present level of balloon 714
How.Along with the height of balloon 714 increases, beam angle can narrow to prevent terrestrial coverage area
718 sizes increase.Additionally, along with the height of balloon 714 reduces, beam angle can broaden to prevent
Only terrestrial coverage area 718 size reduces.
Fig. 7 E illustrates the top view of another example arrangement of the balloon from Fig. 7 D.More specifically, come
The beam angle of the communication beams towards ground of the communication system 716 on balloon 714 can increase with
Just terrestrial coverage area 718 size reduction along with balloon 714 height reduction of balloon 714 is prevented.?
In some examples, so that before any change of the height of balloon 714, the ripple to balloon 714
The adjustment of beam width is enough far away, such that it is able to maintain from this group balloon on the ground adjoin covering.
In other example, similarly or alternatively can adjust balloon 702 and/or the beam angle of balloon 708
Maintain adjoin covering to attempt changing height along with balloon 714.
In some instances, balloon can be generally under the expectation stratosphere height of aerostat
The of the upper end of the first height (such as, 18km) of end and the expectation stratosphere height near aerostat
Operate between two height (such as, 25km).In order to along with balloon will height from the first Level Change to the
Two highly maintain the overlay area of relative constancy on ground, and the example at the first height launches the angle of pattern
Degree span can be about 90 ° (such as, have the radiation pattern of the general conical of 45 ° of half widths), and
Angular span at the example transmitting pattern of the second height can be about 70 ° and (such as, have 36 ° of half widths
The radiation pattern of general conical).
In another example, the beam angle towards the signal of communication on ground from balloon is adjustable to
The change of reply ground level height above sea level.Such as, balloon can include antenna, and the transmitting pattern of this antenna is based on gas
Ball adjusts relative to the height of the ground level immediately below balloon.In other words, launching pattern can be based on
The absolute altitude relative to sea level such as detected by ambient pressure is adjusted, or can be extraly
Or it is alternatively based on and adjusts relative to the height on ground.Thus, balloon can be configured at least partly
Ground compensates the change of relative altitude (such as, owing to balloon is at the overlying regions with height above ground level change
By and the change of relative altitude that causes) to maintain at least constant of the radiation arriving ground level
Geographical expanses and/or intensity level.In one example, balloon may pass through and has a series of ground elevation
The region (such as, hills, mountain valley, slope, region of no relief, mountain range etc.) changed.Example balloon is movable
State adjusts its radiation pattern towards the antenna on ground to compensate the spoke arriving ground from balloon at least in part
The change depending on height penetrated.Such as, launching pattern can be High aititude region (with low relative altitude)
Top is relatively wide.Similarly, launching pattern can be on low altitude area region (with high relative altitude)
Side is relative narrower.
In some instances, can be by predetermined ground level elevation data combining position information (such as, such as GPS
Determined by receptor etc.) and balloon on one or more height sensors (such as, altimeter
And/or pressure transducer etc.) determine relative altitude (that is, the distance from ground to balloon).Determining
When the positional information (such as longitude and latitude coordinate) of balloon, addressable map data base determines
Correspondingly plane height above sea level immediately below balloon.Ground level height above sea level can by the computer system on balloon (such as,
The computer system 312 being similar in the payload 306 of balloon 300) and/or remote with balloon communication
Journey server determines, this ground level height above sea level subsequently can with such as via the height of the balloon determined from belt sensor
In conjunction with to determine the distance (that is, relative altitude) from balloon to ground.In other example, balloon can wrap
Include the sensor being configured to directly sense and/or determine the relative altitude of balloon, the most prone radar
Etc..
In another example, the beam angle of balloon is adjustable to tackle owing to atmospheric effect is (the most right
Synoptic model in fluid layer) impact on the radiation from balloon that causes.As example, the spy of spectrum
Fixed part can increase and quick to vile weather by such as steam and/or drop owing to weakening radiation in troposphere
Sense.In order to realize the expectation radiant intensity (such as, minimum signal to noise ratio) at ground level, then may be in response to inspection
Measure particular weather pattern and make transmitting pattern narrow.In other words, radiation pattern can narrow thus increase
Directional gain in the irradiation area of ground level, with big between ground level and aerostat of reply
Gas weakens the synoptic model of radiation.In some instances, the effect that such weather is relevant can be by dynamically
Detection synoptic model and correspondingly with the reply of the system of balloon communication.In other example, such weather
Relevant effect directly can detect via the sensor on balloon.Additionally or alternatively, can be by inspection
Measure signal intensity at the station of ground level to deteriorate and infer such weather conditions (and/or other letter
Number corruptions).In other words, in the signal to noise ratio (or other tolerance to signal intensity) of the ground station
It is used as the feedback information transmitting pattern for the antenna towards ground dynamically adjusted on balloon, from
And adjust its directional gain.
In other example, can position based on balloon multiple while change (potentially include level
Position change and Level Change) come the communication beams towards ground on one or more balloons
Beam angle is adjusted.Such as, replace along with individual balloon altitude changes the area of coverage of this balloon of holding
Territory relative constancy, can alternatively increase or reduce the beam angle of balloon near other in case maintain for
Adjoining of specific region covers or desired cover grade.Control system can utilize disclosed system and
Method is also to adjust and (including comprising the network of hundreds of or thousand of balloon) in more complicated network
The beam angle of the signal of communication towards ground of balloon.
