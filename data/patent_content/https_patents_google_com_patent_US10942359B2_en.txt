Definitions
- the present disclosure is generally directed to systems, devices, and methods relating to optical engines, for example, optical engines for laser projectors used in wearable heads-up displays or other applications.
- a projector is an optical device that projects or shines a pattern of light onto another object (e.g., onto a surface of another object, such as onto a projection screen) in order to display an image or video on that other object.
- a projector necessarily includes a light source, and a laser projector is a projector for which the light source comprises at least one laser.
- the at least one laser is temporally modulated to provide a pattern of laser light and usually at least one controllable mirror is used to spatially distribute the modulated pattern of laser light over a two-dimensional area of another object. The spatial distribution of the modulated pattern of laser light produces an image at or on the other object.
- At least one controllable mirror may be used to control the spatial distribution, and may include: a single digital micromirror (e.g., a microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based digital micromirror) that is controllably rotatable or deformable in two dimensions, or two digital micromirrors that are each controllably rotatable or deformable about a respective dimension, or a digital light processing (“DLP”) chip comprising an array of digital micromirrors.
- MEMS microelectromechanical system
- DLP digital light processing
- each respective laser diode may have a corresponding respective focusing lens.
- Each of the laser diodes of a laser module are typically housed in a separate package (e.g., a TO-38 package or “can”).
- the relative positions of the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror are all tuned and aligned so that each laser beam impinges on the at least one controllable mirror with substantially the same spot size and with substantially the same rate of convergence (so that all laser beams will continue to have substantially the same spot size as they propagate away from the laser projector towards, e.g., a projection screen).
- a conventional laser projector it is usually possible to come up with such a configuration for all these elements because the overall form factor of the device is not a primary design consideration.
- the form factor of the laser projector is an important design element, it can be very challenging to find a configuration for the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror that sufficiently aligns the laser beams (at least in terms of spot size, spot position, and rate of convergence) while satisfying the form factor constraints.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment.
- a “combiner” component of a wearable heads-up display is the physical structure where display light and environmental light merge as one within the user's field of view. The combiner of a wearable heads-up display is typically transparent to environmental light but includes some optical routing mechanism to direct display light into the user's field of view.
- wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- a wearable heads-up display The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, users also care a lot about aesthetics and comfort. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal or comfort. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date employ relatively large components and, as a result, are considerably bulkier, less comfortable and less stylish than conventional eyeglass frames.
- Femtosecond laser micro-machining is a direct-laser-write and rapid prototyping technique that provides great potential for optical device fabrication. Strong focusing of femtosecond laser light into transparent glass can induce positive refractive index modifications up to 0.01 refractive index units (RIU) within the material and without surface damage. Since then, ultrafast (femto/pico-second) lasers have been shown to enable flexible 3D structuring of various glasses, and has led to the demonstration of many types of optical devices (waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.) that serve as building blocks for 3D optical circuits.
- optical devices waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.
- Direct-laser-writing uses ultrashort laser pulses to confine strong nonlinear optical interactions that may induce, for example, positive or negative refractive index changes in bulk transparent materials for creating optical waveguides (WGs).
- the mechanisms by which direct-laser-write modifications occur include, but are not limited to, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, electron-atom collisions, plasma interactions, thermal effects (e.g. diffusion, heat accumulation), energy dissipation, and material cooling leading to inhomogeneous solidification.
- waveguide performance can be tuned and optimized by, but not limited to, the writing laser's properties (pulse duration, pulse temporal shape, bandwidth and shape, pulse repetition rate, wavelength, polarization, and beam spatial shape) and the focusing conditions (lens numerical aperture, air/liquid immersion, translation direction and speeds).

- hermetic refers to a seal which is airtight, that is, a seal which excludes the passage of air, oxygen, and other gases. “Hermetic” within the present specification carries this meaning. Further, “partially hermetic” as used herein refers to a seal which limits, but does not necessarily completely prevent, the passage of gases such as air. “Partially hermetic” as used herein may alternatively be stated as “reduced hermiticity”. In the example above, adhesives may be used to bond components. Such adhesives may result in a seal being not completely hermetic, in that some amount of gasses may slowly leak through the adhesive. However, such a seal can still be considered “partially hermetic” or as having “reduced hermiticity”, because the seal reduces the flow of gasses therethrough.
- the life of laser diodes 110 and transparency of optical window 130 may be maintained longer than the life of a battery of a device, such that partial hermiticity may be acceptable for the devices.
- even protecting interior volume 132 from particulate with a dust cover may be sufficient to maintain laser diodes 110 and transparency of optical window 130 for the intended lifespan of the device.
- laser diodes 110 and transparency of optical window 130 may last for the intended lifespan of the device even without a protective cover.

- one or more of the laser diodes 710 may be mounted directly on the base substrate 702 without use of a submount.
- coupling may be accomplished inside the encapsulated package. Such feature eliminates the requirement for a separate window, as the waveguide 600 services as the window (e.g., optical window 730 ).
- the plurality of grating couplers of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned inside the interior volume of the encapsulated package and the at least one optical output coupler of the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned outside of the interior volume, for example.
- the components of the optical engine 700 may be bonded together using no adhesives.

- FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of a laser writing system 800 in accordance with the present systems, designs and methods.
- Laser writing system 800 comprises at least writing laser 810 , focusing optic 812 , writeable glass 820 and translatable mount 830 .
- glass is used herein for convenience, any appropriate laser-writable material could be used in place of writeable glass 820 .
- Writing laser 810 emits laser light 811 .
- Laser light 811 comprises short (femptosecond and/or picosecond length) pulses of laser light; consequently, laser light 811 has extremely high peak instantaneous power.
- Focusing optic 812 focuses laser light 811 to focal point 813 .
- Writeable glass 820 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material, which is typically transparent to the laser light 811 emitted by the writing laser 810 ; in other words the light emitted by the writing laser generally will not be absorbed by the glass via typical (linear) optical processes.
- the intensity of laser light 811 is very high due to the combination of spatial focusing (focusing the beam of writing laser light 811 to a small point 813 ) and temporal focusing (emitting the laser light 811 as extremely short femptosecond or picosecond pulses).
- the high intensity of light at the focal point 813 allows nonlinear optical processes such as multiphoton absorption, avalanche ionization, Coulomb collisions (causing lattice ionization and breakdown), and heat conduction to occur in the writeable glass 820 , absorbing the light and changing the refractive index of the glass.
- the change in refractive index may be a positive increase in refractive index.
- Writeable glass 820 can be physically coupled to translatable mount 830 , such as by using clamps 821 , adhesive, or any other appropriate coupling mechanism. Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such that writeable glass 820 can be detached from translatable mount 830 after laser writing is complete. Translation of translatable mount 830 in the X, Y, and/or Z direction will result in corresponding translation of writeable glass 820 , moving the location of focal point 813 within writeable glass 820 . Translating the writeable glass 820 relative to focal point 813 can create a region of changed refractive index in the writeable glass 820 . An increased refractive index in this region causes any light channeled therethrough to experience total internal reflection, thus forming waveguide 822 . In other words, waveguide 822 can be formed as a continuous path of increased refractive index within writeable glass 820 created by laser light 811 at focal point 813 .
- the technique of FIG. 8 can be used to laser write at least one waveguide into writeable glass 820 .

- Writing at least one waveguide may include writing an individual waveguide for each wavelength of light impinging on the writeable glass 820 , where each waveguide comprises a respective input facet (such as an input grating coupler) and a respective output facet. Each output facet may be positioned to provide light to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc.
- four waveguides could be written into writeable glass 820 , one waveguide for each beam of light 610 a , 610 b , 610 c , and 610 d .
- Four grating couplers could also be written, one for each waveguide.

- the aggregate beam may be provided to other components or modules, such as a scan mirror of a laser projector, etc.
- the photonic integrated circuit 600 may include one or more diffractive optical elements (DOE) and/or refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a - d in order to achieve coaxial superposition.
- DOE diffractive optical elements
- refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a - d in order to achieve coaxial superposition.
- each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit can be positioned relatively far from the other input facets, to receive laser light from a respective laser diode, but the output facets for each of the waveguides can be positioned relatively close together.
- a spacing between the output facets of each waveguide can be smaller than a spacing of the input facets of each waveguide.
- each waveguide can be optimized for performance with light of a corresponding wavelength, for example to ensure that each wavelength of light exits the photonic integrated circuit with the same divergence angle as each other wavelength.
- the output of each individual waveguide can be placed close enough together (on the order of 10 s of microns) such that that the light output by each individual waveguide may still follow the same optical path through the rest of a projector, display, or WHUD assembly where the photonic integrated circuit is implemented.
- FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a method 900 of manufacturing an optical engine, in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- the method 900 may be implemented to manufacture the optical engine 700 of FIG. 7 , for example.

Further, the acts discussed below may be performed in an order different than the order presented herein.

- the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned against an optical window of the cap, such that laser light from the laser diodes may pass through the optical window directly into the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit.
- the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned directly against the cap, such that the photonic integrated circuit acts as the optical window, and laser light from the laser diodes may directly enter the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit.
- each laser diode In order for light to travel through a photonic integrated circuit, the light emitted by each laser diode should preferably be aligned with a respective input facet of the photonic integrated circuit with high precision; mis-alignment of greater than 10 micrometers may significantly reduce the efficiency of the photonic integrated circuit.
- An output facet of each laser diode may have dimensions smaller than four square micrometers; aligning such small components to such high precision presents a non-trivial technical challenge.
- each input facet of the photonic integrate circuit could be written as a grating coupler as shown in FIG. 6 , which increases the tolerances for misalignment.
- a collimation lens may be provided such that a coaxially superimposed beam of light from the output edge of the photonic integrated circuit will be collimated by the collimation lens.
- the collimation lens may optionally optimize the spot (e.g., circularize) the coaxially superimposed beam. In some implementations, more than one collimation lens may be provided if the light output from the photonic integrated circuit is not a fully coaxially superimposed beam.

Unless context below dictates otherwise, the disclosure of components in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 is applicable to similarly numbered components in FIG. 10A and will not be repeated in the interests of brevity.
- Photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 a includes laser writing system 800 , which, during operation, writes a photonic integrated circuit in a block of writeable glass 820 in a manner similar to the operation of laser writing system 800 described above with reference to FIG. 8 .
- Photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 a can be utilized to manufacture an optical engine using a process that is similar in at least some respects to method 900 of FIG. 9 , but with photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 a , act 914 can be performed before act 912 , as detailed below.
- Writeable glass 820 is bonded to cap 720 prior to writing a photonic integrated circuit therein, using any of the bonding techniques discussed above.
- the writeable glass 820 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material that undergoes a change in refractive index when exposed to high-intensity laser light. Bonding the writeable glass to the cap includes positioning and orienting the writeable glass 820 relative to each laser diode 710 to place the writeable glass 820 in the path of the beam of light emitted by each laser diode 710 , such that the beam of light emitted by each laser diode 710 impinges on the writeable glass.
- Writeable glass 820 can be positioned against optical window 730 , such that beams of light from laser diodes 710 pass through optical window 730 directly into writeable glass 820 .
- the writeable glass 820 may optionally form optical window 730 .
- the entire base substrate 702 and all components bonded thereto can be physically coupled to translatable mount 830 , such as with clamps 821 , adhesives, and/or any other appropriate coupling mechanism.
- Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such that base substrate 702 and all components bonded thereto can be detached from translatable mount 830 after laser writing of writeable glass 820 is complete.
- At least one waveguide 822 can be laser written into writeable glass 820 by translating base substrate 702 and all components thereon using translatable mount 830 .
- At least one input facet 612 (for example at least one grating input coupler) can also be written into writeable glass 820 by translating base substrate 702 and all components thereon using translatable mount 830 . Consequently, writeable glass 820 becomes a photonic integrated circuit.
- laser diodes 710 could be activated, thus causing beams of light therefrom to impinge on writeable glass 820 .
- Writing laser 810 can be aligned to directly write waveguides and input facets (e.g. grating couplers as shown in FIG. 10A ) at the exact location where the beams of light from laser diodes 710 impinge on the writeable block 820 . In this way, the input facets of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit.
- the writeable glass 820 could be illuminated, such as by being backlit if base substrate 702 is at least partially transparent.
- Writing laser 810 can then be aligned to directly write waveguides based on locations of shadows caused by laser diodes 710 , CoS's 712 and optical redirector element 718 . In this way, the input facets of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit.
- Aligning the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit to the beams of light during the writing stage will be more accurate than trying to mechanically align a pre-fabricated photonic integrated circuit, due to deviations that can arise in the bonding processes of not only the pre-fabricated photonic integrate circuit, but also the laser diodes.
- the laser diodes As one example, if each of four laser diodes is randomly misaligned, it would be difficult to align a prefabricated photonic integrated circuit to match the beam of light from each diode, since not only could the photonic integrated circuit be misaligned during the bonding processes, but also the spacing between each laser diode may not match the spacing between each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit due to the random misalignment of each of the laser diodes.
- Direct laser writing the photonic integrated circuit after all of the components have been mechanically bonded obviates these issues, by allowing the position and spacing of each laser diode relative to the writeable glass to be accounted for after bonding is complete.
- FIG. 10B is a left side sectional view of photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 b .
- Photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 b includes components that may be substantively similar to components of photonic integrated circuit writing system 1000 a as discussed with regards to FIG. 10A .

- the light beam 1302 may diverge with full width half maximum (FWHM) angles of up to 40 degrees in the fast axis direction 1306 and up to 10 degrees in the slow axis direction 1308 . This divergence results in a rapidly expanding elliptical cone.

Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 15A and 15B , light beam 1302 is collimated along both fast axis 1306 and slow axis 1308 by a second lens 1502 .
