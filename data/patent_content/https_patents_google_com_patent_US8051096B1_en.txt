Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to text segmentation and, more particularly, to methods and systems for augmenting a token lexicon.
- Text processing methods and systems exist that attempt to interpret data representing text. Text processing is made more difficult when text comprising a string of characters is received that has no breaks indicating words or other tokens.
- the characters can be segmented into tokens in order to interpret the string.
- Tokens can be words, acronyms, abbreviations, proper names, geographical names, stock market ticker symbols, or other suitable symbolic expressions.
- a string of characters can be segmented into multiple combinations of segmented strings of characters using existing methods and systems. Recognizing tokens can be made more difficult when a string of characters contains misspellings, abbreviations, unusual terms, or proper names.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for augmenting a token lexicon.
- One aspect of one embodiment of the present invention comprises identifying a first token from a search request, storing the first token in a lexicon data storage, receiving a character string comprising a second token, wherein the second token is substantially similar to the first token, and parsing the character string using the lexicon data storage to resolve the second token.
- a method comprises identifying a first token from an internet article, storing the first token in a lexicon data storage, receiving a character string comprising a second token, wherein the second token is substantially similar to the first token, and parsing the character string using the lexicon data storage to resolve the second token.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram of a system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method carried out by the present invention.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for augmenting a token lexicon.
- a token lexicon can be words, acronyms, abbreviations, proper names, geographical names, stock market ticker symbols, or other suitable symbolic expressions.
- the additional tokens can come from a search log containing a record of search queries or from other sources such as web pages, instant messaging dialogs, or chat sessions. Using a search log or other unedited sources of tokens can help identify misspellings, abbreviations, or other unusual or unique tokens to add to the lexicon.
- the lexicon can then be used to better identify tokens within strings containing misspellings, abbreviations, and unusual or unique tokens.

In one embodiment, there are multiple indexes each containing a portion of the total articles indexed. It should be appreciated that other methods for indexing articles in lieu of or in combination with crawling may be used, such as manual submission.
- server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to help explain method illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- One exemplary method according to the present invention comprises identifying a first token from a search request, storing the first token in a lexicon data storage, receiving a character string comprising a second token, wherein the second token can be substantially similar to the first token, and parsing the character string using the lexicon data storage to resolve the second token.
- the second token can be identical to the first token and can comprise at least one of a misspelled token, a domain name, an abbreviation, and a proper name.
- the lexicon can comprise an ontology.
- the ontology can comprise a concept associated with the first token and association data indicating an association between the first token and an interrelated token.
- the first token can be filtered, which can comprise one or more of identifying a threshold frequency, identifying a minimum number of characters, and restricting to a character set.
- the character string can comprise a domain name.
- a method comprises comprising identifying a first token from an internet article, storing the first token in a lexicon data storage, receiving a character string comprising a second token, wherein the second token can be substantially similar to the first token, parsing the character string using the lexicon data storage to resolve the second token.
- the Internet article can comprise one or more of an instant messaging dialog, a chat session, or a web page.
- the second token can be identical to the first token and can comprise at least one of a misspelled token, a domain name, an abbreviation, and a proper name.
- the lexicon can comprise an ontology.
- the ontology can comprise a concept associated with the first token and association data indicating an association between the first token and an interrelated token.
- the first token can be filtered, which can comprise one or more of identifying a threshold frequency, identifying a minimum number of characters, and restricting to a character set.
- the character string can comprise a domain name.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary method 200 for improving text segmentation by identifying tokens from a data source and adding the tokens to a lexicon.
- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by one or a combination of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIG. 2 .
- Accessing a source of possible tokens can comprise, for example, accessing a search log of search queries from the server device 150 , accessing articles on the network 106 such as emails, instant messages, web pages, mailing list archives, and other suitable sources of tokens.
- accessing a source of possible tokens can comprise accessing a source likely to contain unedited or unconventional tokens.
- a search log of search queries can contain search terms that have not been edited for misspellings, etc.
- the search log can therefore contain a record of misspelled tokens that can be used to supplement a token lexicon.
- web pages can contain words, expressions, symbols and terminology unique to an Internet setting that may not be available in traditional lexicons.
- instant messaging and chat articles can contain proper names and other tokens likely to be unique and thus less likely to appear in traditional lexicons.
- the method 200 proceeds to block 206 , wherein the segmentation processor 122 identifies a first string within the source of possible tokens as a token. Identifying a first string as a token can comprise, for example, identifying a character such as a space separating tokens within the data source. For example, a search log of search queries can contain the search query “harmon kardon amplifilers.” The segmentation processor 122 can identify three separate tokens—“harmon,” “kardon,” and “amplifilers”—within the search query based on the spacing between the search terms. According to other embodiments, other suitable criteria or delineators can be used to identify tokens within a string of characters.
- a source of pre-segmented text can be used.
- the search engine 156 can store a history of search queries each of which comprises one or more tokens than can be used by the lexicon processor 124 directly to supplement a token lexicon.
- the method 300 proceeds to block 208 , wherein the lexicon processor 124 adds the token to a lexicon.
- Adding the token to a lexicon can comprise, for example, filtering the token and storing the token in a lexicon data storage such as the token database 126 .
- Filtering the token can be used to improve efficiency and can comprise, for example, determining a threshold frequency for the token determining minimum requirements for the token, or using another suitable filtering criterion.
- a frequency for the token can be determined by identifying how many times the token appears in a sample set of articles on the network 106 .
- the lexicon processor can access the index 160 attached to the server device 150 .
- the lexicon processor can access a separate frequency database or crawl the network to determine a frequency on the fly.
- filtering based on frequency can comprise determining that a token appears a minimum number of times in a source, such as in a search log, prior to adding the token to a database.
- a source such as in a search log
- filtering based on frequency can comprise determining that a token appears a minimum number of times in a source, such as in a search log, prior to adding the token to a database.
- Filtering tokens based on minimum requirements for a token can comprise, for example, a minimum number of characters or restricting characters to a specific character set.
- a minimum requirement can be set that a token contain at least three letters or that a token contain at least one of a certain type of character such as a letter or number, for example.
- a requirement can be set that a token comprise characters from a particular character set, such as English letters or symbols for example.
- all tokens can be added to the token database 126 without filtering.
- Adding the token to the token database 120 can comprise including the token in a lexicon of tokens.
- the lexicon of tokens can comprise a simple listing of all tokens or can further contain additional data associated with each token.
- the lexicon can comprise an ontology containing meanings and concepts associated with each token and allowing relationships and associations between tokens to be identified and stored. For example, the ontology can associate tokens comprising misspellings or alternate spellings with a token comprising a correct or preferred spelling.
- the token “amplifilers” can be associated with the correctly spelled token “amplifiers.” Additionally, the token “amplifilers” can be associated with concepts associated with the correctly spelled “amplifiers,” which can include, for example, consumer electronics, stereo equipment, and music.
- the lexicon processor 124 can utilize a spell checking application program also known as a spell checker.
- the spell checker can reside in memory 118 on the server device 104 or on another device in communication with the lexicon processor 124 .
- the method 200 proceeds to block 210 , wherein the segmentation processor identifies at least one token in a second string based on the tokens in the lexicon. Identifying the token in the second string can comprise, for example, resolving tokens within the second string by identifying tokens that are identical or substantially similar to the tokens in the lexicon.
- the segmentation processor 122 can receive from the client device 102 a a string comprising text, such as a domain name, entered by the user 112 a into a URL field of a web browser application.
- a domain name can comprise an actual domain name that is misspelled, a domain name that cannot be found or does not exist on the network 106 , or any other suitable domain name that may or may not be located by a server device.
- the user 112 a can enter the text “hoffmanamplifilers” into the URL field of a web browser application on the client device 102 a .
- the web browser may be unable to resolve the URL request because the URL was misspelled or because it does not exist.
- the segmentation processor 122 can receive the text “hoffmanamplifilers” from the client device 102 a and identify that the tokens “hoffman,” and “amplifiers'” from the lexicon in the token database 126 are contained in the string “hoffmanamplifilers.”
- Recognizing the token “amplifiers” can be facilitated by the earlier addition of the token “amplifiers” to the lexicon.
- a search log can indicate that users on the network 106 commonly misspell the term “amplifiers.”
- the search log can indicate that “amplifilers,” for example, is a common misspelling of “amplifiers” and the token “amplifilers” can be added to the lexicon.
- the text “hoffmanamplifilers” can be entered by the user 112 a as a URL.
- the URL string “hoffmanamplifilers” can be separated based in part on identifying the token “amplifiers” that was added to the lexicon from the search log and then parsing the remaining portion of the string into the token “hoffman.”
- the segmentation processor can then associate the token “amplifiers” with the correctly spelled “amplifiers” and use the correctly spelled token “amplifiers” together with “hoffman” to identify an existing web page likely to be responsive to the URL the user 112 a attempted to access, even though the terms “hoffman amplifiers” may not have explicitly appeared together in a previous search query, based on correctly identifying the token “amplifiers” from the misspelled token “amplifiers” and parsing the remaining token “hoffman.”
- the segmentation processor 122 can receive the second string from the server device 150 , over the network 106 , or from another suitable source of data to be parsed based on the tokens in the lexicon in the token database 126 . Once the segmentation processor 122 identifies tokens in a second string based on the lexicon, the method 200 proceeds to block 212 , wherein the exemplary method 200 ends.
