Abstract
Aspects of the subject technology relate to creating electronic calendar events. The set of event properties is identified from the message content and participants of the electronic message thread. An electronic calendar event including event attributes based on the set of event properties is created.
Description
Background
Users may discuss various topics with each other using electronic messages (e.g., email, text message, instant message, etc.). When topics such as social events are discussed among users, users can exchange a large number of electronic messages to determine event details (e.g., date, time, location, attendees, etc.) of the social event. Tracking event details propagated through multiple electronic messages and determining the latest event details can be cumbersome.
Disclosure of Invention
Aspects of the subject technology relate to electronic event management. A set of event properties is identified from message content and participants of an electronic message thread (thread) that includes one or more electronic messages. An electronic calendar event is created based on the set of event properties.
Aspects of the subject technology also relate to electronic event management. An electronic message thread is received that includes one or more electronic messages. A first set of event properties is identified from the message content and participants of the electronic message topic. The electronic calendar event including the event attribute is based on the first set of event properties. A calendar event interface displaying event attributes is provided for display. A second set of event properties is identified from the content of a subsequent electronic message received from the electronic message topic. Event attributes of the electronic calendar event are updated based on the second set of event properties. In this way, electronic calendar events may be kept up-to-date and consistent with information in electronic message themes.
Aspects of the subject technology also relate to electronic event management. A first electronic message topic including one or more messages is received from a messaging system. A first set of event properties is identified from message content of a first electronic message topic. A proposed event interface is provided for display of event information generated based on the first set of event properties. In response to a confirmation input received via the proposal event interface, an electronic calendar event including event attributes based on the event information is created. A second electronic message topic is received. A second set of event properties is identified from the message content and participants of the second electronic message topic. The first electronic message topic and the second electronic message topic are reconciled in response to the second set of event properties matching a portion of event attributes of the electronic calendar event and one or more of the first electronic message topic participants matching one or more of the second electronic message topic participants. Event attributes of the electronic calendar event are updated based on the second set of event properties. In this manner, event attributes may be more accurately determined than when matching from event properties determined from only a single electronic message topic.
It will be appreciated that other configurations of the subject technology will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described in an illustrative manner. It will be appreciated that the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Detailed Description
The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The accompanying drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description may include specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the subject technology concepts.
Electronic messaging facilitates communication and collaboration of information among a group of users of an electronic messaging system. For example, a user group may participate in an electronic session via electronic messaging to introduce and discuss details of social events (e.g., date, time, location, etc.). However, the format of the electronic message topic may not provide the participants with the best mechanism for disclosing the details of the social event. Lengthy thread, large numbers of participants, and alternate (shifting) event details all render the thread ineffective in reconciling the details of the social event. Ineffective coordination requires more messaging, which increases congestion within the electrical messaging system and across the communication network.
The subject technology solves reconciliation and congestion problems by analyzing electronic messages exchanged between users over a network, identifying event properties from the electronic messages, and creating calendar events based on the event properties. In this manner, the subject technology provides a mechanism for exposing and transforming the content of an electronic message topic having a plurality of messages for a multitude of participants to an electronic message topic in a different format (calendar events associated with the participant's user account) that is more readily accessible and discernable by the participants. In accordance with aspects of the subject technology, event properties may be identified from message content and participants of an electronic message topic. These event properties parsed from the electronic message topic may be transformed into event properties of the electronic calendar event created and associated with the user account of the participant.
FIG. 1 illustrates an example network environment 100 for creating and managing electronic calendar events in accordance with the subject technology. Network environment 100 includes computing devices 102, 104, and 106, and servers 110 and 114. In some aspects, network environment 100 may have more or fewer computing devices (e.g., 102-106) and/or servers (e.g., 110 and 114) than those shown in FIG. 1.
Each of computing devices 102, 104, and 106 may represent various forms of processing devices having processors, memory, and communication capabilities. Computing devices 102, 104, and 106 may communicate with each other, with servers 110 and 114, and/or with other systems and devices not shown in fig. 1. As non-limiting examples, the processing device may include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a network appliance, a camera, a smart phone, an Enhanced General Packet Radio Service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a gaming machine, or a combination of any of these or other processing devices.
Each of computing devices 102, 104, and 106 may be provided with one or more messaging applications (e.g., email applications, text messaging applications, instant messaging applications, voice messaging applications, and/or social networking service applications). Computing devices 102, 104, and 106 may execute computer instructions to run messaging applications. Users of respective computing devices (e.g., will, janet, and Larry) may utilize a messaging application to create electronic messages, send and/or receive electronic messages with each other and/or users not depicted in fig. 1, and view electronic message titles. The messaging application may transmit and receive electronic messages to and from a server 110 (e.g., a messaging system) via the network 108.
Each of computing devices 102, 104, and 106 may also be provided with one or more calendar applications. Computing devices 102, 104, and 106 may execute computer instructions to run one or more calendar applications. Calendar applications may allow users (e.g., will, janet, and Larry) to maintain user schedules and track calendar events. A user may utilize a calendar application to, for example, create a calendar event, share the calendar event with other users, invite other users to the calendar event. The calendar application may transmit and receive data corresponding to user schedules and calendar events to and from a server 114 (e.g., a calendar system) via the network 108.
The network 108 may be a computer network such as, for example, a Local Area Network (LAN), wide Area Network (WAN), the internet, a cellular network, or a combination thereof, connecting any number of mobile clients, fixed clients, and servers. Further, the network 108 may include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including bus networks, star networks, ring networks, mesh networks, star bus networks, tree or hierarchical networks, and the like. In some aspects, communication between each client (e.g., computing devices 102, 104, and 106) and server (e.g., server 110) may occur via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), secure Shell (SSH) tunnel, secure Socket Layer (SSL) communication, or other secure network connection. In some aspects, the network 108 may further include a corporate network (e.g., an intranet) and one or more wireless access points.
Each of servers 110 and 114 may represent a single computing device, such as a computer server including a processor and memory. The processor may execute computer instructions stored in the memory. Servers 110 and 114 may be geographically co-located and/or servers 110 and 114 may be located in different locations. In some aspects, servers 110 and 114 may collectively represent a computer server. In some aspects, servers 110 and 114 may each be implemented using multiple distributed computing devices. Servers 110 and 114 are configured to communicate with client applications (e.g., electronic messaging applications, calendar applications, etc.) on client devices (e.g., computing devices 102, 104, and 106) via network 108.
Server 110 may be an electronic messaging system (e.g., an email server, a text message server, an instant message server, a voice message server, a social networking server, etc.) that manages the exchange of electronic messages between user accounts of the electronic messaging system. The server 110 may include a data store 112 for storing user account login information for a user (e.g., will, janet, or Larry), contact information associated with a user account (e.g., email address of a contact, phone number of a contact, etc.), and electronic messages exchanged between the user account and the associated contact, for example.
Server 114 may be a calendar system that maintains a user's electronic calendar and tracks electronic calendar events. The calendar system may allow electronic calendar events to be created and added to the user's calendar. The server 114 may include a data store 116 for storing, for example, login information for a user (e.g., will, janet, or Larry) and electronic calendar information for the user. In some aspects, the calendar system may be integrated with an electronic messaging system.
In some aspects, the electronic messaging system may further include an event management system that receives the electronic message, identifies calendar event details discussed in the electronic message, and creates an electronic calendar event based on the calendar event details in the user calendar on the calendar system. In one or more implementations, the computing device 102, the computing device 104, the computing device 106, the server 110, or the server 114 may be or may include all or part of the electronic system components discussed below with respect to fig. 6.
To the extent that the systems discussed herein collect personal information about a user or may utilize personal information, the user is provided with a control program or function to collect user information (e.g., information about the user's contacts, the user's preferences, or the user's current location), and control the number of electronic messages that the system can maintain and analyze, the types of electronic messages that are maintained and analyzed by the system (e.g., participants based on the electronic messages), or opportunities to access the user's calendar information. The user may also be provided with the option to turn on or off certain features or functions provided by the system. In some aspects, a user may choose to disable features and functions provided by the event management system discussed herein (e.g., electronic message content analysis, creating calendar events in a user calendar based on analysis results). In addition, the user may specify that certain data be processed in one or more ways prior to storing or using the certain data so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user (such as a city, zip code, or state level) may be summarized if location information is obtained such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, a user can control whether and how the disclosed system collects, stores, and uses user information.
FIG. 2 illustrates an example data flow in a system 200 for creating an electronic calendar event 232 in accordance with aspects of the subject technology. System 200 includes a messaging system 210, an event management system 220, and a calendar system 230. Although the messaging system 210, the event management system 220, and the calendar system 230 are depicted as separate systems, the event management system 220, the messaging system 210, and the calendar system 230 may be combined in any combination. For example, the event management system 220 may reside in the messaging system 210 or the calendar system 230.
Messaging system 210 may allow client devices (e.g., computing devices 102, 104, and 106) to exchange electronic messages (e.g., text messages, email messages, instant messages, social network posts, or voice messages) with each other over one or more networks (e.g., network 108) using a messaging application in the client devices. For example, a first user of computing device 102 (e.g., will) may send electronic message 213 to a second user of computing device 104 (e.g., janet) and a third user of computing device 106 (e.g., larry). Messaging system 210 may receive electronic message 213 from computing device 102 and transmit electronic message 213 to computing devices 104 and 106. Messaging system 210 may support the exchange of subsequent reply electronic messages (e.g., electronic messages 215, 217, 219) among computing devices 102, 104, and 106.
Messaging system 210 may organize electronic messages (e.g., electronic messages 213, 215, 217, and 219) as electronic message threads (e.g., electronic message thread 211). For example, when messaging system 210 receives an electronic message (e.g., electronic message 213) from a client application on a client device (e.g., computing device 102), messaging system 210 may assign an electronic message topic Identifier (ID) to the electronic message. When messaging system 210 determines that the received electronic message (e.g., electronic message 213) is an initial electronic message based on the electronic message metadata, messaging system 210 may assign an electronic message topic ID (e.g., topic ID 212) to the initial electronic message (e.g., electronic message 213). Future reply messages to the original electronic message (e.g., electronic messages 215, 217, 219) may include the same electronic message topic ID (topic ID 212). In some aspects, the electronic message topic ID may be included in the header or metadata of future reply messages to allow construction of electronic message topics. Messaging system 210 may determine whether the electronic message is an initial message or a reply electronic message based on whether the electronic message includes a topic ID and the topic ID matches an existing topic ID. In some aspects, when electronic message 213 is not associated with an electronic message topic ID, messaging system 210 may identify electronic message 213 as the initial electronic message for electronic message topic 211.
Messaging system 210 may forward electronic message thread 211 to event management system 220. Messaging system 210 may forward electronic message threads 211 at predetermined intervals after a predetermined number of electronic messages are received or after each electronic message is received for electronic message thread 211. In some aspects, messaging system 210 may forward the electronic message to event management system 220 and send a command (e.g., an Application Program Interface (API) call) executable by management system 220 for processing the electronic message received in electronic message topic 211. In some aspects, event management system 220 may send commands (e.g., API calls) executable by messaging system 210 to send electronic message topic 211.
In some other aspects, calendar event details in the electronic message thread 211, such as event date, event time, event location, and/or possible event attendees, may be identified. After identifying calendar event details in the electronic message therein, messaging system 210 may forward electronic message thread 211. For example, the electronic message 213 includes an event name (e.g., dinner), an event date (e.g., tonight), an event time (e.g., 7:00pm (7:00 pm)). However, event location (e.g., resueurant a) information is not discussed until the electronic message 219. Messaging system 210 may send electronic message topic 211 to event management system 220 after receiving electronic message 219.
The event management system 220 includes a message analysis module 222 and an event creation module 226. The message analysis module 222 can analyze (e.g., parse) the messages of the electronic message thread to identify event properties (e.g., event properties 224) from the received electronic messages (e.g., electronic messages 213, 215, 217, 219) of the electronic message thread 211. For example, the message analysis module 222 may parse the header, metadata, and/or message body of the electronic message to identify event properties. Words, phrases, formats, etc. parsed from the electronic message may be compared to known words, phrases, or formats that may flag the nature of the event. These words, phrases, and formats may be organized in tables, graphs, or other data structures for use by the message analysis module 222 to identify event properties. The message analysis module 222 may use, for example, natural language processing to identify event properties 224 from the electronic message thread 211. The message analysis module 222 may identify the language used in the message thread from among the multiple languages supported by the system and process the message thread using the identified language. Message analysis module 222 may also analyze senders and recipients of messages from electronic message threads to identify potential participants in an event. Event properties 224 may include, for example, a time (e.g., 7:00 pm) of an electronic message (e.g., electronic message 213, 215, 217, 219), a date (e.g., tonight, 12/2), a location (e.g., resueurant a), an event name (e.g., dinner), a participant (e.g., sender and/or recipient) (e.g., will, janet, larry), and/or a topic ID (e.g., topic ID 212) of electronic message topic 211.
Event properties 224 may be forwarded to event creation module 226. In some aspects, the event properties 224 may be forwarded when a predetermined number of types of event properties are identified. For example, when the message analysis module 222 identifies a time and location from an electronic message, event properties may be forwarded to the event creation module 226.
The event creation module 226 may generate a proposed event data structure based on the event properties 224 forwarded by the message analysis module. Event creation module 226 may populate the proposed event interface data structure with images of Restaurant A (e.g., image 229), event titles (e.g., dinner), event dates and times (e.g., fri, dec 2,2016,7:00pm (12 th of 2016, friday, 7:00 pm)), and event locations (e.g., restarant A,123North A Street, … (… North A Street 123, A Restaurant)). For example, the event management system 220 may search for an image of restaurant A in an index of the profile of the entity stored on the server. The index of the entity profile may include a description and/or an image of the entity. In some aspects, the event management system 220 may search for images of restaurant A using the Internet (e.g., from a website of the restaurant, a website of a restaurant review, etc.). In other words, event data is supplemented from sources other than electronic messages. The event management system 220 may select an event title based on the content of the electronic message. The event management system 220 may also search for the physical address of restaurant A. The event creation module 226 may communicate with a calendar system 230 associated with the user account and verify that the date and time of the proposal does not conflict with the user's existing schedule before populating the proposal event interface data structure.
The event creation module 226 may generate and provide a proposed event interface 228 for display to a client device (e.g., computing device 102, 104, 106) based on the proposed event data structure. When the electronic message (e.g., electronic message 213, 215, 217, 219) of electronic message topic 211 includes less event properties than those depicted in FIG. 2, event creation module 226 may prompt the user to enter any missing event properties via proposed event interface 228. The proposal event interface 228 may include more or fewer event properties than depicted in fig. 2. The proposal event interface 228 may be provided with a confirmation button for the user to confirm event details. When the event creation module 226 receives a user action on the confirmation button indicating a user's confirmation of the event details and intent to create the electronic calendar event, the event creation module 226 sends instructions (e.g., an API call) executable by the calendar system 230 for creating the electronic calendar event based on the confirmed event properties of the proposed event interface 228. In some aspects, the calendar system 230 may provide a command (e.g., an API call) to the event creation module 226 for transmitting the validation event properties of the proposal event interface 228.
Alternatively, when the message analysis module 222 identifies the event property 224 from the received electronic message (e.g., electronic message 213, 215, 217, 219) of the electronic message thread 211, the event creation module 226 may forward the event property 224 and send instructions executable by the calendar system 230 to create an electronic calendar event without generating and displaying a proposed event interface to the user.
In response to instructions from the event creation module 226, the calendar system 230 may convert event properties identified on the proposal event interface 228 into event attributes and generate the electronic calendar event 232 based on the converted event attributes. For example, event attributes of the electronic calendar event 232 may include an event title (e.g., dinner), an event date (e.g., 12/2/2016), an event time (e.g., 7:00 pm), an event location (e.g., resueurant A,123North A street), and a participant (e.g., janet, larry, will). The calendar system 230 may add electronic calendar events 232 to the calendar system 230 in association with the user accounts of the participants. In some aspects, the calendar system 230 sends instructions executable by the messaging system 210 to display a summary of the calendar event in a message application interface on the client device when the user is discussing the created electronic calendar event 232 in the electronic message thread 211.
Roles and associated editing rights for electronic calendar events may be assigned based on electronic message threads. These roles and associated editing rights may be included in the proposal event data structure and passed to the calendar system 230. For example, a user account initiating an electronic message topic may be designated as the creator and/or owner of an electronic calendar event. As the creator and/or owner, the user account may be granted full editing rights. Other participants may be assigned guest roles that may or may not include full or limited editing rights. If the user account from which the electronic message thread originated cannot be operated by accessing the event management system 220 or calendar system 230 described herein, the originating user account may be assigned a master role and another participant, such as one that triggered creation of an electronic calendar event via a proposal event interface, may be assigned a creator role with full editing rights. The roles assigned to different user accounts with respect to the electronic calendar event may be altered based on subsequent electronic messages received in the electronic message thread indicating different participation levels of the different user accounts.
In some aspects, some functions of the event management system 220 may be performed by the messaging system 210. For example, rather than forwarding electronic messages 213, 215, 217, and 219 or electronic message topic 211, messaging system 210 may parse event properties from the message and forward the event properties to event management system 220. For example, messaging system 210 may parse an electronic message for an electronic message topic and determine whether a predetermined event trigger term is included in the electronic message. In some aspects, the event management system 220 may include an analysis library that stores event trigger words. For example, an event trigger term may include a term that indicates people gathering or gathering. If the messaging system determines that the electronic message includes one or more predetermined event trigger words, the messaging system may forward the electronic message topic to the event management system. In some other aspects, when messaging system 210 determines that the participants of electronic message thread 211 are discussing and reconciling the event together, messaging system 210 may forward the nature of the event to event management system 220. In some aspects, some functions of the event management system 220 (e.g., functions of the event creation module 226) may be performed by the calendar system 230.
3A-3D illustrate example user interfaces 300-330 for creating electronic calendar events in accordance with aspects of the subject technology. For simplicity of discussion, the user interfaces 300-330 may be provided for display on a computing device (e.g., computing device 102) of a user named Will. Fig. 3A illustrates a user interface 300 depicting electronic message exchanges (e.g., text messages) among three users Janet, larry, and Will. The first user Will initiate an electronic message topic by sending an electronic message to the second user (e.g., janet) and the third user (e.g., larry) via a messaging system (e.g., text messaging system). For example, a first user sends a message 301 to a second user and a third user, the message 301 reading as "dinner tonight at 7:00pm (this evening dinner at 7:00 pm)".
The messaging system may identify the message 301 as an initial electronic message and assign a topic ID (e.g., topic ID 212) to the message 301. Subsequent replies to message 301 are associated with a topic ID 212. In some aspects, the messaging system may determine that message 301 includes an event trigger word and send message 301 to an event management system.
Continuing on to subsequent messages in the electronic message thread in the user interface 300, the second user agrees to the first user's proposal via reply message 302. The first user also requests advice for the evening meal venue by sending message 303. In response to message 303, the third user may reply with a Restaurant name (e.g., "resueurant A") in message 304. The first user replies to message 304 by agreeing to the suggestion from the third user in message 305. In some aspects, after a predetermined number of types of event properties (e.g., date, time, location of event) are discussed in the electronic message thread, the messaging system may send the electronic message thread to the event management system.
An event management system (e.g., event management system 220) may identify event properties (e.g., event properties 224) from electronic message topics using an event analysis module (e.g., event analysis module 222). The event analysis module may send a command (e.g., an API call) to the messaging system to provide a button 306 for display within the messaging application interface to prompt the first user to create an event.
Buttons 306 may be provided to display on each of the client devices (e.g., computing devices 102, 104, and 106) for participants of the electronic message thread (e.g., will, janet, and Larry). In some aspects, buttons 306 are provided for display on a client device supporting the functionality of event management system 220. In some other aspects, button 306 may be provided for display on a client device (e.g., computing device 102) of a participant initiating an electronic message topic. Upon receipt of a user action at button 306 of user interface 300, an event creation module of the event management system (e.g., event creation module 226) instructs the messaging system to provide user interface 310 of FIG. 3B for display.
The user interface 310 of FIG. 3B depicts a proposal event interface (e.g., proposal event interface 228) generated by the event creation module based on the nature of the event discussed in the electronic message topic of the user interface 300. The user interface 310 includes a banner 311, an image 312, an event information box 313, and a confirmation button 314. For example, banner 311 indicates that information about calendar events is being presented and provides the first user with the option to close user interface 310. The user may press "x" at the upper left corner of the user interface 310 to cancel or exit the proposal event interface to return to the user interface of the messaging system. Image 312 of restaurant A may be an image from, for example, a website of restaurant A. Event information box 313 includes event information based on event properties (e.g., event date, event time, event location, etc.). The confirm button 314 may allow the first user to confirm event information included in the proposal event interface.
In some aspects, the proposal event interface (e.g., user interface 310) may provide the user with the option of selecting to modify the information included in the proposal event interface. For example, editing rights may be assigned to a user account associated with a participant initiating an electronic message topic. A user of a user account with editing rights may edit event information. For example, editing rights may be assigned to a user account associated with a first user "Will" and access rights or viewing only rights may be assigned to user accounts associated with other participants (e.g., a second user "Janet" and a third user "Larry"). Access or view only rights allow a user of an account having access or view only rights to access event information, but not allow the user to edit event information.
When the event creation module receives a user action (e.g., click, tap, press, etc.) at the confirm button 314 that instructs the first user to confirm the event information in the proposal event interface, the event creation module instructs the calendar system to create and add an electronic calendar event on the first user's calendar. In some aspects, the event creation module may instruct the calendar system to share the electronic calendar event created by the first user with the second user and the third user. In some aspects, the calendar system may send a command to the messaging system to provide a calendar event summary of the electronic calendar event created based on the electronic message thread for display.
Fig. 3C illustrates a user interface 320 showing a subsequent exchange of messages within the electronic message thread of user interface 300. The user interface 320 also includes a calendar summary 321, which calendar summary 321 is a summary of event information for electronic calendar events created based on the nature of the events discussed in the electronic message thread. For example, calendar summary 321 includes an event title (e.g., dinner), an event date ("Fri, dec 2 2016 (friday of 12 months of 2016)), an event time (e.g.," 7:00PM "), and a location (e.g.," Restarant A "). Calendar summary 321 may also provide access links to created calendar events. For example, when a user action is detected at "VIEW EVENT (view event)" of the event summary, the messaging system invokes an API to the calendar event to display details of the electronic calendar event. In some aspects, when the client devices of other participants (e.g., second user "Janet" and third user "Larry") do not support the functionality of the event management system 220, the access link to the calendar event being created may be embedded into a subsequent electronic message from the participant (e.g., will) whose client device supports the functionality of the event management system 220 in the electronic message topic. The calendar system may allow access to the created calendar event when a user action is received at an access link in a subsequent electronic message.
In a subsequent message exchange, the second user (e.g., janet) suggests restaurant B instead of restaurant A in message 322. The third user and the first user agree to the suggestion of the second user via reply messages 323 and 322, respectively. The messaging system forwards messages 322, 323, and 324 to the event management system. For example, the event analysis module of the event management system determines that messages 322, 323, and 324 are associated with the topic ID 212. The event creation module of the event management system determines whether an electronic calendar event exists for the topic ID 212. When an electronic calendar event exists for the topic ID 212, the event creation module sends a command to the calendar system to update the electronic calendar event associated with the topic ID 212. The calendar system sends commands to the messaging system to provide updated calendar event summaries for display.
Fig. 3D illustrates a user interface 330 including an updated calendar summary 331. The updated calendar summary 331 includes event titles (e.g., dinner), event dates ("Fri, dec 22016"), event times (e.g., "7:00 PM"), which are identical to the calendar summary 321. However, the updated calendar summary 331 includes an updated location (e.g., "resueurant B").
In some aspects, the calendar system may allow presentation of event information details of calendar events when user actions are detected on either calendar summary 321 or updated calendar summary 331. The user of the account with editing rights privileges may modify the event information by opening a user interface similar to the proposed event interface depicted in user interface 310.
In some aspects, the event management system may only be able to identify a portion of the nature of the event. For example, an electronic message topic of topic ID 212 may not include an event time (e.g., 7:00 pm). In this case, the event management system may assign a time of day (e.g., 5:00-9:00PM (5:00-9:00 pm)) that is appropriate for the evening meal time. In some aspects, the event management system may check for availability in the calendar system. In some aspects, the event management system may assign event times based on other event properties identified in the electronic message and/or heuristic patterns of users. For example, the term "tonight" in the user interface 300 may refer to any time after 5:00 pm, and the term "dinner" may further narrow the time range to 5:00 pm to 9:00 pm. Further, for example, the event management system may store user preferences and/or past selections by the user, and the event management system may select 7:00pm as the event time.
When a user action is detected at the "create and add to calendar (create and add to calendar)" button 314 in the user interface 310, the event management system may send a command to the calendar system to create and add an electronic calendar event based on the nature of the event. The messaging system may provide a user interface 320 for display in response to a user confirming event information via the user interface 310.
As described above, in response to receiving a user confirmation via the confirmation button 214 in the proposal event interface, the event creation module sends a command to the calendar system to create and add an electronic calendar event to the user's calendar, and displays the calendar summary 321 of the electronic calendar event on the user interface. Alternatively, in response to the event analysis module identifying the nature of the event from the electronic message thread, the event analysis module may send a command to the calendar system to create and add the electronic calendar event to the user's calendar and display a calendar summary 321 of the electronic calendar event on the user interface. These may be user configurable settings to authorize the calendar system to create and add electronic calendar events to the user's calendar in response to user confirmation, or automatically create and add to the user's calendar in response to the event analysis module identifying the nature of the event.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example user interface 400 depicting an electronic message (e.g., email) in accordance with example aspects of the subject technology. The user interface 400 depicts messages sent from a third user (e.g., larry) to the first and second users (e.g., will and Janet). For example, the message may be an email sent via a second messaging system (e.g., an email server) that is different from the messaging system used to transmit the electronic message described in fig. 3A-3D. In some aspects, the message may be a voice message transmitted via a voice messaging server or a post posted on a message board, such as a social networking page, via a social networking server. The second messaging system may forward the email message to the event management system. The event analysis module may identify a set of event properties from the email message.
When identifying an event property set, the event analysis module compares the received event property set with the event property set of the electronic message depicted in fig. 3A-3D previously stored in the data store of the event management system. For example, when a participant, event date, and/or event location of a received set of event properties matches another set of event properties in the data store, the event management system determines that an electronic message from the second messaging system may be associated with an electronic message topic from the messaging system (e.g., a text message server). The event management system may reconcile the electronic message thread from the messaging system with the electronic message thread from the second messaging system. The reconciliation is referred to as determining whether two threads can be associated with the same electronic calendar event. For example, the event management system may assign the same topic ID to electronic messages from the messaging system and the second messaging system. In some aspects, the event management system may associate a first topic ID of an electronic message topic of a messaging system with a second topic ID of an electronic message topic of a second messaging system. Thus, a subsequent electronic message received in any of the electronic message thread from the messaging system or the second messaging system may be considered to be associated with an electronic calendar event.
The event management system may determine that the event properties of the event time from the second messaging system are different than the time indicated by the event attribute of the electronic event calendar. The event management system may use, for example, the timestamp of the electronic message to determine the most recent event time. The event management system may instruct the calendar event to update a time of an event attribute of the electronic calendar event with an event time from the electronic mail message. The event management system may prompt the user to confirm the change in the event attribute of the electronic calendar event prior to updating the electronic calendar event.
FIG. 5A shows a flowchart illustrating an example process 500 for creating an electronic calendar event in accordance with example aspects of the subject technology. For purposes of illustration, various blocks of the example process 500 are described herein with reference to components and/or processes described herein. One or more blocks of process 500 may be implemented, for example, by one or more components or processors of server 110 and/or server 114 of fig. 1. In some implementations, one or more of the blocks may be implemented separately from other blocks and by one or more different processors or controllers. Further for illustrative purposes, the blocks of example process 500 are described as occurring serially or linearly. However, multiple blocks of the example process 500 may occur in parallel. Additionally, the blocks of example process 500 need not be performed in the order shown and/or one or more of the blocks of example process 500 need not be performed.
At block 510, an electronic message topic is received from a messaging system. For example, the event management system may receive an electronic message topic comprising one or more electronic messages from the messaging system. In some aspects, the electronic message thread may be a text message thread that includes one or more text messages. The messaging system may be an email server, a text message server, or the like. In some aspects, the messaging system may send electronic messages or electronic message titles to the event management system at predetermined time intervals.
At block 520, a set of event properties is identified from the message content and participants of the electronic message topic. The event management system may identify a set of event properties, such as event time, event date, event location, event participant and/or topic ID, from the message content and participants of the electronic message topic. For example, an electronic message of an electronic message topic is parsed and event properties can be identified from the message content. For example, if a group of people discuss in an electronic message topic about having dinner at restaurant A in 7:00 PM, the event management system may identify event time (e.g., 7:00 PM), event date (e.g., tonight (e.g., 12 months 2 days of 2016)), and event location (e.g., restaurant A). The event management system may also identify the participant based on the participant and its corresponding response.
In some aspects, a proposal event interface is provided for display. The event management system may generate event information based on the set of event properties and provide a proposed event interface that displays the event information. The event information may include the identified set of event properties. For example, the event information may include an event time of 7:00 pm, an event date of 2016, 12, 2 days, and an event location of restaurant A. In some aspects, the event information may include event attendees. The proposal event interface may be displayed on client devices of one or more participants of the electronic message topic. The proposal event interface may include options for the participant to confirm the event information and prompt for an electronic calendar event to be created. In some aspects, the proposal event interface may include another option to edit event information. In some other aspects, editing rights for event information may be assigned to a user account associated with a predetermined user of a participant. The remaining participants may have user accounts assigned only viewing or access rights.
At block 530, an electronic calendar event is created based on the event information. When an acknowledgment input is received via the proposal event interface, the event management system may send a command to the calendar system to create an electronic calendar event including event attributes based on the event information. For example, the calendar system may create an electronic calendar event and add the event to the electronic calendar. Event attributes may include event time, event date, event location, and/or event title based on event information.
FIG. 5B illustrates a flow chart showing an example process 550 for creating an electronic calendar event in accordance with example aspects of the subject technology. For purposes of illustration, the various blocks of the example process 550 are described with reference to the components and/or processes described herein. One or more blocks of process 550 may be implemented, for example, by one or more components or processors of server 110 and/or server 114 of fig. 1. In some implementations, one or more of the blocks may be implemented separately from other blocks and by one or more different processors or controllers. For further explanation purposes, the blocks of the example process 550 are described as occurring serially or linearly. However, multiple blocks of the example process 550 may occur in parallel. Additionally, the blocks of example process 550 need not be performed in the order shown and/or one or more of the blocks of example process 550 need not be performed.
At block 560, an electronic message topic is received from the messaging system. For example, the event management system may receive an electronic message topic comprising one or more electronic messages from the messaging system. In some aspects, the electronic message thread may be a text message thread that includes one or more text messages. The messaging system may be an email server, a text message server, or the like. In some aspects, the messaging system may send electronic messages or electronic message titles to the event management system at predetermined time intervals.
At block 570, a set of event properties is identified from the message content and participants of the electronic message topic. The event management system may identify a set of event properties, such as event time, event date, event location, event participant and/or topic ID, from the message content and participants of the electronic message topic. For example, an electronic message of an electronic message topic is parsed and event properties can be identified from the message content. For example, if a group of people discuss in an electronic message topic about having dinner at restaurant A in 7:00 PM, the event management system may identify event time (e.g., 7:00 PM), event date (e.g., tonight (e.g., 12 months 2 days of 2016)), and event location (e.g., restaurant A). The event management system may also identify attendees based on the attendees and their corresponding replies.
At block 580, an electronic calendar event is created based on the set of event properties. When an event property can be identified from the message content, the event management system can automatically send a command to the calendar system to create an electronic calendar event that includes the event property based on the set of event properties. For example, the calendar system may create an electronic calendar event and add the event to the electronic calendar. Based on the set of event properties, event attributes may include event time, event date, event location, and/or event title.
At block 590, a calendar event interface is provided for display. The event management system may generate event information based on the event attributes and provide a calendar event interface that displays the event information. The event information may include the identified set of event properties. For example, the event information may include an event time of 7:00 pm, an event date of 2016, 12, 2 days, and an event location of restaurant A. In some aspects, the event information may include event attendees. The calendar event interface may be displayed on a client device of one or more participants of the electronic message thread. The calendar event interface may include options for the participant to share the created electronic calendar event with other participants. In some aspects, the calendar event interface may include another option to edit event information. In some other aspects, editing rights for event information may be assigned to a user account associated with a predetermined user of a participant. The remaining participants may have user accounts assigned only viewing or access rights.
In accordance with aspects of the subject technology, a computer-implemented method for creating an electronic calendar event is provided. A first electronic message topic including one or more electronic messages is received from a first messaging system. A first set of event properties is identified from the message content and the participants of the first electronic message topic. An event interface is provided for display, the event interface displaying event information generated based on the first set of event properties. An electronic calendar event including event attributes based on the event information is created.
A second set of event properties may be identified from the content of a subsequent electronic message received in the first electronic message topic. Event attributes of the electronic calendar event may be updated based on the second set of event properties.
In addition to the event attributes of the electronic calendar event being updated based on the second set of event properties, access rights for the electronic calendar event may be assigned to a user account associated with the participant in the first electronic message thread, and editing rights for the electronic calendar event may be assigned to a user account associated with the set of participants in the first electronic message thread. Editing rights for the electronic calendar event may be reassigned to one or more of the user accounts associated with the participants of the first electronic message thread.
A second electronic message topic may be received and a third set of event properties may be identified from the message content and the participants of the second electronic message topic. The first electronic message thread and the second electronic message thread may be reconciled in response to the third set of event properties matching a portion of the event attributes of the electronic calendar event. Event attributes of the electronic calendar event are updated based on the third set of event properties.
In addition to updating the event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the third set of event properties, a fourth set of event properties may be identified from the content of subsequent electronic messages received in the reconciled first electronic message thread and second electronic message, and the event attributes of the electronic calendar event may be updated based on the fourth set of event properties.
In addition to updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the fourth set of event properties, the second electronic message thread may be from a second message system, which may be different from the first message system. Event attributes of the electronic calendar event include time and location of the electronic calendar event of the first electronic message thread and the second electronic message thread and the participant.
An access link to the electronic calendar event may be provided for display in a message interface for the first electronic message topic and the second electronic message topic.
A validation element may be provided in the proposal event interface. The electronic calendar event may be created in response to a user confirmation input via a confirmation element in the proposal event interface.
Aspects of the subject technology also relate to computing systems for creating electronic calendar events. The system may include one or more processors and a non-transitory machine-readable medium including instructions stored therein, which when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations. The operations may include receiving a first electronic message topic including one or more electronic messages from a first messaging system. The operations may also include identifying a first set of event properties from the message content and the participant of the first electronic message topic. The operations further may include creating an electronic calendar event including an event attribute based on the first set of event properties. The operations may also include providing, for display, a calendar event interface, wherein the calendar event interface displays event information generated based on the event attributes. The operations may include identifying a second set of event properties from content of a subsequent electronic message received in the first electronic message topic. The operations may also include updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the second set of event properties.
The operations may include receiving a second electronic message topic and identifying a third set of event properties from the message content and participants of the second electronic message topic. The operations may further include reconciling the first electronic message topic and the second electronic message topic in response to the third set of event properties matching a portion of the event attributes of the electronic calendar event. The operations may also include updating an event attribute of the electronic calendar event based on the third set of event properties.
In addition to updating the event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the third set of event properties, the operations may include identifying a fourth set of event properties from the content of subsequent electronic messages received in the reconciled first electronic message thread and second electronic message thread, and updating the event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the fourth set of event properties. The second electronic message topic is from a second message system that is different from the first message system.
In addition to updating the event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the fourth set of event properties, the operations may include assigning editing rights for the electronic calendar event to one or more user accounts associated with one or more users participating in the first electronic message thread. The operations further include assigning access rights to the electronic calendar event to one or more of the user accounts associated with the remaining participants of the first electronic message thread, and reassigning edit rights to the electronic calendar event to one or more of the user accounts associated with the remaining participants of the first electronic message thread.
Aspects of the subject technology also relate to a non-transitory computer-readable medium including instructions stored therein, which when executed by a processor, cause a computer to perform operations. The operations may include receiving a first electronic message topic including one or more electronic messages from a first messaging system. The operations may also include identifying a first set of event properties from the message content and the participant of the first electronic message topic. The operations may further include providing for display a proposal event interface, wherein the proposal event interface displays event information generated based on the first set of event properties. The operations may include creating an electronic calendar event including an event attribute based on the event information. The operations may further include: receiving a second electronic message topic, and identifying a second set of event properties from the message content and participants of the second electronic message topic. The operations may also include, in response to: 1) The second set of event properties matches a portion of event attributes of the electronic calendar event, and 2) one or more of the participants of the second electronic message thread matches one or more of the participants of the first electronic message thread, reconciling the first electronic message thread with the second electronic message thread. The operations may include updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the second set of event properties.
In addition to the operation of updating the event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the second set of event properties, the operation may further comprise: a third set of event properties is identified from the content of subsequent electronic messages received in the reconciled first electronic message thread and second electronic message thread. The operations further include updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the third set of event properties. The operations may also include providing, for display, an access link to the electronic calendar event in a message interface for the first electronic message topic and the second electronic message topic.
Aspects of the subject technology relate to computing systems for creating electronic calendar events. The computing system may include means for receiving a first electronic message topic comprising one or more electronic messages from a first messaging system. The computing system may also include means for identifying a first set of event properties from the message content of the first electronic message topic and the participant. The computing system may further include means for creating an electronic calendar event including event attributes based on the first set of event properties. The computing system may also include means for providing, for display, a proposed event interface, wherein the proposed event interface displays event information generated based on the event attributes. The computing system may include means for identifying a second set of event properties from content of a subsequent electronic message received in the first electronic message topic. The computing system may also include means for updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the second set of event properties.
The computing system may further include means for receiving a second electronic message topic and identifying a third set of event properties from the message content of the second electronic message topic and the participants.

In addition to means for updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the third set of event properties, the computing system may further include means for identifying a fourth set of event properties from the content of subsequent electronic messages received in the reconciled first and second electronic message topics and updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the fourth set of event properties. The second electronic message topic is from a second message system that is different from the first message system.
In addition to updating event attributes of the electronic calendar event based on the fourth set of event properties, the computing system may include means for assigning editing rights for the electronic calendar event to one or more user accounts associated with one or more users participating in the first electronic message topic. The computing system further includes means for assigning access rights to the electronic calendar event to user accounts associated with the remaining participants of the first electronic message thread, and reassigning edit rights to the electronic calendar event to one or more user accounts associated with the remaining participants of the first electronic message thread.
Fig. 6 conceptually illustrates an example electronic system 600 with which some implementations of the subject technology may be implemented. Electronic system 600 may be a computer, a telephone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or any other type of electronic device. Such electronic systems include various types of computer-readable media and interfaces for various other types of computer-readable media. Electronic system 600 includes bus 608, processing unit 612, system memory 604, read Only Memory (ROM) 610, persistent storage 602, input device interface 614, output device interface 606, and network interface 616.
Bus 608 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses that communicatively connect many of the internal devices of electronic system 600. For example, bus 608 communicatively connects processing unit 612 with ROM 610, system memory 604, and persistent storage 602.
The processing unit 612 retrieves instructions to be executed and data to be processed from these various memory units in order to perform the processes of the subject disclosure. In different implementations, the processing unit may be a single processor or a multi-core processor.
The ROM 610 stores static data and instructions required by the processing unit 612 and other modules of the electronic system. On the other hand, persistent storage 602 is a read-write memory device. The device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the electronic system 600 is turned off. Some implementations of the subject disclosure use a mass storage device (e.g., a magnetic or optical disk or flash memory) as the persistent storage device 602.
Other embodiments use removable storage devices (e.g., floppy disks, flash drives) as the persistent storage device 602. Similar to persistent storage 602, system memory 604 is a read-write memory device. However, unlike the storage device 602, the system memory 604 is a volatile read-write memory, such as random access memory. The system memory 604 stores some instructions and data that are required by the processor at runtime. In some implementations, the processes of the subject disclosure are stored in system memory 604, persistent storage 602, or ROM 610. For example, the various memory units include instructions for displaying graphical elements and identifiers associated with respective applications, receiving predetermined user input to display visual representations of shortcuts associated with respective applications, and displaying visual representations of shortcuts. Processing unit 612 retrieves the instructions to execute and the data to process from these various memory units in order to perform the processes of some embodiments.
Bus 608 is also connected to input and output device interfaces 614 and 606. The input device interface 614 enables a user to communicate information to the electronic system and select commands. Input devices for use with input device interface 614 include, for example, an alphanumeric keyboard and a pointing device (also referred to as a "cursor control device"). The output device interface 606 enables, for example, the display of images generated by the electronic system 600. Output devices used with output device interface 606 include, for example, printers and display devices, such as Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) or Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). Some implementations include a device, such as a touch screen that acts as both an input device and an output device.
Finally, as shown in FIG. 6, bus 608 also couples electronic system 600 to a network (not shown) through a network interface 616. In this manner, the computer may be part of a network of computers (e.g., a LAN, WAN, or a network of intranets or networks, e.g., the Internet). Any or all of the components of electronic system 600 may be used in conjunction with the subject disclosure.
Many of the above features and applications are implemented as software processes specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer-readable storage medium (also referred to as a computer-readable medium).
