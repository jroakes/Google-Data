- Battery life indicator module 169 may utilize various interface functions to obtain battery related information from conventional circuitry, such as battery monitor circuit 166 of FIG. 1B , adapted to monitor the battery's total capacity and the battery's discharge rate. Battery life indicator module 169 may also receive repeated updates of the batteries discharge rate through these interface functions. Battery capacity is typically measured as milliampere hours (“mAH”), which is determined by multiplying the battery's discharge rate in milliamperes (“mA”) by the amount of time the battery is capable of providing that current. The current capacity of a battery mAh divided by the discharge rate mA results in the amount of hours a battery may sustain. Many factors may also be used to determine an accurate discharge rate, such as battery temperature, a battery's age, internal battery resistance, or the batteries chemical structure (e.g., alkaline, lithium, zinc carbon etc.).
- Client devices may also include an accelerometer 170 or gyroscope to determine the direction in which the device is oriented.

- Server 104 may also store map-related information 146 , at least a portion of which may be transmitted to a client device to provide a user with turn-by-turn directions toward a POI.
- the server may store map information 146 , including map tiles, where each tile comprises a map image of a particular geographic area.
- a single tile may cover an entire region such as a state in relatively little detail and another tile may cover just a few streets in high detail.
- a single geographic point may be associated with multiple tiles, and a tile may be selected for transmission based on the desired level of zoom.
- the map information is not limited to any particular format.
- the images may comprise street maps, satellite images, or a combination of these, and may be stored as vectors (particularly with respect to street maps) or bitmaps (particularly with respect to satellite images).
- the various map tiles may each be associated with geographical locations, such that the server 104 and/or client device are capable of selecting, retrieving, transmitting, or displaying one or more tiles in response to receiving one or more POI locations.
- server 104 may also contain direction data 144 that may be transmitted to POI indicator module 171 in order to provide turn-by-turn directions towards a POI.
- systems and methods in accordance with aspects of the invention may include different web sites, data values, data types and configurations, and may be provided and received at different times (e.g., via different web pages) and by different entities (e.g., some values may be pre-suggested or provided from different sources).
- a client device such as client device 110 being used by user 192 may transmit its current location over a network 116 , via GPS receiver 168 , to server 104 .
- map 300 of FIG. 3A illustrates a location A, which corresponds to current location 210 that may be located along highway 330 .
- predictor module 132 may determine the most likely route and destination of a user based on historical data in user location database 133 of all users that traveled highway 330 through current location 210 .
- the predictor module 132 may find that eighty percent of users took Exit 11 and were destined for location B, which corresponds to destination 220 .
- the predictor module 132 may be configured to infer a particular route and destination when the number of users that used a particular route to arrive at a destination exceeds an eighty percent threshold.
- predictor module 132 may infer that user 192 will take exit 11 and that the destination is destination 220 .
- the threshold for inferring the route and destination may depend on location. For example, if the route travels through a secluded location, the threshold may be lower for routes leading to more populated areas. However, if the entire route is highly populated, the threshold may be set higher.
- the threshold may also be adjusted according to date and time. For example, traveling patterns on a Monday morning may lead to thresholds that are different than those of Saturday evening.
- server 104 may retrieve additional sampling data to predict a route and destination.
- the POI database 136 may include events (e.g., concerts, food & wine festivals, etc.) that may be of interest along a route.
- the inferred route and destination may be based on event data, if the historical data for the current location in user location database 133 is not adequate for determining a route.
- the predictor module 132 may identify POIs.
- FIG. 3B depicts an illustrative screen shot of POIs 550 - 552 to display on a client device as may be determined by predictor module 132 .
- predictor module 132 may query POI database 134 to help distinguish between the routes and destinations. For example, one of the routes or destinations may have more POIs and therefore more likely than the others. Alternatively, the popularity of a POI may be used as a distinguishing factor.
- the predictor module 132 may transmit the POIs to POI indicator module 171 of device 110 .
- POI indicator module 171 may be adapted to display the POIs to a user 192 via display 162 .
- These POIs may be filtered by various methods, including categories. Categories may be preselected by the server or identified by a user and transmitted by a client device. For example, a user may select or request POIs related to museums, such that the selected POIs will correspond to locations such as parks, museums, or hotels. In another example, a user may provide additional information specific to the POI in which the user is interested. For example, a user may provide a request such as “‘Boston’ to ‘Florida,’ stopping at a ‘cheap motel.’”
- a user may select a time frame or a specific date and time.
- the server may filter out locations which have operating hours which do not fit into the specified date and time data. If, for example, a POI such as a garden is open only during April through November from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm, and the user identifies a category corresponding to December at 12:00 pm, this POI may be filtered by removing the garden POI from the determined POIs, or simply not consider the garden POI at all. Any number of categories may be selected, identified, and used. In addition, rather than using categories to merely filter the POIs, categories may be considered when ranking the POIs.
- the predictor module 132 may also transmit the inferred route and destination to battery life indicator module 169 .
- battery life indicator module 169 may prompt a user if the extant battery charge is less than necessary to sustain the trip.
- predictor module 132 may infer a route and destination that is sixty miles away, and battery life indicator module 169 may measure the device's velocity to be thirty miles an hour. Under these circumstances, the trip will take approximately two hours at the current velocity. If an end device battery, such as battery 163 of FIG.
- battery life indicator module 169 may provide an alert, via display 162 , to a user indicating that the extant battery charge may not sustain the entire trip, based on the current velocity and battery discharge rate. This will prompt the user to conserve an end device's battery resources during a trip by using it less frequently, closing large applications, etc.
- FIGS. 4-5 depict an illustrative summary of the processes described above.
- FIG. 4 provides an illustrative embodiment of a method 400 implemented by predictor module 132 .
- predictor module 132 may receive a current device location from a client device.
- predictor module 132 may retrieve historical route and destination data of users that traveled through the current device location, in block 404 .
- predictor module 132 may infer a most likely route and destination of the user.
- a predetermined popularity threshold may be used to infer the most likely route and destination.
- predictor module 132 determines if more than one route and destination are equally likely.
- predictor module 132 may advance to block 416 and retrieve POIs for the route and destination. If predictor module 132 determines that multiple routes and destinations are equally likely, predictor module 132 may advance to block 410 and retrieve POIs for the plurality of routes and destinations. Then, in block 412 , predictor module 132 may infer that the route and destination with the most POIs is the most likely route and destination. Alternatively, predictor module 132 may infer that the route and destination with the most popular POIs is the most likely route and destination. In block 414 , predictor module 132 may transmit the points of interest, the inferred route, and the inferred destination to POI indicator module 171 . Also in block 414 predictor module 132 may transmit the inferred route and destination to battery life indicator module 168 . In addition, predictor module 132 may transmit turn by turn directions to POI indicator module 171 . In block 418 , the process ends.
- FIG. 5 provides an illustrative embodiment of a method 500 implemented by battery life indicator module 169 of an end device.
- battery life indicator module 169 may receive an inferred route and destination.
- battery life indicator module 169 calculates a travel time to the inferred destination via the inferred route in block 504 . As stated earlier, this may be done by calculating the number of miles to the inferred destination, calculating the velocity of the device, and dividing the number of miles by the velocity.
- battery life indicator module 169 may calculate the device's battery charge time. This may be done by dividing the battery's extant capacity by the battery's current discharge rate.
- Battery life indicator module 169 may retrieve the necessary battery information by interfacing with suitable battery monitoring circuitry 166 . Next, in block 508 , battery life indicator module 169 determines whether the device's battery discharge time is less than the inferred destination travel time. If the device's battery charge time is less than the travel time to the destination, battery life indicator module 169 may advance to block 510 and display a user alert indicating that the battery will not sustain the entire trip at the device's current velocity and battery discharge rate. If the device's battery charge time is greater than or equal to the time to the inferred destination, battery life indicator module 169 may advance to block 512 and determine whether the device has arrived at the inferred destination or has stopped.
- battery life indicator module 169 may loop back to block 504 to calculate the device's current velocity. This loop may continue throughout the entire trip. Otherwise, battery life indicator module 169 may advance to block 514 and end.
