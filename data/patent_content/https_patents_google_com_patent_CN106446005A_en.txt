Really P (Qx, Ry).
Each inquiry to inquiry-resource pair, process 300 generates the corresponding query characteristics of the predetermined radix with element
Vector (304).As in figure 2 it is shown, to j the inquiry with radix m, generate query feature vector Qj (QFj1 ... QFjm).Permissible
Study or can predefine radix.Similarly, each resource to inquiry-resource pair, process 300 generates the radix with element
Corresponding resource characteristic vector (306).It is similar to shown in Fig. 2, to k the resource with predetermined radix m, generate resource characteristic
Vector Rk (RFk1 ... RFkm).
Do not need predefined special characteristic QF and RF, alternatively can occur during factorisation procedure.Predefining
In the case of radix, system administration can select the cardinality of a set of for example the 10th, 20 or 30 elements.Selection can be based on model
Desired robustness, available training resource and available query processing resource.
Process 300 trains factorized model to learn the query characteristics of each element for each query feature vector
Value (308), similarly, training factorized model is to learn the resource characteristic of each element for each resource characteristic vector
Value (310).Carry out learning to value so that factorized model output is vectorial based on the individual features of given inquiry and given resource
To model result.In the case of jointly training with machine learning model, the result of modeling can be based on the ground of training data
Face true tag.In the case that machine learning model is used as priori, training factorized model makes based on given inquiry
Model to carrying out the result to learning model with the inquiry-resource of given resource.Additionally, in addition to inquiry-resource token, Factorization
Device 154 can also access other inquiry data 144 and resource data 146 to train factorized model.
Any suitable Factorization learning process can be used to carry out Studying factors decomposition model 150.For example, to degree of having
It is the factorized model of 2, it is possible to use following model equations：
viAnd vjIt is inquiry and resource vector, and<vi,vj>It is the inner product of query vector i and resource vector j.For example, lead to
Cross the gradient descent method for various losses, can learning model parameter.
Although described above is 2 to factorized model, could be used that vague generalization n to factorized model.
Once learning characteristic value makes factorized model 150 model result fully, and process 300 stores query characteristics
Vector sum resource characteristic vector (312).The Factorization data 152 of storage query feature vector and resource characteristic vector can be by
Search system 110 accesses in order to the resource inquired about is marked.
In some embodiments, when training factorized model 150, it is convenient to omit for the respective counts of navigation enquiry
According to.Navigation enquiry is that specific resources has looking into of very high selection ratio relative to other resources nearly all to this inquiry
Ask.Such behavior instruction inquiry of user is that user inputs to search the inquiry of specific resources.In other embodiments, only
Use the corresponding data of the inquiry being confirmed as classified inquiry to train factorized model 150.Classified inquiry is that covering is wide
The inquiry of theme or classification and can have the many results being confirmed as and inquiring about similar correlation.
The query processing of usage factor decomposition model data
The resource in response to inquiry as described above, search system 110 usage factor decomposition model 150 is marked.In operation,
To given inquiry, vectorial based on the query feature vector of this inquiry and the resource characteristic of this resource, generate the score value of given resource.
Depending on that the service of search system 110 limits, search system 110 can generate when inquiry has dividing of Factorization pattern
Value, or as an alternative, can be when system initialization, pre-cache inquiry-resource score value.
For inquiry when generate score value, to given inquiry, system 110 verify with determine for this inquiry query characteristics to
Whether amount is stored in Factorization data.If it is not, not usage factor decomposition model 150.But, if finding inquiry
Characteristic vector, then to each resource marked by search system 110, (or as an alternative, the top n resource of scoring, wherein, N is for commenting
The suitable subset of point resource, such as 200,300 or 400), factorized model 150 is based on query feature vector and is used for
The inner product of the resource characteristic vector of resource, generates query resource score value.It is, for example possible to use the score value of resource is by the row of resource
Name is adjusted to the second different order from the first order.
As an alternative, moreover it is possible to the score value substituting usage factor decomposition model 150 generation selects in response to inquiry initially to provide
Source collection.It is then possible to be based only upon the order of factorized model score value, the Search Results being used for resource is returned to user and sets
Standby.
In the case of expectation caching, when system 100 is when index or at system initialization, it is contemplated that calculate inquiry-resource and divide
Value, and then cache score value so that can retrieve when inquiry.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart of the example process 400 for carrying out pre-cache score value based on factorized model.Fig. 4's
In embodiment, to subset of queries, pre-cache score value.
Process 400 determines the suitable subset (402) of the inquiry receiving at search system.In some embodiments, look into
The suitable subset ask is relative to other the most popular inquiries of inquiry receiving at search system.For example, it is possible to select by connecing
Receive N number of popular query of frequency.Also the additive method selecting popular query can be used.
Process 400 according to following process step 406, the 408th, 410 and 412 process each inquiry (404).First, process
400 determine the resource set (406) determining in response to inquiry.For example, search system 110 can be marked in response to the money inquired about
Source.Scoring does not consider factorized model 150.
Process 400 selects the query feature vector (408) for inquiry, and then process 400 selects in resource set
Resource characteristic vector (410) of each resource.Therefore, to ad hoc inquiry, process 400 access queries characteristic vector and in response to looking into
The resource characteristic vector of the resource ask and determine.
To each resource, process 400 is come based on the query feature vector of inquiry and resource and the inner product of resource characteristic vector
Generate corresponding inquiry-resource score value (412).Then, process 400 by being used for inquiring about-respective queries-resource score value of resource pair
It is stored in (414) in search system cache.
Hereafter, when inquiry, for each inquiry of the match query in that received by search system and query set, mistake
Journey 400 is used for the inquiry-resource score value (416) of this inquiry for search operation retrieval.Thus so that when inquiry, by minimum
The utilization of resources, the score value being used in the resource determining in response to inquiry can be used.
