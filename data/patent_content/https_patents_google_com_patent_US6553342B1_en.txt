Definitions
- This invention relates to a method and apparatus for speech recognition, particularly, though not exclusively, to a method and apparatus for recognising speech in a tonal language, such as Mandarin Chinese.
- Speech recognition techniques are well known for recognising words spoken in English or other non-tonal languages. These known speech recognition techniques basically perform transformations on segments (frames) of speech, each segment having a plurality of speech samples, into sets of parameters sometimes called “feature vectors”. Each set of parameters is then passed through a set of models, which has been previously trained, to determine the probability that the set of parameters represents a particular known word or part-word, known as a phoneme, the most likely word or phoneme being output as the recognised speech.
- tonal languages are one in which tones have lexical meanings and have to be considered during recognition.
- a typical example is Mandarin Chinese.
- Chinese characters There are more than 10,000 commonly used Chinese characters, each of which is mono-syllabic. All these 10,000 characters are pronounced as just 1345 different syllables, the different meanings of a particular syllable being determined by the listener from the context of the speech.
- Pat. No. 5,602,960 uses a syllable recognition system, a tone classifier and a confidence score augmentor.
- the tone classifier has a pitch estimator to estimate the pitch of the input once and a long-term tone analyser to segment the estimated pitch according to the syllables of each of the N-best theories.
- the long-term tone analyser performs long term tonal analysis on the segmented, estimated pitch and generates a long-term tonal confidence signal.
- the confidence score augmentor receives the initial confidence scores and the long-term tonal confidence signals, modifies each initial confidence score according to the corresponding long-term tonal confidence signal, re-ranks the N-best theories according to the augmented confidence scores, and outputs the N-best theories.
- This system is, however, computational resource intensive and is also language dependent, in that the syllables are recognised first and then classified into the particular tones for which the system has been calibrated or trained. Thus, if the language is to be changed from, for example Mandarin Chinese to Cantonese Chinese, not only does the syllable recogniser need retraining, but the tone classifier also needs to be recalibrated for seven tones instead of only five.
- a voiced sound is one generated by the vocal cords opening and closing at a constant rate giving off pulses of air. The distance between the peaks of the pulses is known as the pitch period.
- An example of a voiced sound is the “i” sound as found in the word “pill”.
- An unvoiced sound is one generated by a single rush of air which results in turbulent air flow. Unvoiced sounds have no defined pitch.
- An example of an unvoiced sound is the “p” sound in the word “pill”.
- a combination of voiced and unvoiced sounds can thus be found in the word “pill”, as the “p” requires the single rush of air and the “ill” requires a series of air pulses.
- the present invention therefore seeks to provide a method and apparatus for speech recognition, which overcomes, or at least reduces the above-mentioned problems of the prior art.
- the invention provides a system for speech recognition comprising an input terminal for receiving a segment of speech, a speech classifier having an input coupled to the input terminal and an output to provide an indication of whether the speech segment comprises voiced or unvoiced speech, a speech feature detector having a first input coupled to the input terminal, a second input coupled to the output of the of the speech classifier, and an output to provide a speech feature vector having a plurality of feature values indicating features of the speech segment, the speech feature vector including at least a tonal feature value indicating a tonal feature of the speech segment when the speech segment comprises voiced speech, and a speech recogniser having an input coupled to the output of the speech feature detector and an output to provide an indication of which of a predetermined plurality of speech models is a good match to the speech segment.

- the tone generator preferably has a second input coupled to the second input of the tonal speech transformation circuit.
- the invention provides a method of speech recognition comprising the steps of receiving a segment of speech, classifying the speech segment according to whether the speech segment comprises voiced or unvoiced speech, detecting a plurality of speech features of the segment of speech, generating a speech feature vector having a plurality of feature values indicating the detected plurality of features of the speech segment, wherein the speech feature vector includes at least a tonal feature value indicating a tonal feature of the speech segment when the speech segment comprises voiced speech, and utilising the speech vector to determine which of a predetermined plurality of speech models is a good match to the speech segment.

- FIG. 1 shows the five tone patterns in the Mandarin Chinese language
- FIG. 2 shows a known Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) based automatic speech recognition system
- FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of a speech recognition system according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 shows a schematic diagram of the signals that are input and output of the tone generator of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 1 shows the five tone patterns in the Chinese Mandarin language.
- a tone pattern is a trajectory of pitch frequency in the time domain.
- a flat Tone 1 for example, means that the pitch frequency of the speech signal does not change during a certain time period, a rising Tone 2 implies that the pitch frequency changes monotonously from low to high, a falling-rising Tone 3 implies that the pitch frequency changes from high to low and then back again from low to high.
- a falling Tone 4 implies that the pitch frequency changes monotonously from high to low, whereas the neutral Tone 5 has a constant pitch frequency, similar to that of the flat tone.
- a known Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) based automatic speech recognition system 10 can be considered basically as a pattern matcher. As can be seen, it is basically divided into two parts. The first is the speech processing module 11 , which takes the speech signal at an input 12 and processes it to provide spectral parameters, which are commonly called speech feature vectors to be used for model training and matching, as will be more fully described below. The second part is the speech recognition module 13 , which receives the speech feature vectors and switches them either to a model training unit 14 or a speech recognition unit 15 by means of a switch unit 16 .
- HMM Hidden Markov Modeling
- the system 10 uses a large quantity of speech signals to train a number of patterns, which are called models in terms of speech recognition.
- Each model represents an acoustic unit, which may be a word, a syllable, or a phoneme.
- the speech signals must be segmented into acoustic units and a representative for each of them must be found.
- all segments belonging to a particular speech unit will be used to find the statistical characteristics for the unit. The combination of these statistical characteristics is called the model for the speech unit.
- All the models determined during the training phase are stored in a database 17 .
- the input speech signals are segmented into units and sent to the recognizer to find their best-matched model stored in the database 17 and the best-matched model will be the output of the speech recognition module 13 .
- the speech signal For both model training and recognition, the speech signal must first be digitized.
- the speech signal at the input 12 of the speech processing module 11 is passed to a digitizer 18 , where the speech signal is first converted from an Analog signal to a Digital signal and then divided into segments, which are normally 10-20 milliseconds in length.
- the segments commonly called frames (which are basic analysis and processing units), are then passed to a speech signal transformation circuit 19 , where they undergo a series of mathematical transformations.
- the signal frames are processed so that a set of spectral parameters, which are commonly called speech feature vectors, can be generated in a speech feature vector generator 20 .
- These speech feature vectors are used as the input to the speech recognition module 13 for the model training and speech recognition calculations.
- the feature parameters are chosen to try to represent the lexical meaning carried by the acoustic signals while trying to ignore the emotional meaning and any the speaker's personality because such latter information causes great problems in trying to understand the lexical meaning.
- Tones in the English language are an example of such redundant information to a conventional speech recognition system and are therefore often disregarded during the signal processing and transformation stages.
- tones in tonal languages represent certain lexical meanings.
- the five tones accompanying a syllable always mean five different characters and have different lexical meanings. Because the feature vectors derived by the conventional speech recognizers do not include any tonal information, they cannot distinguish tones in the speech signals, so that they often fail to recognize the lexical meanings in tonal speech.
- a speech recognition system 30 again has a speech processing module and a speech recognition module, which are not indicated separately in the drawing.
- the speech recognition module receives the speech feature vectors and switches them either to a model trainer 34 or a speech recogniser 35 by means of a switch 36 . All the models determined during the training phase are stored in a model memory 37 , from where they are taken by the speech recogniser during the speech recognition phase to be compared with the representative of the input speech and the best-matched model is presented at the output 31 of the speech recognition module.
- This speech recognition module operates substantially the same as the speech recognition module 13 in FIG. 1 and therefore its operation will not be described further here.
- the speech processing module comprises an input 32 for receiving an input speech signal and a speech digitizer 38 , where the speech signal is first converted from an Analog signal to a Digital signal and then divided into frames. The digitised frames are passed to both a speech classifier 39 and to a speech feature detector 33 .
- the speech classifier is used to distinguish between different types of speech.
- the speech feature detector 33 includes a non-tonal feature detector 40 and a tonal feature detector 41 .
- the non-tonal feature detector 40 comprises a non-tonal feature transformation circuit 43 and a non-tonal feature vector generator 44 , which are similar to the signal transformation circuit 19 and the speech feature vector generator 20 described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the tonal feature detector 41 comprises a tonal feature speech transformation circuit 45 and a tonal feature vector generator 46 .
- the outputs of the non-tonal feature vector generator 44 and the tonal feature vector generator 46 are then combined in a speech feature vector generator 42 to provide the speech feature vectors, which are passed to switch 36 to be switched to either the model trainer 34 or the speech recogniser 35 .
- the trained models are able to represent tone information, and the recognizer can better distinguish the tone differences in the speech signals.
- the tonal feature speech transformation circuit 45 comprises a pitch extractor 47 and a tone signal generator. Tone is basically a change in pitch frequency. Therefore in order to detect tone, the pitch extractor is used to estimate a pitch frequency for each frame of speech signal. The changes in pitch frequency are then utilised to determine the tone.
- Pitch detectors are known in the art and any desired implementation of a pitch detector can be used. One example of such a pitch detector is that described in an article entitled “Digital Processing of Speech Signal” by L. R. Rabiner & R. W. Schafer published by Prentice-Hall 1978, Page 156.
- the algorithm uses autocorrelation of consecutive speech frames in the time domain to find the pick value of the autocorrelation function. The distance between two such pick values is the period of pitch.
- Speech signal can be broadly divided into three categories, voiced speech, unvoiced speech, and silence.
- Voiced speech includes vowels and diphthongs.
- Unvoiced speech consists of consonants and semivowels. While silence represents the pauses between words and sentences, as well as before and after sentences.
- tone only occurs in voiced speech.
- the other two types of speech signal do not have consistent pitch frequency changes.
- a signal type classifier is utilised to determine which category of speech a speech frame belongs to. Pitch frequency is then only utilised to determine tone for a frame of speech signal when this frame consists of voiced speech. For all frames belonging to the other two types of signal, no tone signal is output from the tonal feature speech transformation circuit 45 .
- tone information in speech is represented by movement of pitch in the frequency domain
- a change in pitch can be used as a tonal feature.
- tone generation constitutes changing pitch into a tonal feature.
- tone feature T(n) the silence and unvoiced speech section in a speech utterance should be disregarded. The reason is that the signals in those sections do not have fundamental frequencies. The pitch extracted from them would be some sort of random number which could cause great confusion during model training and recognition. Therefore an explicit voiced/unvoiced speech classifier is used for tone parameter extraction.
- voiced/unvoiced speech classifiers are known and any desired implementation can be used.
- One example of such a voiced/unvoiced classifier is described in an article entitled “Robust Voicing Estimation with Dynamic Time Warping” by T. Wang & V. Ciperman published in Proceedings of ICASSP 1998, page 533-536. The algorithm is based on waveform time-warping followed by spectral matching based on voiced and unvoiced spectral models.
- FIG. 4 shows the tone generation operation.
- T(t) is a tone feature at time t
- P(t+j) is the pitch frequency at time t+j obtained from the pitch detector
- ⁇ j is a weighting coefficient given by:
- the pitch frequencies P(t) are provided at input 49 to the tone generator 48 and the speech type function V(t) is provided at input 50 .
- the speech type function V(t) basically provides a “gate” function allowing the pitch frequencies only during voiced speech to be utilised to produce the tone function T(t), as provided at output 51 from the tone generator 48 .
- a typical 10 frame vowel in Mandarin may generate 10 tone features, such as “ ⁇ 9, ⁇ 7, ⁇ 6, ⁇ 5, 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 8”. From these tone features it can be determined that this is a vowel of the third type of tone 3 in FIG. 1, since its pitch contour is in a dropping-rising pattern. This information would be included in the speech feature vectors passed to the speech recognition module and switched to either the model trainer 34 or the speech recogniser 35 .
