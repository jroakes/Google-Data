Definitions
- Systems that provide search and advertising services allow users to search for business listings associated with a geographic location or area. For example, a user may enter search terms for a business type that result in a plurality of business listings. Such systems typically gather business listing data from various online directories and aggregators such as infousa, acxiom, amacai, etc. Each listing may include various types of information such as addresses and phone numbers.
- the data sources may provide different addresses or phone numbers for the same business entity.
- a restaurant listing of a first source may have an address of “W 44 th St”
- a restaurant listing of a second source may have an address of “260 W 44 th St”
- a restaurant listing of a third source may have an address of “E 44 th St.” Examining the business data manually would be inefficient in view of the amount of listings typically maintained by these systems. Users searching for particular businesses are thus required to tolerate business listings that may be inaccurate or out of date.
- a method for detecting trends in clustered business listings may comprise determining a last date that a last attribute value of a business listing has changed, determining whether a number of data providers supplying the last attribute value has decreased by at least a first predetermined percentage since the last date the last attribute value changed, determining using a processor whether a number of data providers that have stopped supplying the last attribute value since the last date the attribute value changed is greater than a number of data providers that have begun supplying the last attribute value after the last date the last attribute value changed, determining whether a number of data providers supplying a new attribute value exceeds a second predetermined percentage since the last date the last attribute value changed, and determining whether a third predetermined percentage of the number of data providers that have stopped supplying the last attribute value since the last date the attribute value changed have begun supplying the new attribute value since the last date the last attribute value has changed.
- the new attribute value may be of a same type as the last attribute value.
- the method may further comprise rendering on an electronic display an indication that the last attribute value is trending toward the new attribute value.
- the first predetermined percentage may be approximately twenty five percent
- the second predetermined percentage may be approximately ten percent
- the third predetermined percentage may be approximately fifty percent.
- a sum of data providers supplying the leading attribute value may be greater than a sum of data providers supplying any other attribute value of a same type.
- a weighted sum of data providers supplying the leading attribute value may be greater than a weighted sum of data providers supplying any other attribute value of a same type.
- a system for detecting trends in clustered business listings may comprise a processor, a listings manager module containing instructions to be executed by the processor, a display device for displaying data processed by the processor in accordance with the instructions of the listings manager module, and a memory for storing data accessed by the processor.
- the listings manager module may instruct the processor to determine a last date that a last attribute value of a business listing has changed, to determine whether a number of data providers supplying the last attribute value has decreased by at least a first predetermined percentage since the last date the last attribute value changed, to determine whether a number of data providers that have stopped supplying the last attribute value since the last date the last attribute value changed is greater than a number of data providers that have begun supplying the last attribute value after the last date the attribute value changed, to determine whether a number of data providers supplying a new attribute value exceeds a second predetermined percentage since the last date the last attribute value changed, and to determine whether a third predetermined percentage of the number of data providers that have stopped supplying the last attribute value since the last date the attribute value changed have begun supplying the new attribute value since the last date the last attribute value has changed.

- Systems and methods are provided that identify and analyze business listing attributes (e.g., address, phone number, etc.) trending toward a particular value.
- the attributes of a business listing having multiple entries may be normalized (i.e., making the title lower-case, adding area code to phone number, dropping suite number from address etc.)
- For each attribute value the last date of change of the leading attribute value or last value may be determined.
- the leading attribute value may be compared and contrasted to other values provided to determine whether an attribute for a business listing is trending toward a new value. If a trend is detected, an alert may be rendered that warns of the trend and that suggests replacing the current attribute value with the value toward which a trend was identified.
- a system 100 in accordance with one aspect of the invention includes a computer 110 containing a processor 120 , memory 130 and other components typically present in general purpose computers.′
