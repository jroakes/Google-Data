Once user provides their selection by ballot input 290, marking logic 354 is as will be described in reference to Figure 6 utilized to process this information.During session, the various users participating in this session can provide their ballot paper relevant with the arbitrary media item in session playlist 204.In one embodiment, the media item of user to themselves certain media items being added into session playlist 204 is not allowed to vote for or vote against.But, allow user themselves media item to be removed from session playlist, and now will not play this media item.
If the media item removed is added by any user be back to the same session that this media item is removed, then this media item is added back with the identical score had before removing.This mechanism is provided, removes the low media item of score to prevent user and immediately these media item added back obtain higher score and carry out rank thus.When playing media item from session playlist 204, this media item being removed from session playlist, resetting score, and increasing for the broadcasting of this session.
Fig. 5 illustrates an example according to an embodiment of the invention, media item (such as, song) to be added into session playlist during session.When with the addition of media item, initial play number of times is automatically set as (1-broadcasting time).If broadcasting time is 0, then as set forth in table 300, be worth for " 1 ".In table 300, also follow the trail of current broadcasting time, thus illustrate that media item C has play once (broadcasting time " PC "=2) in this example, and other all media item keeps their initial play number of times (PC=1).
Table 300 also illustrates and tracking is added into each media item of session playlist 204 to identify which user with the addition of certain media items.In this example, the participant of session comprises Jane, Bob and Rick, and in table 300, identify the media item that they add respectively.Once play 302 certain media items during session, broadcasting time is made to increase progressively 304.In this example, just play media item C and current broadcasting time is increased to 3 in 308a, and in 306b, media item C has been removed from playlist.In one embodiment, replace media item C to remove from playlist, only media item C is moved to the bottom of session playlist 204.
In addition, can while participant participate in session, to the current state of participant's display session playlist 204 of session.Any icon or figure can be provided to represent to illustrate which media item is current in broadcasting.In the example of hgure 5, session playlist 204 illustrates that media item A is current in broadcasting.The additional information of the such as metadata relevant with media item A etc. can also be shown in graphical user interfaces, to provide the more multi-context information relevant with media item A to user during session.
The example of the marking mechanism realized in order to managing conversation playlist 204 during Fig. 6 illustrates according to an embodiment of the invention, agreement session between a plurality of users.In this example, user Rick, Bob and Jane is just participating in the session promoting realization via social media network 112.During this session of participation, user can use their calculation element (mobile or nontransfered type) to add media item from the source of any amount to session playlist 204.As mentioned above, these sources can comprise media content provider logical source 111, media provider logical one 14 or can search, identify and be added into the third party source of session playlist.
During session, user can provide the session relevant with session playlist 204 to input 352.This session input can comprise provides the ballot relevant with any media item in session playlist to input 290.As shown in the figure, media item C is current in broadcasting.User may provide them the respective ballot paper relevant with media item C when media item is in broadcasting.
User can also provide they the ballot preference relevant with any media item in session playlist 204 (agree with, disapprove, grading, comment etc.).Then the part of this ballot input as session input 352 is communicated.This session input is provided to marking logic 354, and wherein this marking logic 354 identifies ballot input 290, and process ballot input 290 is to produce the score of the arbitrary media item in session playlist 204.
As described in reference to Fig. 7, ballot input 290 must be analyzed to judge whether specific user can provide the ballot of particular type.In addition, be affirmative vote or negative vote according to ballot, process and undertaken being not suitable for score adjustment for the certain media items configuration in session playlist 204.Once marking logic 354 has processed from the ballot input 290 received by arbitrary user during session, marking logic 354 will communicate with session playlist rank 356.
The adjustment that session playlist rank 356 will receive for the arbitrary media item in session playlist 204 from marking logic 354, and conversational list 350 is adjusted.Conversational list 350 maintain media content 360 mark, for the score 362 of each media item and broadcasting time 364.As shown in the figure, the marking provided for each media item in conversational list 356 by depend on ballot paper be for or against, whether ballot paper come from the user and other process that with the addition of this media item.
In one embodiment, once generate score, marking 362 is used to carry out rank by most popular order to media item 360, to make the most popular media item in first play session playlist 204 during session.Once have adjusted conversational list 350 according to session playlist rank 356, Rendering logic 372 uses this ranking information fill in a dynamic fashion during session and adjust session playlist 204.Thus, during session, the session playlist after viewing adjusts based on the marking that this group provides by Rick, Bob and Jane.
Fig. 7 illustrates the more details drawing of marking logic 354 as discussed in reference to Figure 6.Marking logic 354 receives session input 352.As mentioned above, session input 352 can comprise following content: be added into the media item of session playlist 204, the media item from session playlist 204 deletion, the ballot etc. agreeing with or oppose relevant with the arbitrary media item session playlist 204.This input is provided to marking logic 354.
The type that first marking logic 354 will be determined for the ballot paper received by arbitrary media item.To ballot types processor 380 be utilized to carry out this process.Judgement ballot paper is affirmative vote or negative vote by ballot types processor 380.If ballot paper is affirmative vote, then ballot types processor 380 will communicate with affirmative vote module 382.Affirmative vote module 382 will perform ballot paper license verifier 384, and wherein this ballot paper license verifier 384 will judge that affirmative vote is from the addition of the people of media item or participating in the people of session.If affirmative vote is from the people that with the addition of media item, then ballot paper license verifier 384 will communicate with refusal affirmative vote machine 386.Refusal affirmative vote machine 386 can send to user the message that expression do not allow these users to vote for the media item that they have been added into session playlist.
In another embodiment, replace the communication of message, when user by this specific medium to when being added into session playlist 204, system will not process the affirmative vote of this user simply.If affirmative vote comes from the people except the people that with the addition of media item, then permission affirmative vote machine 388 is processed, and operate 390 the score to this media item is added+1 point.Thus, in the present embodiment, ticket value+1 point is respectively agreed with.Then the adjustment of this score is communicated to and upgrades to obtain sub-module 400.Upgrade sub-module 400 carries out communicating to make it possible to upgrade and rank conversational list 350 with the session playlist rank 356 of Fig. 6.
If ballot types processor 380 is judged as that ballot paper is negative vote, then ballot paper license verifier 394 confirms to oppose whether ballot comes from the people of the media item that with the addition of as ballot object using first checking.In one embodiment, allow any user to carry out opposition ballot, and whether be that the people that with the addition of media item has nothing to do with these users.In another embodiment, do not allow the user that with the addition of certain media items carry out opposition ballot, and refuse negative vote machine 385 by perform with refusal accept this specific user opposition ballot.
As above for as described in refusal affirmative vote machine 386, refusal negative vote machine 396 can carry out communicating to provide and refuse accept ballot paper or do not allow relevant message of voting simply with user.If allow to oppose ballot, then permission negative vote machine 396 is processed.This process by comprise in operation 397, in order to determine the calculating of suitably deduction for this specific negative vote.Operation 397 by be included in distribute suitable negative vote score value before carry out two different situations processing.
In one embodiment, in 397a, when total negative vote is greater than total affirmative vote, respectively oppose ticket value-1/ (total negative vote-total affirmative vote).If total negative vote is less than or equal to total affirmative vote in 397b, then respectively oppose ticket value-1.Then will be communicated to module 398 for the determined value of negative vote, wherein in this module 398, deduct based on calculated value.Be communicated to by this deduction and upgrade to obtain sub-module 400, wherein this upgrades sub-module 400 communicates with session playlist rank 356.Thus, by the constraint of application affirmative vote and negative vote constraint, the abuse of specific participating user can be prevented, and this abuse potential destroys the better appreciation of one group of specific user.Similarly, as mentioned above, session playlist rank 356 is configured to the renewal of the score providing media item, thus impact the adjustment of media item in triggering session playlist 204 and rearrangement.Therefore, rearrangement is following automatic business processing, wherein as according to example constraint adjust, the ballot of feedback that the conversation-based user of this automatic business processing provides occurs in a dynamic fashion during interactive session.
By performing this voting mechanism or constraint, user is prevented to vote against on other proprietary media item thus the item only added for this specific user affected in playlist carries out the broadcasting of media item.Only in order to the object of example, assuming that there are 11 media item (song) (song from user A and 10 songs from other user) in playlist queue.If user A votes against to all 10 songs, then each ballot paper only will be worth-0.1 point.Although this song (0.9 score is compared to 1.0) that will all song position made lower than user A, only need the song of any other user to user A to throw a ticket negative vote and the song of user A just can be made lower than other negative votes all (0.0 compared to 0.9).
In one embodiment, process score is also needed to maintain an equal level.Score is identical and the song (media item) that ballot paper number is identical sorts by timestamp when adding these songs.Fig. 6 is this situation shown in conversational list 350, wherein in this conversational list 350, and media item B and D must be divided into " 2 " separately, but this two media item sequence in session playlist 204 is by the timestamp (TS) based on them.That is, media item B added before media item D, although and the score of both is identical, and the position of media item B in session playlist 204 is higher.
In addition, but song that ballot paper number different identical to score by the quantity of negative vote is sorted.The more track of negative vote will be in lower position in queue (that is, session playlist).The reason of this mechanism is as follows: in one embodiment, agrees with ticket value 1 point but the mark of negative vote value may be less, and thus full marks negative vote is the signal stronger than affirmative vote.In addition, usually, utilize and share playlist, and try to please compared with more people, be more preferably and enrage people less.
In order to illustrate an example, assuming that song is added in two user's forward play lists.These two use are not voted to any track per family, and therefore the score of all songs is 1.To first play first track added.Second track play will be second track etc. added.Now, the score of two tracks in queue is all 4.Track A has 5 affirmative votes and 2 negative votes.Track B has 3 affirmative votes but without negative vote.Because nobody opposes to listen to track B, these two people do not want to listen to track A really, and therefore the actual rank of track B is higher.
Again, although describe song exemplarily, the part of media item as session playlist 204 for any type of employing digital form can be made.In a concrete example, the media item being added into session playlist 204 should have relatively short form, to make it possible to play multiple media item during session.In addition, in one embodiment, session can be the time that meeting is shared the user in session and just interacted with one another.Certainly, meeting can be used for find enjoyment (such as, and friend go out object for appreciation or business).
Such as, user visits social media network 112 by using themselves calculation element, and starts session at particular point in time.This session can continue, as long as participant expects.Such as, according to the background of session, session can be a few minutes ~ several hours.Appreciate if session is used for amusement, then session may need a few minutes or multiple hours.If session is used for commercial object, then this session also can be a few minutes or continue multiple hours.In this context, maintain during session and process shared session playlist 204.Once session completes, playlist is also removed.
In one embodiment, to play, share, statistics that the type of the media item of comment etc. is relevant processes, to make it possible to communicate with user better in the time after a while.Further, about session, the next friend's communicate status information to user of these statisticss or the fact can also be used.Assuming that provide the license of issuing model for user, then these status informations or the fact can use the form of the model of the user's stream in the social networks of user.Such as, the interesting fact may be that " when the school of listened to music is Reggae, Jane likes listening to song A.”。The implication of the additional facts that may issue could for " Bob and Rick goes out object for appreciation, and they are just listening to following playlist, click here to check! ".In some cases, if your some friends at media (such as, audio frequency, video, game etc.) taste of aspect is similar, then the social networks of user can advise inviting friend to go out object for appreciation, wherein when going out object for appreciation, some playlist can be shared and these playlists are voted.The implication of a message may be " why not you invite Jane to go out object for appreciation? she also likes Reggae, and she can add very cruel thing to your playlist! ".
If some users added in the user of session commonly listen to a class music during session, then the additional information provided by the analysis of statistics can be the recommendation to these users.Such as, if lineup adds session evening and continue several hours on every Fridays, then recommended engine can provide this how first song that group people may appreciate during next session to this group.
System can provide such as such as the following recommendation to user: " at Sunday afternoon, you participate in the session with Rick and Bob, you appreciate Brazilian music ... the session here for you provides some suggestion ".In another embodiment, system can generate automatic model to the friend of the user just participating in session.This automatic model is owing to relating to session playlist, and therefore this automatic model can provide to appreciate with user and listen to or watch the relevant general information of what content.Such as, system can be issued to the stream of user: " Rick is just listening to cool jazz music together with Bob, hears some music in their shared playlist.”。
Consider above example, should be apparent, can be communicated to the type of the notice of the friend participant of user, message, model etc. and form owing to relating to the playlist shared during session, be therefore multiple.Therefore, owing to processing with utilizing the data sharing the use of playlist relevant with interaction, therefore (applying in logic and contextual situation) model of described example of obtaining according to history or current interaction and the fact can extend to multiple context and form.
In addition, as mentioned above, replace only track (such as, audio frequency or music), said method also can be applicable to the playlist of Online Video.In alternative embodiments, negative vote can be worth full marks, makes no matter to vote against to how many song, and any have complete veto power per capita.In addition, song score nearest integer can be rounded to, thus any actual influence can not be produced to rank from the too much negative vote of a user is actual.Can also break and the maintaining an equal level of affirmative vote or aggregate votes.
But, utilize less negative vote to break fair also feasible.Replace agreeing with or opposing, people/user can also be carried out from 1 ~ 5 star to the version that song (media item) is graded.Therefore, should be appreciated that and can utilize and analyze the rating scheme of any type, rewrite by the group participating in session play each media item used with the score of the session playlist during automatically adjusting session.
