- This specification relates to presenting online content to users accessing the Internet and, more particularly, to methods and systems for identifying relationships between different online content items wherein these relationships are used for delivering more relevant content items to online users.
- a content item such as an advertisement
- the content item may be displayed on a user computing device in a webpage or other publication.
- the content item may be presented within the publication because the content item is pertinent to the publication or it may otherwise be of interest to a user viewing the publication.
- Some content items may be selected for display on a particular web page based on information associated with the user computing device, or based on keywords found in the web page, or based on search terms provided to a search engine.
- advertisers are able to customize when and how their particular ads appear on a web page or a search results page. As such, some configurations may lead to greater impact for the advertiser (i.e., a well-performing ad), and some configurations may have a lesser impact (i.e., a poor-performing ad).

- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable a content management system (“CMS”) to identify relevant content items for an online user by identifying relationships between different online content items. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein facilitate identifying relationships between content items, such as online advertisements (“ads”), by examining co-occurrences of the content items within a body of occurrence data, such as a body of search results.
- CMS content management system
- online content items e.g., ads
- occurrence results Two separate online content items are said to “co-occur” when the two ads appear together within the results of the same search query.
- co-occurrence events For example, if an online user enters a search query on a search engine, the search query generates a list of resulting web pages (i.e., organic listings) presented to the user on a search results page.
- the results page may also include one or more ads or “ad impressions” (i.e., paid listings, also referred to as an ad occurrence).
- ads such as AD1 and AD2
- Ad co-occurrence may be viewed as an indication of some aspect of relation between the two ads AD1 and AD2. For example, the more times AD1 and AD2 co-occur, the stronger the relationship between the two ads appears to be. Thus, realization of this relationship may offer analysts opportunities to leverage the similarities by, for example, using data from AD2 to improve the performance of AD1.
- a graph is built that represents co-occurrence relationships between ads.
- a graph in the mathematical field of graph theory
- a graph includes “nodes” (or “vertices”) and links or “edges” that connect two nodes.
- a graph is constructed within a computing device, such as the CMS, by examining the search logs of many users and identifying ad co-occurrences.
- each node represents a single ad (e.g., AD1 would be represented by a first node, and AD2 would be represented by a second node), and each edge represents the relationship between the two nodes (e.g., AD1 and AD2) that the edge connects.
- Each edge has a value associated with it that represents a strength of the relationship between the two ads. In some embodiments, when ads co-occur more often together, the strength of their relationship (i.e., the value of their corresponding shared edge) increases.
- the ads co-occur graph is constructed and leveraged for analyzing relationships between ads. These relationships may be leveraged for analytical purposes by advertisers, content management services, and other involved parties. For example, an analyst may identify an under-performing ad such as “AD1” based on some performance metric for that ad (e.g., an ad that is not being selected and has a low impression count, or an ad that has a sufficient number of impressions but the impressions are not generating enough conversions or sales). AD1 may be underperforming because of its advertisement settings such as, for example, poor keyword selection. The analyst looks at the ads co-occur graph and, more specifically, at any other ads with which AD1 has a strong relationship.
- AD1 under-performing ad
- AD1 a “strong neighbor” of AD1 (i.e., another node with which the underperforming ad shares a high-valued edge due to high co-occurrence), such as AD2, and if that neighbor is performing better than AD1 (e.g., has higher performance metrics than AD1), the analyst may look to the advertisement settings of the neighbor ad (AD2) for ideas of how the underperforming ad (AD1) may be reconfigured. For example, if AD2 has high click-through rates and uses certain keywords not used by AD1, the analyst may consider adding those same keywords to AD1. As such, the underperforming ad (AD1) may start to perform better with the new keywords. Since the keywords were used by a neighbor that frequently co-occurs with the underperforming ad, that co-occurrence relationship may help improve performance of the underperforming ad.
- the ads co-occur graph may also be used to analyze advertisement budgets.
- an advertisement may be assigned a fixed budget (i.e., another example advertisement setting in which a fixed amount of money is configured and used dynamically to pay for purchasing online content from the search engine owner). Every time a user clicks on an ad, the search engine owner will charge the advertiser (i.e., decrement an amount from the budget).
- the ads co-occur graph may be used to identify an advertisement with low occurrences due to having consumed its budget (i.e., a budget-constrained ad). The strong neighbors of the budget-constrained ad may be examined, and a new budget may be suggested for the budget-constrained ad, such as an average of the neighbors' budgets.
- the ads co-occur graph may also be used to analyze bidding suggestions.
- the bid is the amount the advertiser is willing to pay to the search engine owner when a user clicks on the ad.
- a ranking (i.e., display order) of ads may be determined not only by the relevance to the search query, but also by the bid amount. In other words, a higher bid amount leads to a higher ranking, and thus the more likely an ad is to show up on the front pages and top advertisement slots within search query results.
- the ads co-occur graph may be used to identify a low performance ad and compare its bid amount to better-performing strong neighbors. A higher bid amount may be recommended in order to improve performance.
- the ads co-occur graph may be used to reveal other relevant ads suggestions for individual users during their online activities.
- a particular user clicks on an ad on a search results page this indicates that the user is interested in the product and/or theme of that ad type.
- the search engine may use the ads co-occur graph to identify strong neighbors (i.e., similar ads) and present these ads to the user during subsequent activities.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) identifying a first content item, such as an ad, in a memory; (b) identifying a plurality of occurrence results involving a first content item wherein each occurrence result includes providing the first content item for display on a user device; (c) computing a number of co-occurrence events involving the first content item and a second content item from the plurality of occurrence results, wherein each co-occurrence event includes providing both the first content item and the second content item for display on a user device; (d) computing a relationship value between the first content item and the second content item using at least the number of co-occurrence events; (e) identifying a first advertisement setting for the first content item, wherein the first advertisement setting relates to the plurality of occurrence results for the first content item; (f) providing a recommendation for adjusting the first advertisement setting

- graph 500 is constructed between a plurality of ads 402 . A node for each ad 402 is built, and edges 404 are constructed between nodes.
- search query logs are analyzed for a period of time, such as 30 days.
- a number of co-occurrences (co-occurrence events) between two ads, such as AD1 502 and AD2 504 are computed from the search query logs. This figure represents the number of times the two ads have co-occurred within search results in response to a search query submitted by a user. In some embodiments, this number may be used as the weight associated with edge 404 . In other embodiments, this number is modified based on the total number of times that AD1 502 and/or AD2 504 appeared in the search query logs (whether or not they appeared together).
- a total number of times AD1 502 appeared in the search query logs during the same 30 day period is computed, as well as a total number of times AD2 504 appeared.

- graph 500 is constructed for a given time period but only for a certain ad, such as “AD1”.
- search query logs would be scanned to build graph 500 , but only other ads co-occurring with AD1 would be built into graph 500 .

- graph 500 is constructed with all ads appearing within the given time period.
- all ads appearing within the search query logs would have nodes created, each node may have many edges, each edge would be shared with another node also appearing in the search query logs, and each edge is not necessarily shared with a specific ad, such as AD1.
- CMS 106 calculates the total number of co-occurrences between AD1 502 and AD2 504 as 100 times.
- the weight of edge 404 is set to 100, representing an “absolute” strength of relationship between ads 402 (i.e., the two ads co-occurred 100 times during the 30-day time period).
- CMS 106 calculates the total number of co-occurrences, but additionally calculates the total number of times that each ad occurs itself in the search query logs for that same 30 day period.

- AD2 504 i.e., the total number of co-occurrences.
- the strength of relationship of AD1 502 with respect to AD2 504 can be viewed as the number of co-occurrences between AD1 and AD2 divided by the total number of occurrences of just AD1:
- Weight (AD1 ⁇ AD2) in some embodiments, would be assigned as the weight of arc 510 , representing the relationship strength of AD2 504 in relation to AD1 502 . In other words, AD2 504 appears on 25% of the search results that AD1 502 appears on.
- a strength of relationship of AD2 504 with respect to AD1 502 can be viewed as the number of co-occurrences between AD1 and AD2 divided by the total number of occurrences of just AD2 504 . Presume that the AD2 504 total is 150 (i.e., AD2 occurred 150 times during the 30-day period):
- Weight (AD2 ⁇ AD1) in some embodiments, would be assigned as the weight of arc 512 , representing the relationship strength of AD1 502 in relation to AD2 504 .
- AD1 502 appears on 67% of the search results that AD2 504 appears on.
- AD1 502 As an underperforming advertisement (i.e., AD1 has some performance metric that analyst considers low).
- the analyst might look at graph 500 from AD1's 502 perspective and notice that AD2 504 has a significant number of co-occurrences with AD1 502 (i.e., 100 co-occurrences).
- the analyst may consider AD2's 504 co-occurrence “probability” with AD1 (i.e., Weight (AD1 ⁇ AD2), in some sense, represents how probable is it that AD2 appears in an AD1 search query result, from a historical standpoint).
- AD2 504 only co-occurs 25% of the time with AD1 502 , and thus the analyst may not consider AD2 504 strong enough of a relationship with AD1 502 to justify, for example, a change toward AD2's 504 settings.
- AD2 504 As an underperforming advertisement.
- the analyst might look at graph 500 from AD2's 504 perspective and notice that AD1 502 has a significant number of co-occurrences with AD2 504 (i.e., 100 co-occurrences, same as above).
- the analyst may consider AD1's 502 co-occurrence probability with AD2 (i.e., Weight (AD2 ⁇ AD1)).
- AD1 502 co-occurs 67% of the time with AD2 504 , a number which may be high enough for analyst to consider AD1's 502 relationship strong enough with AD2 504 to justify, for example, a change of AD2's 504 settings toward AD1 502 , or some aggregation of multiple strong neighbors' settings.
- performance metrics associated with ads are considered. Performance metrics represent some measure of how well or poorly a particular ad is performing relative to some aspect of performance, such as click-through rate or conversion rate.
- a recommendation for a settings change for an underperforming ad may only be made if a higher-performing neighbor is found. For example, presume AD1 502 is an underperforming ad, and presume that AD2 504 is a strong neighbor. If AD2 504 is also underperforming (i.e., has a low performance metric relative to AD1's performance metric), a settings change toward AD2 504 may actually be detrimental to AD1's future performance.
- AD2 504 is performing better than AD1 502 (i.e., has a higher performance metric in some aspect)
- a recommendation toward AD2's settings may be advantageous and lead to higher future performance for AD1 502 .
- performance metrics for ads are collected, compared, and/or influence recommendations.
- graph 500 is constructed using a MapReduce programming model.
- Search results logs may be large, and thus may benefit from cluster computing and parallelization.
- search records are first converted to co-occurrence records.
- a search record may be in a query log entry [query, ad1, ad2, ad3], wherein “query” represents some ancillary aspects of a given query, such as search terms, and where “ad1”, “ad2”, and “ad3” represent three ads that occurred within that query (and co-occurred together).
- the query log form is converted to a co-occurrence form [node: ⁇ nodeid>, cooccurred-ads: ⁇ list of one or more ads>], where “ ⁇ nodeid>” refers to a unique ad, such as AD1 502 , and where “ ⁇ list of one or more ads>” refers to one or more other unique ads, such as AD2 504 that co-occurred with “ ⁇ nodeid>”.
- the example single query log entry [query, ad1, ad2, ad3] generates three separate co-occurrence entries:
- a “map” phase is performed.
- the co-occurrence records are mapped to multiple computing devices, such as computing device 200 (shown in FIG. 2 ), for further processing using their nodes as keys.
- each computing device only processes a portion of the records.
- a partial graph such as graph 500 , is constructed by grouping and merging co-occurrence records for the same “ ⁇ nodeid>” together. For example, consider just node “ad1”. In the above example, node “ad1” co-occurred with “ad2” and “ad3” once during the example query.
- the combination of the two “ad1” example co-occurrence records yields a node represented by [node: ad1, co-occurred-ads: ad2(2), ad3(1), ad4(1)], where the parenthetical number behind the co-occurred-ads represents a sum of co-occurrences of “ad1” with that particular ad (i.e., a total weight for the edge between “ad1” and the co-occurred-ad).

The method includes identifying a first content item and identifying a plurality of occurrence results for the first content item. Each occurrence result of the plurality of occurrence results includes an indicator that the first content item was retrieved along with a list of other content items based on an online activity of at least one user device. The method also includes computing a number of co-occurrence events involving the first content item and a second content item from the plurality of occurrence results.

The method further includes computing a relationship value between first content item and second content item using at least the number of co-occurrence events.
Description
- This specification relates to presenting online content to users accessing the Internet and, more particularly, to methods and systems for identifying relationships between different online content items wherein these relationships are used for delivering more relevant content items to online users.
- A content item, such as an advertisement, may be displayed on a user computing device in a webpage or other publication. The content item may be presented within the publication because the content item is pertinent to the publication or it may otherwise be of interest to a user viewing the publication. Some content items may be selected for display on a particular web page based on information associated with the user computing device, or based on keywords found in the web page, or based on search terms provided to a search engine. In some cases, advertisers are able to customize when and how their particular ads appear on a web page or a search results page. As such, some configurations may lead to greater impact for the advertiser (i.e., a well-performing ad), and some configurations may have a lesser impact (i.e., a poor-performing ad).
- In one aspect, a computer-implemented method for identifying relationships between online content items is provided. The method uses a computing device including a processor and a memory. The method includes identifying a first content item. The method also includes identifying a plurality of occurrence results for the first content item. Each occurrence result of the plurality of occurrence results includes an indicator that the first content item was retrieved along with a list of other content items based, at least in part, on an online activity of at least one user device. The method further includes computing a number of co-occurrence events involving the first content item and a second content item from the plurality of occurrence results. Each co-occurrence event includes an indicator that both the first content item and the second content item were retrieved together in an occurrence result. The method also includes computing a relationship value between the first content item and the second content item using at least the number of co-occurrence events.
- In another aspect, a computer system is provided. The computer system includes at least one processor. The computer system also includes at least one memory comprising computer-executable instructions that, when executed by said at least one processor, cause said at least one processor to identify a first content item stored within the at least one memory. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to identify a plurality of occurrence results for the first content item. Each occurrence result of the plurality of occurrence results includes an indicator that the first content item was retrieved along with a list of other content items based, at least in part, on an online activity of at least one user device. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to compute a number of co-occurrence events involving the first content item and a second content item from the plurality of occurrence results. Each co-occurrence event includes an indicator that both the first content item and the second content item were retrieved together in an occurrence result. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to compute a relationship value between the first content item and the second content item using at least the number of co-occurrence events.
- In yet another aspect, computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided. When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to identify a first content item stored within a memory. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to identify a plurality of occurrence results for the first content item. Each occurrence result of the plurality of occurrence results includes an indicator that the first content item was retrieved along with a list of other content items based, at least in part, on an online activity of at least one user device. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to compute a number of co-occurrence events involving the first content item and a second content item from the plurality of occurrence results. Each co-occurrence event includes an indicator that both the first content item and the second content item were retrieved together in an occurrence result. The computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to compute a relationship value between the first content item and the second content item using at least the number of co-occurrence events.

- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable a content management system (“CMS”) to identify relevant content items for an online user by identifying relationships between different online content items. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein facilitate identifying relationships between content items, such as online advertisements (“ads”), by examining co-occurrences of the content items within a body of occurrence data, such as a body of search results.
- In the example embodiment, online content items (e.g., ads) are said to “occur” when the content item is offered or delivered for display on a user device. These occurrences of online content items are also referred to herein as “occurrence results.” Two separate online content items are said to “co-occur” when the two ads appear together within the results of the same search query. These co-occurrences of online content items are also referred to herein as “co-occurrence events.” For example, if an online user enters a search query on a search engine, the search query generates a list of resulting web pages (i.e., organic listings) presented to the user on a search results page. The results page may also include one or more ads or “ad impressions” (i.e., paid listings, also referred to as an ad occurrence). When two ads, such as AD1 and AD2, appear within the same set of search results, the two ads are said to co-occur. Ad co-occurrence may be viewed as an indication of some aspect of relation between the two ads AD1 and AD2. For example, the more times AD1 and AD2 co-occur, the stronger the relationship between the two ads appears to be. Thus, realization of this relationship may offer analysts opportunities to leverage the similarities by, for example, using data from AD2 to improve the performance of AD1.
- Further, in the example embodiment, a graph is built that represents co-occurrence relationships between ads. Generally, a graph (in the mathematical field of graph theory) includes “nodes” (or “vertices”) and links or “edges” that connect two nodes. In the example embodiment, a graph is constructed within a computing device, such as the CMS, by examining the search logs of many users and identifying ad co-occurrences. Within the graph, each node represents a single ad (e.g., AD1 would be represented by a first node, and AD2 would be represented by a second node), and each edge represents the relationship between the two nodes (e.g., AD1 and AD2) that the edge connects. Each edge has a value associated with it that represents a strength of the relationship between the two ads. In some embodiments, when ads co-occur more often together, the strength of their relationship (i.e., the value of their corresponding shared edge) increases.
- As such, the ads co-occur graph is constructed and leveraged for analyzing relationships between ads. These relationships may be leveraged for analytical purposes by advertisers, content management services, and other involved parties. For example, an analyst may identify an under-performing ad such as “AD1” based on some performance metric for that ad (e.g., an ad that is not being selected and has a low impression count, or an ad that has a sufficient number of impressions but the impressions are not generating enough conversions or sales). AD1 may be underperforming because of its advertisement settings such as, for example, poor keyword selection. The analyst looks at the ads co-occur graph and, more specifically, at any other ads with which AD1 has a strong relationship. If the analyst finds a “strong neighbor” of AD1 (i.e., another node with which the underperforming ad shares a high-valued edge due to high co-occurrence), such as AD2, and if that neighbor is performing better than AD1 (e.g., has higher performance metrics than AD1), the analyst may look to the advertisement settings of the neighbor ad (AD2) for ideas of how the underperforming ad (AD1) may be reconfigured. For example, if AD2 has high click-through rates and uses certain keywords not used by AD1, the analyst may consider adding those same keywords to AD1. As such, the underperforming ad (AD1) may start to perform better with the new keywords. Since the keywords were used by a neighbor that frequently co-occurs with the underperforming ad, that co-occurrence relationship may help improve performance of the underperforming ad.
- In some embodiments, the ads co-occur graph may also be used to analyze advertisement budgets. For example, in some embodiments, an advertisement may be assigned a fixed budget (i.e., another example advertisement setting in which a fixed amount of money is configured and used dynamically to pay for purchasing online content from the search engine owner). Every time a user clicks on an ad, the search engine owner will charge the advertiser (i.e., decrement an amount from the budget). The ads co-occur graph may be used to identify an advertisement with low occurrences due to having consumed its budget (i.e., a budget-constrained ad). The strong neighbors of the budget-constrained ad may be examined, and a new budget may be suggested for the budget-constrained ad, such as an average of the neighbors' budgets.
- The ads co-occur graph may also be used to analyze bidding suggestions. In some embodiments, the bid is the amount the advertiser is willing to pay to the search engine owner when a user clicks on the ad. A ranking (i.e., display order) of ads may be determined not only by the relevance to the search query, but also by the bid amount. In other words, a higher bid amount leads to a higher ranking, and thus the more likely an ad is to show up on the front pages and top advertisement slots within search query results. The ads co-occur graph may be used to identify a low performance ad and compare its bid amount to better-performing strong neighbors. A higher bid amount may be recommended in order to improve performance.
- Further, the ads co-occur graph may be used to reveal other relevant ads suggestions for individual users during their online activities. When a particular user clicks on an ad on a search results page, this indicates that the user is interested in the product and/or theme of that ad type. The search engine may use the ads co-occur graph to identify strong neighbors (i.e., similar ads) and present these ads to the user during subsequent activities.
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) identifying a first content item, such as an ad, in a memory; (b) identifying a plurality of occurrence results involving a first content item wherein each occurrence result includes providing the first content item for display on a user device; (c) computing a number of co-occurrence events involving the first content item and a second content item from the plurality of occurrence results, wherein each co-occurrence event includes providing both the first content item and the second content item for display on a user device; (d) computing a relationship value between the first content item and the second content item using at least the number of co-occurrence events; (e) identifying a first advertisement setting for the first content item, wherein the first advertisement setting relates to the plurality of occurrence results for the first content item; (f) providing a recommendation for adjusting the first advertisement setting based at least in part on the relationship value between the first content item and the second content item; (g) identifying a second advertisement setting for the second content item, wherein providing a recommendation further comprises providing a recommendation based at least in part on the second advertisement setting; (h) identifying a first performance metric associated with the first content item and a second performance metric associated with the second content item, wherein providing a recommendation further comprising providing a recommendation based at least in part on a comparison between the first performance metric and the second performance metric; (i) identifying a plurality of occurrence results from a plurality of search results; (j) building a graph data structure in the memory; (k) providing a visual representation of the graph data structure to a user of the computing device; (l) computing a total number of occurrences of the first content item; (m) computing the relationship value by dividing the number of co-occurrence events by the total number of occurrences of the first content item; (n) identifying a plurality of occurrence results from a plurality of search results occurring during a first time period; and (o) outputting the relationship value to a user of the computing device.

CMS 106 may provide various features to thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 may deliver content (associated with the content providers 102) to theuser access devices 108 when users access publications from thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 can be configured to deliver content that is relevant to publisher sites, publications, and publisher audiences. - In some examples, the
CMS 106 may crawl publications provided by thepublishers 104 and deliver content that is relevant to publisher sites, publications and publisher audiences based on the crawled publications. TheCMS 106 may also selectively recommend and/or provide content based on user information and behavior, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website. TheCMS 106 may store such information in ageneral database 146. In some examples, theCMS 106 can add search to a publisher site and deliver content configured to provide appropriate and relevant content relative to search results generated by requests from visitors of the publisher site. A combination of these and other approaches can be used to deliver relevant content. - The
CMS 106 may allow thepublishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated content to be displayed with publications provided by thepublishers 104. For example, thepublishers 104 may search through content in thecontent repository 126 and select certain content for display with their publications. - The
CMS 106 may be configured to selectively recommend and provide content created by thecontent providers 102 to theuser access devices 108 directly or through thepublishers 104. TheCMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide content to a particular publisher 104 (as described in further detail herein) or a requestinguser access device 108 when a user requests search results or loads a publication from thepublisher 104. - In some implementations, the
CMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in theenvironment 100. For example, theCMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of thecontent providers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by theCMS 106. - “Computing devices”, for example
user access devices 108, may include any devices capable of receiving information from thenetwork 110. Theuser access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks.

Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, a GPS (Global Positioning system) receiver module may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 200, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 200. -
Computing device 200 may also communicate audibly using an audio codec, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information. The audio codec may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of device. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating oncomputing device 200. -
Computing device 200 may be implemented in a number of different forms. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone, or as part of a smart phone, personal digital assistant, a computer tablet, or other similar mobile device. - To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.

FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example search results page as seen by an online user of the Internet using a computing device ofFIG. 2 in the advertising environment shown inFIG. 1 . In the example embodiment, an online user such as user 150 (shown inFIG. 1 ) submitssearch terms 302 to a search engine. The search engine returns search query results 304, which may include one or more ads (i.e., online content items, also sometimes referred to as “paid listings”) 310, such as AD1, AD2, and AD3, as well as one or more search results references 320 (also sometimes referred to as “organic listings”). In the example embodiment, the search engine is similar to CMS 106 (shown inFIG. 1 ). It should be understood, however, that while the example embodiments are described in relation to a search engine and associated search results (i.e., a specific type of “occurrence results”), the systems and methods described herein may be practiced by any entity that has access to occurrence data and/or co-occurrence data for a plurality of advertisements such as, for example, advertisement display logs for web pages, or other content items. - In the example shown in
FIG. 3 , AD1, AD2, and AD3 co-occur because they appear together within the results of a single search query (i.e., an indicator both that each of these ads occur within an occurrence result, and an indicator that they all co-occur with each other in an occurrence result). In some embodiments, search query results 304 are stored in a search query log within a database such as database 126 (shown inFIG. 1 ), and includes at least thesearch terms 302 and the associatedads 310 that appeared. During operation, in the example embodiment, many search query results such assearch query result 304 are stored in a database for later use. As described in greater detail below, the database of search query results is used to analyze co-occurrences (co-occurrence events) between various ads. -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of a portion of an example ads co-occurgraph 400 that may be generated in accordance with the systems and processes described herein. In the example embodiment,graph 400 is generated using occurrence results such as shown inFIG. 3 and computing devices ofFIG. 2 in the advertising environment shown inFIG. 1 .Graph 400 includes a plurality ofnodes 402. Eachnode 402 may be linked toother nodes 402 by anedge 404. Eachedge 404 connects to twonodes 402. In the example embodiment, eachnode 402 represents a single ad, or “ad group.” Eachedge 404 represents a strength of relationship between the twonodes 402 that it connects. In some embodiments,graph 400 is undirected (i.e., there is only a single value that represents the strength of relationship between the twoads 402, regardless of which node is being analyzed). In other embodiments,graph 400 is a directed graph and, more specifically, a weighted directed graph (where the weights represent the strength of relationship in a specific direction), which is described in greater detail below with respect toFIG. 5 . -
FIG. 5 is an illustration of a portion of another example ads co-occurgraph 500 that may be generated in accordance with the systems and processes described herein. In the example embodiment,graph 500 is generated using occurrence results such as shown inFIG. 3 and computing devices ofFIG. 2 in the advertising environment shown inFIG. 1 .Graph 500 is a “directed graph” in which eachedge 404 includes two directional components: afirst arc 510 and asecond arc 512.First arc 510 is directed from a first node 502 (e.g., “AD1”) to a second node 504 (e.g., “AD2”).Second arc 512 is directed from second node 504 (“AD2”) to first node 502 (“AD1”). Eacharc ads - In reference to
FIG. 4 andFIG. 5 ,graphs FIG. 1 ) or computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ).Graphs Graphs graph 500 is constructed between a plurality ofads 402. A node for eachad 402 is built, and edges 404 are constructed between nodes. - More specifically, in the example embodiment, search query logs are analyzed for a period of time, such as 30 days. A number of co-occurrences (co-occurrence events) between two ads, such as
AD1 502 andAD2 504, are computed from the search query logs. This figure represents the number of times the two ads have co-occurred within search results in response to a search query submitted by a user. In some embodiments, this number may be used as the weight associated withedge 404. In other embodiments, this number is modified based on the total number of times thatAD1 502 and/orAD2 504 appeared in the search query logs (whether or not they appeared together). For example, a total number oftimes AD1 502 appeared in the search query logs during the same 30 day period is computed, as well as a total number oftimes AD2 504 appeared. As such, the total number of co-occurrences may be divided by the two totals forAD1 502 andAD2 504 to yield a percentage value representing the percentage of time that both co-occurred in relation to the total time either of them occurred. - In some embodiments,
graph 500 is constructed for a given time period but only for a certain ad, such as “AD1”. In other words, search query logs would be scanned to buildgraph 500, but only other ads co-occurring with AD1 would be built intograph 500. As such, only ads that co-occurred with AD1 would have nodes created within the graph, each other node would have only a single edge created, and that edge would be shared with AD1. In the example embodiment,graph 500 is constructed with all ads appearing within the given time period. As such, all ads appearing within the search query logs would have nodes created, each node may have many edges, each edge would be shared with another node also appearing in the search query logs, and each edge is not necessarily shared with a specific ad, such as AD1. - By way of example, presume that CMS 106 (shown in
FIG. 1 ) is analyzing 30 days of search query log data.CMS 106 calculates the total number of co-occurrences betweenAD1 502 andAD2 504 as 100 times. In some embodiments, the weight ofedge 404 is set to 100, representing an “absolute” strength of relationship between ads 402 (i.e., the two ads co-occurred 100 times during the 30-day time period). In other embodiments,CMS 106 calculates the total number of co-occurrences, but additionally calculates the total number of times that each ad occurs itself in the search query logs for that same 30 day period. For example, presume thatAD1 502 total occurrence is 400. In other words,AD1 502 occurred 400 times during the 30-day period. Further, 100 of those times also included AD2 504 (i.e., the total number of co-occurrences). As such, the strength of relationship ofAD1 502 with respect toAD2 504 can be viewed as the number of co-occurrences between AD1 and AD2 divided by the total number of occurrences of just AD1: -
- Weight (AD1→AD2), in some embodiments, would be assigned as the weight of
arc 510, representing the relationship strength ofAD2 504 in relation toAD1 502. In other words,AD2 504 appears on 25% of the search results thatAD1 502 appears on. - Similarly, a strength of relationship of
AD2 504 with respect toAD1 502 can be viewed as the number of co-occurrences between AD1 and AD2 divided by the total number of occurrences of justAD2 504. Presume that theAD2 504 total is 150 (i.e., AD2 occurred 150 times during the 30-day period): -
- Weight (AD2→AD1), in some embodiments, would be assigned as the weight of
arc 512, representing the relationship strength ofAD1 502 in relation toAD2 504. In other words,AD1 502 appears on 67% of the search results thatAD2 504 appears on. - Using the above example, presume that an analyst identified
AD1 502 as an underperforming advertisement (i.e., AD1 has some performance metric that analyst considers low). The analyst might look atgraph 500 from AD1's 502 perspective and notice thatAD2 504 has a significant number of co-occurrences with AD1 502 (i.e., 100 co-occurrences). The analyst may consider AD2's 504 co-occurrence “probability” with AD1 (i.e., Weight (AD1→AD2), in some sense, represents how probable is it that AD2 appears in an AD1 search query result, from a historical standpoint). However, analyst sees thatAD2 504 only co-occurs 25% of the time withAD1 502, and thus the analyst may not considerAD2 504 strong enough of a relationship withAD1 502 to justify, for example, a change toward AD2's 504 settings. - On the other hand, presume that the analyst identified
AD2 504 as an underperforming advertisement. The analyst might look atgraph 500 from AD2's 504 perspective and notice thatAD1 502 has a significant number of co-occurrences with AD2 504 (i.e., 100 co-occurrences, same as above). The analyst may consider AD1's 502 co-occurrence probability with AD2 (i.e., Weight (AD2→AD1)). Analyst sees thatAD1 502 co-occurs 67% of the time withAD2 504, a number which may be high enough for analyst to consider AD1's 502 relationship strong enough withAD2 504 to justify, for example, a change of AD2's 504 settings towardAD1 502, or some aggregation of multiple strong neighbors' settings. - Further, in some embodiments, performance metrics associated with ads are considered. Performance metrics represent some measure of how well or poorly a particular ad is performing relative to some aspect of performance, such as click-through rate or conversion rate. In some embodiments, a recommendation for a settings change for an underperforming ad may only be made if a higher-performing neighbor is found. For example, presume
AD1 502 is an underperforming ad, and presume thatAD2 504 is a strong neighbor. IfAD2 504 is also underperforming (i.e., has a low performance metric relative to AD1's performance metric), a settings change towardAD2 504 may actually be detrimental to AD1's future performance. On the other hand, ifAD2 504 is performing better than AD1 502 (i.e., has a higher performance metric in some aspect), then a recommendation toward AD2's settings may be advantageous and lead to higher future performance forAD1 502. As such, in some embodiments, performance metrics for ads are collected, compared, and/or influence recommendations. - In some of the examples provided, such as with respect to
FIG. 4 andFIG. 5 , only two nodes are described for illustrative purposes. However, it should be understood that the systems and methods described herein may involve analysis and graphs including many nodes, and nodes with many edges or no edges. - In some embodiments,
graph 500 is constructed using a MapReduce programming model. Search results logs may be large, and thus may benefit from cluster computing and parallelization. As such, search records are first converted to co-occurrence records. For example, a search record may be in a query log entry [query, ad1, ad2, ad3], wherein “query” represents some ancillary aspects of a given query, such as search terms, and where “ad1”, “ad2”, and “ad3” represent three ads that occurred within that query (and co-occurred together). The query log form is converted to a co-occurrence form [node: <nodeid>, cooccurred-ads: <list of one or more ads>], where “<nodeid>” refers to a unique ad, such asAD1 502, and where “<list of one or more ads>” refers to one or more other unique ads, such asAD2 504 that co-occurred with “<nodeid>”. As such, the example single query log entry [query, ad1, ad2, ad3] generates three separate co-occurrence entries: -
TABLE 1 Example co-occurrence entries [node: ad1, cooccurred-ads: ad2, ad3] [node: ad2, cooccured-ads: ad3, ad1] [node: ad3, cooccurred-ads: ad1, ad2] - In the example embodiment, after search records are converted to co-occurrence records, a “map” phase is performed. The co-occurrence records are mapped to multiple computing devices, such as computing device 200 (shown in
FIG. 2 ), for further processing using their nodes as keys. As such, each computing device only processes a portion of the records. On each computing device, a partial graph, such asgraph 500, is constructed by grouping and merging co-occurrence records for the same “<nodeid>” together. For example, consider just node “ad1”. In the above example, node “ad1” co-occurred with “ad2” and “ad3” once during the example query. Presume there was also another query [query2, ad1, ad2, ad4], which accordingly generates an “ad1” co-occurrence record (in addition to two others) of [node: ad1, cooccurred-ads: ad2, ad4]. During the “map” phase, the combination of the two “ad1” example co-occurrence records yields a node represented by [node: ad1, co-occurred-ads: ad2(2), ad3(1), ad4(1)], where the parenthetical number behind the co-occurred-ads represents a sum of co-occurrences of “ad1” with that particular ad (i.e., a total weight for the edge between “ad1” and the co-occurred-ad). As such, co-occurrence entries may be combined for each ad, and partial graphs are generated. - During a “reduce” phase, in the example embodiment, the partial graphs from the computing devices are collected and combined into a single graph using the same process as described above. As such, the full graph is constructed.
- Referring now to
FIG. 4 andFIG. 5 , in some embodiments, the analyst may be presented with a front-end tool that allows navigation and traversing ofgraphs graphs nodes input device 212 and/or output device 214 (shown inFIG. 2 ). In some embodiments, analyst may be a user associated with CMS 106 (shown inFIG. 1 ), a user associated with content provider 102 (shown inFIG. 1 ), and/or a publisher 104 (shown inFIG. 1 ). - Further, in some embodiments,
graph 500 may be used to examine aspects of ads categories. For example, the category in which an ad is classified may be examined based on the number of neighbors. In other words, the more neighbors an ad has, the bigger that category is for the ad. - It should be understood that, while some operations in the example embodiments disclosed herein may be described as being performed by an analyst (i.e., a human), these functions may alternatively be programmed to be performed by a computing device. In some embodiments, for example, the computing device may provide recommendations for advertisement settings changes for ads.
