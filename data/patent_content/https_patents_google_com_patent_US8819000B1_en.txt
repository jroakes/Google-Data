- the present specification relates to information retrieval.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content) that are relevant to a user's needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user. Users typically submit queries that indicate the information the users desire to retrieve. In response to the user-submitted queries, conventional search engines provide search results responsive to the queries.
- resources e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content
- search results that are responsive to the query or responsive to a variation of the query are used to generate a modified query.
- the search results are used to identify characteristics of high-quality search results. For example, common characteristics shared by resources corresponding to highly-ranked search results can be identified.
- the modified query is generated to include the limitations of the original query and an additional limitation representing one or more of the identified characteristics.

- FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating another example system that can perform query modification.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating another example process for query modification.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system 100 that can perform query modification.
- the system 100 includes a client device 102 , a server system 104 , one or more data storage devices 105 , and a network 106 .
- the client device 102 can be, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, cellular phone, smart phone, tablet computer, or navigation system.
- the functions performed by the server system 104 can be performed by individual computer systems or can be distributed across multiple computer systems.
- the network 106 can be wired or wireless or a combination of both and can include the Internet.
- the diagram shows states (A) to (G), which may occur in the sequence illustrated or in a different sequence. States (A) to (F) illustrate a flow of data, and state (G) illustrates a user interface 160 .
- a user 101 of the client device 102 initiates a search using a keyword string 119 that includes one or more query terms 121 a , 121 b .
- the context in which the keyword string 119 is received may also indicate limitations that constrain the search.
- the client device 102 transmits a query 120 including the keyword string 119 and information indicating limitations for the search from the context in which the keyword string 119 was received.
- the query 120 that is received by the server system 104 includes more than the keyword string 119 entered by the user 101 .
- the query 120 may specify limitations from context, or may provide information about the context that permits the server system 104 to identify appropriate limitations from the context.
- Context for the keyword string 119 can include, for example, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and content of a rendered resource having a user interface with which the keyword string 119 was received.
- Context can include values or states of controls on a user interface in which the keyword string 119 was received and the identity or location of a control in which the keyword string 119 was received.
- Limitations of a query 120 from context may or may not be indicated to the user 101 on a user interface.
- Limitations of the query 120 can be keyword or non-keyword query components.
- the query 120 includes at least one keyword limitation, e.g., the query terms 121 a , 121 b , and at least one non-keyword limitation 122 .
- Keyword limitations define the terms and patterns of terms to be matched against, for example, documents and metadata.
- keyword limitations include query terms and operators defining patterns of query terms, e.g., Boolean logic.
- Non-keyword limitations include other restrictions on a search. For example, non-keyword limitations can restrict locations in which keyword patterns are found or restrict values associated with a resource. Non-keyword limitations can require a search engine to identify results based on information about a document, for example, a document type, a document collection in which a document is included, a geographical location, a language, or a time or date range.
- Non-keyword limitations may restrict the values of one or more fields.
- Non-keyword limitations may restrict a value indicating, for example, a document type, a date of publication, a date of addition to a collection, an author, or a publisher.
- a non-keyword limitation may also indicate whether a resource links to or cites to a particular resource or whether a resource is similar to a particular resource.
- Non-keyword limitations can require a search engine to identify results using an index focused on news, web pages, books, or scholarly articles, thus requiring the identified results to reference documents in a particular corpus of documents.
- Non-keyword limitations can thus have the effect of narrowing a source set of documents or source set of data from which responsive results are identified.
- Keyword and non-keyword limitations can be expressed in a keyword string, in context for a keyword string, or both.
- a keyword string can include a label, such as “dateafter:”, that can indicate a date restriction on a publication date, which is a non-keyword limitation.
- the same limitation may alternatively or additionally indicated on a control a user interface.
- the contents of the keyword string 119 is denoted by brackets, for example, “[nuclear proliferation]”, indicating that the query 120 includes the term 121 a “nuclear” and the term 121 b “proliferation”.
- the query 120 also includes a non-keyword limitation 122 that constrains a search engine to provide results that reference corresponding resources that are scholarly articles. Results that are responsive to the query 120 do not correspond to other types of documents, such as web pages and books.
- the limitation 122 in the example is indicated in context for the keyword string 119 rather than in the keyword string 119 itself.
- the limitation 122 can be included due to user 101 entering the keyword string 119 on a user interface (not shown) of a web page for searching for scholarly articles.
- the one or more non-keyword limitations 122 of the query 120 may alternatively be expressed in a keyword string.
- the server system 104 performs the actions described for states (B) through (F), described below, in response to each query received by the server system 104 .
- the server system 104 obtains first search results 126 a - 126 d responsive to a modified query 125 .
- the modified query 125 is a variation of the original query 120 that omits one or more non-keyword limitations of the original query 120 .
- the modified query 125 broadens the original query 120 in at least one aspect.
- the server system 104 generates the modified query 125 , which omits the limitation 122 requiring results to be scholarly articles. Consequently, the identified results 126 a - 126 d reference resources from the web, a broader collection of which scholarly articles are a subset.
- Each search result 126 a - 126 d references at least one corresponding resource 127 a - 127 d .
- the reference characters for the resources 127 a - 127 d in the illustration are shown in association with URLs, description of the resources 127 a - 127 d refers to the resources accessible at the URLs and not to the URLs themselves.
- the result 126 a corresponds to the resource 127 a accessible at the URL “www.example.com”.
- the server system 104 may cause a search to be performed using the modified query 125 , but need not do so.
- the modified query 125 includes the keyword limitations of the original query 120 .
- the resources 127 a - 127 d referenced by the search results 126 a - 126 d are responsive to the patterns of query terms 121 a , 121 b indicated by the original query 120 .
- some of the resources 127 a - 127 d referenced by the results 126 a - 126 d may not satisfy the omitted non-keyword limitations 122 of the original query 120 , for example, because the resources 127 a - 127 d have a document type excluded by the limitation 122 .
- the server system 104 identifies one or more characteristics of one or more of the resources 127 a - 127 d referenced by the results 126 a - 126 d . In particular, the server system 104 identifies characteristics of resources corresponding to highly-ranked results responsive to the modified query 125 .
- the server system 104 uses the resources referenced by highly-ranked results as examples of useful, high-quality resources.
- the server system 104 can extract information implicit in the ranking of the results 126 a - 126 d by inferring that characteristics of the resources corresponding to the highly-ranked results are characteristics of useful, high-quality resources.
- the highly-ranked results can be selected as, for example, the N-highest-ranking results, where N is an integer.
- the value for N can be a predetermined number.
- the highly-ranked results are selected as the top three results: results 126 a - 126 c of the results 126 a - 126 d.
- the server system 104 can identify various characteristics 130 a - 130 e of the resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c .
- the server system 104 can identify characteristics of the resources 127 a - 127 c that are related to the query terms 121 a , 121 b .
- Characteristics of a particular resource of the resources 127 a - 127 c include, for example, whether one or more of the query terms 121 a , 121 b occur in the particular resource 127 a - 127 c : (i) in a particular portion or field, e.g., the title, abstract, body, or metadata; (ii) in a particular sequence or as a phrase; (iii) at a particular distance from each other; or (iv) with a particular frequency.
- Characteristics of a particular resource of the resources 127 a - 127 c can also include whether query terms occur in one or more resources that cite to or include a link to the particular resource of the resources 127 a - 127 c , including whether query terms 121 a , 121 b occur in anchor text of a link to the particular resource of the resources 127 a - 127 c.
- the server system 104 can also identify other characteristics of the resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c including, for example, a document length, a language, a time or date of publication, a number of citations or links to the respective resources 127 a - 127 c , a link analysis score, a media type of each resource of the resources 127 a - 127 c , a classification or document type of the resources 127 a - 127 c (e.g., whether each of the resources 127 a - 127 c is a book, an article, a blog, or a web page), or a topic of the content of the resources 127 a - 127 c .
- Identified characteristics can also include the occurrence of one or more terms other than the query terms 121 a , 121 b in the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c.
- Characteristics can also include a geographical location associated with one or more of the resources 127 a - 127 c .
- a geographical location can be associated with a resource due to, for example, an occurrence of an address or other geographically identifying information in one or more of the resources 127 a - 127 c , or a top-level domain name that indicates the source of one or more of the respective resources 127 a - 127 c.
- the server system 104 can also identify common characteristics shared by resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to different highly-ranking results 126 a - 126 c . For example, the server system 104 can determine whether at least two resources of the resources 127 a - 127 c have a particular characteristic. For example, as a first common characteristic 132 a , the server system 104 determines that two resources 127 a - 127 c include the query terms 121 a , 121 b in a phrase, in other words, adjacent to each other in the sequence that the query terms.
- the server system 104 determines that all three resources 127 a - 127 c include the query terms 121 a , 121 b in a title field. As a third common characteristic 132 b , the server system 104 determines that two resources of the resources 127 a - 127 c are cited to by more than ten other resources.
- the server system 104 can also identify combinations of characteristics that occur together.
- the server system 104 can determine whether two or more of the resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c have a particular combination of identified characteristics 130 a - 130 e .
- the server system 104 can determine that for two of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c , the query terms 121 a , 121 b occur as a phrase and also occur in the title, or more particularly, they occur as a phrase in the title.
- the server system 104 compares the content of the of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c to determine commonalties.
- the server system 104 can determine that two or more of the resources 127 a - 127 c referenced by highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c include a particular image, or include particular terms other than the query terms 121 a , 121 b.
- the server system 104 identifies characteristics of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c in addition to, or instead of, identifying characteristics of the resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c .
- the server system 104 can identify common characteristics among the highly ranked results 126 a - 126 c , including common characteristics of aspects of the results 126 a - 126 c that would be visibly displayed to a user when the results 126 a - 126 c are presented on a user interface. For example, common features of the titles and text snippets of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c can be identified.
- the characteristics 130 a - 130 e and the common characteristics 132 a - 132 c can include characteristics and common characteristics of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c.
- the server system 104 During state (D), the server system 104 generates a second modified query 140 .
- the second modified query 140 includes the constraints of the original query 120 .
- the second modified query 140 includes one or more additional limitations 142 a , 142 b selected based on the identified characteristics 130 a - 130 e of the resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c to the first modified query 125 .
- the additional limitations 142 a , 142 b each represent one or more of the identified characteristics 130 a - 130 e .
- the additional limitations 142 a , 142 b can require results that are responsive to the second modified query 140 to have one or more of the identified characteristics 130 a - 130 e .
- the additional limitations 142 a , 142 b are selected to represent the common characteristics 132 a , 132 b determined to be shared by multiple of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c.
- FIG. 2 is a table 200 illustrating an example of analysis to select query limitations.
- the server system 104 can generate respective scores 202 a - 202 e for each identified characteristic 130 a - 130 e and determine whether the scores 202 a - 202 e satisfy one or more corresponding thresholds 204 a - 204 e .
- Additional limitations 142 a , 142 b for the second modified query 140 can be selected to represent one or more characteristics 130 a - 130 e having respective scores 202 a - 202 e that satisfy a corresponding threshold 204 a - 204 e .
- the thresholds 204 a - 204 e can represent a level of commonality necessary for a corresponding characteristic 130 a - 130 e to be indicative of high quality.
- the scores 202 a - 202 e for each identified characteristic 130 a - 130 e are determined based on a count of how many of the resources 127 a - 127 c corresponding to highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c have the respective characteristics 130 a - 130 e .
- a score 202 a - 202 e can be a fraction representing the count divided by the total number of highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c.
- the scores 202 a - 202 e are based on a position-weighted sum, where weighting values are determined based on the ranking of each of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c .
- Occurrence of a characteristic 130 a - 130 e in the first-ranked result 126 a can correspond to a weighting value W 1
- occurrence of a characteristic 130 a - 130 e in the second-ranked result 126 b can correspond to a weighting value of W 2
- Higher-ranked positions can have higher weighting values, resulting in higher influence in the weighted sum.
- the score 202 a - 202 e can be the sum of the weighting values for results 126 a - 126 c in which the characteristic 130 a - 130 e occurs.
- the scores are determined based on occurrence of the characteristic in the results 126 a - 126 c.
- the server system 104 determines that two of the three, or approximately 70%, of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c reference a resource 127 a - 127 c that includes the query terms 121 a , 121 b in a phrase. Based on this percentage, the server system 104 generates a score 202 a of “0.7”. Alternatively, the server system 104 can assign a score of “2” to indicate that two of the resources 127 a - 127 c have the characteristic 130 a , or can calculate a weighed sum as described above.
- the server system 104 compares the score 202 a to the corresponding threshold 204 a , determining that the score 202 a satisfies the threshold 204 a because it exceeds the threshold value of “0.6”. As a result of this determination 206 a , as discussed further below, the server system 104 may include a limitation 208 a representing the characteristic 130 a in the second modified query 140 . However, as described below, not every characteristic having a score above the corresponding threshold is necessarily represented by an additional limitation.
- the scores 202 b - 202 e for the other characteristics 130 b - 130 e can be generated and compared to corresponding thresholds 204 b - 204 e in a similar manner as described for the characteristic 130 a.
- a corresponding query limitation 208 a - 208 e can require results identified by a search engine to reference a corresponding resource having the characteristic 130 a - 130 e or a similar characteristic.
- the corresponding limitation 208 a is a phrase operator, which requires query terms within the quotation marks to occur as a phrase.
- the limitation 208 a requires query terms 121 a , 121 b to occur as a phrase.
- the limitation 208 b constrains query terms 121 a , 121 b to occur in a title field, thus requiring results to reference corresponding resources that have the characteristic 130 b.
- multiple candidate query limitations correspond to a particular characteristic 130 a - 130 e .
- the server system 104 can select a limitation to represent an identified characteristic that is most appropriate in combination with the limitations of the original query 120 .
- the query limitation representing a characteristic may be selected based on one or more limitations of the original query 120 , and in particular, may be based on one of the non-keyword limitations 122 .
- the server system 104 can select a limitation corresponding to a characteristic based on one or more properties of the first limitation 122 , which was omitted in the first modified query 125 .
- one property of a first limitation may be that the first limitation limits results to correspond to books, or to correspond to a resource of a different document type that does not include an abstract field.
- the server system 104 may identify as a common characteristic that query terms are included in the abstract of resources referenced by different highly-ranked results. A limitation that constrains query terms to occur in the abstract would, combined with the first limitation, results in an empty result set for the second modified query.
- the server system 104 can select a different limitation, such as a limitation that terms to occur in the first chapter of each responsive result or to occur in the first 25 pages of each responsive result.
- the query limitations 208 a - 208 e can be keyword or non-keyword limitations. Some query limitations 208 a - 208 e , if included in the second modified query 140 may be expressed in a keyword string 141 of the second modified query 140 . Other query limitations 208 a - 208 e may not be expressed in the keyword string 141 and may not be indicated to the user 101 at all. For example, the limitation 208 e requires a search engine to identify results corresponding to resources that are cited to by 10 or more other documents. When included in the second modified query 140 , the limitation 208 e may not be indicated to the user 101 . Similarly, the limitation 208 e may be one that is not selectable by the user 101 in composing the original query 120 .
- the server system 104 selects one or more of the limitations 208 a - 208 e to add to the second modified query 140 , based on whether the scores 202 a - 202 e for the characteristics 130 a - 130 e satisfy the corresponding thresholds 204 a - 204 e .
- the determinations 206 a - 206 e indicate that the characteristics 130 a , 130 b have scores satisfying the corresponding thresholds 204 a , 204 b .
- the limitations 208 a , 208 b representing those characteristics 130 a , 130 b are candidate limitations for addition to the query 140 .
- the number of additional limitations that are included in the query 140 is limited to a maximum number, e.g., a maximum of three additional limitations. If there are three or fewer candidate limitations, all of the candidate limitations can be included in the query 140 . In the example, both of the candidate limitations, the limitations 208 a , 208 b corresponding to the characteristics 130 a , 130 b , are selected and included in the second modified query 140 as the limitations 142 a , 142 b.
- the server system 104 selects a subset of the candidate limitations to include in the query 140 . In some implementations, the server system 104 selects limitations according to a specified order. In some implementations, the server system 104 selects the candidate limitations corresponding to the most commonly occurring of the characteristics 130 a - 130 e . For each characteristic, the server system 104 can count the resources 127 a - 127 c that have the characteristic. By comparing the counts, the server system 104 can identify the most common characteristics, and can select the limitations corresponding to the most common characteristics to add to the query 140 .
- the server system 104 generates scores based on a count of resources in which combinations of characteristics occur together, and compares the scores to thresholds. Combinations of limitations are selected when the score for the combination satisfies a threshold. For example, the limitations 142 a , 142 b can be selected when a count of the resources 127 a - 127 c including both characteristics 130 a , 130 b satisfies a threshold. Similarly, because the limitations 142 a , 142 b affect each other when combined in a query, the count can be a count of resources 127 a - 127 c in which the query terms 121 a , 121 b occur as a phrase in a title.
- the server system 104 would not add an additional limitation to the limitations of the original query 120 .
- the second modified query 140 would be identical to the original query 120 .
- the server system 104 can cause a search engine to perform a search based on the original query 120 and provide identified results in response to the original query 120 .
- the server system 104 obtains results 150 to the second modified query 140 .
- the server system 104 can cause a search engine to perform a search to identify the responsive results 150 .
- the server system 104 provides the results 150 to the second modified query 140 to the client device 102 .
- the client device 102 displays the results 150 on a user interface 160 .
- the second modified query 140 includes the limitations of the original query 120 , so the results 150 are scholarly articles, as required by the limitation 122 .
- the second modified query 140 includes the additional limitations 142 a , 142 b and is thus narrower than the original query 140 .
- the highest-ranking results 150 are likely to be more useful to the user 101 than highest-ranked results that are responsive to the original query 120 would be without the additional limitations 142 a , 142 b . Due to the imprecision of the original query 120 , results that are responsive to the original query 120 would likely include, in addition to the results 150 , many results of lower quality than the results 150 .
- results 150 to the second modified query 140 are required to reference resources having characteristics 130 a , 130 b similar to those of resources referenced by high-quality results. Results that would be responsive to the original query 120 but would not reference resources having the characteristics 130 a , 130 b are omitted. Often, the additional limitations 142 a , 142 b cause the highest-ranking of the results 150 to the second modified query 140 to be of higher quality than the highest-ranking results to the broader but imprecise original query 120 .
- the results 150 may not be effective.
- extensive historical query data may be available for searches of the web, resulting in the results 126 a - 126 d to the modified query 125 being very well-ranked.
- the characteristics 130 a , 130 b correlated with high rankings are identified and imitated in the results 150 to the second modified query 140 .
- the second modified query 140 requires the results 150 to reference resources having the characteristics 130 a , 130 b , which can improve the quality of the results 150 provided to the user 101 .
- second modified query 140 is displayed on the user interface 160 , indicating that the original query 120 was modified. In some other implementations, no indication that the original query 120 was modified is displayed. For example, when a pattern of characteristics is very strong among the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c , the server system 104 may determine that there is a high confidence level that the additional limitations 142 a , 142 c will produce results 150 that are of high quality. As another example, screen area may be limited on mobile devices. Rather than indicate modifications to the original query 120 , available area on a user interface 160 of a mobile device can be used to display results 150 or other information.
- the server system 104 does not receive any request to modify the original query 120 or receive any indication from the user 101 that the original query 120 should be modified or further limited. Rather, the server system 104 automatically modifies the original query 120 by generating the second modified query 140 .
- the results 150 which are identified by a search engine performing a search based on the second modified query 140 , are presented in place of results identified by performing a search based on the original query 120 , when only results identified using the original query 120 were requested.
- information about the context of the client device 102 is used to generate the second modified query 140 .
- the second modified query 140 can include a limitation requiring results to be associated with a geographical area near the client device 102 .
- a result is associated with a geographical area when, for example, the result references a resource that includes a name of a place or includes an address in the area.
- a result can also be associated with a geographical area when information, including map data or other information extrinsic to a referenced resource, links the referenced resource to an identified location, such as a place of business or source of the resource.
- geographical restrictions are included in a second modified query 140 when the location of the client device 102 is known, in addition to other limitations 142 a , 142 b representing identified characteristics 130 a , 130 b .
- geographical limitations may be included in the second modified query 140 to represent a characteristic of the highly-ranked results 126 a - 126 c .
- the server system 104 can determine whether a threshold number or percentage of the highly ranked results 126 a - 126 c are associated with the location of the client device 102 , and if so, constrain the geographical location of results identified based on the second modified query 140 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an example process 300 for query modification.
- An original query is received that includes a first limitation ( 302 ).
- the original query can be a query supplied by a user.
- the received query is termed original to denote the query as received, without alteration, and the term original does not indicate the content of the query.
- the first limitation can be a non-keyword limitation, for example, one that does not define the query terms or patterns of query terms to be matched in, for example, responsive documents or metadata.
- the first limitation can further constrain, for example, a time, a date, a media type, a document type, a language, an author, a publisher, a number of links or citations, or a geographical region of resources corresponding to results responsive to the original query.
- the first limitation can restrict the value of a field associated with a resource that indicates, for example, a document collection or document type of a resource.
- the first limitation can require a search engine performing a search based on the original query to identify results that each reference a corresponding resource of a particular document type or a resource from a particular document collection.
- the first limitation is a limitation determined from context for a keyword string of the original query, and thus the first limitation is not expressed in a keyword string of the original query.
- First search results responsive to a modified query are obtained ( 304 ).
- the modified query omits the first limitation of the original query. For example, when the first limitation constrains a query to a range of publication dates, the modified query may instead constrain the query to a broader range of publication dates, or not restrict the publication date altogether.
- the modified query may omit the first limitation and replace it with a limitation of different scope. Still, the modified query is broader in at least one aspect, encompassing one or more potential results that would not be responsive to the original query. For example, when the first limitation requires results to reference resources that are books, the modified query may instead require results to reference resources that are either books or articles, or may require results reference resources that are web pages.
- Responsive results can thus include documents that include the patterns of query terms specified in the original query, but otherwise would not be responsive to the original query, for example, because a document type or time range restriction of the first limitation would exclude the documents.
- One or more common characteristics shared by two or more resources are identified ( 306 ). Each of the two or more resources corresponds to a different highly-ranked result of the first search results. In addition to or as an alternative to identifying common characteristics of resources corresponding to the highly-ranked results, one or more common characteristics shared by two or more of the highly-ranked results can be identified.
- Characteristics of one of the highly-ranked results can indicate, for example, the content of the result, the source of the result, a classification of the result, and other information, as described above.
- Characteristics of a resource can include not only features of the resource, but also aspects of the context in which a resource is accessible or in which the resource was created. For example, characteristics can include a publisher of a resource, a particular internet domain in which the resource is hosted, and a time or date that the resource was published. Characteristics can indicate other information related to a resource, such as a number of other resources that cite to the resource, and the popularity of the resource.
- Common characteristics shared by resources referenced by different highly-ranked results can be identified. For example, for each of the highly-ranked results, characteristics of a referenced resource can be identified, and the identified characteristics can be compared to identify commonalties among the identified characteristics. Additionally, or alternatively, the resources referenced by the highly-ranked results can be compared to each other without regard to previously identified characteristics.
- a second modified query is generated ( 308 ).
- the second modified query includes the original query and a second limitation representing the one or more common characteristics.
- a second modified query includes the original query by including each of the limitations of the original query.
- the second limitation can require results identified in a search based on the second modified query to have the one or more common characteristics or similar characteristics. For example, if multiple highly-ranked results each reference a resource that is determined to be cited to by three or more documents, then the second limitation can constrain the modified query such that results identified are to be cited to by three or more documents.
- the second limitation can be a limitation that is not expressed in a keyword string for the second modified query.
- the second modified query can include multiple limitations representing different identified characteristics.
- the second limitation can represent one or more identified characteristics
- the second modified query can also include a third limitation representing different identified characteristics.
- generating a second modified query includes selecting the second limitation based on a property or effect of the first limitation.
- the second modified query can be automatically generated, without receiving a request to add the second limitation.
- the second limitation can be added without an indication from a user that the original query should be modified.
- Generating the second modified query can include generating scores for each of the one or more identified characteristics.
- the score for each characteristic can be based on a count of how many of the highly-ranked results reference a resource that has the characteristic. For each characteristic, it can be determined whether the score satisfies a corresponding threshold. If so, a limitation representing the characteristic can be included in the second modified query.
- the limitation representing the characteristic can constrain a search engine to identify results that have the represented characteristic or a similar characteristic.
- Generating a second modified query can include generating a second modified query including the original query, a second limitation representing the one or more common characteristics shared by the two or more resources, and a third limitation representing the one or more common characteristics shared by the two or more highly ranked results.
- Second search results responsive to the second modified query are obtained ( 310 ).
- a search engine can perform a search to identify results that reference documents that satisfy the limitations of the second modified query.
- the second search results are provided in a response to the original query ( 312 ).
- the second search results can be provided rather than providing results that would be retrieved by evaluating the original query.
- the second modified query can be provided as a suggested query modification for the original query.
- One or more of obtaining first search results responsive to the modified query ( 304 ), identifying characteristics of highly-ranked first search results ( 306 ), generating a second modified query ( 308 ), obtaining second search results responsive to the modified query ( 310 ), and providing the second search results ( 312 ) can be performed in response to receiving the original query ( 302 ).
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of another example system 400 that can perform query modification.
- the system 400 is illustrated performing query modification when a user causes a search to be performed with narrowed query after results to a broader, initial query have been provided.

- the diagram shows states (A) to (H), which may occur in the sequence illustrated or in a different sequence.
- States (B) to (G) illustrate a flow of data, and states (A) and (H) illustrate user interfaces 450 a , 450 b.
- the user interface 450 a of the client device 402 displays search results 426 a - 426 d responsive to an original query 420 .
- Each search result 426 a - 426 d represents a corresponding resource 427 a - 427 d .
- the original query 420 can be a query previously submitted by a user 401 of the client device 402 .
- the search results 426 a - 426 c can be results provided by the server system 404 in response to receiving the original query 420 .
- the original query 420 includes one or more query terms 421 a , 421 b and includes a non-keyword limitation 422 specifying that search results 426 a - 426 c must reference resources from the web.
- the user 401 causes a search to be performed for the original query 420 with one or more additional limitations 424 , which can be non-keyword limitations.
- the additional limitations 424 can further constrain a query component that restricts a date, a document type, or a document collection.
- the user 401 selects a control 423 that limits a date of publication, narrowing the original query 420 so that results identified for the narrowed query reference corresponding resources published to the web in the previous seven days.
- the server system 404 receives a request 425 from the client device 402 to perform a search using the original query 420 and the additional limitation 424 .
- the request 425 can be a query including all of the limitations of the original query 420 and the additional limitation 424 .
- search results identified by a search engine performing a search based on the request 425 are a subset of the results 426 a - 426 d responsive to the original query 420 .
- the server system 404 selects highly-ranked results from the results 426 a - 426 d to the original query 420 , in the same manner described above.
- the server system 404 identifies one or more characteristics of the resources 427 a - 427 d corresponding to the highly-ranked results.
- the server system 404 can additionally or alternatively identify characteristics of the highly-ranked results.
- the server system 404 can identify common characteristics shared by multiple resources corresponding to the highly-ranked results, or shared by multiple highly-ranked results in the same manner described above.
- the server system 404 During state (E), the server system 404 generates a modified query 440 .
- the modified query 440 includes the limitations of the query specified by the request 425 and also adds one or more additional limitations 442 a , 442 b representing one or more characteristics 430 a , 430 b of the highly-ranked results 426 a - 426 c .
- the additional limitations 442 a , 442 b can be selected to represent common characteristics 432 a - 432 c shared by multiple highly-ranked results 426 a - 426 c.
- the server system 404 can generate scores for the characteristics 430 a - 430 c and compare the scores to corresponding thresholds.
- the server system 404 can select the one or more additional limitations 442 a , 442 b from query limitations representing the characteristics 430 a - 430 c having scores that satisfy corresponding thresholds.
- the server system 404 obtains results 450 responsive to the modified query 440 .
- the server system 404 provides the results 450 to the client device 402 in a response to the request 425 .
- the results 450 are presented on the user interface 460 b of the client device 402 . Because the additional limitations 442 a , 442 b require the characteristics of the highly-ranked results 426 a - 426 c or similar characteristics to be present in all of the results 450 , the results 450 indicated on the user interface 460 b are similar to the results 426 a - 426 d previously indicated on the user interface 460 a .
- the results 450 are constrained to reference resources having similar characteristics to, or the same characteristics as, resources referenced by highly-ranked results responsive to the broader original query 420 .
- FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate example user interfaces 500 , 550 for query modification.
- the user interface 500 displays a search engine results page indicating results 510 responsive to a query 502 .
- the user interface 500 also includes a control 515 permitting a user to create an alert based on the current query 502 .
- a user can select the control 515 to request that a search be periodically performed using the query 502 , so that new results since the previous search are transmitted to the user.
- the alert may be a request to provide newly identified results responsive to the query 502 that have been published or added to a document collection in the previous week.
- an alert may specify that results responsive to the query 502 within the current year that were not previously identified should be provided as soon as the new results are identified.
- Selection of the control 515 can submit the request for the alert to a server system that, in response, provides information indicated on the user interface 550 .
- the request for an alert based on the original query 502 indicates that the user desires additional results similar to the results 510 .
- the results provided for the alerts should have similar characteristics to the highly-ranked results of the results 510 .
- the server system receiving the request can automatically modify the user's query 502 , without receiving a request to modify the query or an indication that the user desires the query to be modified.
- the server system can generate a modified query 552 that includes limitations representing characteristics of the results 510 to the user's query 502 .
- the modified query 552 can be indicated in the user interface 550 .
- the modified query 552 is a suggested query that improves the precision of the user's original query 502 using the results 510 .
- the user interface 550 indicates sample results 560 to the modified query 552 , demonstrating the types of results the user can expect to receive from alert messages. For example, when a weekly alert is requested, the results 560 can be results from the previous week.
- the user has the opportunity to review the results 560 , and if the results are acceptable, the user can select a control 570 to confirm the alert. If the results 560 are not acceptable, the user may edit the modified query 552 in a text field 572 before causing the alert to be set by selecting the control 570 .
- FIG. 6 is flow chart illustrating another example process 600 for query modification.
- a request to provide results responsive to a narrowed query including the original query and an additional first limitation is received ( 602 ).
- the original query and the first limitation can have features as described above with respect to the process 300 .
- One or more characteristics of one or more highly-ranked results of the first search results or of one or more resources corresponding to the one or more highly-ranked results are identified ( 604 ).
- the highly-ranked results can be selected as described above, and the characteristics can be identified as described above.
- a modified query is generated ( 606 ).
- the modified query includes the limitations of the original query, the first limitation, and a second limitation representing the one or more characteristics identified.
- the second limitation can require results responsive to the second modified query to have the one or more identified characteristics or similar characteristics.
- the modified query can include multiple limitations representing different identified characteristics.
- the second limitation can represent one or more identified characteristics
- the modified query can also include a third limitation representing one or more different identified characteristics. Generating the modified query can include other features as described above for generating the second modified query in the process 300 .
- Second search results responsive to the modified query are obtained ( 608 ).
- a search engine can perform a search to identify results that reference resources that satisfy the limitations of the modified query.
- the second search results are provided in a response to the request ( 610 ).
- the second search results can be provided instead of results that would be retrieved by performing a search based on the original query and the limitation in the request.
- One or more of identifying characteristics of highly-ranked results ( 604 ), generating a modified query ( 606 ), obtaining second search results responsive to the modified query ( 608 ), and providing the second search results ( 610 ) can be performed without the received request, or any other request, indicating that the second limitation should be added to the original query and the first limitation.
- the second limitation can be added automatically without receiving a request to add the second limitation.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram of another example system 700 that can perform query modification.
- the system 700 is illustrated as providing query suggestions in a response to a user's initial query.
- the system 700 includes a client device 702 , a server system 704 , and a network 706 .
- the diagram shows states (A) to (G), which may occur in the sequence illustrated or in a different sequence.
- States (B) to (F) illustrate a flow of data
- states (A) and (G) illustrate user interfaces 750 a , 750 b.
- a user 701 initiates a search that includes a keyword string 719 , for example, by selecting a search control 715 on the user interface 750 a .
- the client device 102 transmits a query 720 including the keyword string 719 and a non-keyword limitation to the server system 704 .
- the server system 704 obtains search results 726 identified by a search engine in response to the query 720 .
- the server system 704 identifies characteristics of resources corresponding to highly-ranked results of the search results 726 , including common characteristics of the resources. Additionally, or alternatively, the server system 704 identifies characteristics of the highly-ranked results, including common characteristics of the highly-ranked results. As described above with respect to FIG. 2 , the server system 704 can generate scores for identified common characteristics and determine whether the scores satisfy one or more thresholds.
- each suggested query 730 a , 730 b includes an additional first limitation 731 a , 731 b that is a non-keyword limitation.
- the respective first limitations 731 a , 731 b may represent an identified common characteristic, but need do so.
- the addition of each first limitation 731 a , 731 b limits results responsive to the suggested query 730 a , 730 b to be a subset of the results 726 that are responsive to the original query 720 .
- Each suggested query 730 a , 730 b can include an additional second limitation 732 a , 732 b representing one or more identified common characteristics that have scores satisfying a threshold. If no common characteristic has a score that satisfies a threshold, then no second limitation based on common characteristics is included in the suggested queries.
- the respective second limitations 732 a , 732 b can be a keyword or non-keyword limitation. In some implementations, each second limitation 732 a , 732 b is selected based on a property of the first limitation 731 a , 731 b , and thus the second limitations 732 a , 732 b can be different for different queries 730 a , 730 b.
- the server system 704 generates at least one suggested query 730 a in response to each query received.
- the suggested query 730 a can include a particular first limitation 731 a , regardless of the content of the query 720 and the results 726 to the received query 720 .
- the server system 704 generates a suggested query 730 a that includes a limitation 731 a restricting a publication date to be within the current year.
- the server system 704 can generate one or more other suggested queries that have a first limitation that represents one of the common characteristics.
- suggested queries can be provided when a common characteristic is a document type or a document collection.
- the server system 704 determines as a common characteristic that multiple results 726 correspond to resources identified as “news” resources.
- the server system 704 counts the results corresponding to resources that are marked as “news” resources and determines that the count satisfies a threshold.
- the server system 704 generates a suggested query 730 b that includes a first limitation restricting a document type to “news” resources.
- the server system 704 generates one or more suggested queries based on identified combinations of common characteristics that occur together.
- a suggested query including limitations representing a combination of common characteristics can be generated when a count of the highly-ranked results or corresponding resources having the combination of characteristics satisfies a threshold, and at least one of the limitations corresponding to one of the common characteristics is a non-keyword limitation.
- the server system 704 can count the number of results 726 in which the keyword terms “nuclear” and “proliferation” occur as a phrase in a title and correspond to resources identified as “news” resources.

- a first limitation not included in the original query is selected ( 808 ).
- the first limitation can be a non-keyword limitation, and can be a limitation that is not expressed in a keyword string of the suggested query.
- the first limitation can require a search engine performing a search based on the original query to identify results that each reference a corresponding resource of a particular document type or a resource from a particular document collection.
- the first limitation can constrain a time, a date, a document type, a media type, a language, an author, a publisher, a number of links or citations, or a geographical region of resources corresponding to results responsive to the original query.
- a suggested query comprising the original query, the first limitation, and a second limitation representing the one or more common characteristics is generated ( 810 ).
- the second limitation can require results to the suggested query to each reference a corresponding resource having the one or more common characteristics.
- Scores can be generated for each of the one or more common characteristics based on a count of results of the plurality of highly-ranked results that reference a corresponding resource having the one or more common characteristics. It can be determined that one or more of the scores satisfy a threshold.
- the second limitation can represent a characteristic of the one or more common characteristics that has a score that satisfies the threshold.
- the first limitation can be selected to represent a characteristic of the one or more common characteristics that has a score that satisfies the threshold.
- the one or more common characteristics can include a first common characteristic, and a second common characteristic. Selecting a first limitation can include selecting a first limitation that represents the first common characteristic. The second limitation can represent the second common characteristic.
- a score can be generated based on a count of the two or more resources have the first common characteristic and the second characteristic. It can be determined that the score satisfies a threshold. Selecting a first limitation that represents the first common characteristic can occur in response to determining that the score satisfies the threshold.
- the search results and information indicating the suggested query are provided in a response to the original query ( 812 ).
- the process 800 can also include additional features described with respect to the processes 300 , 600 and the systems 100 , 400 , 700 described above.
