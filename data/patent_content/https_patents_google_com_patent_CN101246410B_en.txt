Fig. 3 to Fig. 6 illustrates the schematic diagram of the example of character selected by editor's lexicon word 300.Editing system 200 can edit the one or more characters in lexicon word 300.As shown in Figure 3, cursor 302 can select the character 304 in lexicon word 300.In the example drawn, context or linguistic context window 306 are defined by centered by selected character 304.In some embodiments, treatment facility 102 can identification character 308 and 310 as adjacent character.Based on adjacent character 308 and 310 and combinatorial input, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can identify the candidate characters of selected character 304.
As shown in Figure 4, context after adjustment in use or linguistic context window 402 adjacent character can be identified.In this example, context or linguistic context window 402 than context or linguistic context window 306 large.In some embodiments, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can determine whether the candidate characters quantity produced by context or linguistic context window 306 is greater than Maximum alternative character quantity.If the candidate characters quantity produced by context or linguistic context window 306 is greater than Maximum alternative character quantity, then treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 dynamically can regulate the size of context or linguistic context window 306, produce context or linguistic context window 402.Based on context or linguistic context window 402, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 such as can identify extra adjacent character 404 and 406.Use adjacent character 308,310,404 and 406, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can identify one group of new candidate characters and/or extra candidate characters.In some embodiments, larger context or linguistic context window can reduce candidate characters quantity.
In some embodiments, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can determine whether there is punctuate in context or linguistic context window 402.In this example, context or linguistic context window 402 comprise punctuate 408 (such as, comma).It is consistent with punctuate 408 that then treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can regulate the edge of context or linguistic context window 402.Context after regulating shown in Fig. 5 or the example of linguistic context window 502.Regulate the edge of context or linguistic context window 502 consistent with punctuate 408.Therefore, character 406 is removed by from adjacent character, and character 504 is added to one of adjacent character.Also the punctuate of other type can be used to regulate context or linguistic context window, such as, fullstop, colon, clause etc.
In some embodiments, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 based on the candidate characters quantity produced, can regulate the size of context or linguistic context window further.Such as, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can determine whether the candidate characters quantity produced by context or linguistic context window 502 is less than minimum candidate characters quantity.If the candidate characters quantity produced by context or linguistic context window 502 is less than minimum candidate characters quantity, then treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 can reduce the size of context or linguistic context window 502.As shown in Figure 6, treatment facility 102 and/or input engine 204 produce context or the linguistic context window 602 with four character boundaries, between this size (three characters) between context or linguistic context window 306 and size (five characters) of context or linguistic context window 502.
In some embodiments, lexicon editing system 200 can also identify candidate characters based on the cursor position in editing equipment 202.Fig. 7 is depicted in the display example 702 and 722 in lexicon editing environment 700.
In the first example 702, cursor 704 between the first and second characters of phrase 706, and identifies adjacent character 708.Combinatorial input 710, such as, " sh ", is received and is provided to input engine 204.Input engine 204 identifies the list being applicable to the candidate characters 712 inserted on the position of cursor 704.Such as, two adjacent with the cursor 704 in phrase 706 adjacent characters 708 are identified as the adjacent character of cursor 704.Based on combinatorial input 710 and two adjacent characters 708, identify sets of candidate characters 712.User can select a candidate characters on the position being inserted in cursor 704.
In the second example 722, cursor 724 between the first and second characters of phrase 726, and identifies adjacent character 728.Combinatorial input 730, such as, " sh ", is received and is provided to input engine 204.Input engine 204 identifies the list being applicable to the candidate characters 732 be inserted on the position of cursor 724.Such as, two adjacent with the cursor 724 in phrase 706 adjacent characters 728 are identified as adjacent character.Based on combinatorial input 730 and two adjacent characters 728, identify sets of candidate characters 732.User can select a candidate characters on the position being inserted in cursor 724.
As shown in these two examples, input engine 204 identifies different sets of candidate characters 712 and 732 for identical combinatorial input " sh ".The context that adjacent character 708 provides or language ambience information make input engine 204 identify the first sets of candidate characters 712, and the context that adjacent character 728 provides or language ambience information make input engine 204 identify the second sets of candidate characters 732.
In one embodiment, adjacent character (such as character 708) can show side by side with one or more candidate characters (such as character 712).Therefore this realization provides the mark of context or language ambience information to user.
In a further implementation, the selection of character selects the character adjacent with selected character as adjacent character using making input engine 204.Such as, in the first example 702, if having selected character " in ", then character " survey " and " literary composition " can be identified as adjacent character.Therefore input engine 204 can revise selected character based on combinatorial input and the adjacent character identified.
