Definitions
- the present invention relates to web browser improvements, specifically regarding improvements to navigating a webpage.
- Electronic devices such as personal computers, smart phones, and tablets have become popular and ubiquitous. Manufacturers of such devices are adding more and more features to these devices, and they are often equipped with powerful processors, significant memory, and open operating systems, which allow many developers to add different applications.
- Popular applications provide functions such as calling, emailing, texting, image acquisition, image display, music and video playback, location determination (e.g., GPS), and internet browsing functions, among others.
- location determination e.g., GPS
- internet browsing functions among others.
- Such devices often include various user input and output components for instructing operation of the devices and for perceiving information from the devices, respectively.
- touch detecting surfaces such as touch screens or touch pads
- many mobile devices are equipped not only with various buttons and/or keypads, but also with touch detecting surfaces (such as touch screens or touch pads) by which a user, simply by touching a particular area of the mobile device and/or by moving a fmger along the surface of the mobile device, is able to communicate instructions to control the electronic device.
- touch detecting surfaces can output visual content with great detail and precision.
- FIGS. 1 -3 illustrate screenshots of an example search results page, an example target webpage, and an example resized portion of the example target webpage, in that order, with respect to one or more example methods described herein.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example network including one or more electronic devices, with respect to one or more example methods described herein.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of example components common to one or more of the electronic devices of FIG. 4.
- FIGS. 6-15 illustrate example methods performed by any one or more of the electronic devices of FIG. 4.
- the methods in at least some embodiments take advantage of preexisting technologies such as wired and wireless communication technologies, search engines (including well known Internet search engines), web browser and operating system functions, and computer programs described herein.
- the combination of these technologies results in an electronic device capable of receiving webpage data from a web server and then in-turn determining whether the immediately preceding webpage was a search results page.
- the combination of the technologies facilitates searching the webpage data for instances of parts of a search string in the contents of the webpage, and then upon finding parts of the search string, resizing a portion of the webpage containing the parts before displaying the webpage.
- the technologies first facilitate an electronic device receiving target webpage data from a web server.
- the technologies facilitate a controller (e.g., a processor) of the electronic device determining whether the immediately preceding webpage was a search results page.
- a webpage contents searching program searches the target webpage data for instances of parts of a search string (which was the search string that caused the search results of the search results page) in the contents of the target webpage.
- the controller upon finding parts of the search string in the target webpage data, the controller causes resizing and displaying of a portion of the target webpage containing the parts of the search string.
- FIGS. 1-3 depict an example search results page 100, an example target webpage 200 that has a uniform resource locator (URL) 102 that locates the target webpage 200, and an example resized portion 300 of the target webpage 200, respectively (all of which are displayed by a web browser).
- the search results page 100 displays selectable (e.g., clickable) search results 104 of a search for content in the World Wide Web having text "Motorola Mobility," which is an example text string 106 (labeled as text string 202 in FIG. 2).
- a user can click on one of the results (e.g., a result 108) which causes the browser to display a resized portion 300 of the target webpage 200 rather than the target webpage 200 without resizing.
- text of the target webpage 200 is difficult to read due to the size of the text.
- This issue is resolved in at least some of the embodiments by resizing a portion 204 of the webpage 200 containing instances of at least part of the text string 106 (labeled as instances 206 and 208, respectively, in FIG. 2), and resizing and rewrapping the text of that portion 204 as illustrated by FIG. 3.
- the instances 206 and 208 are represented by instances 302 and 304, respectively.
- the technologies prior to resizing the portion of the webpage containing the parts of the search string, can facilitate prioritizing instances of the parts of the search string, and then in-turn resize the portion of the webpage containing one or more of the instances with the highest priority.
- parts of the webpage are ranked with respect to the prioritized instances, and then in-turn the technologies make possible resizing the part of the webpage having the highest rank.
- the controller facilitates the user to jump from one instance of the search term to another (initially within the same part of the webpage and later to other parts of the webpage in order of decreasing rank).

Details regarding prioritizing instances of the parts of the search string will be described later with references to FIG. 15.
- the processor 504 resizes one or more parts of the target webpage having the one or more instances with the highest priority.
- the processor instructs rendering of the resized parts of the target webpage on a display. Others parts of the webpage (possibly not-resized) many also be rendered.

- the processor 504 performs resizing of the one of the parts of the target webpage having the highest rank.
- the processor instructs rendering of the resized parts of the target webpage on a display. Others parts of the webpage (possibly not-resized) many also be rendered.
- FIGS. 7-9 depict flowcharts 700, 800, and 900, which all include the determining of whether the URL of the target webpage was selected from a search results page at steps 706, 806, and 906, respectively.
- searching of the target webpage data for one or more instances of one or more parts of a search string and then resizing of a part of the target webpage having the one or more instances can occur without such a determination.
- FIGS. 10-12 depict steps similar to the steps of FIGS. 7-9 illustrating three possible alternatives of the particular action of the step 650.
- steps 1051-1059, 1 151-1 158, and 1251-1259 are similar to the steps 751 -759, 851-859, and 951 -959, respectively, except the steps 1051- 1059, 1 151- 1 159, and 1251 -1259 do not require steps 602-608 (or steps similar to steps 602-608) to precede them.
- FIG. 13 depicted is a flowchart 1300, which for example, can follow any of the flowcharts 800, 900, 1 100, or 1200, or any other embodiment that includes prioritizing of the one or more instances of the one or more parts of a search string, or ranking 956, 1256, based on the prioritizing of the one or more instances, the parts of a target webpage data.
- the flowchart 1300 includes a step 1302 representative of performing any of the flowcharts 800, 900, 1 100, or 1200, then, at a step 1304, for example (where the flowcharts 800 or 1 100 were performed), the one or more input components 510 facilitate receiving of input to resize an other part of the target webpage data having one or more instances having a priority other than the highest priority (such as the next highest priority), and then the processor 504 performs resizing of the other part of the target webpage.
- a user can press or select a key or virtual button (e.g. , tab key or virtual "next" key, respectively), which refocuses the browser (or moves the cursor of the browser) to another instance (e.g. the next instance) of the search string, which may be the next lower priority instance or the next higher priority instance (e.g. , as a result of the user pressing shift and tab keys simultaneously or a virtual "previous" key).
- a key or virtual button e.g. , tab key or
- the one or more input components 510 facilitate receiving of input to resize another part of the target webpage not having the highest rank, and then the processor 504 performs resizing of the other part of the target webpage.
- the electronic device can receive input from the user to jump to the next instance of the one or more parts of the search string and/or to the previous instance of the one or more parts of the search string; and in some other embodiments, the device can receive input to jump to the next highest ranked part of the webpage and/or the previous ranked part of the webpage.
- the flowchart 1300 represents steps equivalent to the steps 858 or 1 158 or the steps 957 or 1257, except resizing occurs at portions of the webpage that do not have instances with the highest priority or resizing occurs at parts of the webpage that does not have the highest rank, respectively.
- the process instructs rendering of the resized part of the target webpage.
- such resizing can occur by rewrapping the one or more parts of the target webpage and/or by storing a content resizing coefficient to the processor readable storage medium where the resizing of the one or more parts of the target webpage is derived from the content resizing coefficient.
- the resizing coefficient for a mobile phone or a tablet will be different, and the resizing coefficient for software that assists the visually impaired will have a different resizing coefficient as well.
- the processor 504 performs resizing through a sub-routine 1400 (which can be a sub-routine of the steps 752, 858, 957, 1057, 1 158, 1257 of FIGS. 7-12, respectively) that includes the following steps.
- a sub-routine 1400 which can be a sub-routine of the steps 752, 858, 957, 1057, 1 158, 1257 of FIGS. 7-12, respectively.
- the sub-routine 1400 begins by determining whether the web browser can rewrap the part of the target webpage with the highest priority instances of the search string or the highest priority rank at a step 1402, and if it can, then it rewraps the part of the webpage to fit the viewable area of a graphical user interface (GUI) component (displayed for example by a display of any one of the electronic devices 410- 414) displaying the webpage 1404 and it resizes the font to a comfortable reading size (which can be based on user settings of the browser application rendering the target webpage) 1406.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the sub-routine determines whether the part can fit in the viewable area of the GUI component at a larger font size 1408, and if it can, it resizes the font to the larger font size (which can be based on user settings of the browser application rendering the target webpage) 1412; otherwise, it resizes the font to a smaller (or default) font size (which can also be based on user settings of the browser application rendering the target webpage) 1410.
- Such techniques for the resizing of the one or more parts of the target webpage facilitate focusing in on content of interest that a user has specified in the search string that was executed by the previously mentioned search engine that generated the search results page.
- sub-routine 1500 of FIG. 15 which could be a sub-routine of the steps 852, 952, 1 152, and 1252 of FIGS. 8, 9, 1 1 , and 12, respectively.
- the location of the instance can influence its priority, such as whether the instance is in a section heading or the body of a section 1501 (e.g., which can be determined by examining the HTML coding of the target webpage data), and/or whether the instance is near the center of the webpage or on the periphery
- the formatting of the instance can influence its priority, such as the font size
- the percentage of the search string the instance contains 1505 can influence its priority. For example, in some embodiments, an instance that contains the entire search string is going to have a greater priority than an instance that only contains one word of the search string.
- the amount of the search string found in an instance 1505 is the most important factor governing priority. In some other embodiments, the most important factor is the location of the instance and/or the formatting of the instance. Additionally, in one embodiment, the primary factor is whether the instance is in a section heading 1501 , then whether its font is bold 1504, then whether it is near the center of the webpage or its periphery 1502, then whether its section is larger than other sections 1506, and then finally the percentage of the search string in the instance 1505.
- the primary factor is whether the instance is near the center of the webpage or its periphery 1502, then the percentage of the search string in the instance 1505, then whether its section is larger than other sections 1506, then whether it is in a section heading 1501 , and then finally whether its font is bold 1504.
- each of these methods facilitates navigation of content searchable on the Internet. Particularly these methods facilitate focusing in on desired content of a webpage, where in focusing in on such content may be difficult due to size of a respective display screen, complexity of webpage navigation inputs such as common navigational gestures of touch screens, and/or impairments of a user such as visual or mechanical impairments.
