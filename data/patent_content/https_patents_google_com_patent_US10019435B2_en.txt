Definitions
- Computing devices may provide a graphical keyboard as part of a graphical user interface for composing text using a presence-sensitive screen.
- the graphical keyboard may enable a user of the computing device to enter text (e.g., an e-mail, a text message, or a document).
- a computing device may present a graphical, or virtual, keyboard at the presence-sensitive display that permits the user to enter data by tapping virtual keys on the graphical keyboard display.
- An example method includes outputting, for display at a presence-sensitive device operatively coupled to a computing device and at a keyboard area of a graphical user interface (GUI), a virtual keyboard including a plurality of keys, and receiving, by the computing device, an indication of an input entered at the presence-sensitive device, the input indicating a plurality of characters and determining, by the computing device, a sequence of at least three character strings included in the plurality of characters, such that the sequence of at least three character strings does not include any space characters.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the method further includes modifying, by the computing device, the plurality of characters by inserting at least two space characters within the plurality of characters to demarcate the at least three character strings from one another, and determining, by the computing device, at least two suggested character strings based at least in part on a first character string, a second character string and a third character string of the sequence of at least three character strings.
- the method further includes outputting, for display at the presence-sensitive device and at a text-suggestion area of a GUI, the at least two suggested character strings, receiving a selection that indicates a selected character string of the at least two suggested character strings, and outputting, for display at the presence-sensitive device and at a text-entry area of the GUI, the selected character string.
- the processor(s) are further configured to modify the plurality of characters by inserting at least two space characters within the plurality of characters to demarcate the at least three character strings from one another, and to determine at least two suggested character strings based at least in part on a first character string, a second character string and a third character string of the sequence of at least three character strings.
- the one or more processors are further configured to output, for display at the presence-sensitive device and at a text-suggestion area of the GUI, the at least two suggested character strings, receive a selection that indicates a selected character string of the at least two suggested character strings, and output, for display at the presence-sensitive device and at a text-entry area of the GUI, the selected character string.
- a computer-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions.
- the instructions when executed, cause a processor of a computing device to perform operations.
- the operations include outputting, for display at a presence-sensitive device operatively coupled to the computing device and at a keyboard area of a graphical user interface (GUI), a virtual keyboard including a plurality of keys, receiving, by the computing device, an indication of an input entered at the presence-sensitive device, the input indicating a plurality of characters and determining, by the computing device, at least three character strings included in the plurality of characters, such that the sequence of at least three character strings does not include any space characters.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the operations further include modifying, by the computing device, the plurality of characters by inserting at least two space characters within the plurality of characters to demarcate the at least three character strings from one another, and determining, by the computing device, at least two suggested character strings based at least in part on a first character string, a second character string and a third character string of the sequence of at least three character strings.

- FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system comprising a computing device that may be configured or otherwise operable to implement one or more techniques of this disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating details of an example computing device that may be configured or otherwise operable to perform one or more techniques of this disclosure.
- FIGS. 3A & 3B are conceptual diagrams illustrating example user interfaces (UIs) that show the implementation of one or more multiple space prediction techniques of this disclosure.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example process by which a computing device may implement one or more techniques of this disclosure.
- a computing device equipped with a touchscreen may be configured to present virtual keyboards (e.g., keyboards providing a “QWERTY” layout) via the touchscreen.
- the computing device may receive text input from users via the touchscreen. For example, a user may input a particular character by tapping (e.g., with a finger or stylus) an area of the touchscreen at which the character's corresponding virtual key is displayed. In some instances, the user may perform a swipe gesture at the touchscreen to move from one virtual key to another, thereby inputting text at a faster pace.
- a virtual keyboard may limit a user's ability to utilize more than one finger to input text.
- a user may commonly hold a smartphone with a non-dominant hand, and use a single finger (e.g., the index finger) of a dominant hand to input text through a virtual keyboard displayed at a touchscreen.
- a user may be able to utilize up to all ten fingers while providing text input through a traditional keyboard, as may be coupled to a desktop or laptop computer.
- techniques of the present disclosure are directed towards mitigating the time to enter multiple spaces when receiving input through a user interface device, such as a presence-sensitive screen.
- the techniques may enable a computing device to accept multi-character text input and automatically add space characters in order to demarcate various character strings, such as words, from one another.
- a computing device implementing these techniques may receive a multi-character text input and modify the text input by inserting two or more space characters within the text, thereby demarcating three or more words in the text input.
- the computing device may, in some implementations, automatically modify one or more characters in the text input to perform spelling correction.
- a computing device implementing the techniques may enable a user to enter text at a faster rate via a touchscreen-based virtual keyboard. More specifically, by inserting multiple space characters into the text input, the computing device may potentially reduce constraints that interrupt a user's text input actions and that may require the user to input space characters at regular intervals. In some instances, the techniques may eliminate the need for a user to utilize a virtual spacebar, thereby enabling a user to continuously input text at a fast rate. Additionally, in implementations where the computing device performs spelling correction, the techniques may reduce constraints on a user that require unduly precise tapping/swiping, which may be difficult owing to the small size of virtual keys in comparison to the size of most users' fingertips.
- FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system comprising computing device 2 that may be configured or otherwise operable to implement one or more techniques of this disclosure.
- Computing device 2 may include or be part of one or more of a variety of types of devices including mobile phones (such as “smartphones”), personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet computers, convertible laptop/tablet computers, watches, and various other devices or mobile computing devices.

As described, the input may be entered at presence-sensitive device 4 . More specifically, UI module 6 may enable computing device 2 to detect user gestures, such as taps, swipes, and the like at various areas of presence-sensitive device 4 . For example, UI module 6 may detect a gesture, such as a tap, in an area of presence-sensitive device 4 that is associated with virtual keyboard 24 . Based on a general location of the detected tap gesture, UI module 6 may detect the indicated textual data.
- textual data e.g., individual characters, character strings
- UI module 6 may recognize an input of textual data corresponding to the character ‘A.’ Similarly, UI module 6 may detect a swipe gesture at presence-sensitive device 4 that corresponds to a movement between various characters represented within virtual keyboard 24 . Based on characters indicated in the swipe gesture, as well as lexicon entries available to computing device 2 , UI module 6 may recognize a character string (e.g., a word, numerical sequence) in the indicated textual data.
- a character string e.g., a word, numerical sequence
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may enable a user to enter a character set without entering a space character (e.g., through tapping of spacebar 26 , lifting a finger/stylus between swipes, etc.) and enter multiple space characters in the character set based on various criteria and/or string detection techniques.

- multiple-space prediction module 8 and spelling correction module 10 may generate suggested text entries in the form of text suggestions 14 A- 14 C (“text suggestions 14 ”).
- text suggestion 14 A may include a so-called “literal string” of characters extracted from character set 22 .
- the literal string of text suggestion 14 A may include a sequence of characters extracted from character set 22 , with no further modification implemented by either multiple-space prediction module 8 or spelling correction module 10 .

- spelling correction module 10 may modify the character strings reading “thw” and “dpg” to read “the” and “dog” respectively.
- text suggestion 14 C may represent a spell-corrected version of text suggestion 14 B, which in turn may represent a space-corrected version of text suggestion 14 A.
- UI module 6 may modify text-entry area 20 such that at least a portion of character set 22 is replaced with the text (namely, “the lazy dog”) presented in text suggestion 14 C.
- computing device 2 and components thereof may implement the techniques of this disclosure to make preferred text suggestions visually distinct to a user of computing device 2 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating details of an example computing device 2 that may be configured or otherwise operable to perform one or more techniques of this disclosure.
- Computing device 2 shown in FIG. 2 is one example implementation of computing device 2 illustrated in and described with respect to FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 2 Several elements of FIG. 2 are numbered similarly to corresponding elements of FIG. 1 . Commonly numbered elements of FIGS. 1 & 2 may operate similarly. For ease of discussion, only those elements with different element numbers from FIG. 1 are described with respect to FIG. 2 . It will be appreciated that other implementations of computing device 2 shown in FIG. 1 may perform one or more techniques of this disclosure, and that different implementations may be used in various instances.
- Processors 40 are configured to implement functionality and/or process instructions for execution within computing device 2 .
- processors 40 may be capable of processing instructions stored in storage devices 48 .

- a presence-sensitive display includes a touch-sensitive screen.
- Computing device 2 may include operating system 54 .
- Operating system 54 controls the operation of components of computing device 2 .
- operating system 54 in one example, facilitates the communication of application modules 12 with processors 40 , communication unit 44 , storage devices 48 , input device 42 , and output device 46 .
- storage devices 48 may include UI module 6 , multiple-space prediction module 8 , spelling correction module 10 , entry age module 34 , and application modules 12 , as described in FIG. 1 .
- Application modules 12 may each include program instructions and/or data that are executable by computing device 2 .
- UI module 6 may include instructions that cause computing device 2 to perform one or more of the operations and actions described in the present disclosure.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may perform various operations, such as the insertion of two or more space characters, on text inputs received via input device 42 and/or presence-sensitive device 4 .
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may insert two space characters at various points within a received text input, thus forming a sequence of three distinct character strings. More specifically, the two inserted space characters may demarcate the three character strings from one another.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 (and/or other components of computing device 2 ) may generate and cause UI module 6 to output (e.g., via display at presence-sensitive device 4 ) one or more text suggestions.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may generate a text suggestion that represents the sequence of three character strings separated by the respective inserted space characters. Such a text suggestion may be referred to herein as a “space-corrected” text suggestion.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may, in collaboration with spelling correction module 10 , generate a text suggestion that is referred to herein as a “space- and spell-corrected” text suggestion.
- spelling correction module 10 may identify one or more erroneous characters included in the original text input. Responsive to identifying the erroneous character(s), spelling correction module 10 may delete the erroneous character(s). For instance, spelling correction module 10 may detect that the text input includes multiple consecutive instances of the same character.
- spelling correction module 10 may detect that redundant instances of the character are superfluous. By deleting the superfluous character(s), spelling correction module 10 may remove erroneous instances of multiple (e.g., double, triple) consecutive characters, thereby generating a more correct representation of the original text input.
- computing device 2 may implement the functionalities of multiple-space prediction module 8 and spelling correction module 10 in any order.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may modify a text input through insertion of multiple space characters before spelling correction module 10 detects and deletes one or more erroneous characters in the text input.
- spelling correction module 10 may implement various spelling-correction techniques on the individual character strings demarcated by multiple-space prediction module 8 .
- spelling correction module 10 may implement, in addition to spelling-correction, various word-prediction techniques using language models known in the art. For instance, if spelling correction module 10 identifies multiple possible spelling suggestions for a string, spelling correction module 10 may select and/or prioritize the spelling suggestions using a language model.
- the language model may use various criteria, such as context provided by character strings that precede and/or follow the spell-corrected character string in the text input.
- spelling correction module 10 may implement one or more spelling-correction techniques on portions of the text input prior to multiple-space prediction module 8 modifying the text input.
- spelling correction module 10 may be configured or otherwise operable to detect potentially distinct character strings (e.g., through near-matches with lexicon entries) in the text input, and implement the spelling-correction techniques on the unmodified text input.
- spelling correction module 10 may detect potentially erroneous characters in the unmodified text input based on one or more criteria (e.g., detection of redundant consecutive characters that may be erroneous).
- computing device 2 may concurrently implement functionalities attributed to both multiple-space prediction module 8 and spelling correction module 10 .
- multiple-space prediction module 8 and spelling correction module 10 may concurrently perform space-insertion and spelling-correction functionalities (either independently of one another, or interdependently, as the case may be).
- computing device 2 may implement techniques of this disclosure in a variety of orders/sequences to generate and output text suggestions to a user.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may, in some instances, cause UI module 6 to output, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 , a literal string (e.g., extracted from the received text input) that does not include any space characters.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may form the literal string using the character string(s) identified in the received text input.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may concatenate two or more character strings identified from the received text input such that the concatenated result does not include any space characters.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may generate a text suggestion (or suggested character string) that is based on the literal string formed through the concatenation process.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may generate a different text suggestion by inserting at least one space character between different character strings identified in the text input. For instance, in the concatenation-based methodology described above, multiple-space prediction module 8 may insert a space character between the two concatenated character strings, thereby forming a second text suggestion (e.g., the space-corrected string of text suggestion 14 B in FIG. 1 ). In this manner, computing device 2 may implement the techniques of this disclosure to use character string concatenation and space character-insertion to generate multiple, different text suggestions.
- computing device 2 may also include entry age module 34 .
- entry age module 34 may be configured or otherwise operable to determine an entry age of a received text input and/or separate entry ages associated with particular character strings or characters identified within the text input. As one example, entry age module 34 may determine an entry age of the entire text input, based on a detected time when entry of the input began and/or a detected time when entry of the input ended. In other examples, entry age module 34 may determine the entry age with respect to other received text inputs. In one such example, entry age module 34 may determine the entry age as a function of a number of characters (and/or strings) that have been received subsequent to receiving the original text input. In this manner, entry age module 34 may determine entry age based on different types of criteria, such as temporal criteria indicated by passage of time or amounts of subsequently entered text.
- entry age module 34 may determine the entry age of particular character strings (e.g., as identified by multiple-space prediction module 8 ) included in the received text input.
- entry age module 34 may discern one or both of the time when entry of the string began and the time when entry of the string ended (e.g., through use of timestamps associated with receipt of the first and final character of the string, respectively). Based on the discerned time (e.g., the timestamp associated with receipt of the final character of the character string), entry age module 34 may determine an elapsed time measured from the entry time of the final character to a current time (e.g., accessible through a timer or clock included in or coupled to computing device 2 ). For example, if the elapsed time corresponds to a span of twenty seconds, entry age module 34 may determine that the character is, as one example, “twenty seconds old” for text entry purposes.
- entry age module 34 may determine the entry age of the character string based on a number of subsequent characters of the text input that are positioned to one side of the character string. For example, if entry age module 34 determines that fifteen characters are positioned to the right of the character string (e.g., to the right of the final character of the character string) in the text input, entry age module 34 may determine that the character string is, as one example, “fifteen characters old” for text entry purposes. As another example, entry age module 34 may determine the entry age of the character string based on a number of subsequent characters that are positioned below the character string (e.g., including characters that represent carriage returns).
- entry age module 34 detects subsequent characters positioned to the right of the character string
- the subsequent characters may be displayed at presence-sensitive device 4 such that at least a portion of the subsequent characters appears below the character string.
- Reasons for this appearance may include size constraints associated with presence-sensitive device 4 , a layout of a user interface provided by UI module 6 (e.g., based on a nature of an application currently executing on computing device 2 ), and others.
- entry age module 34 may commit the character string.
- entry age module 34 may commit the character string at least in part by causing UI module 6 to output the character string for display in a text-entry area of a UI.
- entry age module 34 may cause UI module 6 to refrain from outputting the character string in a text-suggestion area of the UI.
- entry age module 34 may commit a string that has been modified (e.g., spell corrected) by spelling correction module 10 .
- entry age module 34 and/or spelling correction module 10 may commit a highest-ranked spell-corrected character string of available characters that meet or exceed the threshold entry age.
- UI module 6 may, in some scenarios, display multiple text suggestions in a text-suggestion area of a UI provided at presence-sensitive device 4 .
- one or more components of computing device 2 e.g., multiple-space prediction module 8
- computing device 2 may apply one or more criteria in selecting the preferred text suggestion from the multiple text suggestions. For example, computing device 2 may select the preferred text based on heuristic data available to computing device 2 (e.g., via local storage on storage devices 48 , from a remote device accessible using communication unit(s) 44 , and others).
- the heuristic data may include data associated with previous selections of particular text suggestions, previous typing errors associated with a particular user account that is currently active on computing device 2 , and the like.
- computing device 2 may display the preferred text suggestion in such a way that the preferred text suggestion is visually differentiated from the remaining text suggestions (e.g., in a bold font, with highlighting, and other visual distinctions known in the art).
- computing device 2 may designate that text suggestion as a preferred text suggestion.
- computing device 2 may prioritize the various preferred text suggestions (e.g., using the heuristic data available to computing device 2 ). In this manner, computing device 2 may select and optionally prioritize various preferred text suggestions using heuristic data associated with such criteria as previous selections of particular text suggestions.
- FIGS. 3A & 3B are conceptual diagrams illustrating example user interfaces (UIs) 62 and 72 that show the implementation of one or more multiple space prediction techniques of this disclosure.
- Text input 66 may represent an unmodified input indicated by a user through the virtual keyboard (not numbered separately for purposes of clarity only).
- text suggestions 64 A- 64 C (“text suggestions 64 ”) may include various instances of space-correction and spelling-correction.
- text 64 A includes a character string that results from inserting two space characters in text input 66 (namely, between the first ‘w’ character and the ‘q’ as well as between the ‘n’ and ‘f’ characters), indicating space correction.
- text suggestion 64 A does not include a second consecutive ‘u.’ character from text input 66 .
- a computing device such as computing device 2 of FIGS. 1 & 2 may delete potentially erroneous characters, such as characters that are entered due to errant double taps of a virtual key.
- Text suggestion 64 B includes the space- and spell-corrected text of text suggestion 64 A, but with additional space correction. More specifically, text suggestion 64 B does not include the space character included in text input 66 positioned between the ‘b’ and ‘r’ characters.
- a device such as computing device 2 of FIGS. 1 & 2 , may implement space-correction techniques that enable deletion of potentially errant entries of a space character (e.g., as may be caused by stray contact of a finger with a presence-sensitive device at the spacebar of the virtual keyboard).
- text suggestion 64 C includes a space- and spell-corrected modification of text input 66 .
- text suggestion 64 C includes the capitalization of text suggestion 64 A, the inserted space characters of text suggestions 64 A & 64 B, and the space character deletion of text suggestion 64 B.
- text suggestion 64 C includes spelling corrections associated with deletion and, optionally, replacement of potentially erroneous characters included in text input 66 .
- the space- and spell-corrected text of text suggestion 64 C results in the following character sequence: “The quick brown fox.”
- text suggestion 64 C may be a preferred text suggestion, based on criteria such as all four included character strings matching lexicon entries accessible to a computing device that outputs UI 62 .
- FIG. 3B illustrates updated UI 72 , which in some instances, may represent a version of UI 62 that is modified due to additional text input by a user as well as committing of a text suggestion using techniques of this disclosure.
- updated UI 72 includes continued text input 70 . More specifically, continued text input 70 includes text corresponding to preferred text suggestion 64 C of FIG. 3B , followed by additional text (demarcated by underlining).
- the additional text includes sixteen characters (as shown in the literal string of text suggestion 68 A), or 4 character strings, as shown in the space-corrected text of text suggestions 68 B & 68 C.
- the computing device implementing the techniques of this disclosure may determine that (original) text entry 66 is sixteen characters old, in terms of entry age. Based on the determination of the entry age of text entry 66 , the computing device may commit preferred text suggestion 64 C, by outputting the text of preferred text suggestion 64 C in the text-entry area of updated UI 72 . In turn, the computing device may output text suggestions 68 that are generated based on the additional text of continued text input 70 . In this manner, a computing device may implement the techniques of this disclosure to commit preferred text suggestions as the computing device receives additional text input via a user interface. By repeating (e.g., recursively executing) the commitment techniques described herein, a computing device may implement the techniques over text inputs of varying lengths, some of which may be arbitrary and relatively long.
- a computing device implementing the techniques of this disclosure may, in various scenarios, commit varying numbers of words/character strings at a time, such as single-, double-, or triple-word sets.
- the techniques may enable deactivation of character string committing, thereby preventing committing of character strings by the computing device, regardless of the entry age of any character string included in text entry 66 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 80 by which a computing device may implement one or more techniques of this disclosure. Although process 80 may be performed by a variety of devices, for ease of discussion purposes only, process 80 is described herein with respect to computing device 2 of FIG. 1 .
- Process 80 may begin when computing device 2 outputs, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 and in a keyboard area of GUI 16 , virtual keyboard 24 that includes various keys, such as spacebar 26 ( 81 ). Additionally, computing device 2 may receive, an indication of an input entered at presense-sensitive device 4 , the input indicating a plurality of characters ( 82 ).
- Multiple-space prediction module 8 may determine a sequence of at least three character strings included in the plurality of characters, such that the sequence does not include any space characters ( 83 ). Additionally, multiple-space prediction module 8 may modify the plurality of characters by inserting at least two space characters within the plurality of characters to demarcate the three character strings from one another ( 84 ). Multiple-space prediction module 8 may determine at least two suggested character strings based at least in part on a first character string, a second character string, and a third character string of the sequence of three character strings ( 88 ).
- UI module 6 may output, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 and at text-suggestion area 18 of GUI 16 , the two or more suggested character strings ( 90 ). Additionally, UI module 6 may receive a selection that indicates a selected character string of the two or more suggested character stings ( 92 ). As described, UI module 6 may receive the input as a gesture, such as a tap, detected at presence-sensitive device 4 . UI module 6 may output, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 at and at text-entry area 20 of GUI 16 , the selected character string ( 94 ).
- UI module 6 may determine whether computing device 2 has received, within a predetermined time period, the selection that indicates the selected character string. Responsive to determining that computing device 2 has not received the selection within the predetermined time period, UI module 6 may output, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 , the preferred suggested character string (e.g., as determined based on heuristic data, etc. as described with respect to FIG. 2 ).
- computing device 2 may determine that a last (or final) character of the first character string represents a terminal character, the determination indicating that the first character string is included in a lexicon accessible to computing device 2 . Additionally, computing device 2 may determine that a first character of the second character string indicates a search path with respect to the first character string when concatenated with the first character string, the determination indicating that the concatenation of the first character string with the first character of the second character string forms at least a portion of an entry in a lexicon accessible to the computing device.
- a first suggested character string of the two or more suggested character strings may include the first character string followed by a space character
- a second suggested character string of the two or more suggested character strings may include the first character string followed by at least the first character of the second character string
- UI module 6 may output, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 and at text-entry area 20 of GUI 16 , character set 22 generated based at least in part on the plurality of characters. Additionally, in some such implementations, UI module 6 may remove, from display at presence-sensitive device 4 and at text-entry area 20 of GUI 16 , character set 22 in response to receiving the selection of the selected character string.
- UI module 6 may receive, via GUI 16 , an indication of a second input entered at presence-sensitive device 4 , the second input indicating a second plurality of characters.
- Multiple-space prediction module 8 may determine a second sequence of at least two character strings included in the second plurality of characters, such that the second sequence does not include any space characters.
- Multiple-space prediction module may modify the second plurality of characters by inserting at least one space character within the second plurality of characters to demarcate the at least two character strings from one another.
- UI module 6 may output, for display at presence-sensitive device 4 , the selected character string and a second character set generated based at least in part on the second plurality of characters, such that the second character set is displayed to one side of the selected character string at text-entry area 20 of GUI 16 .
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example process 110 by which a computing device may identify and extract character strings (e.g., dictionary words) from a text input, such as a set or plurality of characters.
- character strings e.g., dictionary words
- process 110 may be performed by any of a variety of devices. However, as with other example processes described herein, process 110 is described with respect to computing device 2 of FIG. 1 , for purposes of clarity only.
- Process 110 may begin when multiple-space prediction module 8 parses a text input on a character-by-character basis ( 112 ). Additionally, spelling correction module 10 may evaluate each character for possible alternatives ( 114 ). For instance, spelling correction module 10 may flag potentially erroneous characters and identifying possible alternate characters. In evaluating each character for possible alternatives, spelling correction module 10 may employ various factors, such as the position of a respective character within a string (e.g., first intra-string character, second intra-string character, and so on). Multiple-space prediction module 8 may determine whether the parsing process is at a terminal character (decision block 116 ). More specifically, a terminal character may, in examples, indicate a character that represents the end of a lexicon entry.
- a terminal character may, in examples, indicate a character that represents the end of a lexicon entry.
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may continue to parse characters of the text input (e.g., returning to 112 ). Conversely, if multiple-space prediction module 8 determines that the current character represents a terminal character (or “terminal node”), multiple-space prediction module 8 may add the character string ending at the terminal character to a list of text suggestions ( 118 ).
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may determine whether the character string ending at the terminal node is a prefix other lexicon entries (decision block 120 ). More specifically, multiple-space prediction module 8 may determine if the character string forms a portion of another lexicon entry, such that the lexicon entry includes other characters subsequent to the identified character string. The subsequent characters may be referred to herein as a “suffix” of the string.
- the ‘t’ character may represent a terminal character with respect to the character string ‘present.’ Additionally, the character string ‘present’ may be included in a lexicon entry ‘presentation.’ In this instance, multiple-space prediction module 8 may add the string ‘present’ to a list of text suggestions, and determine that the string is included in the lexicon entry ‘presentation,’ among potentially other entries as well. Based on this determination, multiple-space prediction module 8 may identify one or more additional search paths with respect to character strings including the string ‘present.’
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may continue to parse additional characters of the text input (e.g., returning to 112 ).
- multiple-space prediction module 8 may begin a next character string with the next character of the text input as the root of the next character string. For instance, by beginning the next character string (e.g., a next word), multiple-space prediction module 8 may indicate that no additional search paths exist with respect to the already-identified character string. Upon beginning the next character string, multiple-space prediction module 8 may continue parsing subsequent characters of the text input (e.g., returning to 112 ).
- processors including one or more microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry, as well as any combinations of such components.
- DSPs digital signal processors
- ASICs application specific integrated circuits
- FPGAs field programmable gate arrays
- processors may generally refer to any of the foregoing logic circuitry, alone or in combination with other logic circuitry, or any other equivalent circuitry.
- a control unit including hardware may also perform one or more of the techniques of this disclosure.
- Such hardware, software, and firmware may be implemented within the same device or within separate devices to support the various techniques described herein.
- any of the described units, modules or components may be implemented together or separately as discrete but interoperable logic devices. Depiction of different features as modules or units is intended to highlight different functional aspects and does not necessarily imply that such modules or units are realized by separate hardware, firmware, or software components. Rather, functionality associated with one or more modules or units may be performed by separate hardware, firmware, or software components, or integrated within common or separate hardware, firmware, or software components.
- Techniques described herein may also be embodied or encoded in an article of manufacture including a computer-readable storage medium encoded with instructions. Instructions embedded or encoded in an article of manufacture including an encoded computer-readable storage medium or computer-readable storage device, may cause one or more programmable processors, or other processors, to implement one or more of the techniques described herein, such as when instructions included or encoded in the computer-readable storage medium are executed by the one or more processors.
- Computer readable storage media may include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), programmable read only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, a hard disk, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM), a floppy disk, a cassette, magnetic media, optical media, or other computer readable storage media. Additional examples of computer readable medium include computer-readable storage devices, computer-readable memory, and tangible computer-readable medium. In some examples, an article of manufacture may comprise one or more computer-readable storage media.
- a control unit may, in various examples, comprise any combination of one or more processors, one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and one or more application specific standard products (ASSPs).
- a control unit may also comprise memory, both static (e.g., hard drives or magnetic drives, optical drives, FLASH memory, EPROM, EEPROM, etc.) and dynamic (e.g., RAM, DRAM, SRAM, etc.), or any other non-transitory computer readable storage medium capable of storing instructions that cause the one or more processors to perform the efficient network management techniques described in this disclosure.
- a control unit may represent hardware or a combination of hardware and software to support the below described components, modules or elements, and the techniques should not be strictly limited to any particular example described below.
- computer-readable storage media and/or computer-readable storage devices may comprise non-transitory media and/or non-transitory devices.
- the term “non-transitory” may indicate that the storage medium is tangible and is not embodied in a carrier wave or a propagated signal.
- a non-transitory storage medium may store data that can, over time, change (e.g., in RAM or cache).
