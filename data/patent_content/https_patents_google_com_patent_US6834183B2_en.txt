Definitions
- the present invention relates to wireless communications, and specifically to wireless communications where voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) gain tracking is used for setting modulation gain.
- VCO voltage controlled oscillator
- Phase locked loops are used to drive local oscillators for upconverters (transmitters) and downconverters (receivers) in telecommunications equipment and systems.
- PLLs can also be equipped with modulators and/or demodulators for the associated transmitters and receivers of the type that respectively send and receive constant envelope signals such as signals having phase and/or frequency modulation, as well as with non-constant envelope transmitters and receivers in which a signal is expressed as a combination of multiple constant envelope signals (linc modulation) or as a constant envelope signal and a separate envelope-defining signal (polar modulation).
- the accuracy of PLL based modulators and demodulators depends on whether the PLL bandwidth is sufficiently large compared to the bandwidth of the signals being transmitted and received.
- the PLL bandwidth may be limited by the need for low output radio frequency (RF) spectrum noise at offset frequencies near the edge of the modulation bandwidth.
- RF radio frequency
- the signal bandwidth is typically near channel spacing, and low spectral noise is needed so that blocking effects from signals on adjacent channels can be minimized.
- Dual port PLLs are commonly used for broadening the PLL response to a modulation or demodulation signal while at the same time maintaining low output RF spectrum noise.
- a fractional-N modulating synthesizer there are two signal paths between the data input, and the phase or frequency modulated output signals.
- Signal flow analysis requires that networks containing a single loop and having more than one forward path have a transfer function determined by the sum of the transfer functions of the forward paths divided by one plus the transfer function of the loop.
- modulation accuracy is highly dependent on variations in Kv, the VCO gain.
- the degree of sensitivity to variation in Kv depends on the PLL bandwidth. For lower PLL bandwidths, the sensitivity of modulation accuracy to Kv variation may become higher than can be tolerated by system requirements.
- the signal bandwidth is approximately 200 KHz, and there are strict spectral noise requirements at the 400 KHz offset frequency of ⁇ 113 dBC/Hz.
- the noise stimulus from the phase detector output dominates the output RF spectrum.
- a typical in-band noise level is approximately ⁇ 100 dBC/Hz.
- a 150 KHz PLL can be employed resulting in nominal 15 dB rejection to the phase detector noise stimulus at 400 KHz. This results in an output RF spectrum noise of ⁇ 114 dBc/Hz, which marginally passes the requirement.
- the PLL rejection is insufficient when PLL parameters vary in such a way as to widen the PLL bandwidth.
- Adjusting the loop filter transfer function can reduce the PLL bandwidth. For instance, in order to reduce the bandwidth by a factor of 0.5 and bring the PLL bandwidth down to 75 kHz, loop filter resistors can be reduced by a factor of 2 and the capacitors increased by a factor of 4.

- FIG. 1 shows a mobile station 10 .
- the mobile station 10 may be any type of wireless phone, data or messaging device such as, for example, a code division multiple access (CDMA) or GSM type cellular telephone, that is capable of communicating with other like wireless devices or with public switched telephone network landline devices through a base station 12 using a conventional wireless protocol as is well known in the art.
- CDMA code division multiple access
- GSM GSM type cellular telephone
- the mobile station 10 In addition to including a conventional transmitter 14 and receiver 16 for respectively transmitting and receiving wireless communications signals over an antenna 18 , the mobile station 10 also includes a synthesizer 20 and a controller 22 that each include components that enable modulation of wireless communications signals with voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) gain tracking so that the modulation on the channels in the bands and sub-bands on which the mobile station 10 operates can be automatically calibrated in a manner that will be discussed below in more detail.
- VCO voltage controlled oscillator
- the synthesizer 20 is preferably a dual port multi-accumulator fractional-N, or fract-N, synthesizer of the type well known to those skilled in the art.
- the synthesizer 20 may alternatively be any synthesizer, such as a delta-sigma synthesizer, that is capable of modulating a carrier signal to produce and output or provide a modulated radio frequency (RF) signal to the transmitter 14 .
- RF radio frequency
- the synthesizer 20 includes a loop filter 24 , a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 26 , a programmable divider 28 , a phase detector 30 , a fract-N controller 32 and a reference oscillator 34 that are intercoupled as depicted and together form a conventional phase-locked loop (PLL).
- VCO voltage controlled oscillator
- PLL phase-locked loop
- the VCO 26 generates a carrier signal at a frequency and with modulation that a tuning voltage Vt generated by the loop filter 24 controls, thereby producing an RF signal at 42 .
- the RF signal is also input into the programmable divider 28 , which divides the RF signal by a predetermined value Ndiv, with Ndiv being a value that is determined by the fract-N controller 32 and output to the programmable divider 28 at 44 .
- the value Ndiv which is based on a modulation data signal input from the controller 22 over a data signal line 45 , controls the modulation of the carrier signal generated by the VCO 26 .
- the value Ndiv output over the data signal line 45 also controls the modulation of the carrier signal generated by the VCO 26 by driving a high port input, also referred to as the reference numeral 45 , of the loop filter 24 .
- the phase detector 30 generates an error signal representing the difference in phase between the divided RF signal output from the phase detector at 46 and a reference signal generated by and output at 48 from the reference oscillator 34 , which is preferably a quartz crystal based oscillator that generates a reference oscillator signal having a frequency of about 26 MHz.
- the phase detector 30 then inputs the error signal into the loop filter 24 through a low port 50 of the loop filter 24 or, more generally, through a low port of the synthesizer 20 .
- the loop filter 24 includes a lowpass filter 54 for filtering the error signal input from the phase detector 30 .
- the loop filter 24 also includes a multiplier digital to analog controller (DAC) 55 that, via a digital to analog converter (DAC) 56 , converts the modulation data signal input through the synthesizer high port 45 to an analog signal.
- the DAC 56 which is preferably a 10-bit DAC, and a multiplier 58 , or amplifier with a controllable gain, that multiplies the modulation data signal input through the synthesizer high port 45 by an analog reference voltage, or high port gain control signal.
- the high port gain signal is, in the case of a 10-bit DAC, a 6-bit signal generated by the controller 22 , converted to an analog signal by, and output through, a gain setting DAC 78 in the controller 22 and input through a gain control port 60 of the loop filter 24 . Therefore, the DAC 55 has a gain that is controlled by the high port gain control signal input through the gain control port 60 .
- the resulting analog signal output at 62 from the multiplier DAC 55 is an output voltage that represents a high port signal to be modulated on the carrier signal generated by the VCO 26 .
- the high port signal 62 is then summed by a summer 66 with the filtered error signal output at 64 from the lowpass filter 54 to produce a tuning voltage Vt.
- the tuning voltage, or tuning voltage, Vt is output to the VCO 26 at a loop filter output 68 to control the modulation frequency of and, more specifically, to modulate the RF signal that is provided or output at 42 in FIG. 1 by the VCO 26 . As shown in FIG.
- the tuning voltage Vt is also fed back to the controller 22 via a VCO gain tracking feedback loop 70 to enable VCO gain tracking to be performed to enable modulation gain setting calibration data or, more generally, calibration data, stored in the LUT 76 to be updated.
- calibration data may be used to describe the data stored in the LUT 76 to emphasize the fact that the data may either be the actual modulation gain setting calibration data for setting the gain of the high port gain control signal output at 60 by the controller 22 , or alternatively more unrefined data, such as the value of the tuning voltage Vt, the controller 22 may use to calculate the modulation gain setting calibration data.
- the controller 22 includes an all-purpose ADC 72 that, during gain setting calibration, alternatively referred to as gain setting updating, receives the tuning voltage Vt from the VCO gain tracking feedback loop 70 , converts the tuning voltage Vt to a digital gain control signal, and outputs the digital gain control signal at 74 to a gain control lookup table (LUT) 76 .
- the gain control LUT 76 is an appropriately sized memory for storing calibration data to be used depending on the channel setting of the synthesizer 20 .
- the requisite modulation accuracy and the channel grouping strategy determine the number of different channel settings. For instance, one possible strategy is to have an equal number of contiguous channel groupings, hereinafter referred to as sub-bands, for each band of operation. Another strategy might employ channel groupings of various sizes, with the smaller channel groupings for channel frequencies corresponding to frequency regions having a larger variation in VCO gain.
- Hcl(s) is the closed loop gain ignoring the high port path.
- Hcl(s) determines the PLL's suppression of the noise stimuli that dominate the output RF spectral noise. These stimuli include the noise floor at the phase detector 30 and the fractional-N waveform noise.
- H(s) For minimum distortion of the modulated signal, H(s) must be equal to one. This means that Hhp(s), the transfer function between the multiplying DAC 55 and the VCO 26 , needs to equal 1/Kv, where Kv is the VCO gain, as shown below in equation (2).
- modulation distortion in a dual port system is relatively unaffected by variations in parameters such as the gain of the phase detector 30 , the divider ratio N, and the components of the loop filter 24 that determine the loop filter transfer impedance, Zlf(s).
- This insensitivity to parameter variation is why a dual port synthesizer, or, more specifically, a dual port PLL, is a better solution than other approaches to the problem of modulation accuracy for applications such as digital predistortion.
- the optimum gain setting is the reciprocal of the VCO gain Kv. An interim determination of the VCO gain Kv may be made during the process of determining the calibration data.
- the VCO gain Kv is the first derivative of the VCO output frequency with respect to the VCO tuning voltage Vt, which can be expressed as the limit of the change in VCO output frequency divided by the change in Vt as the change in Vt approaches zero. This can be approximated as the difference in VCO output frequency, ⁇ F, divided by the difference in VCO tuning voltage, ⁇ Vt:
- the VCO gain Kv can therefore be approximated as the frequency separation of two channels divided by the difference in VCO tuning voltage for the two channels.
- a modulation or, more specifically, high port, gain setting calibration process will now be described for the channel grouping strategy of having an equal number M ⁇ 1 sub-bands for each band.
- a high port gain setting is calibrated as follows.
- the synthesizer 20 is sequentially programmed by the controller 22 to the lowest channel in the sub-band having band index n and sub-band index m, followed by the lowest channel having band index n and sub-band index m+1.
- the controller 22 uses the ADC 72 to convert the tuning voltage Vt, measured for each of the two channels during operation of one of the calibration methodologies that will be described below to first and second digital tuning voltage measurements, and the tuning voltage difference, ⁇ Vt, is calculated.
- C 1 is a proportionality constant stored in the controller memory 80 to account for the value of the frequency difference between sub-bands as well as other constant factors that affect the high port gain calculation, such as the gain factors of the VCO gain tracking feedback loop 70 and the ADC 72 , as will be understood by those skilled in the art.
- the process of controlling the synthesizer 20 to two channel settings, feeding back the tuning voltage Vt for each, calculating the high port gain setting and storing the high port gain setting in the LUT 76 is repeated for all band and sub-band settings. Since the initial calibration may be executed without having valid gain control signals in the LUT 76 , the modulation accuracy may be poorer or less than can be tolerated by system requirements. For this reason, the initial calibration may be best suited for a background mode of operation in which the output signal from the transmitter 14 is attenuated by disabling the automatic output controller (AOC) 84 , as will now be described.
- AOC automatic output controller
- the AOC 84 is disabled by the controller 22 to assure that amplifiers and switches (not shown) in the transmitter 14 are in a maximum state of attenuation and that a power level at the antenna 18 is below a spurious emissions limit.
- the controller 22 looks up initial parameters from controller memory 80 , including the number of bands N, the number of channels per band Nchannel(n), the number of sub-bands per band M and proportionality constants C 1 (n,m).
- the LUT 76 may be programmed to store a gain setting for each of these sub-bands or, alternatively, for just the bands, depending upon the level of accuracy required at the VCO 26 .
- the number of bands and sub-bands may vary depending upon the type of communications protocol and the accuracy required. In the most demanding case, the number of channels per sub-band is one and the LUT 76 contains a gain control setting for every channel.
- the controller 22 programs the synthesizer 20 to transmit pseudorandom data on sub-band m of band n.
- the controller 22 measures the resulting tuning voltage Vt output from the loop filter 24 and stores the value of Vt as Vt(n,m) in the controller memory 80 .
- the above calibration methodology may be initiated during factory programming of the mobile station 10 , or alternatively at, for example, power-up prior to use.
- a one-time factory calibration may not be sufficient due to parametric shifts due to, for example, component aging, and a start-up calibration may not be sufficient due to parametric variation with temperature.
- phase locked loop distortion due to variations in the initial parameters may need to be addressed by recalibrating the high port gain values in the LUT 76 during normal operation of the mobile station 10 .
- Such a continuous calibration methodology is based on tuning voltage measurements that are made during normal operation without the need for special tuning waveforms and without affecting the modulated RF signal generated by the VCO 26 and transmitted by the transmitter 14 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates the methodology for implementing the above continuous calibration. This calibration is performed while the synthesizer 20 is programmed according to the RF channel requirements for normal transceiver operation.
- the controller 22 measures the VCO tuning voltage Vt fed back from the VCO gain tracking feedback loop 70 and stores the measured value of Vt in the controller memory 80 .
- the controller 22 determines whether two tuning voltages Vt 1 , Vt 2 at different channels, or points, in a sub-band have been stored. If two tuning voltages Vt 1 , Vt 2 have been stored, at 134 , the controller 22 then looks up initial parameters as at 102 in FIG.
- the controller 22 stores the value of the high port gain setting Ahp in the LUT 76 , and the methodology then checks to see if the continuous calibration methodology is still enabled at 140 . If it is enabled, the methodology returns to 132 , and if it is not enabled it ends.
- the described calibration methodologies provide high port gain settings based on Equation (4) above where the VCO tuning voltages, Vt, are approximated by piecewise linear functions versus VCO output frequency or channel, where piecewise linear segments are defined over the frequency sub-bands, and where the slopes of the segments approximate the VCO gain Kv according to Equation (3) above. These methodologies have the advantage of simplifying the processing of the controller 22 .
- curve fitting methodology or more generally as curve fitting
- Curve fitting requires a model equation of actual system behavior in terms of an independent variable versus a dependant variable.
- the curve fitting of interim dependant variable Vt versus VCO frequency or channel will now be discussed, employing the transform to Ahp from ⁇ Vt by Equation (3).
- curve fitting of other interim variables such as Kv, or, more directly, curve fitting of Ahp versus frequency or channel, is also possible.
- VCO circuit designs vary in their Vt versus frequency behavior, but generally are well-behaved in the sense that a low order polynomial provides an accurate model.
- Closed form expressions for curve fitting to a polynomial model can be derived by employing the mathematical concept of determinants in the form of algebraic functions of pairs of Vt and frequency or channel data points.
- the number of data pairs needed to generate a polynomial model is equal to the order of the polynomial plus one.
- the number of tuning voltage measurements required, Nmin is the order of the polynomial plus 1.
- An exemplary second order polynomial model of Vt versus frequency is shown below, with it being understood by those skilled in the art that higher order polynomials may be used depending upon VCO circuit behavior:
- the aforementioned methods of determining the model formula employ the minimum number of measurements, and these measurements exactly fit the resulting formula. For reasons discussed below, it may be useful to utilize more than the minimum number of measurements.
- the model formula cannot exactly fit all of the data points but tends to exclude the effects of measurement noise. It is not generally practical or possible to employ closed form expressions for the best estimate of the model formula.
- Methods commonly referred to as regression techniques employ iterative approaches for finding the model formula that provides the minimum error function.
- One such error function for example, is a least squares error function, which is the sum of the squares of the difference between the measured data and the data produced by the model formula.
- a methodology for calculating and storing high port gain control settings Ahp into the LUT 76 can be utilized. For example, if the channel grouping strategy of having an equal number of contiguous channel groupings for each band of operation is chosen, the resulting methodology is as shown in FIG. 5 .
- the controller 22 looks up initial parameters from the controller memory 80 , including the number of bands N, the number of channels per band Nchannel(n), the number of sub-bands per band M, proportionality constants C 1 (n,m) and, in addition, a minimum number of measurements, Nmin, required to bring to an acceptable level the error on the channel gain setting Ahp caused by measurement noise.
- the controller 22 calculates the model formula coefficients for the band n, using, for example, Equation (5) above for the case of a second order polynomial model, and stores them in the memory 80 .
- the controller 22 measures the tuning voltage Vt fed back from the VCO gain tracking feedback loop 70 and stores Vt in the memory 80 according to the band of operation.
- the controller 22 determines whether Vt has been measured a minimum number of times Nmin in the band n and stored.
- the controller 22 calculates Ahp(n,m) for the sub-band m in use in band n based on the stored model coefficients and at 190 stores the calculated gain setting Ahp(n,m) in the LUT 76 .
- the methodology determines if the continuous calibration methodology is enabled and, if so, returns to 180 . If it is not enabled, the methodology ends.
- the foregoing discussion is directed toward operation of the mobile station 10 with respect to the transmitter 14 .
- the automatic high port, or modulation, gain setting calibration according to the present invention may also be deployed with respect to modulated signals received by the receiver 16 and subsequently output to and processed by the controller 22 .
- the mobile station configuration could be one such as that shown at 10 in FIG. 1, or it may be one where a separate synthesizer is deployed for the receiver, such as in a full duplex radio.
- the calibration routines of the present invention are applicable to any wireless protocol, it is specifically applicable to wireless protocols having wider signal bandwidths such as EGPRS, CDMA, wideband CDMA (WCDMA) and universal mobile telecommunications service (UMTS) based on the tradeoff in PLL bandwidth due to the aforementioned output RF spectrum and modulation distortion.
- wireless protocols having wider signal bandwidths such as EGPRS, CDMA, wideband CDMA (WCDMA) and universal mobile telecommunications service (UMTS) based on the tradeoff in PLL bandwidth due to the aforementioned output RF spectrum and modulation distortion.
