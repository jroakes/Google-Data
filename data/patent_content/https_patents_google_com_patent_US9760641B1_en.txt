Definitions
- This specification relates to ranking search results of search queries submitted to an Internet search engine.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources, e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content, that are relevant to a user's information needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Internet search engines generally return a set of search results, each identifying a respective resource, in response to a user-submitted query.
- This specification describes how a system can determine a score for a site, e.g., a web site or other collection of data resources, as seen by a search engine, that represents a measure of quality for the site.
- the score is determined from quantities indicating user actions of seeking out and preferring particular sites and the resources found in particular sites.
- a site quality score for a particular site can be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator that represents user interest in the site as reflected in user queries directed to the site and a denominator that represents user interest in the resources found in the site as responses to queries of all kinds.
- the site quality score for a site can be used as a signal to rank resources, or to rank search results that identify resources, that are found in one site relative to resources found in another site.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining a first count of unique queries, received by a search engine, that include a reference to a particular site; determining a second count of unique queries, received by the search engine, that are associated with the particular site, wherein a query is associated with the particular site when the query is followed by a user selection of a search result that (a) was presented, by the search engine, in response to the query and (b) identifies a resource in the particular site; and determining, based on the first and second counts, a site quality score for the particular site.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- a query includes a reference to the particular site when the query includes a site label identifying the particular site.
- a query includes a reference to the particular site when the query includes a term that has been determined to be a term that refers to the particular site.
- a query includes a reference to the particular site when the query is a query that has been determined to be a navigational query to the particular site.
- the user selection of a search result is an action received from a user that causes the resource identified by the search result to be presented, at least in part, to the user.
- Determining the site quality score comprises computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, wherein the numerator is based on the first count, and wherein the denominator is based on the second count.
- the numerator is based on the first count reduced by a threshold value.
- the numerator is a maximum of (a) a lower-bound value and (b) the first count reduced by a threshold value.
- the denominator is based on the second count raised to a power that is greater than zero and less than one.
- the denominator is a sum of a base value plus the second count raised to a power that is greater than zero and less than one.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining a first count of user selections, received by a search engine, of search results that were presented in response to queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site; determining a second count of user selections, received by the search engine, of search results that identify resources in the particular site; and determining, based on the first and second counts, a site quality score for the particular site.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- a query includes a reference to the particular site when the query includes a site label identifying the particular site.
- a query includes a reference to the particular site when the query includes a term that has been determined to be a term that refers to the particular site.
- a query includes a reference to the particular site when the query is a query that has been determined to be a navigational query to the particular site.
- the user selection of a search result is an action received from a user that causes the resource identified by the search result to be presented, at least in part, to the user.
- Determining the site quality score comprises computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, wherein the numerator is based on the first count, and wherein the denominator is based on the second count.
- the numerator is based on the first count reduced by a threshold value.
- the numerator is a maximum of (a) a lower-bound value and (b) the first count reduced by a threshold value.
- the denominator is based on the second count raised to a power that is greater than zero and less than one.
- the denominator is a sum of a base value plus the second count raised to a power that is greater than zero and less than one.
- Site quality scores representing a measure of quality for sites can be computed.
- the site quality scores can be used to rank search results according to the web sites in which the resources identified by the results are found.
- a site quality score for a site can be used as a term in the computation of scores for resources that are in the site.
- a high site quality score for a particular site can be used to determine how other attributes are used to score resources in that site.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a site quality score.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of another example process for determining a site quality score.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system 114 .
- the search system 114 is an example of an information retrieval system implemented as computer programs on one or more computers in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a user 102 can interact with the search system 114 through a user device 104 .
- the user device 104 can be a computer coupled to the search system 114 through a data communication network 112 , e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks.
- the search system 114 can be implemented on the user device 104 , for example, if a user installs an application that performs searches on the user device 104 .
- the user device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- RAM random access memory
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 104 can be a personal computer of some kind, a cloud client device, a smartphone, or a personal digital assistant.
- the user device 104 can run an application program, e.g., a web browser, that can interact with the search system 114 to display web pages that provide a user interface to the search system 114 for the user 102 of the user device 104 .
- a user 102 can use the user device 104 to submit a query 110 to a search system 114 .
- a search engine 130 within the search system 114 performs the search to identify resources matching the query.
- the query 110 may be transmitted through the network 112 to the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 includes an index database 122 and the search engine 130 .
- the search system 114 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the user device 104 for presentation to the user 102 , e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 104 .
- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data: the data does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations.
- the index database 122 can include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- the term “engine” will be used broadly to refer to a software-based system or subsystem that can perform one or more specific functions. Generally, an engine will be implemented as one or more software modules or components, installed on one or more computers in one or more locations. In some cases, one or more computers will be dedicated to a particular engine; in other cases, multiple engines can be installed and running on the same computer or computers.
- the search engine 130 When the query 110 is received by the search engine 130 , the search engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources on the Internet and uses an index database 122 to store the index information, and a ranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- the search system 114 can include, and can communicate with, a site scoring engine 140 that can generate site quality scores for sites.
- the site scoring engine 140 can generate site quality scores based at least in part on site data 150 .
- Site data 150 includes data that the system has that includes or describes queries that were submitted to the system by users. Queries that include a reference to a particular site are of particular interest. Such queries will be referred to as “site queries.”
- the system can categorize queries as ones that refer to a particular site in a number of ways. For example, a query can be categorized as referring to a particular site if the query includes a site label that identifies the particular site.
- a site label identifying a particular site can be specified using an operator, e.g., a “site:” operator, followed by a name, e.g., a domain name, for the particular site.
- Queries that refer to a particular site can be used to request resources that are in the particular site. For example, a query “san francisco site:www.example.com” can be used to request resources responsive to the query “san francisco” that are in the site www.example.com.
- a query can be categorized as referring to a particular site if the query includes a term that has been determined to be a term that refers to the particular site. For example, if the search system has data indicating that the terms “example sf” and “esf” are commonly used by users to refer to a site “sf.example.com,” queries that contain the terms “example sf” or “esf”, e.g., the queries “example sf news” and “esf restaurant reviews,” can be counted as queries that refer to the site “sf.example.com.”
- a query can be categorized as referring to a particular site when the query has been determined to be a navigational query to the particular site.
- a navigational query is a query that is submitted in order to get to a single, particular web site or web page of a particular entity.
- a search engine this is a matter of inference.
- a search system can determine that a query is a navigational query to a particular site when a search result linked to the particular site has received at least a threshold percentage of the user selections that were received for all search results that are responsive to the query.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a site quality score.
- the process 200 will be described as performed by a system including one or more computing devices.
- a search system 114 as described in reference to FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 200 .
- the system determines a count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site ( 202 ).
- the count can be for a particular time window to a current time, e.g., all queries received by the system in the preceding day, two days, week or month, for example, or over all query data available to the system.
- all queries that contain the same query terms, regardless of order, are counted as a single unique query. For example, in such implementations, multiple queries “san francisco site:example.com” and “francisco san site:example.com” are counted as one unique query.
- the system can use user information or user device information when counting unique queries. For example, the same query can be counted as two unique queries if it is identified as having been submitted by two different users. In this context, whether a query is the same query can be determined with or without regard to the order of the query terms, as described above.
- the system can identify a user based on, e.g., a user being logged into a user account, an Internet protocol address associated with the user device being used by user, or by using information provided by the user device, e.g., an Internet cookie.
- User information that is used to identify unique users, unique addresses, or other user-related history can be anonymized so that the privacy of users is protected. For example, quasi-unique identifiers can be associated with users, but the actual identifying information of the users may not be stored.
- the system determines a count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site ( 204 ).
- the system can associate a particular query with a particular site when a search result that was presented in response to the particular query identifies a resource in the particular site, where the search result has received a user selection. For example, a particular query “example restaurant reviews” can be associated with a particular site “example.com” when a user selects a search result that was presented in response to the particular query, where the search result identifies a resource in the particular site, e.g., “http://example.com/resource”.
- the system determines a site quality score for the particular site ( 206 ).
- the site quality score can be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is based on the count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to the particular site, and where the denominator is based on the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site.
- One example of such a ratio can be expressed as: S/U where S is the count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to the particular site, and where U is the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site.
- a site quality score can also be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is based on the count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to the particular site reduced by a threshold value, and where the denominator is based on the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site.
- T is the threshold value, e.g., a number from 1 to 30, e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 or 30. The value may be determined empirically according to the uses that will be made of the score.
- a site quality score can also be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is based on a maximum of (a) a lower-bound value L, e.g., zero, and (b) the count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site reduced by a threshold value, and where the denominator is based on the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site.
- L lower-bound value
- the denominator is based on the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site.
- the effect of the denominator, or of U, the count of unique queries can be dampened, e.g., by being raised to a power n between 0.0 and 1.0, e.g., the power 0.5, 0.0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, or 0.9.
- n between 0.0 and 1.0, e.g., the power 0.5, 0.0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, or 0.9.
- a site quality score can also be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is based on the count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site, and where the denominator is based on a sum of a base value B that is greater than zero, e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, or 100, plus a term based on the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site.
- a ratio can be expressed as:
- a site quality score can also be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is based on a maximum of (a) a lower-bound value L, and (b) the count of unique queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site reduced by a threshold value T, and where the denominator is based on a sum of a base value B plus the count of unique queries that are associated with the particular site raised to a power n, which parameters have been described above.
- a ratio can be expressed as:
- the system can be configured to treat different kinds of collections of resources as a site.
- a site can be defined operationally as a collection of resources that are hosted on a particular server.
- resources in a site can be accessed through a network, e.g., the Internet, using an Internet address, e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), corresponding to a server on which the site is hosted.
- a network e.g., the Internet
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- a site can be defined operationally as the resources in a domain, e.g., “example.com,” where the resources in the domain, e.g., “host.example.com/resource1,” “www.example.com/folder/resource2,” or “example.com/resource3,” are in the site.
- a site can be defined operationally using a subdomain, e.g., “www.example.com,” where the resources in the subdomain, e.g., “www.example.com/resource1” or “www.example.com/folder/resource2,” are in the site.
- a site can be defined operationally using a subdirectory, e.g., “example.com/subdirectory,”, where the resources in the subdirectory, e.g., “example.com/subdirectory/resource.html,” are in the site.
- Site quality scores can be used by a ranking engine to rank search results.
- the site quality score for a particular site can be used as a term in the computation of scores for resources that are in the particular site.
- a site quality score for the site “http://www.example.com” can be used as a term in the computation of a score for a resource “http://www.example.com/resource.html” that is in the site.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of another example process for determining a site quality score.
- the process 300 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 300 .
- a search system 114 as described in reference to FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 300 .
- the system determines a count of user selections of search results that were presented in response to queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site ( 302 ).
- a mouse rollover, a click, a click of at least a certain duration, or a click of at least a certain duration relative to a resource length may be treated by the system as being a user selection.
- the system can maintain a count of user selections of search results that were presented in response to queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site. For example, if the search system has data indicating that the terms “example sf” are commonly used by users to refer to a site “sf.example.com,” the system can count the number of user selections that were received on search results that were presented in response to queries that contain the terms “example sf”, e.g., the queries “example sf news” and “example sf restaurant reviews,” both of which include a reference to the site “sf.example.com.”
- a user selection is any action received from a user, and made in connection with the presentation of search results, that causes the resource identified by a search result to be presented, at least in part, to the user.
- the user device and search system are separate, such actions are detected on the user's device and data characterizing the actions are transmitted to the search system.
- one or more of a mouse rollover, a click, a click of at least a certain minimum duration, i.e., a selection after which the user views the resource for at least the certain minimum duration, or a click of at least a certain duration relative to a physical or temporal length of the resource for example, may be treated by the system as being a user selection.
- the system determines a count of user selections of search results that identify resources in the particular site ( 304 ), regardless of the content of the query to which the search results are a response.
- the system determines a site quality score for the particular site ( 306 ).
- the site quality score for the particular site can be determined by using the ratios described in reference to FIG. 2 , where the numerator is a function of the count of user selections of search results that were presented in response to queries that are categorized as referring to a particular site, and where the denominator is a function of the count of user selections of search results that identify resources in the particular site.
