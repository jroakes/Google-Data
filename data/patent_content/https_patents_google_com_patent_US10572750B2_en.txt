Definitions
- Publishers may request content from multiple third-party content providers as part of choosing a sponsored content item to display with the publisher content. This is often done through the use of mediation platforms that interact with the third-party content providers.
- the mediation platform chooses a third-party content provider and then the third party content provider network is responsible for requesting and serving the sponsored content items. Accountability for undesirable sponsored content items may be difficult when many different third-party content provider networks are serving sponsored content items.
- One implementation relates to a method running on one or more processors of a computing device providing mediation code to a publisher for inclusion in publisher content provided to a user device.
- the mediation code is associated with a table of sponsored content networks.
- the method further relates to receiving an image of a sponsored content item and a sponsored content network identifier from the user device, analyzing the image of the sponsored content item, the analysis generating extracted image data from the sponsored content item, and categorizing the sponsored content item based on the extracted image data and the sponsored content network identifier.
- the method further relates to receiving an instruction to filter the sponsored content networks exceeding a metric based on a category, the instruction comprising the metric and associated with the publisher and updating the table of sponsored content networks to remove a particular sponsored content network, the particular sponsored content network exceeding the metric based on the category to prevent serving of sponsored content items from the particular sponsored content network to the user device.
- the method may include receiving data over a network comprising an identifier of a model of a user device, an identifier of an application on the user device, and an indication of an interaction with the application and launching one of a video playback, a tutorial, a demonstration, and a simulation responsive to receiving the data.
- the method may further comprise receiving additional data over the network comprising an identifier of the application, an indication of a response from the application, and an indication of another interaction with the application after the response from the application.
- Another implementation relates to a system with at least one processor and memory that is operatively coupled to the processor, wherein the memory stores instructions that are executed by the at least one processor. Execution of the instructions causes the system to provide mediation code to a publisher for inclusion in publisher content provided to a user device, the mediation code associated with a table of sponsored content networks, receive an image of a sponsored content item and a sponsored content network identifier from the user device, analyze the image of the sponsored content item, the analysis generating extracted image data from the sponsored content item, categorize the sponsored content item based on the extracted image data and the sponsored content network identifier, receive an instruction to filter the sponsored content networks exceeding a metric based on a category, the instruction comprising the metric and associated with the publisher, and update the table of sponsored content networks to remove a particular sponsored content network, the particular sponsored content network exceeding the metric based on the category to prevent serving of sponsored content items from the particular sponsored content network to the user device.
- Another implementation relates to non-transitory computer-readable storage media storing instructions that are executable by one or more processing devices to perform operations.
- Performing the operations may comprise providing mediation code to a publisher for inclusion in publisher content provided to a user device, the mediation code associated with a table of sponsored content networks, receiving an image of a sponsored content item and a sponsored content network identifier from the user device, analyzing the image of the sponsored content item, the analysis generating extracted image data from the sponsored content item, categorizing the sponsored content item based on the extracted image data and the sponsored content network identifier, receiving an instruction to filter the sponsored content networks exceeding a metric based on a category, the instruction comprising the metric and associated with the publisher, and updating the table of sponsored content networks to remove a particular sponsored content network, the particular sponsored content network exceeding the metric based on the category to prevent serving of sponsored content items from the particular sponsored content network to the user device.
