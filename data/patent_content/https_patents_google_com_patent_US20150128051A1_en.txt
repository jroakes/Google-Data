- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable users to configure delivery of informational events of interest to their computing devices. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein facilitate configuration and delivery of “informational events” based on a plurality of parameters. An “informational event” is an event that presents one or more “informational elements” to the user through the user's computing device, where the informational element is the data being presented. In one example embodiment, a user configures an informational event based on at least three parameters: (1) the type of information that will be displayed (i.e., the “informational element”); (2) the conditions under which the event will happen (i.e., the “trigger event conditions”); and (3) where and how the information will be presented (i.e., the distribution mechanism or “display interface” used to present the event). As such, when all of the configured conditions are met (i.e., once the trigger event conditions are true), the informational element will be presented to the user on the configured display interface (i.e., one of the user's computing devices).
- In some embodiments, the trigger event conditions are configurable based on a plurality of criteria such as, for example, a particular time schedule (e.g., “Mondays at 7 pm”), a current location of the user or the user's computing device (e.g., “at home” or “at work”), and when engaged in an activity (e.g., “running” or “on the bus”). Further, the display interface may be selected from a plurality of display interfaces associated with the user such as, for example, through a particular application on the user's smartphone, or through the user's social media application, through an interface with the user's specific computing device such as their tablet computer or their wearable computing device. As such, the user is able to configure what data they want to receive, precisely under what conditions they want to receive the data, and through what display mechanism they want to receive the data.
- The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) receiving, into the memory from the user of the computing device, content configuration information defining a first informational element; (b) receiving, into the memory from the user of the computing device, trigger event configuration information associated with a trigger event; (c) receiving, into the memory from the user of the computing device, target display interface configuration information defining a target display interface; (d) determining that the trigger event is satisfied based on the trigger event configuration information; (e) automatically retrieving the first informational element based on the content configuration information when the trigger event is satisfied; (f) transmitting the first informational element to the target display interface; (g) receiving trigger event configuration information including a trigger event including of one or more conditions, each of the one or more conditions defining a result that can be determined by the processor; (h) monitoring, by the processor, a status of the first set of one or more conditions; (i) receiving trigger event configuration information wherein the trigger event includes an activity event condition that is satisfied based on when the user is engaged in a first activity; (j) receiving content configuration information including a data source associated with the first informational element, and wherein retrieving the first informational element comprises retrieving the first informational element from the data source; (k) presenting to the user a graphical user interface on the computing device in which the user configures one or more of the content configuration information, the trigger event configuration information, and the target display interface configuration information; (1) presenting to the user, via the graphical user interface, a list including a plurality of target display interfaces; (m) receiving, from the user via the graphical user interface, a selection of a target display interface from the plurality of target display interfaces, the selected target display interface being included in the target display interface configuration information; and (n) defining the first informational element to include web analytics data.
- The following detailed description illustrates embodiments of the disclosure by way of example and not by way of limitation. It is contemplated that the disclosure has general application to displaying informational events to users regardless of the type of computing device used for displaying the informational events.
- As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and proceeded with the word “a” or “an” should be understood as not excluding plural elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited. Furthermore, references to “one embodiment” of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.

In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, a GPS (Global Positioning system) receiver module may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 200, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 200. -
Computing device 200 may also communicate audibly using an audio codec, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information. The audio codec may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of device. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating oncomputing device 200. -
Computing device 200 may be implemented in a number of different forms. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone, or as part of a smart phone, personal digital assistant, a computer tablet, or other similar mobile device. - To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system (e.g., computing device 200) that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- In the example embodiment,
computing device 200 is configured to store informational events that include informational elements from various other computing devices connected tocomputing device 200 through a communication network, and display those informational events on a display interface such asoutput device 214.Computing device 200 is further configured to manage and organize these events using at least one ofmemory 206,storage device 210, andROM 208 using the techniques described herein. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram of auser 302 configuring an exampleinformational event 310 within an informational event presentation system (IEPS) 306 using acomputing device 304 similar to the computing devices shown inFIGS. 1 and 2 . In the example embodiment, theIEPS 306 is executed by a computing device such as, for example,computing device 304, IMS 114 (shown inFIG. 1 ), user access devices 108 (shown inFIG. 1 ), and/or computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ). Theuser 302 configures theinformational event 310 through interaction withIEPS 306. Theinformational event 310 is an event that presents one or more “informational elements” 322 to the user through one of the user's computing device, such ascomputing device 304 or user access devices 108. The computing device used to configure theinformational element 310 may be the same computing device on which the informational element is presented, or a different computing device may be used for presentation of theinformational event 310. - In the example embodiment, the
informational event 310 includes three major configuration elements: content configuration information 320 (i.e., the type of information that will be displayed), trigger event configuration information 330 (i.e., the conditions under which the event will happen), and target display interface configuration information 340 (i.e., the distribution mechanism or the “where and how” theinformational element 322 will be presented). -
Content configuration information 320, in the example embodiment, includes at least oneinformational element 322 that describes the information to be displayed during theinformational event 310. Theinformational element 322 may include reference to one or moreexternal data sources 324 such as, for example, a publicly accessible web site from a web server such as web server 112 (shown inFIG. 1 ), or adatabase server 118 that provides access to data of interest through, for example, an API, or an information service system (IMS) server 116 (shown inFIG. 1 ) that provides customized informational elements forusers 302 of the IMS 114 (shown inFIG. 1 ). Further, theinformational element 322 and/or thecontent configuration information 320 may enable content “scraping” from the variousexternal data sources 324. In other words, the content retrieved fromdata sources 324, when first retrieved by computingdevice 304, may initially contain a superset of data of which only a subset is desired to be viewed by the user (i.e., only a portion of the data may be “scraped” from the full content and presented as the informational element 322). In some embodiments,content configuration information 320 may include content from other devices belonging to the user, such as, for example, GPS location, images, or acceleration from a mobile computing device. Further,content configuration information 320 may include informational elements that may be computed, such as time and public holidays. In other embodiments,content configuration information 320 may include statistical data from, for example, web analytics tools, such as providing advertisement data. - In some embodiments,
IEPS 306 performs data gathering functions of theinformational element 322. In other embodiments, theserver 116 of a client-server based system, such as shown in theenvironment 100 shown inFIG. 1 , may perform the data gathering functions necessary forinformational element 322. In still other embodiments, multipleinformational elements 322 may be present within a single informational event 310 (i.e., when theinformational event 310 occurs, theuser 302 receives multiple elements of data, perhaps even from multiple sources). - Trigger
event configuration information 330, in the example embodiment, includes one or moretrigger event conditions 332. Thetrigger event conditions 332 generally describe the conditions that will cause theinformational event 310 to occur (i.e., the conditions that will cause theinformational element 322 to be displayed to the user 302). In the example embodiment, theuser 302 selects one or moretrigger event conditions 332 from a list of available types of conditions. The list of condition types may include, for example, a time of day, or one or more ranges of time, and referencing, for example, specific dates, or days of the week, or every day, or days of the month, such as “at 7:00 pm on Mondays” or “every day after 7:00 pm”. - In the example embodiment, the list of condition types also includes a travel mode of the
user 302 and/or a mobile computing device associated with the user, such as through collection of geo-location data associated with the user and/or computing device, or through inference based on use of various computing devices. For example, geo-location data may be collected from a global positioning system (GPS) associated with a mobile computing device, and a travel mode condition may include conditional data such as “currently at work”, or “currently commuting”, or “currently walking/jogging”. The travel mode may include data based on estimated starting and/or ending locations, such as “currently commuting from work to home”, which may be inferred through historical data correlated with recent data from, for example, a GPS of the user's 302 mobile computing device. As used herein, the term “travel mode” may include not only information associated with users in transit, but may also refer to locational positions of users. For example, theuser 302 may configure aninformational event 310 to include a grocery store list of needed items when the user is in close proximity to the selected grocery store. As such, a present locational position from a mobile computing device's GPS system may be correlated with a GPS location of a grocery store, and thus the “travel mode” may alert “when near grocery store” (e.g., when within a pre-determined threshold distance from grocery store's GPS location). - The list of condition types, in the example embodiment, also includes an activity condition associated with the
user 302 and/or one or more of thecomputing devices informational event 310. For example, theuser 302 may wear or otherwise carry a mobile computing device that has access to vital statistics of theuser 302, such as heart rate. As such, an activity condition may be based on the heart rate or other vital statistics of the user 302 (e.g., the activity of “exercising” may be configured to be true when heart rate is over a pre-determined threshold). - In some embodiments, conditions may also include external events and/or information-based events such as, for example, if a stock price of a stock in the user's investment portfolio moves by a pre-determined amount, or if the number of visitors to the user's website suddenly decreases. Some external events/information-based events of others may trigger events of the user. For example, if the user is socially connected to a friend, the user may configure and receive alerts when that friend arrives at a location or replies to an invitation. Additionally, the events may be configured to target a preferred display forum of the user. For example, if the user's stock changes more than a pre-determined amount, the user may want to receive notification through their wearable computing device, but if a friend replies to an invitation, the user may want to receive the notification via and email update.
- In the example embodiment,
trigger event conditions 332 are truth evaluated to determine whether and whenIEPS 306 presents theinformational event 310 to the user 302 (i.e., wheninformational event 310 “occurs”). For example, a time-basedtrigger event condition 332 of “at 7:00 pm on Mondays” is evaluated as “true” during one minute on each Monday of the week (i.e., between 7:00:00 pm and 7:00:59 pm on every Monday), and otherwise evaluates to “false”. A travel mode-basedtrigger event condition 332 such as, for example, “currently at work” or “currently walking”, is evaluated as “true” at the specific times when, for example, the user's mobile computing device is detected and evaluated as in that state. - In some embodiments, the
trigger event conditions 332 may be subject toBoolean logic 334 in order to determine a single truth value for one or moretrigger event conditions 332. For example, in some embodiments, theuser 302 may configure a singletrigger event condition 332 as negated byBoolean logic 334, such as “not” “currently at work” (i.e., the informational event would occur once the condition “currently at work” is not true, or in other words, is false). In some embodiments,multiple trigger events 332 may be combined together withBoolean logic 334. For example, theuser 302 may wish to receive theinformational element 322 during his evening commute from work to home, but the information may only be available after 7 pm. As such, theuser 302 may configure two trigger events and combine them together, such as “after 7:00 pm” “and” “currently commuting”, where the “and” represents theBoolean logic 334 used to combine multiple truth values into a single truth value for the entire informational event. As such, triggerevents 332 may be combined usingBoolean logic 334 using logical operators commonly known in the art. - Target display
interface configuration information 340, in the example embodiment, includes a list of available display interfaces 342 in which theinformational event 310 may be presented to the user 302 (i.e., display mediums in which theinformational element 322 may be presented). The list ofdisplay interfaces 342, in some embodiments, includesspecific computing devices 304 and/or 344 associated with theuser 302. For example, theuser 302 may be associated with a desktop computer and/or several portable computing devices, such as a smartphone and a laptop, a tablet computing device, and/or a wearable computing device (e.g., computer glasses). In other embodiments, the list of display interfaces 342 includes display interfaces that are not device-specific (i.e., that are not necessarily associated with a specific computing device). For example, the list ofdisplay interfaces 342 may include display interfaces such as an email address (e.g., the user may receive an email as the “display” of informational element 322), a social media site (i.e., the user may receive theinformational element 322 through their social media account), or a messaging service (i.e., the user may receive a text message through, for example, a cellphone). Alternatively, any such display interface that enables the systems and methods described herein may be used. - In some embodiments, a graphical user interface is presented to the
user 302 on a computing device such ascomputing device 304. The user configuresinformational event 310 through use of the graphical user interface. In some embodiments, theuser 302 is presented with a list including a plurality of target display interfaces, and theuser 302 selects, by the user via the graphical user interface, a target display interface from the plurality of target display interfaces. The selected target display interface is thereby included in the target display interface configuration information. - During configuration, in some embodiments, the
user 302 configures an informational event such asinformational event 310. More specifically, theuser 302 configures: (1)content configuration information 320 including at least oneinformational element 322; (2) triggerevent configuration information 330 including one ormore trigger events 332 and optionallyBoolean logic 334; and (3) a selection of one or more display interfaces from the list of available display interfaces 342. In some embodiments, configuration information forinformational event 310 may be stored on one or more personal computing devices of theuser 302, such ascomputing device 304 and/or 344. In other embodiments, configuration information forinformational event 310 may be centrally stored by a server system such as IMS 114 (shown inFIG. 1 ). Alternatively, any such architecture that enables the systems and methods described herein may be used. - During operation, the
IEPS 306 monitors the truth value of thetrigger event conditions 332 associated with theinformational event 310. Upon occurrence of the informational event (i.e., when the trigger event configuration information is satisfied), theinformational element 322 is displayed to one or more of the selected display interfaces 344. In some embodiments, at the time the trigger event configuration information is satisfied (i.e., at the time theinformational event 310 occurs), theinformational element 322 may be populated with outside data fromdata sources 324 prior to presentation to theuser 302. - In some embodiments, one or more of the user's 302
computing devices 304 and/or 344 are programmed to manageinformational event 310, and may also be configured as one of the target display interfaces of the list of available display interfaces 342. In other embodiments, such as in networked environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ), configuration information forinformational events 310 may be stored and/or otherwise managed, in a client-server fashion, using a centralized server system such as IMS 114 (shown inFIG. 1 ). As such, trigger event configuration information may be monitored and/or evaluated, including the collection and analysis of data used by thetrigger events 332, by either the user'scomputing devices 304 and/or 344 orIMS 114. - In some embodiments, the various functions of
IEPS 306 may be performed by a single computing device, such as user access device 108 orcomputing device 304. In other embodiments, the various functions ofIEPS 306 may be performed by multiple computing devices. For example, in one embodiment, theuser 302 may have a desktop computing device such ascomputing device 304 from which they configureinformational events 310. The informational events may be stored on and/or monitored byIMS 114, and the informational event may be displayed on a mobile computing device such as user access device 108. - In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
