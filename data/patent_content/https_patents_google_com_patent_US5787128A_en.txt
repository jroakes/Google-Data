- TDMA time-division-multiple-access
- TDMA cellular telephone system is specified in TIA/EIA Interim Standard IS-54, published by and available from the EIA Engineering Publications Office, 2001 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006 (hereinafter the "EIA/TIA Interim Standard IS-54").
- EIA/TIA Interim Standard IS-54 is incorporated herein by reference.
- communication systems typically comprise a plurality of communication units, a predetermined number of base stations (or repeaters) located throughout a geographic region and a controller.
- the communication units may be vehicle mounted or portable units.
- the communication units and the base stations each comprise a transmitter, a receiver or both a transmitter and a receiver to form a transceiver.
- the communication units communicate with the base stations over a communication channel over which modulated signals, such as radio frequency (RF) signals, are transmitted and/or received.
- the controller typically comprises a centralized call processing unit or a network of distributed controllers working together to establish communication paths for the communication units in the communication system.
- the receiver includes, inter alia, a demodulator, a sampler, a memory unit, a correlator and a detector.
- a receiver in the communication unit receives a modulated signal on the communication channel to produce a received signal subsequent to transmission of the modulated signal by a transmitter of a base station.
- the demodulator demodulates the modulated signal to produce a demodulated signal.
- the sampler samples the demodulated signal at multiple points in time to produce a sampled signal.
- the memory unit stores a reference signal. Both the modulated signal and the reference signal are complex signals represented by real and imaginary components.
- the correlator correlates, at the multiple points in time, the sampled signal with the reference signal to produce a complex correlation signal.
- the complex correlation signal is used to determine an optimum sampling point for synchronization, signal recovery and channel sounding, for example.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of a conventional linear complex signal correlator 900 for correlating a received signal 901 with a reference signal 902 to produce the complex correlation signal 903.
- the conventional linear complex signal correlator 900 generally includes fourteen delay elements 904-918 (904-6 and 918 are shown), fourteen taps 919-933 (919-921 and 933 are shown), and one complex summer 934.
- the conventional linear complex signal correlator 900 is implemented as a complex finite impulse response (FIR) filter as shown in FIG. 9.
- the number of taps are equal to the number of samples in the sync word of the sampled signal 901.
- Complex correlators that correlate a received signal with a reference signal using both the magnitude component and the phase component are known as linear correlators.
- the conventional linear complex signal correlator 900 performs four multiplication operations 935-938 and two addition operations 940 and 941 per tap. Equations EQ-1, EQ-2 and EQ-3 define the operation of the conventional linear complex signal correlator 900.
- Cn is the complex correlation signal
- S(n) is the reference signal
- Rx(n) is the sampled signal
- "k" is an index
- "*" denotes a complex conjugate.
- Both the sampled signal and the reference signal are complex signals having real and imaginary components.
- the real component of the complex signal is represented by the magnitude of the In-phase (I) component.
- the imaginary component of the complex signal is represented by the magnitude of the Quadrature (Q) component.
- the I and Q components together represent the amplitude and phase of the complex signal. Therefore, complex correlation is performed by treating the I and Q components as a complex number with the magnitude of the I component representing the real part of the signal and the magnitude of the Q component as the imaginary part of the signal.
- DQPSK Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
- the complex correlation signal for each index "k” has four multiply operations and two add operations. These correspond to the four multipliers 935-938 and two adders 939 and 940 for each tap 919-933 as shown in FIG. 9.
- the conventional linear complex signal correlator 900 as shown in FIG. 9 and described in EQ-3 needs approximately 27,000 Motorola Standard Cell Gates to implement the four multipliers 935-939 for each tap 919-933.
- the current drain for these 27,000 gates is calculated according to EQ-4.

- the nonlinear signal correlator 129 correlates the received signal 123 with the reference signal 128 by adding the phase component of the received signal 123 and the phase component of the reference signal 128, as performed in the present invention, rather than by multiplying the received signal 901 with the reference signal 902 (see FIG. 9), as performed in the prior art.

If the particular received signal vector representing the demodulated I and Q signals 125a is less than the unity circle, the demodulated signal will be lengthened to signal 125-L.

- a predetermined number of the plurality of taps 401-414 correspond to a predetermined number of symbols 321-334 (FIG. 3) in the reference signal 128. Therefore, the number of taps in this case is fourteen.

- the plurality of absolute value determiners 447-460 were not used.
- the second feature is now explained.

- the plurality of taps 401-414 are adapted to delay the received signal 123 at multiple points in time.
- the predetermined number of the plurality of taps 401-414 corresponds to the predetermined number of symbols in the reference signal 128.
- the plurality of adders 416-429 are operatively coupled to the plurality of taps 401-414, respectively, and adapted to add the phase component of the received signal 123 and the phase component of the reference signal 128 at the multiple points in time to produce samples of the complex correlation signal 462-475.

- the multiplication of the magnitudes of the received signal Rx(kT) and reference signal S(kT) should be unity for a ⁇ /4 DQPSK modulation system since under ideal conditions the received signal should fall on the unity circle.
- Timing offsets, frequency offset, noise, delay spread and fading are some of the contributors to the distortion of the received signal.
- the remainder of EQ-5 is just the addition of the phases of the two signals as shown below in EQ-6:
- each correlation step has just one adder as opposed to the four multipliers 935-938 and two adders 939 and 940 (FIG. 9).
- FIG. 4 shows the preferred implementation of a reduced complexity nonlinear signal correlator using adders 416-429.
- the nonlinear signal correlator 129 of the present invention adds the phases of the received signal 123 Rx(kT) and the reference signal 128 S(kT) to provide a substantially equivalent complex correlation step as that shown in EQ-5 by the prior art.
- This interpolation/extrapolation operation is justified due to the ⁇ /4 DQPSK modulation scheme implemented as well recognizing that the majority of information encoded is in the phase of the received signal 123.
- the nulled signal power received from a fading channel does not contribute to the correlation peak magnitude to the extent apparent in the conventional linear complex correlation method. Therefore, the normalizing operations are eliminated which also reduces the hardware required and thereby reducing current drain.
- the number of Motorola Standard Cell Gates needed to implement the nonlinear signal correlator 129 as shown in FIG. 4 in hardware is 1,260 gates resulting in a current drain of less than 1 mA from EQ-4 (4 * 1260 gates * 0.1944 MHz ⁇ -1 mA).
- the steps of correlating using the nonlinear correlator 129 are primarily performed by adding the phases of the complex signals rather than by multiplying the complex signals.
- the nonlinear correlator 129 using simple binary adders to implement a hardware signal correlator is much less complex and uses much less current than the linear correlator 900 of the prior art using multipliers and adders. This required realization that the correlation does not require all of the information of the received signal 123.
- By interpolating/extrapolating the magnitude of the correlation samples the entire complex correlation operation is reduced to the addition of the phases of the received signal 123 and the reference signal 128.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a flowchart 550 describing the operation of the nonlinear complex signal correlator 129 of FIGS. 1 and 4.
- the flowchart 550 describes a method for correlating the received signal 123 with the reference signal 128 to produce a positive unbiased complex correlation signal 476.
- the received signal 123 and the reference signal 128 are complex signals each represented by a magnitude component and a phase component.
- the method begins.
- the magnitude component of the received signal 123 is limited.
- the step 552 of limiting is accomplished by setting the magnitude component of the received signal 123 equal to a value of one
- the step 552 of limiting may be accomplished by ignoring the magnitude component of the received signal 123.
- the phase component of the received signal 123 and the phase component of the reference signal 128 are added at multiple points in time to produce samples of the complex correlation signal 462-475.
- the multiple points in time correspond to a predetermined number of symbols in the reference signal 128.
- step 554 the samples of the complex correlation signal 462-475 are summed to produce a complex correlation signal 131.
- a bias 505 of the complex correlation signal 131 is determined.
- the bias is a mean value 505.
- the step 555 of determining the mean value 505 of the complex correlation signal 131 is accomplished by averaging the complex correlation signal 131 over a predetermined number of symbols 432 in the reference signal 128.
- the bias 505 from each of the samples of the complex correlation signal 462-475 is removed to produce unbiased samples of the complex correlation signal 477-490.
- the bias 505 is removed by subtracting 433-446 the mean value 505 from each of the samples of the complex correlation signal 462-475.
- an absolute value 447-460 of each of the unbiased samples of the complex correlation signal 477-490 is determined to produce positive unbiased samples of the complex correlation signal 491-504.
- step 558 the positive unbiased samples of the complex correlation signal 491-504 are summed to produce the positive unbiased complex correlation signal 476.
- FIGS. 6 and 7 are described together to present practical performance measurements of the nonlinear correlator 129 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a graph of false rate versus signal to noise ratio at one symbol delay, for example, for the nonlinear complex signal correlator of FIG. 4 and a conventional linear complex signal correlator of FIG. 9.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a graph of miss rate versus signal to noise ratio at one symbol delay, for example, for the nonlinear complex signal correlator of FIG. 4 and the conventional linear complex signal correlator of FIG. 9.
- Signal correlator performance is rated by false rate and miss rate.
- False rate is the ratio of false sync word detects to the total number of slots.
- the miss rate is the number of correlator peaks below a predetermined threshold and is related to the "dropping" of sync.
- the performance of the nonlinear correlator of the present invention is shown in comparison with the conventional linear complex correlator with normalization in FIGS. 6 and 7. The data gathered for each point shown in a graph is over a minimum of 3000 time slots.
- Correlator performance is related to fixed point precision.
- Fixed point precision is the number of binary digits (bits) required to represent a given number.
- a symbol delay is a channel model which is the result of the transmitted signal path having 2 rays; where one of the rays is delayed by one symbol relative to the other transmitted ray, and where both rays are combined at the receiver to produce a received signal which has inter symbol.
- the linear correlator falsing rate is 3 to 5 dB better than the nonlinear correlator for static and delay spread channels for the higher precision of 10 and 12 bits as seen in FIGS. 6 and 7. Under fading channel conditions, the linear correlator only performs better with 12 bits of precision, otherwise, the nonlinear correlator performs better independent of the precision as seen in FIG. 7.
- miss rate is almost identical for both correlators in all conditions and fixed point precisions. It is of interest to note that the false rate is more sensitive to reduction in precision than the miss rate. All miss rate curves are grouped in a small area while the false rate curves fluctuate throughout the graph dependent upon the fixed point precision.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a plot of magnitude 801 versus time 802 for a plurality of complex correlation signals 806-836 generated by the nonlinear complex signal correlator 129 of FIG. 4 and adapted for use with the TDMA cellular telephone 100 of FIG. 1.
- An optimum point in time 837 for sampling the received signal 123 is determined by illustration in FIG. 8.
- the received signal 123 and a reference signal 128 are complex signals each represented by a magnitude component and a phase component.
- a method for determining an optimum point in time 837 comprises the steps of repeating the steps 553 through 558 of FIG. 5 for a predetermined period of time 805 to produce a plurality of complex correlation signals 806-836.
- a desired complex correlation signal 821 is determined from among the plurality of complex correlation signals 806-836. When the desired complex correlation signal 821 is favorable, the point in time 837 corresponding to the desired complex correlation signal 821 is selected. When the desired complex correlation signal 821 is unfavorable, the point in time 837 corresponding to the desired complex correlation signal 821 is disregarded.
- the step of determining the desired complex correlation signal 821 further comprising the steps of comparing the plurality of complex correlation signals 806-836 to one other; and determining the desired complex correlation signal 821 as the complex correlation signal having a minimum value 804 from among the plurality of complex correlation signals 806-836 responsive to the step of comparing.
- the desired complex correlation signal 821 is determined to be favorable when the desired complex correlation signal 821 is less than a predetermined threshold 803; and the desired complex correlation signal 821 is determined to be unfavorable when the desired complex correlation signal 821 is greater or equal to the predetermined threshold value 803.
- the nonlinear signal correlator of the present invention advantageously substitutes one adder per tap as shown in FIG. 4 for the four multipliers and two adders per tap needed in the prior art complex signal correlators as shown in FIG. 9.
- This substitution significantly reduces the complexity of the nonlinear signal correlator 129 of the present invention over prior art linear complex signal correlators by approximately 95% which yields a current drain savings of about 20 mA.
- the significant complexity reduction results in a lower parts count which reduces cost, space and current drain of the nonlinear complex signal correlator.
- the complexity reduction is accomplished by recognizing that correlation does not require all of the information of the received signal 123.
