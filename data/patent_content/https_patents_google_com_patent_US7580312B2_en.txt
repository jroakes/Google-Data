- Row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index.
- the stored row address bit 14 may again used with bank address bit 2 to form the four DRAM chip select signals.
- address may be mapped between four 1 Gb DRAM circuits 206 A-D that simulate a single 4 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing the buffer chip 202 .
- There may be 16 row address bits from the system 204 such that row address bits 0 through 14 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 204 such that bank address bits 0 through 3 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- row address bits 14 and 15 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 206 A-D. Row address bits 14 and 15 may also be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index. During the column operation, the stored row address bits 14 and 15 may again be used to form the four DRAM chip select signals.
- this mapping technique may optionally be used to ensure that there are no unnecessary combinational logic circuits in the critical timing path between the address input pins and address output pins of the buffer chip 202 .
- Such combinational logic circuits may instead be used to generate the individual chip select signals. This may therefore allow the capacitive loading on the address outputs of the buffer chip 202 to be much higher than the loading on the individual chip select signal outputs of the buffer chip 202 .
- the address mapping may be performed by the buffer chip 202 using some of the bank address signals from the memory controller to generate the individual chip select signals.
- the buffer chip 202 may store the higher order row address bits during a row operation using the bank address as the index, and then may use the stored address bits as part of the DRAM circuit bank address during a column operation.
- This address mapping technique may require an optional lookup table to be positioned in the critical timing path between the address inputs from the memory controller and the address outputs, to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack.
- addresses may be mapped between four 512 Mb DRAM circuits 206 A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM utilizing the buffer chip 202 .
- There may be 15 row address bits from the system 204 , where row address bits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 204 , such that bank address bit 0 is used as a DRAM circuit bank address bit for the DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- row address bit 14 may be used as an additional DRAM circuit bank address bit.
- the bank address bits 1 and 2 from the system may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 206 A-D.
- row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation.
- the stored row address bit 14 may again be used along with the bank address bit 0 from the system to form the DRAM circuit bank address.
- the column address from the memory controller may be mapped directly as the column address to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack. Specifically, this direct mapping may be performed since each of the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack, even if of the same width but different capacities (e.g. from 512 Gb to 4 Gb), may have the same page sizes.
- address A[ 10 ] may be used by the memory controller to enable or disable auto-precharge during a column operation. Therefore, the buffer chip 202 may forward A[ 10 ] from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits 206 A-D in the stack without any modifications during a column operation.
- the simulated DRAM circuit may be desirable to determine whether the simulated DRAM circuit behaves according to a desired DRAM standard or other design specification.
- a behavior of many DRAM circuits is specified by the JEDEC standards and it may be desirable, in some embodiments, to exactly simulate a particular JEDEC standard DRAM.
- the JEDEC standard defines control signals that a DRAM circuit must accept and the behavior of the DRAM circuit as a result of such control signals.
- the JEDEC specification for a DDR2 DRAM is known as JESD79-2B.
- the following algorithm may be used. Such algorithm checks, using a set of software verification tools for formal verification of logic, that protocol behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit is the same as a desired standard or other design specification. This formal verification is quite feasible because the DRAM protocol described in a DRAM standard is typically limited to a few control signals (e.g. approximately 15 control signals in the case of the JEDEC DDR2 specification, for example).
- Examples of the aforementioned software verification tools include MAGELLAN supplied by SYNOPSYS, or other software verification tools, such as INCISIVE supplied by CADENCE, verification tools supplied by JASPER, VERIX supplied by REAL INTENT, 0-IN supplied by MENTOR CORPORATION, and others. These software verification tools use written assertions that correspond to the rules established by the DRAM protocol and specification. These written assertions are further included in the code that forms the logic description for the buffer chip. By writing assertions that correspond to the desired behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit, a proof may be constructed that determines whether the desired design requirements are met. In this way, one may test various embodiments for compliance with a standard, multiple standards, or other design specification.
- an assertion may be written that no two DRAM control signals are allowed to be issued to an address, control and clock bus at the same time.
- the aforementioned algorithm may allow a designer to prove that the simulated DRAM circuit exactly meets the required standard or other design specification. If, for example, an address mapping that uses a common bus for data and a common bus for address results in a control and clock bus that does not meet a required specification, alternative designs for buffer chips with other bus arrangements or alternative designs for the interconnect between the buffer chips may be used and tested for compliance with the desired standard or other design specification.
- FIG. 3 shows a high capacity DIMM 300 using buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 , in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the high capacity DIMM 300 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1 and/or 2 A-F. Of course, however, the high capacity DIMM 300 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a high capacity DIMM 300 may be created utilizing buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 .
- a DIMM 300 may utilize a plurality of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 instead of individual DRAM circuits, thus increasing the capacity of the DIMM.
- the DIMM 300 may include a register 304 for address and operation control of each of the buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 . It should be noted that any desired number of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 302 may be utilized in conjunction with the DIMM 300 . Therefore, the configuration of the DIMM 300 , as shown, should not be construed as limiting in any way.
- the register 304 may be substituted with an AMB (not shown), in the context of an FB-DIMM.
- FIG. 4 shows a timing design 400 of a buffer chip that makes a buffered stack of DRAM circuits mimic longer CAS latency DRAM to a memory controller, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the design of the buffer chip may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-3 .
- the design of the buffer chip may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- any delay through a buffer chip may be made transparent to a memory controller of a host system (e.g. see the host system 204 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.) utilizing the buffer chip.
- the buffer chip may buffer a stack of DRAM circuits such that the buffered stack of DRAM circuits appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency.
- Such delay may be a result of the buffer chip being located electrically between the memory bus of the hoist system and the stacked DRAM circuits, since most or all of the signals that connect the memory bus to the DRAM circuits pass through the buffer chip. A finite of time may therefore be needed for these signals to traverse through the buffer chip.
- industry standard protocols for memory e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.
- DDR SDRAM register chips and advanced memory buffers
- Industry standard protocols for memory e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.
- Such industry standard protocols define the properties of a register chip and AMB but not the properties of the buffer chip 202 , etc. Thus, the signal delay through the buffer chip may violate the specifications of industry standard protocols.
- the buffer chip may provide a one-half clock cycle delay between the buffer chip receiving address and control signals from the memory controller (or optionally from a register chip, an AMB, etc.) and the address and control signals being valid at the inputs of the stacked DRAM circuits.
- the data signals may also have a one-half clock cycle delay in traversing the buffer chip, either from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits or from the DRAM circuits to the memory controller.
- the one-half clock cycle delay set forth above is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner whatsoever.
- a one clock cycle delay, a multiple clock cycle delay (or fraction thereof), and/or any other delay amount is incorporated, for that matter.
- the aforementioned delay may be coordinated among multiple signals such that different signals are subject to time-shifting with different relative directions/magnitudes, in an organized fashion.
- the cumulative delay through the buffer chip (e.g. the sum of a first delay 402 of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and a second delay 404 of the data signals through the buffer chip) is j clock cycles.
- the buffer chips may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency 408 of i+j clocks, where i is the native CAS latency of the DRAM circuits.
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 5 (i.e. 4+1).
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 6 (i.e. 4+2).
- FIG. 5 shows the write data timing 500 expected by a DRAM circuit in a buffered stack, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the write data timing 500 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-4 . Of course, however, the write data timing 500 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- Designing a buffer chip (e.g. see the buffer chip 202 of FIGS. 2A-2E , etc.) so that a buffered stack appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency may, in some embodiments, create a problem with the timing of write operations.
- the DDR2 SDRAM protocol may specify that the write CAS latency is one less that the read CAS latency. Therefore, since the buffered stack appears as a DDR2 SDRAM with a read CAS latency of 6, the memory controller may use a write CAS latency of 5 (see 502 ) when scheduling a write operation to the buffered stack.
- the DRAM circuits may require a write CAS latency of 3 (see 504 ).
- the write data from the memory controller may arrive at the buffer chip later than when the DRAM circuits require the data.
- the buffer chip may delay such write operations to alleviate any of such timing problems. Such delay in write operations will be described in more detail with respect to FIG. 6 below.
- FIG. 6 shows write operations 600 delayed by a buffer chip, in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the write operations 600 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-5 .
- the write operations 600 may be used in any desired environment.
- the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a buffer chip may provide an additional delay, over and beyond the delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip, between receiving the write operation and address from the memory controller (and/or optionally from a register and/or AMB, etc.), and sending it to the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- the additional delay may be equal to j clocks, where j is the cumulative delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and the delay of the data signals through the buffer chip.
- the write address and operation may be delayed by a register chip on a DIMM, by an AMB, or by the memory controller.
- FIG. 7 shows early write data 700 from an AMB, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the early write data 700 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-5 .
- the early write data 700 may be used in an desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- an AMB on an FB-DIMM may be designed to send write data earlier to buffered stacks instead of delaying the write address and operation, as described in reference to FIG. 6 .
- an early write latency 702 may be utilized to send the write data to the buffered stack.
- correct timing of the write operation at the inputs of the DRAM circuits in the stack may be ensured.
- a buffer chip (e.g. see the buffer chip 202 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.) may have a cumulative latency of 2, in which case, the AMB may send the write data 2 clock cycles earlier to the buffered stack. It should be noted that this scheme may not be possible in the case of registered DIMMs since the memory controller sends the write data directly to the buffered stacks. As an option, a memory controller may be designed to send write data earlier so that write operations have the correct timing at the input of the DRAM circuits in the stack without requiring the buffer chip to delay the write address and operation.
- FIG. 8 shows address bus conflicts 800 caused by delayed write operations, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the delaying of the write address and operations may be performed by a buffer chip, or optionally a register, AMB, etc., in a manner that is completely transparent to the memory controller of a host system.
- the memory controller since the memory controller is unaware of this delay, it may schedule subsequent operations, such as for example activate or precharge operations, which may collide with the delayed writes on the address bus from the buffer chip to the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- an activate operations 802 may interfere with a write operation 804 that has been delayed.
- a delay of activate operations may be employed, as will be described in further detail with respect to FIG. 9 .
- FIGS. 9A-B show variable delays 900 and 950 of operations through a buffer chip, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the variable delay 900 and 950 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-8 .
- the variable delays 900 and 950 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should be also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- either the write operation or the precharge/activate operation may be delayed.
- a buffer chip e.g. see the buffer chip 202 of FIGS. 2A-E , etc.

- the memory controller may schedule a column operation to a bank 6 clock cycles after an activate (e.g. row) operation to the same bank.
- the DRAM circuits in the stack may actually have a tRCD of 4 clock cycles.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay the activate operation by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack while still ensuring correct read and write timing on the channel between the memory controller and the buffered stack.
- the buffer chip may issue the activate operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the activate operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay of the activate operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of other DRAM operations that may conflict with the activate operation, and may optionally change from one active operation to another.
- the buffered stack may appear to the memory controller as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with a tRP of 6 clock cycles, the memory controller may schedule a subsequent activate (e.g. row) operation to a bank a minimum of 6 clock cycles after issuing a precharge operation to that bank.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay issuing the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits in the stack by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack. In address, even if there are no conflicts on the address bus, the buffer chip may still delay issuing a precharge operation in order to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- the precharge operation to the same bank may be delayed by the buffer chip to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- the buffer chip may issue to precharge operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the precharge operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay of the precharge operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of address bus conflicts or tRAS violations, and may change from one precharge operation to another.
- FIG. 10 shows a buffered stack 1000 of four 512 Mb DRAM circuits mapped to a single 2 Gb DRAM circuit, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the buffered stack 1000 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 1-9 .
- the buffered stack 1000 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- the multiple DRAM circuits 1002 A-D buffered in the stack by the buffer chip 1004 may appear as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit to the memory controller.
- the combined power dissipation of such DRAM circuits 1002 A-D may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic DRAM of the same capacity.
- the buffered stack may consist of four 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits that appear to the memory controller as a single 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit.
- the power dissipation of all four DRAM circuits 1002 A-D in the stack may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM.
- a DIMM containing multiple buffered stacks may dissipate much more power than a standard DIMM built using monolithic DRAM circuits. This increased power dissipation may limit the widespread adoption of DIMMs that use buffered stacks.
- the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D may be opportunistically placed in a precharge power down mode using the clock enable (CKE) pin of the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D.
- CKE clock enable
- a single rank registered DIMM R-DIMM
- a 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM may generally have eight banks as specified by JEDEC. Therefore, the buffer chip 1004 may map each 512 Mb DRAM circuit in the stack to two banks of the equivalent 2 Gb DRAM, as shown.
- the memory controller of the host system may open and close pages in the banks of the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D based on the memory requests it receives from the rest of the system.
- no more than one page may be able to be open in a bank at any given time.
- a DRAM circuit 1002 A-D since each DRAM circuit 1002 A-D in the stack is mapped to two banks of the equivalent larger DRAM, at any given time a DRAM circuit 1002 A-D may have two open pages, one open page, or no open pages.
- the power management scheme may place that DRAM circuit 1002 A-D in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- the CKE inputs of the DRAM circuits 1002 A-D in a stack may be controlled by the buffer chip 1004 , by a chip on a R-DIMM, by an AMB on a FB-DIMM, or by the memory controller in order to implement the power management scheme described hereinabove.
- this power management scheme may be particularly efficient when the memory controller implements a closed page policy.
- Another optional power management scheme may include mapping a plurality of DRAM circuits to a single bank of the larger capacity DRAM seen by the memory controller. For example, a buffered stack of sixteen ⁇ 4 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may appear to the memory controller as a single ⁇ 4 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit. Since a 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit is specified by JEDEC to have eight banks, each bank of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be 512 Mb. Thus, two of the 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may be mapped by the buffer chip 1004 to a single bank of the equivalent 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit seen by the memory controller.
- bank 0 of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be mapped by the buffer chip to two 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits (e.g. DRAM A and DRAM B) in the stack.
- DRAM A and DRAM B 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits
- DRAM B may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- DRAM A may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- This technique may ensure that if p DRAM circuits are mapped to a bank of the larger capacity DRAM circuit seen by the memory controller, then p-l of the p DRAM circuits may continuously (e.g. always, etc.) be subjected to a power saving operation.
- the power saving operation may, for example, comprise operating in precharge power down mode except when refresh is required.
- power-savings may also occur in other embodiments without such continuity.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a method 1100 for refreshing a plurality of memory circuits, in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the method 1100 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of any one or more of FIGS. 1-10 .
- the method 1100 may be carried out by the interface circuit 102 of FIG. 1 .
- the method 1100 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a refresh control signal is received in operation 1102 .
- such refresh control signal may, for example, for example, be received from a memory controller, where such memory controller intends to refresh a simulated memory circuit(s).
- a plurality of refresh control signals are sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. see the memory circuits 104 A, 104 B, 104 N of FIG. 1 , etc.) at different times. See operation 1104 .
- Such refresh control signals may or may not each include the refresh control signal of operation 1102 or an instantiation/copy thereof.
- the refresh control signals may each include refresh control signals that are different in at least one aspect (e.g. format, content, etc.).
- At least one first refresh control signal may be sent to a first subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a first time and at least one second refresh control signal may be sent to a second subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a second time.
- a single refresh control signal may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. a group of memory circuits, etc.).
- a plurality of the refresh control signals may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits.
- refresh control signals may be sent individually or to groups of memory circuits, as desired.
- the refresh control signals may be sent after a delay in accordance with a particular timing.
- the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to minimize a current draw. This may be accomplished in various embodiments by staggering a plurality of refresh control signals.
- the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to comply with a tRFC parameter associated with each of the memory circuits.
- DRAM circuits of any desired size may receive periodic refresh operations to maintain the integrity of data therein.
- a memory controller may initiate refresh operations by issuing refresh control signals to the DRAM circuits with sufficient frequency to prevent any loss of data in the DRAM circuits.
- a refresh control signal is issued to a DRAM circuit, a minimum time (e.g. denoted by tRFC) may be required to elapse before another control signal may be issued to that DRAM circuit.
- the tRFC parameter may therefore increase as the size of the DRAM circuit increases.
- the buffer chip When the buffer chip receives a refresh control signal from the memory controller, it may refresh the smaller DRAM circuits within the space or time specified by the tRFC associated with the emulated DRAM circuit. Since the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits is larger than that of the smaller DRAM circuits, it may not be necessary to issue refresh control signals to all of the smaller DRAM circuits simultaneously. Refresh control signals may be issued separately to individual DRAM circuits or may be issued to groups of DRAM circuits, provided that the tRFC requirement of the smaller DRAM circuits is satisfied by the time the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits has elapsed. In use, the refreshes may be spaced to minimize the peak current draw of the combination buffer chip and DRAM circuit set during a refresh operation.
