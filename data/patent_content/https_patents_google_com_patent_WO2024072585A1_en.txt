[0051] The internet can provide a plethora of resources on a variety of topics. A user may be viewing and/or reading information provided on a topic. Additional information on the topic may be relevant to a user. The relevant information may be unknown to the user
and/or may be desired by the user; however, the user may not obtain the information until later due to additional search hurdle. The systems and methods disclosed herein can automatically process displayed content to determine the relevant additional content that can be suggested to the user.
[0052] Additionally and/or alternatively, the information may be out-of-date and/or may not be the most reliable information. The systems and methods disclosed herein can determine an entity (e.g., a topic, an author, a publisher, and/or a field of knowledge associated with a topic of the displayed content) associated with a displayed content item and can determine more recent and/or more reliable information on the particular entity to be suggested to the user.
[0053] Alternatively and/or additionally, a user may want to better understand the information and/or interact with the information; however, the user may traditionally be limited to manually performing additional searches and/or bookmarking the web page. The systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage one or more machine-learned models to suggest a summary of the displayed content. In some implementations, the systems and methods can determine an action associated with the content type of the displayed content, and the action can be suggested to the user. For example, the displayed content can include an advertisement for a product or service. The systems and methods can determine the advertisement content type and can suggest a price tracking feature that can recursively update the user on future price changes. In some implementations, the displayed content can include an event (e g., a football game), and an event content type can be determined. The systems and methods may suggest tracking the event updates (e.g., score updates). The action can include a summarization action, a tracking action, a save action, and/or a related resource look-up action (e.g., in response to determining a movie review content type, the systems and methods may suggest a movie theater web page for booking tickets and/or may suggest a web resource that includes actor and director information for the movie).
[0054] Articles and other content items can be lengthy and/or may discuss tangential topics merely in passing. The length and/or the lack of full context can cause additional hurdles for readers that may traditionally lead to further searches and can be time consuming. The systems and methods disclosed herein can proactively determine and suggest a summary for the content. Additionally and/or alternatively, the systems and methods can proactively determine a relevant tangential topic in the displayed content. The systems and methods can determine additional content associated with the tangential topic and can suggest the additional content to the user.
[0055] In response to the information provided in a displayed content item, a user may desire additional information and/or attempt to perform one or more additional actions based on the information provided in the displayed content item. Obtaining the additional information and/or performing the additional actions can include searching for supplementary information, searching for a purchase portal for purchasing a product discussed in the displayed content item, and/or one or more other additional actions. The additional actions can be time consuming, and a user may be uncertain on how to perform such additional actions, which can cause further confusion. The systems and methods disclosed herein can automatically determine additional information and/or additional actions associated with the displayed content and can suggest the additional information and/or additional actions to the user.
[0056] The systems and methods of the present disclosure provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, the system and methods can provide an interface for providing additional content prediction. The additional content prediction can enable a user to perform one or more actions and/or obtain additional information on a topic. The additional content prediction may be provided in an interface that allows a user to view a portion of the additional content while still displaying a portion of an initial content item.
[0057] Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is the ability to leverage one or more machine-learned models to determine a particular portion of the displayed content is descriptive of a specific topic to determine a plurality of different additional content items to provide in which each respective additional content item may be associated with a respective portion of the displayed content item.
[0058] Another example of technical effect and benefit relates to improved computational efficiency and improvements in the functioning of a computing system. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage the additional content prediction to proactively provide resources which may be desired by a user, which can save time and computational power over navigating to one or more additional web pages to find the resource associated with the additional content.
[0059] With reference now to the Figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.
[0060] Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of an example additional content suggestion system 10 according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The additional content suggestion system 10 can include obtaining content data associated with displayed

[0062] The content data can be processed to determine an entity 20 associated with the displayed content 12. The determined entity 20 can then be utilized to determine the additional content 14. For example, the determined entity 20 can be utilized to generate a search query, which can be utilized to query a search engine and/or a database to determine additional content associated with the determined entity 20.
[0063] Alternatively and/or additionally, the content data can be processed with one or more machine-learned models 22 to generate a machine-learned model output. The machine- learned model output can be the additional content 14 and/or can be utilized to determine additional content 14. For example, the machine-learned model 22 can be trained to summarize content, and the additional content 14 can be a summary of the displayed content 12. Alternatively and/or additionally, the machine-learned model 22 can be a semantic understanding model (e.g., a natural language processing model trained for semantic understanding) that can processed the displayed content 12 to generate a semantic understanding output. The semantic understanding output can then be utilized to determine other web resources and/or other documents that are associated with the semantic understanding.
[0064] In some implementations, the displayed content 24 can be processed to determine one or more actions 24 associated with the displayed content 12. User interface elements for performing the one or more actions 24 can be provided as additional content 14. For example, the displayed content 12 can be determined to include content that can potentially change overtime, and a tracking action can be provided as an option to a user. Alternatively and/or additionally, the displayed content 12 can be determined to include an object that is associated with an augmented-reality experience (e.g, a live try-on experience), and an augmented-reality experience can be provided as an option.
[0065] The displayed content 12 and the suggested additional content 14 can be provided for display in a suggestion interface 16. The suggestion interface 16 can be provided for display on a mobile device 30, a desktop device, a smart wearable, and/or via other display
devices. The suggestion interface 16 can include a viewing window 32 for the displayed content 12 and a pop-up interface element 34 for the additional content 14. Alternatively and/or additionally, the additional content 14 can be provided for display in a dynamically moving bubble interface element that moves in unison with a scroll indicator.

[0105] Figure 18A depicts a block diagram of an example computing system 100 that performs additional content interface presentation according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The system 100 includes a user computing device 102, a server computing system 130, and a training computing system 150 that are communicatively coupled over a network 180.
[0106] The user computing device 102 can be any type of computing device, such as, for example, a personal computing device (e.g., laptop or desktop), a mobile computing device
(e.g., smartphone or tablet), a gaming console or controller, a wearable computing device, an embedded computing device, or any other type of computing device.
[0107] The user computing device 102 includes one or more processors 112 and a memory 114. The one or more processors 112 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. The memory 114 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. The memory 114 can store data 116 and instructions 118 which are executed by the processor 112 to cause the user computing device 102 to perform operations. [0108] In some implementations, the user computing device 102 can store or include one or more content prediction models 120. For example, the content prediction models 120 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models such as neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) or other types of machine-learned models, including non-linear models and/or linear models. Neural networks can include feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (e.g., long short-term memory recurrent neural networks), convolutional neural networks or other forms of neural networks. Example content prediction models 120 are discussed with reference to Figures 2 - 11.
[0109] In some implementations, the one or more content prediction models 120 can be received from the server computing system 130 over network 180, stored in the user computing device memory 1 14, and then used or otherwise implemented by the one or more processors 112. In some implementations, the user computing device 102 can implement multiple parallel instances of a single content prediction model 120 (e.g., to perform parallel additional content prediction across multiple instances of displayed content items).
[0110] More particularly, the content prediction model 120 can be configured to process content data (e.g., a uniform resource locator, text data, image data, latent encoding data, and/or other metadata) to determine additional content associated with the displayed content. The additional content can be determined by generating semantic data associated with the displayed content and querying a database based on the semantic data. Alternatively and/or additionally the additional content can be determined by generating a search query based on the content data. In some implementations, a predicted action ty pe can be determined, and the additional content can be determined based on the predicted action type.
[0111] Additionally or alternatively, one or more content prediction models 140 can be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by the server computing system 130 that
communicates with the user computing device 102 according to a client-server relationship. For example, the content prediction models 140 can be implemented by the server computing system 140 as a portion of a web service (e.g., a content prediction service). Thus, one or more models 120 can be stored and implemented at the user computing device 102 and/or one or more models 140 can be stored and implemented at the server computing system 130. [0112] The user computing device 102 can also include one or more user input component 122 that receives user input. For example, the user input component 122 can be a touch-sensitive component (e g., a touch-sensitive display screen or a touch pad) that is sensitive to the touch of a user input object (e.g., a finger or a stylus). The touch-sensitive component can serve to implement a virtual keyboard. Other example user input components include a microphone, a traditional keyboard, or other means by which a user can provide user input.
[0113] The server computing system 130 includes one or more processors 132 and a memory 134. The one or more processors 132 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. The memory 134 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. The memory 134 can store data 136 and instructions 138 which are executed by the processor 132 to cause the server computing system 130 to perform operations.
[0114] In some implementations, the server computing system 130 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. In instances in which the server computing system 130 includes plural server computing devices, such server computing devices can operate according to sequential computing architectures, parallel computing architectures, or some combination thereof.
[0115] As described above, the server computing system 130 can store or otherwise include one or more machine-learned content prediction models 140. For example, the models 140 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models. Example machine-learned models include neural networks or other multi-layer non-linear models. Example neural networks include feed forward neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Example models 140 are discussed with reference to Figures 2 - 11.
[0116] The user computing device 102 and/or the server computing system 130 can train the models 120 and/or 140 via interaction with the training computing system 150 that is communicatively coupled over the network 180. The training computing system 150 can be separate from the server computing system 130 or can be a portion of the server computing system 130.
[0117] The training computing system 150 includes one or more processors 152 and a memory 154. The one or more processors 152 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. The memory 154 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. The memory 154 can store data 156 and instructions 158 which are executed by the processor 152 to cause the training computing system 150 to perform operations. In some implementations, the training computing system 150 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices.
[0118] The training computing system 150 can include a model trainer 160 that trams the machine-learned models 120 and/or 140 stored at the user computing device 102 and/or the server computing system 130 using various training or learning techniques, such as, for example, backwards propagation of errors. For example, a loss function can be backpropagated through the model(s) to update one or more parameters of the model(s) (e.g., based on a gradient of the loss function). Various loss functions can be used such as mean squared error, likelihood loss, cross entropy loss, hinge loss, and/or various other loss functions. Gradient descent techniques can be used to iteratively update the parameters over a number of training iterations.
[0119] In some implementations, performing backwards propagation of errors can include performing truncated backpropagation through time. The model trainer 160 can perform a number of generalization techniques (e.g., weight decays, dropouts, etc.) to improve the generalization capability of the models being trained.
[0120] In particular, the model trainer 160 can train the content prediction models 120 and/or 140 based on a set of training data 162. The training data 162 can include, for example, example training data sets, which can include a training example and ground truth data. The training example can include example content data (e.g., a unifomi resource locator, example text, example images, example latent encoding data, and/or an example embedding). The ground truth data can include a ground truth label, a ground truth
prediction, a ground truth action type, a ground truth query, and/or a ground truth semantic data output.
[0121] In some implementations, if the user has provided consent, the training examples can be provided by the user computing device 102. Thus, in such implementations, the model 120 provided to the user computing device 102 can be trained by the training computing system 150 on user-specific data received from the user computing device 102. In some instances, this process can be referred to as personalizing the model.
[0122] The model trainer 160 includes computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. The model trainer 160 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. For example, in some implementations, the model trainer 160 includes program files stored on a storage device, loaded into a memory and executed by one or more processors. In other implementations, the model trainer 160 includes one or more sets of computer-executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media. [0123] The network 180 can be any type of communications network, such as a local area network (e.g., intranet), wide area network (e.g., Internet), or some combination thereof and can include any number of wired or wireless links. In general, communication over the network 180 can be carried via any type of wired and/or wireless connection, using a wide variety of communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP), encodings or formats (e.g., HTML, XML), and/or protection schemes (e.g., VPN, secure HTTP, SSL).
[0124] The machine-learned models described in this specification may be used in a variety of tasks, applications, and/or use cases.
[0125] In some implementations, the input to the machine-learned model(s) of the present disclosure can be image data. The machine-learned model(s) can process the image data to generate an output. As an example, the machine-learned model(s) can process the image data to generate an image recognition output (e.g., a recognition of the image data, a latent embedding of the image data, an encoded representation of the image data, a hash of the image data, etc ). As another example, the machine-learned model(s) can process the image data to generate an image segmentation output. As another example, the machine- learned model(s) can process the image data to generate an image classification output As another example, the machine-learned model(s) can process the image data to generate an image data modification output (e.g., an alteration of the image data, etc.).
