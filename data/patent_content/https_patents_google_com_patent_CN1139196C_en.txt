The method of a communication system of control
The all communication systems of relate generally to of the present invention more particularly relate to be used for the accurately sign coverage and the loading of the control of improvement system.
All fast power control honeycomb fashion multiaccess systems of the shared same carrier frequency of a large number of users, the performance of for example all code division multiple accesss (CDMA) system is not characterized well and/or controls by existing all technology.Its reason is many fine distinctions of being showed by such cdma communication system.For example, different with the honeycomb fashion multiaccess system of all routines, in a cdma communication system when the power on the distributing carrier wave between all users, all adjustment of the transmitting power of base station and travelling carriage take place to change continuously, so noise per second on a wide scope of seeing at base station and travelling carriage takes place many times to change.Another reason is the sensitivity behaviour that the delay expansion condition of all parts can have a deep effect on all receivers in cdma communication system, and has a deep effect on the adjustment in all power control of each base station and travelling carriage conversely.
With above-mentioned relevant be such fact, promptly radio performance and transmitting power are subjected to the profound influence of the characteristics of soft handover, travelling carriage can and receive all signals from a plurality of base stations to all signals of a plurality of base station in soft handover.Another reason is the such fact during all methods are not in the past considered to put into practice, promptly when communication, all base stations connection that many travelling carriage discord are best, and because all timers and actual scanning survey number of times usually stand the connection of lacking than for all best connection of communicating by letter.This has influence on the noisiness that all cdma receivers in the system are seen, and has influence on all power control adjustment in the base station conversely again.
Therefore, need a kind of in cdma communication system characterization covering and load with the exact method of system's control that improvement is provided.
Fig. 1 usually described a code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communication system with the form of block diagram, and this system can advantageously adopt the system's control that has improved according to of the present invention.
Fig. 2 has usually described the transmitter of a CDMA travelling carriage of communicating by letter with a cdma receiver of a base station with the form of block diagram.
Fig. 3 has usually described the transmitter of a cdma base station of communicating by letter with a receiver of a CDMA travelling carriage with the form of block diagram.
Fig. 4 has usually described according to the present invention the parametric grid computer memory for a demonstration of the system of Fig. 1.
Fig. 5 has usually described all steps of being got by the controller of Fig. 1 for the various parametric grid that is identified for system's control according to the present invention in a flowchart.
In general, a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system has been improved control by accurately characterizing coverage all parameters relevant with cdma communication system with loading.In order accurately to characterize the coverage all parameter relevant with cdma communication system, the corresponding all parametric grids of all parameters of generation and cdma communication system with loading.Perhaps individually or in combination assess all parametric grids, so that the information widely about the performance of cdma communication system is provided.Based on all results of assessment, the controller in cdma communication system inside is controlled all parameters, so that improve the speech quality of cdma communication system, loads etc.
More specifically, the application has announced the method for a communication system of a kind of control.This method usually comprises corresponding to calculation of parameter at least one parametric grid relevant with communication system, assesses this parametric grid then, so that produce all steps of influence parameter control signal relevant with communication system.Based on the control signal control communication system that produces.The parameter relevant with communication system includes, but not limited to forward direction and backward power requirement in preferential embodiment, useful all pilot signal quantity and best pilot signal.Again, in preferential embodiment, the calculating of parametric grid is each x of the grid (grid) on an interesting areas, and y coordinate place carries out.
In an optional modification of cdma communication system control method, determine all forward directions and the power of reverse link requirement of all base stations in the interesting areas.Then, based on all forward link power requirements of determining, determine to provide the base station of largest forward link power.In order to alleviate all effects of this base station, restriction is attached to the quantity of the travelling carriage of that base station, thereby with respect to total forward link power of all base stations, its forward link power contribution has reduced.According to the base station to communication system one of influence once more assessment allow to increase the quantity of the travelling carriage that is attached to interested base station.
In another scheme of cdma communication system control method, determine the noise total amount that all travelling carriages provide in the communication system.Secondly, determine to provide all travelling carriages of a unacceptable noisiness then to fixed noise total amount.At last, restriction inserts those travelling carriages that a unacceptable noisiness is provided, and the noise total amount in communication system reaches an acceptable level, so that reduce all influences of all travelling carriages that offends.In this scheme of cdma communication system control method, the power of reverse link by needs calculating for all travelling carriages in an interesting areas requires parametric grid, determines the overall noise in cdma communication system.
Fig. 1 has usually described a wireless communication system 100 with the form of block diagram, and it may advantageously adopt the system control method that has improved according to of the present invention.In preferential embodiment, wireless communication system 100 is a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular radio and telephones.Yet, will recognize as those skilled in the art, can in any wireless communication system, implement the system's control that has improved according to of the present invention.

As shown in Figure 1, a plurality of base station 101-103 are coupled to a CBSC104.Each base station 101-103 offers the communication of travelling carriage 105 rf frequencies (RF).In preferential embodiment, what implement in all base station 101-103 and all travelling carriages 105 is to support that emittor/receiver (transceiver) hardware of the transmission of the RF communication resource is definition in " for the travelling carriage-base station compatibility standard of double mode broadband spread-spectrum cellular system " basically at the title of TIL/EIA/IS-95A, in June, 1993, file in, it can be from telecommunications industry association (TIA), 2001Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, D.C., 20006 obtain.CBSC104 is responsible for especially by the call treatment of TC110 and the mobile management by MM109.CBSC104 also comprises a controller 113, and its is according to the invention provides the system's control that has improved.The all tasks of other of CBSC104 are to comprise feature control and emission/network interface.For the more information relevant for the general utility functions of CBSC104, with reference to people's such as Bach United States Patent (USP) 5475686, this patent has transferred the application's assignee, and it is attached among the application as a reference.
The OMCR112 of the MM109 that is coupled to CBSC104 has also been described in Fig. 1.OMCR112 is responsible for all operations of radio part (combination of CBSC104 and base station 101-103) of communication system 100 and general maintenance.CBSC104 is coupled to a MSC115, and MSC115 is provided at the exchange capacity between PSTN120/ISDN122 and the CBSC104.OMCS124 is responsible for all operations of switching part (MSC115) of communication system 100 and general maintenance.The user profile that HLR116 and VLR117 will be mainly used in the bill purpose offers communication system 100.
CBSC104, MSC115, the function of HIR116 and VLR117 distributes as illustrated in fig. 1, however will recognize also can be with function combinations in single parts for the personnel of a skilled ordinary skill.Again, for different configurations, TC110 can or the position MSC115 or the position at a base station 101-103.The link 126 that MSC115 and CBSC104 are coupled is technical well-known T1/E1 links.If TC110 is placed on the CBSC place,, just can in link budget, realize an improvement of 4: 1 owing to compressed input signal (from 126 inputs of T1/E1 link) with TC110.Compressed signal is sent to a specific base stations 101-103 so that it is transmitted to a specific travelling carriage 105.The compressed signal of noting being sent to a specific base stations 101-103 will stand further at base station 101-103 before emission takes place, and processing is important.In other words, but the final signal that is transmitted to travelling carriage 105 is different in form with compressed signal from TC110 output is identical in itself.
When travelling carriage 105 receives signal by base station 101-103 emission, travelling carriage 105 basically " eliminations " (being commonly referred to " decoding ") major part processing by system's 100 enforcements.When travelling carriage 105 was got back to a base station 101-103 with a signal emission, travelling carriage 105 also will carry out its processing.(Signal Processing is just changed the form of signal at a treated signal by travelling carriage 105, and do not change its essence) be transmitted to a base station 101-103 after, the processing that base station 101-103 implements " elimination " to signal also passes the signal to suitable point in the system 100.At last, signal is sent to a last user by T1/E1 link 126.
Fig. 2 has usually described the transmitter 200 of a CDMA travelling carriage 105 of communicating by letter with the receiver 203 of any one (or whole) among the cdma base station 101-103 with the form of block diagram.In the coded portion 201 of communication system, all traffic channel datas position 202 is from a microprocessor (μ P) 205, and with a specific bit rate (that is 9.6 kbps) it is input to an encoder 204.μ P205 is coupled to the square frame 207 that an appointment has relevant all functions, implement there to comprise call treatment, all functions of link establishment, with the general of other with set up and all functions of safeguarding that radio communication is relevant.All traffic channel datas position 202 can comprise or be transformed into the speech of data, clear data, perhaps two types data combination by a vocoder.Encoder 204 is encoded into all data symbol 206 with an encryption algorithm with all traffic channel datas position 202 with fixing code rate (1/r), this encryption algorithm carries out the follow-up maximum likelihood decoding that all data symbols is become all data bit (for example, encryption algorithm all convolution or piece) easily.For example, encoder 204 with a data bit to three a data symbol (promptly, 1/3) a fixing code rate (is for example encoded all traffic channel datas position 202, speed with one 9.6 kbps receives 192 input data bit), make all data symbols 206 of encoder 204 outputs (for example, exporting 576 data symbols) like this in the speed of one 28.8 Kilo Symbols Per Second.
Then all data symbols 206 are input to an interleaver 208.Interleaver 208 advances all (that is all frames) with all data symbols 206 tissues and at the staggered all input data symbols 206 of symbol level piece.In interleaver 208, all data symbols are individually imported in the matrix of piece that a definition one of all data symbols pre-determines size.All data symbols are input to all positions in the matrix, make with row then the mode of row be full of matrix.With the individually output of all position from matrix of all data symbols, make the mode of following delegation with delegation evacuate matrix.Typically, matrix is the square matrix that a line number equals columns; Yet, can select other matrix form, so that be increased in the adjoining land input not by the staggered distance of the output between staggered all data symbols.Through staggered all data symbols 110 by interleaver 208 with identical data symbol rate (that is 28.8 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds) output with their inputs.By the predetermined size of all data symbol block of defined matrix is can derive out with the maximum quantity of all data symbols of an encoded bit rate transmission from the transmission block that pre-determines length at.For example, if all data symbols 206 are exported from encoder 204 with the speed of 28.8 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds, if and the length that pre-determines of transmission block equals 20 milliseconds, the predetermined size of so all data symbol block equals 28.8 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds and multiply by 20 milliseconds (ms), and this equals to define one 18 576 data symbols taking advantage of 32 matrix.
Encoded and staggered all data symbols 210 are exported from the coded portion 201 of communication system, and are input to the radiating portion 216 of communication system.By a modulator 217 all data symbols 210 are ready to, so that on a communication channel, launch.Then, modulated signal is offered an antenna 218, so that on digital radio channel 108, it is launched.
Modulator 217 passes through from encoded, and the code sequence of the regular length that staggered all data symbols 210 are derived in the process of an expansion is ready to all data symbols 210 so that carry out direct sequence C DMA emission.For example, all data symbols in the sequence of all data symbols 210 of baseline encoded can be extended to the code of a unique regular length, make the code of available single 64 bit lengths represent a group that a land data symbol is arranged.To represent one to have all codes of the group of a land data symbol preferentially to combine so that form the code of single 64 bit lengths.A result as this expansion process, with fixing speed (promptly, 28.8 Kilo Symbols Per Second) reception is encoded, the modulator 217 of staggered all data symbols 210 has the sequence spreading of the code of one 64 bit length now, it has a higher fixing character rate (for example, 307.2 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds).Those those skilled in the art will recognize can be according to many other algorithms, will be encoded, and all data symbols in the sequence of staggered all data bit 210 are extended to a sequence than the code of length.
By further expanding sequence spreading, further be ready to sequence spreading, so that carry out the emission of direct sequence code division (divided) spread-spectrum with a long spreading code (that is, the PN code).Spreading code is with a user's of a fixing spreading rate (that is 1.228 million chips/sec) output specific symbol sebolic addressing or unique personal code work.Except a sign is provided, the user is sending outside encoded all traffic channel datas position 202 about this sign on the digital radio channel 108, and unique personal code work has increased the confidentiality of communicating by letter by upsetting encoded all traffic channel datas position 202 in communication channel.In addition, all personal code work extended coding data bit (that is, all data symbols) are used for by driving sinusoidal wave all phase control, sine wave of bi-phase modulated.With the sine wave signal output bandpass filtering, be transformed into a RF frequency, amplify, filtering and radiate by an antenna 218 is finished the emission of all traffic channel datas position 202 in a digital radio channel 108 so that modulate with binary phase shift keying (BPSK).
A receiving unit 222 of base station receiver 203 is by the spread spectrum signal that be launched of antenna 224 receptions from coming at digital radio channel 108.Received signal is input to a receiver front end 221, and it comprises digital radio channel 108 downward conversions is become a circuit that is applicable to the signal of sampling.With sampler 226 all data sampling points are taken a sample in the output of receiver front end 221 by despreader, then, all data sampling points 242 are outputed to the decoded portion 254 of communication system.
Despreader and sampler 226 are preferentially by filtering, and demodulation is from all RF frequency inverted with a predetermined speed (that is, 1.2288 million sampling point/seconds) sampling, the spread spectrum signal that BPSK takes a sample and receives.Then, by all sampled signals that will receive and the long spreading code expansion BPSK sampled signal that shuts away mutually.It is resulting that all to remove to expand sampled signal 228 sampled with a predetermined speed, and it (is for example outputed to a non-coherent detector 240,307.2 thousand sampling point/seconds, thus sequence that four sampling points of the spread spectrum signal that receives are arranged is gone expansion and/or by the representative of individual data sampling point) so that carry out the incoherent detection of all data sampling points 242 later on.
To recognize as those those skilled in the art, and can come the diversity (diversity) of implementation space respectively with a plurality of receiving units 222 to 223 and all antennas 224 to 225.N receiver section will be to work with above-mentioned receiving unit 222 substantially the same modes, so that recover all data sampling points from the spread spectrum signal that receives digital radio channel 108.All output 242 to 252 of N receiver section is input to an adder 250, and its diversity is combined into one by the combined-flow of all data sampling points 260 of coherent detection with all input data sampling points.
All other data sampling point 260 that will form the soft decision data then is input to a decoded portion 254, and it comprises the deinterleaver 262 of the soft decision data 260 of deinterleave input on individual other data hierarchy.In deinterleaver 262, soft decision data 260 individually to be imported in the matrix, one of this defined matrix pre-determines the piece of the soft decision data of size.The soft decision data are input to all positions in the matrix, make the mode of following delegation with delegation be full of matrix.The soft decision data 264 of deinterleave are individually exported from all positions matrix, made that following a mode that is listed as with row evacuates matrix.By deinterleaver 262 with the soft decision data 264 of their same rate mutually (that is 28.8 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds) output deinterleave of input.
Derive predetermined size by the soft decision data block of defined matrix from the maximum rate of all sampled data sampling points, all data samplings are put and are come leisure to pre-determine the spectrum signal that receives in the transmission block of length.
The soft decision data 264 of deinterleave are input to a decoder 266, and the likelihood decoding technique of all maximums of decoder 266 usefulness produces all traffic channel datas position 268 of estimating.Can strengthen the likelihood decoding technique of all maximums with similar with a Veterbi decoding algorithm basically algorithm.Decoder 266 usefulness a groups other soft decision data 264 form one group of soft decision transfer matrix each specific time state for use in the likelihood sequencal estimation decoder 266 of maximum.The quantity of soft decision data 264 is corresponding from the quantity of all data symbols 206 of each input data bit 202 generation with the output at convolution coder 204 in the group who is used to form each group soft decision transfer matrix.The quantity of all soft decision transfer matrixes equals 2 in every group, and this 2 is taken on the power of quantity of the soft decision data 264 in every group certainly.For example, when in transmitter, during with one 1/3 convolution coder, producing three data symbols 105 from each input data bit 202.Like this, all groups of decoder 266 usefulness three each and every one other soft decision data 264 form eight soft decision transfer matrixes for use in each time state in the likelihood sequencal estimation decoder 266 of maximum.Be input to the speed of decoder 266 and the relevant speed of fixed rate of all input data bit 202 that is used for encoding at first with one with soft decision data 264, all traffic channel datas position 268 that generation is estimated (promptly, if the soft decision data are 1/3 with the speed of 28.8 thousand matrixes/input second and initial coding, all traffic channel datas position 268 of Gu Jiing is with the speed output of one 9600 bps so).
All traffic channel datas position 268 of estimating is input to a μ P270 who is similar to μ P207.As the situation at μ P207, μ P270 is coupled to the square frame 272 that an appointment has all correlation functions, and this square frame also implements to comprise call treatment, all functions of link establishment with other general with set up and safeguard all functions that radio communication is relevant.μ P270 also is coupled to an interface 274, and interface 274 allows the receiver 203 of base station 103 to communicate by letter with CBSC113.
Fig. 3 has usually described any one transmitter 300 among all cdma base station 101-103 that communicate by letter with a receiver 303 of a CDMA travelling carriage 105.In the coded portion 301 of communication system, export all traffic channel datas position 302 from a μ P305, and they are input to an encoder 304 with a specific bit rate (for example, 9.6 kbps).μ P305 is coupled to the square frame 307 that an appointment has all correlation functions, and this square frame is implemented and the square frame 207 of Fig. 2 and 272 similar and wireless relevant all functions.μ P305 also is coupled to an interface 309, and interface 309 allows the transmitter 300 of base station 102 to communicate by letter with CBSC114.
All traffic channel datas position 302 can comprise or be transformed into the speech of data, clear data, perhaps two types data combination by a vocoder.The encryption algorithm that encoder 304 enters all data bit with a likelihood decoding that is easy to make the maximum in succession of all data symbols with a fixing code rate (1/r) (for example, all convolution or block encoding algorithm), all traffic channel datas position 302 is encoded into all data symbols 306.For example, encoder 304 with a data bit to two a data symbol (promptly, 1/2) a regular coding speed, encode all traffic channel datas position 302 (for example, 192 input data bit that receive with the speed of one 9.6 kbps), make encoder 304 export all data symbols 306 (for example, exporting 384 data symbols) with the speed of one 19.2 Kilo Symbols Per Second.
Then all data symbols 306 are input to an interleaver 308.Interleaver 308 is organized into all data symbols 306 in all (that is, all frames), and the data symbol 306 of the staggered all inputs of piece on the level of symbol.In interleaver 308, all data symbols individually are input in the matrix piece that pre-determines size of all data symbols of this defined matrix.With all position of all data symbol inputs in matrix, make that following a mode that is listed as with row is full of matrix.With the individually output of all position from matrix of all data symbols, make the mode of following delegation with delegation evacuate matrix.Typically, matrix is the square matrix that a line number equals columns; Yet, can select other all matrix forms, so that be increased in the adjoining land input not by the staggered distance of the output between staggered all data symbols.Export with data symbol rate identical when they imports (, 19.2 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds) by interleaver 308 through staggered all data symbols 310.The size that pre-determines by the piece of all data symbols of defined matrix is from deriving out at a maximum quantity that pre-determines all data symbols that transmit the transmission block of length with an encoded bit rate.For example, if all data symbols 306 are exported from encoder 304 with the speed of 19.2 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds, if and the predetermined length of transmission block equals 20 milliseconds, the predetermined length of the piece of so all data symbols equals 19.2 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds and multiply by 20 milliseconds (ms), and this equals to define one 18 384 data symbols taking advantage of 32 matrix.
Encoded and staggered all data symbols 310 are exported from the coded portion 301 of communication system, and are input to a radiating portion 316 of communication system.By a modulator 317 all data symbols 310 are ready to, so that on a communication channel, launch.Then, modulated signal is offered an antenna 318, so that on digital radio channel 108, it is launched.
Modulator 317 passes through encoded, and staggered all data symbols 310 implementation data upset, and are ready to all data symbols 310, cuts apart the spread-spectrum emission so that carry out direct sequence code.By implement all interleaver output symbols 310 and an emission cycle for that symbol when beginning effectively the mould 2 of the binary value of long code pseudo noise PN chip add, finish data perturbation.This pseudo noise PN sequence is the equivalent of long code that is operated in the clock rate of 1.2288MHz, has only first per 64 output to be used for data perturbation (that is, one 19200 sampling point/second speed) there.
After upset, in an expansion process, obtain a sequence from all fixed length codes of all data symbols through upsetting.For example, each data symbol in the sequence of all data symbols through upsetting preferentially can be expanded to the code of a unique regular length, make the code of available single 64 bit lengths represent each data symbol.The preferential topotype 2 of the code of representative data symbol is added on separately the data code.A result as this expansion process, with fixing speed (for example, 19.2 the modulator 317 that Kilo Symbols Per Second) receives encoded, staggered all data symbols 310 has the sequence spreading of all 64 bit length codes now, this sequence spreading has a higher fixing character rate (for example, 1228.8 Kilo Symbols Per Seconds).Those those skilled in the art will recognize can be according to many other algorithms, will be encoded, all data symbols in the sequence of staggered all data bit 310 are extended to a sequence than all codes of length, and do not depart from scope and spirit of the present invention.
By further expanding sequence spreading, further be ready to sequence spreading, so that carry out the emission of direct sequence code division spread-spectrum with a long spreading code (that is, the PN code).Spreading code is with a user's of a fixing spreading rate (that is 1.2288 million chips/sec) output specific symbol sebolic addressing or unique personal code work.Except a sign is provided, the user is sending outside encoded all traffic channel datas position 302 about this sign on the digital radio channel 308, and unique personal code work has increased the confidentiality of communicating by letter by upsetting encoded all traffic channel datas position 302 in communication channel.In addition, all personal code work extended coding data bit (that is, all data symbols) are used for by driving sinusoidal wave all phase control, sine wave of bi-phase modulated.With the sine wave signal output bandpass filtering, be transformed into a RF frequency, to amplify, filtering and radiate by an antenna 318 is so that finish the emission of all traffic channel datas position 302 in a digital radio channel 108 with the BPSK modulation.
When cdma wireless communication system of design makes it overlap an existing wireless communication system (for example, an AMPS wireless communication system) and go up, need anticipate and minimize the interference between any system that may produce from office of portion.The mechanism that has some kinds of possible inter-system interference.But main problem is the interference product that the strong AMPS base station from the front end that is blended in a CDMA travelling carriage 105 produces, and it produces the undesirable all signals in the passband of present CDMA travelling carriage 105.
Still with reference to Fig. 3, a receiving unit 322 of mobile station receiver 303 is by the spread spectrum signal that be launched of antenna 324 receptions from digital radio channel 108.In preferential embodiment, receiver 303 is well-known technically Rake receivers.Received signal is input to a receiver front end 321, and it comprises digital radio channel 108 downward conversions is become a circuit that is applicable to the signal of sampling.Receiver front end 321 also comprises an attenuator 327 (not drawing in the drawings), and attenuator 327 is used for alleviating all effects that aforesaid AMPS disturbs.Know as technical, the attenuator 327 that is positioned at the front end 321 of receiver 303 will reduce desirable (CDMA) signal with corresponding attenuation, but will be reduced in the undesirable all IM products that produce in the receiver 200 with three (3) doubly to the decay of this attenuation.Like this, work and inoperative by selectively making attenuator, all effects of the AMPS signal of all interference can be relieved to such degree, call quality improves and has eliminated the likelihood of losing a calling greatly at that time.
Still with reference to Fig. 3, with sampler 326 all data sampling points are taken a sample in the output of receiver front end 321 by despreader.Then, all data sampling points 342 output to the decoded portion 354 of communication system.Despreader and sampler 326 are preferentially by filtering, and demodulation from all RF frequency inverted with a predetermined speed (that is, 1.2288 million sampling point/seconds) sampling, is carried out the BPSK sampling to the spread spectrum signal that receives.Then, shut away mutually by all sampled signals that will receive and long spreading code and expand the BPSK sampled signal.It is resulting that all to remove to expand sampled signal 328 sampled with a predetermined speed, and it is outputed to a non-coherent detector 340 (promptly, 19.2 thousand sampling point/seconds, so the sequence of 64 sampling points of the spread spectrum signal of a reception is gone expansion and/or is represented by the individual data sampling point) so that carry out the incoherent detection of all data sampling points 342.
To recognize the diversity that to come the implementation space with a plurality of receiving units 322 to 323 and antenna 324 to 325 respectively as those those skilled in the art.N receiver section will be to work with above-mentioned receiving unit 322 substantially the same modes, so that the spread spectrum signal from receiving digital radio channel 320 recovers all data sampling points.The output 342 to 352 of N receiver section preferentially is input to an adder 350, and its diversity is combined into all input data sampling points the combined-flow of the relevant all data sampling points 360 checked of a quilt.
All other data sampling point 360 that will form the soft decision data then is input to a decoded portion 354, and decoded portion 354 comprises the deinterleaver 362 of the soft decision data 360 of deinterleave input on the individual data level.In deinterleaver 362, soft decision data 360 are individually imported in the matrix piece that pre-determines size of soft decision data of this defined matrix.The soft decision data are input to all positions in the matrix, make the mode of following delegation with delegation be full of matrix.The soft decision data 364 of deinterleave are individually exported from all positions matrix, made that following a mode that is listed as with ranks evacuates matrix.By deinterleaver 362 to export the soft decision data 364 of deinterleave with their same rate mutually (that is 19.2 thousand matrix/seconds) of input.
Derive predetermined size by the piece of the soft decision data of defined matrix, the spread spectrum signal that all data sampling points receive from the maximum rate of all sampled data sampling points in the transmission block that is pre-determining length.
The soft decision data 364 of deinterleave are input to a decoder 366, and the likelihood decoding technique of all maximums of decoder 366 usefulness produces all traffic channel datas position 368 of estimating.Can strengthen the likelihood decoding technique of all maximums with similar with a Veterbi decoding algorithm basically algorithm.Decoder 366 usefulness a groups other soft decision data 364 form one group of soft decision transfer matrix each specific time state for use in the likelihood sequencal estimation decoder 366 of maximum.The quantity of soft decision data 364 is corresponding from the quantity of all data symbols 306 of each input data bit 302 generation with the output at convolution coder 304 in the group who is used to form each group soft decision transfer matrix.The quantity of all soft decision transfer matrixes equals 2 in every group, and this 2 is taken on the power of quantity of the soft decision data 364 in every group certainly.For example, when in transmitter, during with one 1/2 convolution coder, producing two data symbols 306 from each input data bit 302.Like this, all groups of decoder 366 usefulness two each and every one other soft decision data 364 form two soft decision transfer matrixes for use in each the specific time state in the likelihood sequencal estimation decoder 366 of maximum.Be input to the speed of decoder 366 and the relevant speed of fixed rate of all input data bit 302 that is used for encoding at first with one with soft decision data 364, all traffic channel datas position 368 that generation is estimated (promptly, if the soft decision data are 1/2 with the speed of 19.2 thousand matrixes/input second and initial coding, all traffic channel datas position 368 of Gu Jiing is with the speed output of one 9600 bps so).All traffic channel datas position 368 of estimating is input to a μ P370, all traffic channel datas position 368 that its translation is estimated and other all territories.μ P370 also is coupled to front end 321 by control line 371.According to the present invention, according to a order from base station 102, μ P370 will make attenuator 327 work/inoperative.μ P370 further is coupled to all correlation functions 372, and they are implemented and square frame 207,272 and 307 those intimate and wireless relevant all functions of implementing.
For the system's control that improves according to the invention process, in the controller 113 of Fig. 1, at first implement a kind of computing method of parametric grid.A parametric grid is exactly each x of an aperture plate on interesting areas simply, and a specific parameter relevant with communication system calculated at y coordinate place.This can find out in Fig. 4, there by all some x
s, y
sThe definition interesting areas.In preferential embodiment, on whole zone, the many different condition that forms one group of grid is repeatedly calculated all parametric grids, and can utilize grid group to come the control of improvement system, as we will illustrate later on according to the present invention.
Arriving this, is significant according to the present invention to carrying out a brief summary by various types of all parameters that controller 113 calculates.
The power requirement of forward link (base station is to travelling carriage)
This network (mesh) in the speed of having considered travelling carriage especially, postpones expansion, under the situation of possible all transmission conditions (just being called " all conditions " later on), calculate from service district on the summit of travelling carriage, in Fig. 4 by x
m, y
mExpression, the power that needs of the emission of a travelling carriage.Utilize frame erasing speed (FER) to determine this power by a predetermined voice quality.These frame erasing speed also by all radio links of system or computer characterizes or the laboratory characterizes and pre-determines.Because it is in desirable gate of the quality monitoring closed chain road desired power, also available it come in the system each the point with respect to some physical restriction (as a power amplifier in the base station, or the size of PA, perhaps a restriction to each traffic channel transmission power) determine a boundary.For example, the power of Xu Yaoing may be 8 watts (W); If we plan service channel power is limited in 2W, so required power is 6dB in this restriction.
The power requirement of reverse link (travelling carriage is to the base station)
On the basis of all conditions, its thought is the same with the grid that needs forward power.Because it is required power, it can be added to the PA of any size afterwards, such as will be described below.
The quantity of useful pilot signal
The quantity of useful pilot tone grid under all conditions, has been calculated the quantity (pilot tone may from each sector) of pilot tone, and these pilot tones on each summit of grid are useful (that is, can be used for soft handover).By calculating IS-95 quantity Ec/Io, and if it is by a current threshold value, then by it being counted determine this parameter.Like this, all values in the grid are to represent the integer of all numbers of connection that can have on given position, and no matter the quantity of all connections that in fact travelling carriage can have.In fact, if useful pilot tone than travelling carriage can handle more, then trouble may appear.
Ec/Io is also referred to as best pilot signal
This grid is confirmed as best pilot tone in considering under the situation of all conditions all Ec/Io items in each position Ec/Io calculates.A high-quality pilot tone is extremely important for high-quality all forward-link communication, and this grid points out whether to receive a high-quality pilot tone.What is high-quality, as the situation at other all grid, goes after being put into to discuss, no matter are and so on all values because this grid has them.
To recognize as common those skilled in the art, and can produce many other parametric grids so that obtain understanding preferably to cdma communication system 100.The all parameter relevant with these grids includes, but not limited to describe the laod unbalance of balance between the received power of all neighbor cells, on the forward link for the available relatively cell power that can not utilize and the performance of paging channel.The sub-fraction of whole sub-districts (all sub-districts in the system) power is described for the available relatively cell power that can not utilize, as in the antenna measurement of a travelling carriage, this fraction power can be recovered (power with respect to whole sub-districts adds all other noise and the interference that can not be produced by all sub-districts in the system) by travelling carriage." iorioc defines by variable for the relative available cell power that can not utilize.
When or be identical with a space method in epoch or with the method for calculating all grids an epoch time during method.
Space epoch (epoch) method
Space method in epoch is defined as in the system of test (for example has a plurality of base stations, all base station 101-103) and travelling carriage (for example, travelling carriage 105) implements interactive a calculating and in controller 113, so that the physical parameter of other Traffic Channel and a large amount of other, the Traffic Channel of each forward link and each reverse link is taken to the optimum value of its average delivering power according to all.After finishing that and calculating, think that the spatial configuration for travelling carriage and base station has made communication system 100 stabilisations.
Secondly, place just in time more one travelling carriage (it is in office, and where face does not influence system) and consider all system noises on each summit of grid by the imagination, the base station of best service, if or all base stations when running into soft handover, according to the delay on that summit expansion and one to the report speed calculation of travelling carriage parameters of interest, computer memory grid in epoch at every bit.For each x of the grid on the system coverage area that is superimposed upon supplier, y position, all steps that controller 113 is carried out as shown in Figure 5.At first, controller is determined to disturb (I from total forward link of all sub-districts in step 503
t), then, determine from other all contention systems and/or the interference (I of all noise sources of non-supplier in step 506
Np), allow travelling carriage to carry out all adjustment so that alleviate their influence (for example, adjusting the decay in the receiver front end of travelling carriage) so that alleviate the intermodulation distortion that the interference by contention system produces, produce by I
t'=I
t+ I
NpA total interference of expression.
Then, controller 113 is determined in step 509 owing to postpone the channel model (quantity of all signal paths between server and remote-control device) that expansion produces, following expression:
Fng_frc_fwd[0, i]=by sub-fraction or FRP (with respect to the antenna of travelling carriage) for the gross power of recovering with the travelling carriage branch of the corresponding strongest signal paths of cell i;
Fng_frc_fwd[1, i]=by the sub-fraction or the FRP (with respect to the antenna of travelling carriage) of the gross power of recovering for the travelling carriage branch of second strongest signal paths;
Fng_frc_fwd[n, i]=by the sub-fraction (with respect to the antenna of travelling carriage) of the gross power of recovering for the travelling carriage branch of n strongest signal paths;
As definition here, equal the quantity of forward link with the quantity of the different sub-district of n peak signal or all forward link correspondences.With respect to Pilot PN (pseudo noise code) skew definition all sub-district or all sector of IS-95A (front was mentioned) with a uniqueness.
Then, controller 113 calculates pilot tone Ec/Io (pilot_ecio) and pilot tone Ec/No (met) in step 512 for each forward signal path from each cell i, wherein:
D
r=N
0W
Mt+ I
tBe total interference and N at mobile portable antennas
0W
MtIt is the available heat noise that produces by the remote-control device receiver;
EcIo_flat (i)=(Ppilot (i)/D
r) be the strongest pilot tone Ec/Io, it does not constitute the FRP of cell i, as measuring at the mobile portable antennas place;
Eclo (i)=(fng_frc_fwd[0, i] * EcIo_flat (i)) be the strongest pilot tone Ec/Io for the sub-district I of explanation FRP;
Pilot_ecio[i]=EcIo (i) is for the strongest Ec/Io path of cell i;
pilot_ecio1[i]＝EcIo_flat(i)*fng_frc_fwd[1，i]；
pilot_ecio2[i]＝EcIo_flat(i)*fng_frc_fwd[2，i]；
Dra＝It-fng_frc_fwd[0，i]*Pcell(i)+NoWmt。Pcell (i) is the power receiver at mobile portable antennas, receives the power that only comes from cell i.Other all variable-definitions are:
Drb＝It-fng_frc_fwd[1，i]*Pcell(i)+NoWmt；
Drc＝It-fng_frc_fwd[2，i]*Pcell(i)+NoWmt；
met[i]＝fng_frc_fwd[0，i]*Ppilot(i)/Dra；
met1[i]＝fng_frc_fwd[1，i]*Ppilot(i)/Drb；
Met2[i]=fng_frc_fwd[2, i] * Ppilot (i)/Drc; Ppilot (i) is the pilot power that receives from cell i, as measuring at the mobile portable antennas place.
Arrive this, controller 113 Ec/Io that step 515 test calculates whether a threshold value (typically-12 to-20dB) on.If the result in step 515 test negates, program enters step 518 and thinks that there this pilot tone is useless to travelling carriage so.If the result in step 515 test is sure, controller 113 calculates so has pilot tone Ec/Io the quantity of all sub-districts on the threshold value arbitrarily, and for the grid that produces " quantity of useful all pilot tones " in this amount of step 521 storage.Define the sub-district of maximum pilot tone Ec/Io signal path and store this amount for the best server may grid of reverse link based on above-mentioned all equation controllers 113 then for producing.
Arrive this, controller 113 is determined the path of maximum pilot signal Ec/Io in step 524, and stores this amount for producing " best pilot signal-Ec/Io " grid.The quantity of given all forward signal path (each useful pilot tone can have k the signal path owing to delay expansion generation relevant with it) and their signal strength signal intensities separately, controller 113 is selected the highest n in step 527.Give the quantity that fixes on all demodulators available in the travelling carriage 105 (all branches), controller 113 is also in the required all forward link power level of step 527 calculating from each sub-district, it is in order to reach acceptable frame erasing (quality) level that constitutes mobile station speed, " iorioc (as described above) and to successfully needed to all restrictions of the available all branches of all signal path assignments.
Above-mentioned information has been arranged, and controller 113 usefulness pilot tone Ec/Io select n the highest signal path, and n equals the quantity of all demodulators (all branches) available in travelling carriage here.In preferential embodiment, n=3.From this information, can determine following all variablees:
Ecio_0=is from the pilot tone Ec/Io in the strongest path (e) of sub-district k;
Ecio_1=is from the pilot tone Ec/Io in second path the strongest (f) of sub-district 1;
Ecio_2=is from the pilot tone Ec/Io in the 3rd the strongest path (g) of sub-district m;
The speed of speed=travelling carriage;
MaxPilot=is corresponding to the Ec/Io level of maximum pilot signal path (maximum Ec/Io), as measuring at the mobile portable antennas place; With
Iorioc=as measure at the mobile portable antennas place for the available cell power in all the strongest paths that the assignment of all branches can be given it and (Is_tot), divided by deducting Is_tot at mobile portable antennas place total received power (Itot).Three branches being arranged and have three branches at least for travelling carriage is available (that is, because because all signal path intensity of Ec/Io enough greatly can these branches of assignment) forward signal path, and these paths are selected corresponding to sub-district (k, l, m) three the strongest paths (e, f, g) situation has
Is0[k]＝fng_frc_fwd[e，k]*Pcell(k)；
Is1[l]＝fng_frc_fwd[f，l]*Pcell(l)；
Is2[m]＝fng_frc_fwd[g，m]*Pcell(m)；
Is_tot＝Is0[k]+Is1[l]+Is2[m]；
ioric＝Is_tot/(Itot-Is_tot)；
NbNo_tgt＝f(MaxPilot，ecio_0)/ecio_1，ecio_1/ecio_2，
Speed, iorioc, the frame quality level of hope) wherein f () can be one by the Ec/Io look-up table of above-mentioned all parameter retrievals;
Ptarget_fwd＝Maxpilot*EbNo_tgt/(met[e，k]+
Met[f, l]+met[g, m]) be for the required forward power of each forward path.Notice that this implementation supposes that all forward paths all have equal transmission (speech or Traffic Channel) power-pilot power ratio.
Below, controller 113 limits the forward link power (Ptarget_fwd) of each sub-district in step 530 according to an admissible minimum and maximum horizontal, and minimum may be different to each sub-district with maximum horizontal.Then, controller 113 storages are for each x, and the Ptarget_fwd of y is so that also produce the forward power grid in step 530.
For with corresponding each forward signal path (forward link) in a different sub-district, controller 113 is then at each place at all antenna connectors of sub-district, step 533 pair corresponding all reverse signals path, suppose that travelling carriage launching the power of 1 milliwatt (mW-Pcur), calculate Eb/No ' s (EbNo (icd)).Then, also in step 533 with these reverse signal paths Eb/No (EbNo_sum) addition.Then, controller 113 calculates required transmission power of mobile station in step 536, it is to obtain the required power of a target Eb/No (EbNo_rtar), this target is for after selecting behind the frame on using from a position of all frames of all service districts (CBSC) behind all frames of service district (BTS) decoding or in the situation at soft handover, keeps the frame quality level of a hope needed.With the situation that each antenna is had two sub-district k that postpone extensions paths and the two-way soft handover of l as an example:
EbNo_sum＝EbNo_rtch[k11]+EbNo_rtch[k12]+
EbNo_rtch[k21]+EbNo_rtch[k22]+EbNo_rtch[l11]+
EbNo_rtch[l12]+EbNo_rtch[l21]+EbNo_rtch[l22] wherein
Icd=is at the reverse signal path d corresponding to the antenna c place of cell i;
EbNo_rtch[i

Fng_frc_rev[i

NoWc[i
Cd]=about the thermal noise power of antenna c by the receiver generation of service district i;
Nbackground[i
CdThe noise that]=by all non-CDMA source produces (that is, artificial noise or simulation disturb);
EbNo_tgt=h (the frame quality of hope, speed, 100W);
EbNo_tgt2=h (the frame quality of hope, speed, capacity (headroon) before the power);
Ptarget_rev1(u)＝EbNo_tgt+Pcur(u)-EbNo_sum；
Poor before the power between the transmitting power Ptarget_rev1 (u) of the maximum transmission power of capacity=travelling carriage and needs; With
Ptarget_rev2(u)＝EbNo_tgt2+Pcur(u)-EbNo_sum。Arrive this, the required remote-control device power level of controller 113 storages, it is needed so that also produce required backward power grid in step 536 for the frame quality level that reaches a hope (Ptarget_rev2 (u)).
On the basis of finishing the parametric grid generation, all travelling carriages are moved on to all repositions and repeat at first to restrain the calculating of grid then.This forms for the one group grid of each parameter on one group of location of mobile station, and has reflected each locational possible condition in the system, and no matter whether a travelling carriage is positioned at the there and how many times occurs on this group location of mobile station.Each group location of mobile station is called one " whereabouts ", seems that all travelling carriages just drop in the interesting areas.
Epoch time method
When on epoch time, producing one group of grid, implement all grid computings itself in identical mode.Difference is the mode that the transmitting power in travelling carriage and base station produces.In this case, all transmitting powers do not converge to their optimal average, but the simulation that is launched by the real time sequence of an analogue system produces the control messages transmission of simulating free sequence power control and being expressed.
Minimum time resolution from the simulation of several seconds or several branches after certain time interval is calculated all parametric grids.In this situation, the order of all grids is important.Can think not only by one group of location of mobile station, and by all grids of all these grid group of search of increment in the time.So, when an interested special parameter is " bad ", know not only how it takes place to know also how long this parameter has gone bad frequently.In addition, all noise effects that comprise these system defects from the grid in all epoch time that all defectives of real system (for example, system is connected on position not being best or the one group of position) are calculated.
In case determined all parametric grids, just realized calculating an effective method of all parameters.Below explanation is used to calculate several grids " instrument " of all numbers.
Single mesh tool
If a hard-threshold (for example, the forward link power of 2W) can be set, each summit by checking each a grid and criterion by/failure is set can operates grid group so.As an example, if know that with forward power grid and hope power required in which type of mark of time surpasses 2W, then can test each grid, and, count that grid for the grid that passes through (that is, need greater than 2W).If for one given at x1, the summit of y1 has N grid to pass through, and M grid arranged, on whole group, at summit x1, y1 passes through criterion in the N/M of time so.To all summit xi, yj repeats this process, and wherein i is that the exponential sum j for x in the grid is the index for y in the grid.Like this, will taper to single grid for the whole grid group of a special parameter, wherein all value representatives in grid are by the probability of certain criterion.Can accomplish this point well equally for all grids, but the time grid group will comprise all additive corrections for actual performance from all spaces or epoch time.
If certain the predetermined sub-fraction in the time is not passed through standard, think that then in this locational performance be unacceptable, controller 113 is taken action and is changed the performance of duration of work system.Calculating the situation of forward link, in the predetermined path loss file that all forward links and the power of reverse link of system is stored in controller 113 inside.This file is measured or calculated to available well-known technology in advance.(for example, the transmitter 300 of base station 102 among Fig. 3) ability can be calculated with controller 113 so and impact those regional noises above emission power amplifier to be transmitted into the power that goes in the zone if desired.This is because as shown in top calculating, determine that the power that needs comprises all service channel powers and from all pilot tone/pagings/synchronizing channel power of all base stations in the system.Might reduce all pilot tone/pagings/synchronizing channel power, thereby reduce the noise in the zone that covering problem is arranged from one or several base stations in the system.So the required power from base station transmitter can discharge to realizing a satisfied enough power that connects.
The method that reduces power is as follows.At first, in for those regional expression formulas that are confirmed as " being unsatisfied with ", find all noise items.All pilot tone/pagings/synchronizing channel power for the base station that the maximum noise item is arranged is reduced predetermined amount, for example a 3dB.Consider such minimizing, calculate by reappraise whole system and repeated grid and repeat this calculating.If thought in the past that unsatisfied zone became satisfied now, and or there is not new unsatisfied zone to be detected, perhaps produced a less unsatisfied zone, this just points out that all conditions for current time are with all pilot tone/pagings/synchronizing channel power setting De Taigao so.By this way, produce the cdma system control of improvement according to the present invention.
Also can recognize importantly all zones rather than their size according to the present invention.A map of cellular system overlay area is placed in the memory of controller 113.With the map of each sub-segments represent it to give to(for) several assignments of the relative importance of as a whole system.For example, from the possessory viewpoint of communication system, a urban central zone may be more important than the zone on the cemetery.Produce a regional parametric grid and considering all pilot tone/pagings/synchronizing channel power, after implementing an assessment, zone (as described above) that is considered to unacceptable and is correspondingly changed in fact greater than the zone that is corrected but more inessential be possible.In this situation, a variation is implemented in the zone according to the importance that the present invention is based on the zone.
Be important to note that method that in cdma communication system characterization covers and load immediately produces a new parametric grid (or organize parametric grid) after the variation more and grid (or a plurality of grid) is reappraised so that determine the ability whether overall performance of system has improved or reduced by can taking place especially, provides the system of improvement to control in system.Like this, some other importance of communication system is worsened, try so next noise source is carried out an adjustment if the signal that maximum noise is arranged is carried out a power adjustment.The mode that can also make up tries all other noise sources are carried out all adjustment, up to problem solved or an alarm till the operator of a system reports generation problem once more.The alarm of report can be taked many forms, comprises the outstanding unacceptable and zone that can not be solved of a map that shows all grid computings and (by light, color, or other these class methods).Similarly, can so that point out the problem that can not save be arranged in the zone of assignment to the operator of the system ASCII message of glistening.
Characterization covering and loading in a cdma communication system be so that another method of improvement system control is to be evaluated in the parametric grid that (a bit) base station contribute the forward link power of maximum in a given zone, and remove the contribution of that base station from calculating.Be actually, deduct the power of the base station of self-interference from the communication channel noise.If do the problem that can solve in above-mentioned mode in the unacceptable zone like this, controller 113 can limit the quantity that permission is connected with the base station of that interference so.After certain period, be possible to (by the regeneration of all parametric grids) expression of reappraising that carry out in the zone of initial generation trouble no problem (perhaps being) because from a minimizing of the base station of other all part of system.In this situation, can allow all quantity that communicates to connect of the base station of self-interference to increase once more.
In a similar mode, can be with same tool applications to useful all pilot tone grids.For example, how our quantity of wishing to determine all useful all pilot tones surpasses the available all Rake demodulation branch in travelling carriage frequently.When the pilot number in a specific region surpassed the useful quantity of travelling carriage 105, additional all signals only were to be added to the noise on the receiver and quality of signals is degenerated.On the other hand, may have only two pilot tones, but owing to the delay in these two pilot signals is expanded, three branches in travelling carriage 105 all in use.In this situation, more signal may destroy the quality of signals that is received by travelling carriage.If this situation, as in above-mentioned example, controller 113 is known the power of pilot signals all in system, thereby also knows the power of all noises.Determine once more by the noise signal of the maximum of representing from the gross power of another base station and all pilot tone/pagings/synchronizing channel power of that base station of reduction.According to the present invention, the zone of (on an equal basis or more importantly) unacceptable performance is not arranged by producing another in the system of reappraising after, change the size of available pilot number or available signal to noise ratio, can improve cdma system control.
As another example, can determine whether the covering in the reverse link of certain zone from system is unacceptable with the backward power grid.The transmitter 200 that can not be moved platform 105 when the noise in the receiver 203 in base station 102 overcomes and this situation just takes place therefore can not provide suitable quality of connection the time.This noise not only is the sub-district by base station 102 services, and can be from around the system.Controller 113 is known the position and their corresponding all connections and all contributions of each travelling carriage in the system, and it is known contributing the travelling carriage of most of noise to the base station in a specific region like this.These knowledge has been arranged, and controller 113 can indicate all their power of travelling carriage minimizing that goes out contribution till problematic zone is covered satisfactorily.So can be with this as the basis of a restriction so that be restricted to/from the connection of all base stations of all sub-districts of causing problem, up to all conditions change make these connect cause a problem in the zone that trouble is no longer being arranged till.To can not produce other negative influence to any covering because cancel all connections, thus different with the situation of forward link, other all zones of not needs assessment.
The operating personnel of cellular system may record, perhaps controller 113 may be followed the tracks of, the appearance in all alarms or problematic all zones, if and during operation a zone or a plurality of zone in the pre-predetermined sub-fraction of work purpose or when becoming unacceptable in the time, so individually or piece all parametric grids of obtaining can produce a indication about the type and/or the seriousness of problem.Then can be by increasing all base stations, address these problems with different antenna etc.If will be described in greater detail below, we realize this explanation.
Many mesh tools
The complexity that CDMA is bigger means that the grid that statistics ground is assessed simultaneously more than usually is useful.Assess parametric grid at one time, can obtain a more comprehensive understanding cdma system more than one.
For example, first kind of combination of checked all grids is all grids that need forward direction and power of reverse link.Because a cellular communication is two-way, the quality that forward direction and power of reverse link both need.If any one poor quality wherein, then the quality of communication is just bad probably.Remember this point, check corresponding all grid points on each grid.Be important to note that for each grid and test available different standard.For example, the forward link power that needs may be less than 33dBm, and the power of reverse link that needs may be less than 20dBm.If both are real in this point, this is a condition of passing through for that summit.Now, as mentioned above, the probability that passes through for each summit is that N/M and two grids (in fact) have been reduced to the individual probability grid.The candidate that the resulting all zones that can not satisfy the grid of standard were studied as future.
For example, on the Ec/Io grid of reverse link grid and the best, be unacceptable all zones simultaneously, particularly, usually can be counted as being subjected to the infringement of " path loss " problem in the situation of light load.In other words, may not having in cdma system can be with that regional base station of acceptable quality services.Yet, when cdma system begins load, thisly be subjected to one " and path loss " all may disappearance at leisure of problem infringement.If controller 113 can not reduce to main all interference an acceptable level, because may need the redesign of a system, will send this regional alarm (as mentioned above) so to a system operator.
As another example, when the Ec/Io of the best grid (for example shows a unacceptable value, one is lower than-value of 13dB) and the quantity of the measured all pilot tone grids of matter point out " in a large number " pilot tone (for example, land) time, these pilot tones may be interfering with each other and be produced the peculiar problem of this situation--and the neither one pilot tone be it seems good quality.This be not one aforesaid " path loss " problem, but path loss is too low for the too many base station from problematic zone.We know this condition that is a trouble for all CDMA control system with former technology.In order to alleviate this problem, reduce the power of one (or a plurality of) in these pilot tones according to the present invention.Just can not accomplish this point if do not damage certain other important zone, have to so a base station (or a plurality of base station) removed so that address this problem.Can be by controller 113 these new base station locations of reappraising as described above.
The time grid instrument
In this case, can be to special grid group of a specified conditions search, this condition satisfies the grid of a specific quantity in the sequence, when all grids turned round on epoch time, this time of many seconds of representative.When all grids only are that this can not have an effect when producing on epoch in the space.
As an example, consider when the forward direction that needs and power of reverse link all periods during above available power.For the period of all weak points, this condition may be acceptable; For all long periods, this condition obviously is unacceptable.Included by the time in will assessing, the grid that obtains at last is described in the probability of that specific incident that each position takes place.There are many modes can report this incident, comprise the quantity that report takes place, total duration of all generations, total sub-fraction time of all generations etc.
System based on this time grid instrument controls with above-described similar, and just what is considered to " unacceptable " in a different mode.In above-mentioned discussion, mean that the average behavior of all links in the problem is used to the meaning of definition " unacceptable ".But in fact for a long time allly on average may cover all seriously unacceptable performances, and all users of a cellular system may react to all short-period poor qualities' business in a kind of mode of subjectively negating in fact than short-term.
Use this mesh tool, available here standard can be N period of " bad " service, or T second grow the time interim t at least second duration.In a much simple structure, any period or at least the bad business of t second can be this condition.The definition of these unacceptable business and/or quality is adjustable in controller 113.
With before in all CDMA controllers of technology, " covering " is expressed out as a function of single variable such as path loss or carrier wave-interference ratio.By finish all parametric grids according to the present invention, not only considered path loss, and individually and/or side by side considered to postpone to expand, power control to all travelling carriages in the system, by all variations in the radio sensitivity of mobile station speed generation, all states of soft handover in whole system, receiver in received energy efficient and for other all variable of forward direction and/or reverse link.In epoch time,, can cause increasing the knowledge of the link-quality that obtains by all simple statistical method of using in the past with the time expansion of system.In addition, calculating is carried out on whole interesting areas.
Therefore, we wish that the present invention can not limited by above-described all embodiment, but comprise that all bases invest all kinds of change that the spirit and scope of all claims of the application are made, all kinds of correction, all kinds of variation.When showing particularly with reference to certain embodiments and describes when of the present invention, those personnel that are skilled in technique will understand and can make the various variation in formal and the details here and do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.We think corresponding all structures that all methods in below the claim or step add all function element, all materials, all effects and all equivalents are included as any structure, material or the effect of implementing all functions and other all element combination of prescription especially.
