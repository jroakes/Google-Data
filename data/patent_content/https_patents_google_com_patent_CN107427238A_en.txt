Abstract
This document describes the measurement of optical centre vein pressure.In order to optically determine the central venous pressure (CVP) of people, the video on the right side of the neck of the people is captured.As an example, medical worker records the video on the right side of the neck of the people by using smart phone.On the right side of the neck for capturing the people, because the right side is the position where the vena jugularis externa and jugular vein of the people, and occur available for measurement CVP pulsating motion in those veins.Then the video is handled according to video motion amplifying technique to generate the reconstructing video on the right side of the neck of the people.In the reconstructing video, the pulsating motion of the venous system for the people for occurring to locate on the right side of the person neck is amplified by vision.By using the reconstructing video, the distance between the peak value of pulsating motion and the anatomical features of the people after the visually amplification is measured.Measure the CVP that the distance between the peak value of the pulsating motion after the obtained visually amplification and described anatomical features are used to determine the people.These technologies make it possible to determine CVP in the case of the estimation made independent of medical worker.
Description
Relevant application
The U.S. Patent Application No. 14/ that the application requires to submit on May 19th, 2015 according to 35 U.S.C. § 119 (e)
The priority of 715, No. 793, the disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
Background technology
As the part for the treatment of patient (the more importantly patient with critical illness), medical worker assesses and solved
The Hemodynamics of patient.The one of which measurement useful to the Hemodynamics of medical worker assessment patient is central venous pressure
(CVP), central venous pressure (CVP) is the venacaval blood pressure of chest near the atrium dextrum of the heart of patient.Due to CVP in itself
It is identical with right atrial pressure, so CVP is the important clinical measurement of right ventricular filling pressure.Filling pressure determines the preceding load of right ventricle,
The preceding load directly affects stroke volume by Frank-Starling mechanism.Standard first order modeling prediction CVP change, which is equal to, to be held
The change with Venous compliance is eliminated in quantitative change.In this degree, CVP increases with venous blood volume or the increasing with intravenous tension
Add and increase.CVP this increase can indicate the excessive blood volume of patient, heart failure or breathing problem.
However, the routine techniques for measuring CVP is not that shortcoming is not present.For example, some conventional skills for measuring CVP
Art has traumatic, and is related to and inserts the catheter into subclavian vein or jugular vein, wherein, tip is located in atrium dextrum
In the vena cave in front.Although this traumatic examination can accurately measure the CVP of people, it is done so that expense it is more high
Hold high and great wound and pressure can be caused to human body.On the other hand, can be due to medical matters people for measuring CVP atraumatic technique
Member level of skill and technology change and can not be consistent.Generally, noninvasive CVP measurement requests medical worker visually estimates
The peak height (can be raised by the blood that pulsating motion is observed) of the pulsating wave in the vena jugularis externa or jugular vein of people is counted, so
The height is measured according to the angulus sterni of people afterwards.Because this technology relies on the position terminated by particular medical person with regard to pulsating wave
The unpredicted vision estimation made with the height based on angulus sterni, so this technology can not be consistent.Further,
In order to carry out these measurements, medical worker receives substantial amounts of training.Equally, noninvasive CVP measurements are almost completely by fine craftsmanship
Doctor perform so that its use cost outside clinic or hospital environment is too high.Traumatic CVP e measurement technologies and noninvasive
The shortcomings that CVP e measurement technologies, causes it not ideal in many cases.
The content of the invention
This document describes the measurement of optical centre vein pressure.In order to optically determine the central venous pressure of people (CVP), capture
The video of the neck of the people.As an example, medical worker records the video on the right side of the neck of the people by using smart phone.
Preferably, on the right side of the neck for capturing the people, because on the right side of neck it is the location of vena jugularis externa and jugular vein of people, and
These veins are vertically filled based on CVP.Because right side is closer to atrium dextrum, so right side ratio left side is more highly preferred to.Due to neck
Internal jugular vein has the more direct path for leading to atrium, so compared with vena jugularis externa, accordingly it is also preferred that capture jugular vein.
Then for example, application on the smart phone for passing through medical worker, video is handled according to video motion amplifying technique with

The pulsating motion of the venous system of the people.In other words, according to make it possible to observe possibly can not be perceived by the human eye it is trickle
The mode of pulsating motion amplifies these motions.In addition, for example, by using the reference background feature in smart phone or integrated
At least one in formula orientation sensor measures the vertical orientation of the dissection of people.
By using reconstructing video, the anatomical features of peak value and people to pulsating motion after amplification are (for example, under people
Jaw angle or ear-lobe) the distance between measure.For example, being measured during the apnea of people, analysis can be passed through
Reconstructing video is to determine the respiratory rate of people, so as to find out apnea.Under any frequency, measurement is obtained after amplification
Pulsating motion peak value and the distance between anatomical features with the vertical orientation of dissection and from anatomical features to angulus sterni
Know that distance combines, to determine the CVP of people.For example, although the reconstructing video from amplification pulsating motion determines that CVP may not be produced
With testing equally accurate data in traumatic cardiac, but this method hardly causes any harm and is easy to people
Performed by medical worker.Further, technique described herein makes it possible to make in the medical worker independent of fine craftsmanship

General introduction
This document describes the dress that the technology measured using optical centre vein pressure and enabled optical centre vein pressure are measured
Put.By using these technologies and device, the central venous pressure (CVP) of people can be non-invasively measured, and with relying on medical matters people
The Present clinical agreement for the vision estimation that member is difficult to make is compared, and has more preferable repeatability using these technologies and device.And
And alternatively, technique described herein alternatively can measure automatically and reduce medical worker it is determined that people CVP with
CVP measurement apparatus is positioned to the effect in terms of the position that can capture the video of people.In certain embodiments, can make
CVP Automatic surveys, the degree of automation are that can make one to carry out self-management to measurement.By extensively using these technologies,
CVP measurements can be uniformly established in the case where not carrying out invasive surgery to patient.
(such as, it is configured with video camera as an example, medical worker can hold CVP measurement apparatus and CVP measures application
Smart phone) capture the video on the right side of the neck of people.Then can be by application by using one or more kinds of video motions
Amplifying technique is handled the video captured, the result is that generating reconstructing video, in the reconstructing video, visually
It is exaggerated the pulsating motion that the venous system of the people on the right side of its neck occurs.In one example, the reconstructing video enhances
Move and alternatively extend the time (for example, slow motion), can be simply used for manually identifying peak value by medical worker
And CVP measurements are carried out by using Present clinical agreement.In at least some embodiments, as described below, CVP can be surveyed
Amount automation.
Using reconstructing video, the component of application can measure the peak value of pulsating motion and the solution of people after visually amplification
Cut open the distance between feature (for example, angle of mandible of people).If allowing the orientation of people to change, CVP measurement apparatus may be used also
To find out the vertical orientation of the dissection of people during measurement, such as, by the inner orientation sensor of CVP measurement apparatus or make
With reference background object.Peak value and the distance between anatomical features and people based on the pulsating motion after visually amplifying
Vertical orientation, it may be determined that CVP.By to the anatomical features and standard clinical reference feature (for example, angulus sterni of people) in people
The distance between carry out disposable patient-specific calibration measurement, CVP can be converted into standard clinical reference absolute measurement.So
(for example, on display of the smart phone of medical worker) CVP can be presented to medical worker in the user interface afterwards.
Under certain situation, user interface can show reconstructing video to medical worker and covering for the information including identified CVP is presented
Lid.
Therefore, the position for the pulsating motion being maintained at by paying the effort of very little by device in the venous system of recorder
In, CVP consistent evaluation can be made within the relatively short time.When repeat action and a period of time (for example,
Every a few houres, every several days or every several weeks in one day) interior execution action when, the action is determined for the CVP of people
Trend.In view of in the course for the treatment of for being related to intravenous fluid recovery, the technology of the video captured using CVP measurement apparatus is true
The CVP for determining people has been held in the level of instruction normal blood flow amount.By using this technology, medical worker can avoid wound
Property CVP measurement process, it is possible to reducing damage probability caused by the trauma associated with these processes.
This can simply perform a simple examples of the mode of optical centre vein pressure measurement, and other show is provided below
Example and details.This document turning now to the example of the part of the dissection with the relevant reference people of measurement CVP exemplary environments, this
Afterwards, example optical center venous pressure measuring device and method and exemplary computing system are described.
Example context
Fig. 1 is the schematic diagram for the example context 100 that can use the measurement of optical centre vein pressure.Environment 100 illustrates work
Centered on the people 102 and in some cases of object that measures of vein pressure (CVP), the knot for the CVP that storage optical measurement obtains
The medical records 104 of fruit.The example is using the CVP measurement apparatus 106 for being capable of optical measurement CVP.In Fig. 1 particular example,
CVP measurement apparatus 106 is configured to smart phone, however, it is possible to consider other configurations.Illustrate and be used in schematic diagram below
The other configurations of optical measurement CVP CVP measurement apparatus 106.
Other entities can be communicated to from CVP measurement apparatus 106 by CVP measurement data 108, such as, store medical records 104
ISP, some other computing devices away from CVP measurement apparatus (not shown) etc..CVP measurement data 108 can wrap
Include the data for the CVP that instruction is determined by CVP measurement apparatus 106.Alternatively or in addition, CVP measurement data 108 can include
By CVP measurement apparatus 106 capture be used for determine CVP original video, according to one or more kinds of video motion amplifying techniques
The video captured is handled and caused reconstructing video, to the distance between the anatomical structure of pulsating wave and people 102
Measurement etc..Due to can (the different types of data be actually represented from capturing by these different types of data
Video determines the different piece during CVP) in each data be communicated to remote computing device, it is possible in difference
Computing device at perform CVP determination process different piece.So do, can be unloaded from CVP measurement apparatus 106
(offload) CVP computation burden is determined from the video captured.In addition, in home health care or the feelings of tele-medicine
Under condition, communication CVP measurement data 108 enables measurement remotely to check its accuracy by well-trained medical worker.
Generally, CVP measurement apparatus 106 can capture the video of people 102.As an example, CVP measurement apparatus 106 is by making
The video of people is captured by the use of including as the camera of a part for CVP measurement apparatus 106.It is such as described herein below
, after the video to capturing is handled, CVP measurement apparatus 106 can determine from the reconstructing video as caused by processing
The CVP of people 102.
For context, consider that Fig. 2, Fig. 2 illustrate the part relevant with CVP measurements of people and its cardiovascular system.Depending on
Figure 200 shows the vena jugularis externa 202, jugular vein 204 and angulus sterni 206 of people 102.View 200 also show people's 102
The atrium dextrum 208 of heart.
Using the routine techniques for noninvasively estimating CVP, make one 102 and lie on the back on bed 210.In some cases, use
Tangential light source generates shade and makes vein movement more obvious.Bed 210 is increased with incremental mode, so that the angle of the head of a bed
Degree is in 30 degree, 45 degree, 60 degree and 90 degree.Peak systole (by pulsating motion it was observed that blood rise) is based on atrium dextrum
The vertical range of side, therefore, when being uprised on head and neck with the increase at angle of inclination, peak value can decline.Medical worker
Determine that there is which angle optimal peaks visible to mark using preferable angle of inclination, it is then determined that vein pressure 212.Therefore,
Measurement apparatus 214 is placed on the angulus sterni 206 of people 102, and measure vena jugularis externa either jugular vein 202 or
The peak height (by pulsating motion it was observed that blood rise) for the pulsating wave observed respectively in 204.Therefore, the measurement and breastbone
Estimate that pulsating motion can respectively reach the point of peak value in vena jugularis externa either jugular vein 202 or 204 with observer in angle 206
Between vertical range it is corresponding.Therefore, these technologies largely rely on observer (for example, medical worker) and estimate to pulse
Athletic meeting reaches the position of peak value.
Even if assume that medical worker can accurately and consistently estimate that pulsating motion reaches the point of peak value, but some pulsation fortune
It is dynamic excessively trickle, so that these pulsating motions can not be perceived by the human eye.It is different from conventional noninvasive CVP e measurement technologies, retouch herein
The technology amplification non motion of human eye stated, so that its is visible.Further, when measurement is by the group of CVP measurement apparatus 106
When part performs, these technologies estimate that the pulsating wave observed in the neck of people 102 reaches the position of peak value independent of observer
Put.On the contrary, CVP measurement apparatus 106 determines CVP from the reconstructing video for being visually exaggerated pulsating motion of people 102.Therefore,
Medical worker participates in determining that CVP can be simplified as that CVP measurement apparatus 106 is only placed on to the neck that can capture people 102 right side
In the position of the video of side.
As shown in example context 100, CVP measurement apparatus 106 can show user interface 110 so that reconstructing video is presented,
In the reconstructing video, the pulsating motion occurred in the neck of people 102 is visually exaggerated.User interface 110 includes vision

Pulsating motion possibly can not be perceived by the human eye, but amplify the pulsating motion according to one or more kinds of video motion amplifying techniques
So that its visible scene in reconstructing video.Furthermore it is possible to by the time lengthening of reconstructing video playback (for example, so as to slow
Manner of execution plays back the reconstructing video), so as to more easily identify the peak height of pulsating wave and identify directly atrial contraction it
Preceding time interval, measured during the time interval.User interface 110 also includes some fingers of covering reconstructing video
Show, include the instruction-in this case of anatomical features 114, angle of mandible, the peak value and Vertical surveyors' staff for indicating pulsating motion
It is the line 116 of (Vertical surveyors' staff indicate vertical orientation and distance), corresponding with the peak value of the pulsating motion 112 after visually amplification
The peak value of pulsating motion after measurement 118 and the visually amplification with previously being observed in reconstructing video is corresponding previously to have been surveyed
Amount 120.Alternatively, the heart rate and respiratory rate of patient can also be shown in the user interface 110.By not received a large amount of trainings
Librarian use in the case of, anatomical guidance covering can be presented to help to instruct being appropriately directed for camera in user interface 110.
By being regarded by the measurement 118 associated with the video once captured and previously measurement 120 and with what is captured at the time earlier
The associated measurement of frequency is compared, it may be determined that the CVP of people 102 trend.
