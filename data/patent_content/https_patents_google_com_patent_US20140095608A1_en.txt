- the server 101 of the various embodiments includes a pinned-content database 103 that contains metadata for associations made among content as described below in further detail.
- the server 101 may access the pinned-content database 103 and may provide information, such as, but not limited to, links or portions of pinned content that may be pinned to index positions of primary content when the primary content is accessed at the given index positions.
- the access may be by the same user or other users 123 who connect to the server 101 over a network such as the Internet.
- first content is an “second content”
- second content is an “indexed” content. That is, the primary content or second content has an indexing scheme such as time based, frame based, page based, etc., and that has a given granularity (for example, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.) where a position within that given granularity may be indicated as an “index position” by index information or index input that can be provided to the server 101 via an electronic device, for example, through a user interface.
- the “first content” may become a “pinned content” after association with a second content at an index position of the second content in accordance with the methods of operations disclosed and described herein in accordance with the various embodiments.
- An “accessed” first content as used herein refers to the first content being consumed, that is, viewed, by a user and which the user decides to “pin” to another second content (i.e., an “indexed” second content) by way of one of the various embodiments herein disclosed.
- the browser application 109 may send queries 113 to a search engine 117 and obtain results 115 which are displayed by the browser application 109 , as understood by those of ordinary skill. Additionally the browser application 109 may access a video catalog 119 which may provide access to a video database 121 . Likewise the search engine 117 may provide results 115 to the browser application 109 by searching the contents of the video database 121 .

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure is related generally to social-media networks and, more particularly, to tagging content within a social-media framework.
- Social media enable social network members to comment or “like” or “dislike” certain pieces of content such as articles and videos. Usually, a browser application window displays content, such as an article or video, and provides various button widgets each associated with a given social network. By selecting an appropriate one of these buttons, a user may “share” the article or video with other users who are members, or are logged in to, the respective social network. Other users may see an indication of how many times certain content has been “shared,” e-mailed, “tweeted,” etc., or may be able to view comments added to the content by other users.

The following description is based on embodiments of the claims and should not be taken as limiting the claims with regard to alternative embodiments that are not explicitly described herein.
- The present disclosure provides a system and methods of operation that enable a user to “pin” a piece of content to a second indexed content, at a given index position. For example, a user may pin a Web article to a video at a specific time (i.e., an index position) in the video, or to a specific scene. When the same user, or another user, accesses the video and arrives at the specific index position (such as the appropriate time, scene, or frame), that user will be given access to, or information about, the pinned article. The embodiments provide, among other advantages, an enhancement to the informational value of indexed content such as video, audio, electronic books, or other forms of indexed content by enabling associations (i.e., pinning) of other interesting or useful information content at specific relevant index locations. Put another way, the various embodiments provide a new form of, or, a new way of creating, hypermedia that enable users to obtain supplementary materials in various formats related to indexed content. The embodiments also provide a new form of collecting and sharing that enables the content to be available along with the right context (access of an indexed content) and at the right time (at the index position) to a user.
- One disclosed method includes receiving content-association input including identification of an accessed first content and an index position of a second content and associating the accessed first content with the second content at the index position of the second content in response to the content-association input. When a user subsequently accesses the second content, that user is provided with information related to the first content in response to access of the second content. The information provided is based on the association of the first content with the second content and may include a link to the first content, a description of the first content, a portion of the first content, or the entire first content.
- A user may search for the second content using a search engine, for example, or the second content may be determined automatically. Automatic determination of the second content may include determining a list of suggested second-content choices and providing a most relevant choice from the list. In some embodiments, a user interface is provided with a selectable option to view the list of suggested second-content choices. The second content may then be displayed based on selection from the list of suggested second-content choices. The list of suggested second-content choices may also be based upon accessed content indicated in a user history.
- In some embodiments a user interface may be provided on a first device while the first content is displayed on a second device. The user interface is operative to send the content-association input to a server. The indexed second content may be, but is not limited to, video. The video may have a time index or a frame index, where an index position corresponds to a time in the video or a frame in the video. Other indexing schemes may also be used.
- Another disclosed method includes providing a user interface within an application window while the application window displays a first content. A second window is then provided in response to selection input via the user interface. The second window displays an indexed second content and enables entry of input for creating an association of the first content with the second content at an index position. When users subsequently access the second content, the users are provided with information related to the first content in response to access of the second content.
- Index-information input may be received via the second window, with the index-information input indicating an index position of the indexed second content. An association input then creates the association of the first content to the indexed second content at the index position corresponding to the index-information input.
- A search box may be provided in the second window, prior to displaying the indexed second content. Then the indexed second content may be displayed as one of the search results obtained based on search text entered into the search box. The second content may also be determined. This may include determining a list of suggested second-content choices and displaying a most relevant choice from the list of suggested second-content choices as the indexed second content. A selectable option to view the list of suggested second-content choices may be provided. The indexed second content displayed may be based on selection from the list of suggested second-content choices. The list of suggested second-content choices may also be based upon accessed content indicated in a user history.
- The user interface within the application window may include, or may be, a selectable icon within the application window. The second window may be provided in response to selection input via the user interface and may display a thumbnail view of a video as the indexed second content. The index may be a time index, and the index position may be a point in time of the video. The second window provides a pop-up window or an additional frame of a browser application window where the browser application window is the application window.
- A disclosed system includes at least one server hosting an application accessible by multiple users. The server is operative to receive the content-association input including identification of a first content and an index position of a second content, to create an association of the first content with the second content at the index position, and to provide information related to the first content, in response to access of the second content at the index position. The server is also operative to receive index-position input via a user interface on a remote device.
- The system may include a content-suggestion server, operatively coupled to the server or integrated with the server. The content-suggestion server is operative to determine the second content in accordance with the various methods discussed briefly above.
- The system may include a user-profile database operatively coupled to the content-suggestion server, where the content-suggestion server is further operative to determine the list of suggested second-content choices based on accessed content indicated in a user history stored in the user-profile database. The content-suggestion server may include a multimedia-analysis module and a video-asset-matching module operatively coupled to the multimedia-analysis module. The multimedia-analysis module is operative to analyze the first content being displayed on the remote device. The video-asset-matching module is operative to receive analysis of the first content, to access video metadata, scene metadata, and a user profile, and to provide the remote device with at least one suggested second content.
- Turning now to the drawings,
FIG. 1 illustrates anexample network architecture 100 in accordance with an embodiment. As shown inFIG. 1 ,network architecture 100 includes anelectronic device 105 which may be a laptop, PDA, tablet, other mobile communication device, television, or some other suitable electronic device. Theelectronic device 105 includes a media application such as, but not limited to, abrowser application 109. In accordance with embodiments, the user of theelectronic device 105 provides commands andinputs 107 to thebrowser application 109, and thebrowser application 109 interacts with aserver 101 over anInternet connection 111. Theserver 101 of the various embodiments includes a pinned-content database 103 that contains metadata for associations made among content as described below in further detail. Theserver 101 may access the pinned-content database 103 and may provide information, such as, but not limited to, links or portions of pinned content that may be pinned to index positions of primary content when the primary content is accessed at the given index positions. The access may be by the same user orother users 123 who connect to theserver 101 over a network such as the Internet. - For purposes of explanation the present disclosure uses terminology including “first content,” “second content,” “primary content,” and “pinned content.” This terminology is used only to facilitate understanding and explanation of the various embodiments and is not to be construed as limiting. As used herein a “primary” content (usually referred to herein as “second content”) is an “indexed” content. That is, the primary content or second content has an indexing scheme such as time based, frame based, page based, etc., and that has a given granularity (for example, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.) where a position within that given granularity may be indicated as an “index position” by index information or index input that can be provided to the
server 101 via an electronic device, for example, through a user interface. The “first content” may become a “pinned content” after association with a second content at an index position of the second content in accordance with the methods of operations disclosed and described herein in accordance with the various embodiments. An “accessed” first content as used herein refers to the first content being consumed, that is, viewed, by a user and which the user decides to “pin” to another second content (i.e., an “indexed” second content) by way of one of the various embodiments herein disclosed. - The
browser application 109 may sendqueries 113 to asearch engine 117 and obtainresults 115 which are displayed by thebrowser application 109, as understood by those of ordinary skill. Additionally thebrowser application 109 may access avideo catalog 119 which may provide access to avideo database 121. Likewise thesearch engine 117 may provideresults 115 to thebrowser application 109 by searching the contents of thevideo database 121. - The
electronic device 105 may access some content such as, for example, an article, using thebrowser application 109. In accordance with embodiments, theserver 101, which interacts with thebrowser application 109 over theInternet connection 111, may detect the article being accessed (i.e., the accessed first content) by thebrowser application 109. However, alternatively the user may provide input that indicates that the user wishes to pin the article to an indexed second content. In this example, thebrowser application 109 may send identification of the first content such as, but not limited to, a URL link, a title, metadata, or any other suitable identification that uniquely identifies the first content and enables retrieval of the first content by theserver 101 or by other devices, i.e.,other users 123. In some embodiments, theserver 101 may send executable code over theInternet connection 111 to thebrowser application 109 to provide a user interface. The executable code for the user interface may be, for example, JavaScript or a Java applet, etc. In other embodiments, the user interface may be resident on theelectronic device 105 and may be integrated with thebrowser application 109. The user interface enables the user of theelectronic device 105 to make an association of content being viewed in thebrowser application 109 window to an indexed second content. That is, the user may pin a first content to a second content at an index position. One example is that the user may pin a Web article to a video at a scene or point in time (i.e., the “index position”) of the video. - In one example embodiment, the
server 101 may display a search box within the user interface such that the user may enter search text and obtain a result within the user interface. The search results may include a list of videos from thevideo catalog 119. If the user wishes to pin the article to a scene or specific location within the video, the user interface may allow the user to scroll to the appropriate frame or time within the video. The user interface may also enable a user to select a portion of a video frame image for pinning of the article. For example, the video frame image may be divided up into sections or may allow pinning to pixel areas within the image. The user may then provide content-association input to pin the article to the scene or time within the video (or to a location on the frame in embodiments having this granularity of indexing). In other words, the user makes an association of first content being viewed within thebrowser application 109 window to the second indexed content at an index position (time, frame, scene, etc.). - In another example embodiment, a user may have multiple devices such as a
laptop 105 and atablet 125. In this example, one device may view the first content, such as an article, while the other device provides a user interface for entry of content-association input that is provided to theserver 101. For example, theelectronic device 105 may be used to browse content on the Web. In some embodiments, theserver 101 may detect the browsed content and send suggested second content items for pinning to the user's secondelectronic device 125. As mentioned, theelectronic device 125 has a user interface that may be part of a resident application, i.e., resident on theelectronic device 125, or, alternatively, an application provided by theserver 101 to theelectronic device 125. Examples of applications provided by theserver 101 include a cloud-based application accessible by logging in to the cloud-based application service (“Software as a Service”) or a Java applet or JavaScript pushed to theelectronic device 125 as a client device. When theelectronic device 125 acts in the role of “client,” theserver 101 may include context awareness of the user's multiple devices such as theelectronic device 105 and theelectronic device 125, so that the first content viewed on theelectronic device 105 is used by theserver 101 to provide second content suggestions or to allow the user to make associations in accordance with the embodiments. The devices may also share information about content being viewed, in some embodiments, via status-announcement messages sent in a peer-to-peer manner between the devices. In other alternative embodiments, content information may be queried using various interoperability protocols, for example, the “GetMediaInfo” command specified by DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standards may be utilized. In other embodiments, an application on one of the devices may utilize audio or video signatures or watermarks to determine the first content on the other device and to obtain that information from the other device in a peer-to-peer manner. - The
electronic device 105 may also include a first user interface, such as, but not limited to, a selectable icon or “button” that enables the user to initiate a second user interface or additional user interface features and capabilities on theelectronic device 125. That is, the user may provide input that sends theserver 101 identification information that identifies the first content being viewed on theelectronic device 105 and that informs thatserver 101 that the user wishes to make an association with a second content. Theserver 101 may, in response, provide executable code (such as a Java applet or JavaScript or some other suitable executable code) to theelectronic device 125 to provide a user interface. The user may then use theelectronic device 125 to obtain second content, either by searching or by server suggestions and to provide content-association input to pin the first content viewed on theelectronic device 105 with a second content viewed on theelectronic device 125. The user may provide index input in various ways such as using a scroll bar, direct input of a numerical index indication, identification of a page, video frame, or any other suitable index input, etc., that conveys an index position of the second content to theserver 101. Theserver 101 then creates an association of the first content with the second content at the index position based on the index input and content-association input. - The content-association input is entered by a user into the electronic device 105 (or into the electronic device 125) via a user interface and includes at least identification of the first content (i.e., the content to be pinned) and an index position of the second content. The
server 101 may have a priori knowledge of the identity of the second content in the embodiments where theserver 101 provides a suggested second content or displays second content in a user interface for the user based on search results. An example embodiment where second content is suggested to the user is described below. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample network architecture 200 in accordance with another embodiment. Thenetwork architecture 200 includes a content-suggestion server 201. The content-suggestion server 201 may be included, or integrated, with theserver 101 in some embodiments. In this example, thebrowser application 109 includes aconnection 203 to the content-suggestion server 201, a connection over a network such as the Internet. The content-suggestion server 201 may also access a user-profile database 215 over theInternet connection 213, a video-metadata database 221 via theInternet connection 223, and a scene-metadata database 217 via theInternet connection 219. The scene-metadata database 217 may be populated by various media-analysis engines 225 which receivevideo signals 227 and perform analytics or extract the scene metadata. - The content-
suggestion server 201 may include a multimedia-analysis module 205 coupled viaconnection 209 to a video-asset-matchingmodule 207. The video-asset-matchingmodule 207 providescontent suggestions 211 to the user interface of thebrowser application 109. The content suggestions may be a listing of one or more video assets, for example. The video, that is, the indexed second content suggested by video-asset-matchingmodule 207, may be based on analysis of the content being viewed by the user within thebrowser application 109 window. That is, the multimedia-analysis module 205 may analyze viewed content for keywords, metadata, etc., to determine the list of suggested content. The video-asset-matchingmodule 207 may also access the user-profile database 215 to determine video content that was previously accessed by the user of theelectronic device 105 and to provide these content items as thecontent suggestions 211 if appropriate. Otherwise, the video-asset-matchingmodule 207 may search scene metadata from scene-metadata database 217 and video metadata from video-metadata database 221 to make the suggestions of video content to associate with the content being viewed by thebrowser application 109. - Therefore, in one example of operation, when a user accesses an article, for example, using the
browser application 109, the multimedia-analysis module 205 analyzes the article for keywords or metadata and provides the information viaconnection 209 to the video-asset-matchingmodule 207. The video-asset-matchingmodule 207 may then access the various databases to determine a suitable match or set of matches related to the article being viewed and sends thecontent suggestions 211 to thebrowser application 109. Thecontent suggestions 211 may also include suggestions for index positions within the content. For example, the video-asset-matchingmodule 207 may search within the index positions for metadata or other information that matches metadata and or other information related to the article and make appropriate suggestions based on the results. The content suggestions may be handled by the user interface provided byserver 101. Alternatively, the user interface may be resident on the electronic device. The user interface may appear as a second application window in some embodiments and may display thecontent suggestions 211 to the user of theelectronic device 105. At that point, the user may make the determination of whether or not to make an association, that is, whether or not to pin the article to an index position such as a point in time, a frame, or a scene within a particular video asset. - Although the embodiments illustrated in
FIGS. 1 and 2 are related to thebrowser application 109 and to theelectronic device 105, a browser application is not necessary in all embodiments. For example, in one embodiment a user may access a video asset via a television set without the need for any particular software application. As discussed in detail above, the user may use a second electronic device, such as theelectronic device 125, to access content related to the video. For example, user may use theelectronic device 105, such as, but not limited to a smartphone, laptop, etc., to access an article. Theelectronic device 105 may form a connection with theserver 101 via the Internet, and theserver 101 may detect the article being accessed by the user. If the electronic device such as a television is an Internet-connected device, then the television may provide the user interface that enables the user to pin the article being viewed in the handheld device to the video displayed on the television. For this example, the user may have a user account, or be logged in, on theserver 101, so that theserver 101 has awareness of the devices that are tied to that specific user in order to be able to provide the associations between the various content types. Also, the user may be provided with a user interface on the electronic device that enables pinning of the displayed article to the video displayed on the television set. Various other possibilities may occur to those of ordinary skill in view of the descriptive examples provided above. Some specific embodiments using application windows such as, but not limited to, browser application windows are now described. -
FIG. 3 is diagram showing an application window displaying a first content and having a first user interface, which is aselectable icon 307, in accordance with one embodiment. As shown inFIG. 3 , the user may access anarticle 317, having aheadline 303, via anapplication window 301. In the example embodiment illustrated byFIG. 3 , theapplication window 301 is a tabbed window of abrowser application 300. As understood by those of ordinary skill, articles such asarticle 317 may also have an associated user interface such as the “share this story”box 305. In theexample box 305, various “buttons” are provided such as, for example, a “share”button 309, a “tweet”button 311, and ane-mail button 313. Each one of these buttons allows the user to perform the associated action such as e-mailing the article to another user via “pushing” thee-mail button 313, i.e., providing selection input at thee-mail button 313. In some cases, these buttons also have an associated “number of users”balloon 315 that indicates the number of users that have engaged in the activity related to the associated button. For example, as shown in the balloon above theshare button article 317. Likewise 26 users have “tweeted” thearticle article 317. - In accordance with the embodiments, an additional “button” is provided that is, the
pin button 307 which is a selectable icon and which is a first user interface. Thepin button 307 allows initiation of pinning a piece of content to another indexed second content at an index position in accordance with the embodiments. That is, if the user decides to make an association of thearticle 317 to an indexed second content such as a video, the user may initially provide selection input at thepin button 307, which may provide an identification of thearticle 317 to theserver 101. The identification may be, for example, the URL of the article, theheadline 303, or metadata or some other suitable information that uniquely identifies thearticle 317 to theserver 101 and enables later retrieval of thearticle 317. - Turning to
FIG. 4 , after selection of thepin button 307 by the user, auser interface 400 may appear and be displayed. In some embodiments, thebrowser application 300 may receive executable code, such as JavaScript or a Java applet, or some other suitable form of executable code, from theserver 101 which when executed causes the processor of theelectronic device 105 hosting thebrowser application 300 to display theuser interface 400. In other embodiments, theuser interface 400 may be integrated into thebrowser application 300 or may otherwise be resident on theelectronic device 105. For the embodiments where a list of content suggestions is provided to the user by, for example, the content-suggestion server 201, thetop suggestion 403 may be suggested initially to the user. Theuser interface 400 may also display athumbnail view 401 of the video and anindex scroll bar 409 having aposition indicator 411 that indicates thetime 413 within the video up to amaximum runtime 415 of the video. Thetitle 407 of the video may also be displayed. If the user decides that thetop suggestion 403 is not an appropriate selection for pinning thearticle 317, then the user may select a “view all”option 405 to view a list of the other suggested video-content assets. By selecting from the list, the user may be returned to the display shown by theuser interface 400 with the selected video suggestion displayed as athumbnail view 401. The user may move theposition indicator 411 to the appropriate scene, frame, or time within the video and complete the pinning process by selecting the “post”button 419. Selecting thepost button 419 sends the content-association input to theserver 101 which proceeds to create the association in response to the inputs. The content-association input in this example includes at least the index-position information. The index position may be input in other ways in some embodiments, for example, direct entry into a text box or some other suitable input, such as, but not limited to, selecting a video frame, etc. The user may also be allowed to add comments by selecting the “comment”button 417 which will open an appropriate text box for user entry of comments. The content-association input will include at least the identification information for the indexed second content, which in this case example may be the title of the video, and an index position within the indexed second content. However, in embodiments where theserver 101 or the content-suggestion server 201 provided a single suggestion the second content identification may be already known and need not be sent again. However, when the user has some choice as to what the second content will be, the content-association input may include identification of the second content as well as the index position. The content-association input may also include any comments added by the user. The index position as described above may be thetime 413 of a specific scene within the video or an indication of the frame or scene by some other indexing scheme (such as frame number or scene number). That is, the index information provided toserver 101 viauser interface 400 depends on the indexing scheme applied to the video or other indexed content asset. The possible indexed second content is not limited to a video, but can be any indexed second content such as audio or a larger work such as a book that contains a number of pages and may be indexed by page number or another article that may be indexed by line numbers or paragraph numbers, etc. That is, the user may pinarticle 317 to a page number or paragraph number within a book or larger indexed piece of content. In other words, the indexed second content may be any type of content that is subject to an indexing scheme such as a time-indexing scheme, frame index, scene index, chapter index, page index, line numbers, paragraph numbers, or any other suitable indexing scheme. -
FIG. 5 is diagram showing theapplication window 301 displaying a first content and having a second window for searching for related content for association in accordance with one embodiment. Theuser interface 500 is an alternative to, or is preliminary to, theuser interface 400 shown inFIG. 4 , in that asearch box 505 is provided along with an indication to “find related content” 501. That is, the user is prompted by an “Enter Search Text” prompt 503 and understands that thesearch box 505 may be used to search for the second indexed content. For example, the user may entersearch text 507 that is related to the text of thearticle 317 or to theheadline 303, or some other related information, and select thesearch button 509 to obtain search results. Thus inFIG. 5 , the user may select thepin button 307 and obtain theuser interface 500, where the user may then entersearch text 507 into thesearch box 505 to perform a search for related indexed second content. The search will be directed to indexed second content, such as that found in thevideo catalog 119 illustrated inFIG. 1 or in the video-metadata database 221 illustrated inFIG. 2 , etc. - When the user obtains the search results via
user interface 500, the top suggestion of the search results may be provided to the user similar to the display illustrated byuser interface 400 inFIG. 4 . In other embodiments, the user may be immediately provided with the list of search results such that the user may select one of the specific results to be taken back to theuser interface 400. The user may then work within theuser interface 400 to select an index position within the second content and pin thearticle 317 to the specific index position. Thethumbnail view 401 displays the scene or frame corresponding to the index position. Bothuser interfaces server 101 such that theserver 101 may make associations and store the association in the pinned-content database 103. That is, the user interfaces described above allow the user to provide content-association input that is sent back to theserver 101. The content-association input may include the second content identification information and an index position within the indexed second content to pin the first content. The content-association input may also include identification of the first content. - It is to be understood that in some embodiments, the
user interfaces pin button 307. That is, theapplication window 301 may include theuser interfaces pin button 307. That is, any suitable user interface may be used such as, but not limited to, gesture input, gyroscopic control, hot buttons on a keyboard, voice activation, or any other suitable user interface. - Subsequently, when the same or another user accesses the indexed second content such as, for example, a video, and views the video up until the index position, the
server 101 will provide information related to the pinned content. For example, theserver 101 may provide either a link to the article 317 (such as an HTML link), a description of thearticle 317, theheadline 303, a portion of thearticle 317, or theentire article 317, in response to access of the second content index position. In other words, when any user pins a first content to indexed second content, a subsequent access of the second content at the index position will result in theserver 101 returning information about the pinned content such as either a link to the first content, a description of the first content, a portion of the first content, or the entire first content in response. “Access” as used herein may include viewing the second content, viewing identification information about the second content, or viewing metadata that provide other information about the second content. Further, viewing the second content about the index position may invoke theserver 101 to provide information related to the pinned content. For example, theserver 101 may provide information related to the pinned content before, after, specifically at, or during some plus/minus interval about the index position. These features may also be specified by the user in some embodiments. - In some embodiments, the recipients of such pinned content may be limited by a “friends” network such as in a social-media network. In this example, only friends in the social network will receive the pinned content that was pinned by one of their friends. The friends of the social network are recorded by
server 101 and stored along with the content associations in the pinned-content database 103. That is, theserver 101 may store permissions that enable certain users to view pinned content but not others. That is, a user may designate and provide permissions for certain users to view his pinned content but block others by setting various permissions. - Thus among other advantages of the various embodiments, a new type of informational association is provided in that a user may pin a first content to a second content at an index position, for later access by either the same user or by other users accessing the second content. The informational value of the indexed second content is therefore greatly enhanced because various indexed positions may have additional pinned content providing additional or supplemental information related to the indexed second content. Various other advantages of the embodiments may become apparent to those of ordinary skill in view of the descriptions provided herein.

FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating high-level operation of various embodiments. As shown in 601, the method of operation includes theserver 101 receiving content-association input including identification of a first content and an index position of a second content. The identification of the first content may be a URL link, a title, metadata, or any other suitable identification that uniquely identifies the first content and enables retrieval of the first content by theserver 101 or other devices. As shown in 603, theserver 101 associates the first content with the second content at the index position in response to receiving the content-association input. In 605, theserver 101 provides information related to the first content in response to access of the second content based on the association of the first content with the second content. Access as used herein may include viewing the second content, viewing identification information about the second content, or viewing metadata that provide other information about the second content. - As discussed in detail above, a user interface may be provided for receiving content-association input. The user interface may also display an indexed second content. The user may associate (i.e., pin) the first content with the second content at an index position of the second content. The
server 101 stores the association information in response to the content-association input received via the user interface. In 605, the information that theserver 101 provides may include a link to the first content, a description of the first content, a portion of the first content, or the entire first content, in response to access of the second content about the index position, based on the association of the first content with the second content. That is, the information is provided when the user access is near the index position, for example, during a time interval of the second content, at a specific time, or after or before a specific time or time interval. -
FIG. 7 is a flowchart for embodiments that provide a search box within the user interface. For example, in 701, a search box is provided in the user interface prior to displaying the indexed second content. In 703, the indexed second content is displayed as a search result obtained based on search text entered by the user into a search box. This operation is best understood with respect toFIG. 5 where theuser interface 500 is shown having thesearch box 505. As described above, the user may enter thesearch text 507 into thesearch box 505 and hit thesearch button 509 to obtain search results accessible as the indexed second content. It is to be understood that the “find related content”user interface 500 only returns “indexed” content as the second content. In other words, another article would not be provided unless the article was somehow indexed and only if the index information could be indicated by the user interface such that the article 317 (i.e., the first content) could be pinned to the second content at an index position. The index position, as described above, can be a time index, a scene index, a frame index, a location index, or some other appropriate type of index that may be accessed through theuser interfaces -
FIG. 8 is a flowchart for a method of operation where two electronic devices of a user are employed. That is, first content is displayed on a first device as shown in 801. In 803, a user interface is provided on a second device for sending content-association input. In 805, theserver 101 may receive content-association input from the second device, associating (i.e., pinning) the first content displayed on the first device to second content displayed on the second device. The devices engage in context sharing that may be facilitated by theserver 101 as described above. -
FIG. 9 provides a flowchart related to the embodiment illustrated inFIG. 2 having a content-suggestion server 201. As shown in 901, the content-suggestion server 201 determines a list of suggested indexed second-content choices that may be displayed to the user in various ways. In 903, the user interface displays the most relevant choice from a list of suggested indexed second-content choices. However, in some embodiments as discussed above, the list of suggestions may be provided to the user with an option to select one from the list. In that case, the user interface would appear to the user similar to theuser interface 400, where a video appears in thethumbnail view 401 and theindex scroll bar 409 allows the user to move theposition indicator 411 to an appropriate indexed position of the video before making the verification via thepost button 419 to provide the content-association input to theserver 101. -
FIG. 10 illustrates the provision of a list of selectable choices for the indexed second content. For example in 1005, the user is provided within the user interface a selectable option to view the list of second-content choices. After the user makes a selection from the list, the user interface displays the indexed second content based on the selection as shown in 1007. -
FIG. 11 is a flowchart showing operation of embodiments that employ thepin button 307. As discussed briefly above some embodiments automatically provide theuser interfaces post button 419 to make the content association. However in some embodiments, theuser interface pin button 307 which is a selectable icon. Thus in 1101, a selectable icon is provided within an application window while the application window is displaying a first content. That is, as the user is viewing anarticle 317, thepin button 307, which is a selectable icon in accordance with the embodiments, may be provided to the user. In 1103, a second window may be provided in response to selection input at the selectable icon (i.e., pushing the pin button 307). The second window displays the indexed second content. For example, inFIG. 4 , if the user selects thepin button 307, then theuser interface 400 appears to the user with thetop suggestion 403, thereby enabling the user to verify the pinning operation by selecting an index position and hitting thepost button 419. In 1105, theserver 101 receives input via the second window and creates an association of the first content with the second content at the index position. In 1107, theserver 101 provides a link to the first content, the description of the first content, a portion of the first content, or the entire first content, in response to the same or another user accessing the second content at the index position based on the association of the first content with the second content. - In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the present discussion may be applied, it should be recognized that the embodiments described herein with respect to the drawing figures are meant to be illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the claims. Therefore, the techniques as described herein contemplate all such embodiments as may come within the scope of the following claims and equivalents thereof.
