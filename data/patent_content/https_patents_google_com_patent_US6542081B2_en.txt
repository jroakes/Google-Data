Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to systems and methods for monitoring movement of a human eye, and more particularly to systems and methods for real-time monitoring of fatigue and other states of mind in individuals, purposeful communication, and/or controlling devices based upon movement of their eye, eyelid, and/or other components of their eye.
- U.S. Pat. No. 3,863,243 discloses a device that sounds an alarm to warn a person using the device that they are beginning to fall asleep.
- the device includes a frame similar to a set of eyeglasses onto which is mounted a fiber optic bundle and a photocell that are directed towards the user's eye when the frame is worn.
- the fiber optic bundle is coupled to a source of light and a pulse generator to emit light towards the user's eye.
- the photocell detects the intensity of light reflected off of the user's eye, i.e., either by the eyelid when the eye is closed or the eye surface when the eye is open.
- Circuitry receives a signal from the photocell, and uses a timer to distinguish between regular blinks, and an extended time period during which the eye is closed, i.e., a time period that may indicate that the person is falling asleep. When a threshold time elapses, an alarm is sounded to notify and/or wake the user.
- This device requires running wires and fiber optic bundles from the frame to external components, e.g., the pulse generator and the required circuitry, and for this reason, the device may be awkward or inconvenient to use.
- some devices may detect eye movement, but may not be able to distinguish when the eye is opened or closed. For example, it may be desirable to measure the percentage of total time that the eyelids are closed as a function of time or the area of the palpebral fissure that is covered by the eyelid as the eye is opened or closed, commonly known as “PERCLOS,” for example during medical research or when monitoring driver alertness.
- PERCLOS the percentage of total time that the eyelids are closed as a function of time or the area of the palpebral fissure that is covered by the eyelid as the eye is opened or closed
- Devices that merely detect eye muscle movement or eyelash movement may not be able to distinguish when the eye is open or closed, and consequently may not be able to measure PERCLOS.
- such devices may not measure other parameters, such as velocity of eyelid closing or opening, acceleration or deceleration characteristics, duration of open or closed eye states, intervals between eye blinks and/or partial versus full eye blinks or eye closures.
- infrared cameras or other devices may be used to monitor a driver's awareness, which are typically mounted on the dashboard, roof or other fixed mounting within the user's vehicle. Such devices, however, require that the user maintain constant eye contact with the camera. In addition, they do not monitor eyelid movement if the user looks sideways or downwards, turns around, exits the vehicle or compartment in which he or she is being monitored, or if the camera moves relative to the individual. Further, such cameras may have problems seeing through eyeglasses, sunglasses, or even contact lenses, and may not operate effectively in sunlight.
- the present invention is directed to systems and methods for monitoring eye movement.
- humans blink at least about 5-30 times per minute, or about 7,000-43,000 times per day.
- Each involuntary-reflexive blink lasts about 200-300 milliseconds, and generally averaging about 250 milliseconds, amounting to about 1,750-10,800 seconds per day of eye closure due to involuntary blinking.
- the eye blink gets longer and slower until the eyes begin to close for short term “microsleeps,” i.e., sleep conditions that last for about 3-5 seconds or longer, or for prolonged sleep.
- the present invention provides systems and methods for monitoring, measuring, and/or responding to eye movement, e.g., nonpurposeful reflexive eyeblinks.
- the system includes an emitter and a sensor in a predetermined relationship with an eye such that the emitter emits light and the sensor detects light from the emitter, the sensor producing a light intensity signal indicating when the eye is open or closed. More preferably, the emitter is directed or aimed at the eyelid and eye, while the sensor detects eyelid-reflected light, since, unlike the eyelid, the eye ball (except the retina, which may cause a “red reflex” under white light conditions or “white pupil” under infrared light) does not reflect substantial light back to the sensor. Circuitry is coupled to the sensor for converting sequential light intensity signals corresponding to eyelid movement received from the sensor into a stream of data, and a processor converts the stream of data into an understandable message.
- the circuitry for converting sequential light intensity signals may compare the sequential light intensity signals with a predetermined time threshold to detect voluntary-intentional or unintentional-involuntary sequences of eyelid movements, corresponding, for example, to a predetermined binary code.
- Memory circuitry may be coupled to the processor for storing the stream of data and/or a communication device, such as a video monitor or synthesized voice module, may be coupled to the processor for communicating the understandable message.
- a control system may be coupled to the processor, and the understandable message may include a command for controlling equipment, including electrical or electronic equipment, machinery, or a computer or computer accessory devices coupled to the control system.
- the system preferably also includes a transmitter, preferably a radio frequency transmitter, for wireless transmission of the stream of data to a remote location.
- a transmitter preferably a radio frequency transmitter
- other forms of wireless transmission e.g. infrared, as well as hard-wire connections may be used.
- the processor, as well as the memory circuitry, communication device, and/or control system, may be located at the remote location, and a receiver may be coupled to the processor for receiving the stream of data from the transmitter.
- the system includes a detection device having a frame adapted to be worn on a person's head, e.g., with the frame resting on the bridge of the user's nose and/or ears.
- the frame has the emitter and sensor thereon such that the emitter and sensor are oriented towards the person's eye when the frame is worn on the person's head.
- the emitter and sensor are a single solid state device, such as a biosensor device, that emits light within a predetermined frequency range, for example infrared light, towards the eye and detects the emitted light reflected off of the eyelid, respectively.
- a system for monitoring a blinking cycle of a person from a remote location includes an emitter for directing light towards an eye, and a sensor in a predetermined relationship with the emitter for detecting the emitted light reflected off of the eye, the sensor producing an output signal indicating when the eye is open or closed.
- the emitter light may be reflected off of the eyelid back to the sensor, or diffused by the surface of the eyeball.
- a transmitter is coupled to the sensor for wireless transmission of the output signal, and a processor is provided for comparing the output signal to a predetermined threshold to detect when the eyelid is closed for a minimum predetermined duration.
- a warning indicator may be coupled to the processor, the warning indicator being activated when the processor detects that the eyelid is closed for the minimum predetermined duration.
- the warning indicator may be an audible buzzer, a visible warning light, a vibrating device, an electrical shock device, a gustatory smell device, or other device that may act as a stimulus to any sensory modality.
- a receiver may be provided at the remote location coupled to the processor for receiving the wireless transmission from the transmitter.
- Memory circuitry may be provided for storing the output signal and/or a processor may be provided for converting the output signal into an understandable message.
- a communication device may be coupled to the processor for communicating the understandable message.
- a self-contained device for detecting movement of a person's eyelid includes a frame adapted to be worn on the person's head, an emitter on the frame for directing light towards an eye of the person when the frame is worn, and a sensor on the frame for detecting light from the emitter.
- the sensor produces an output signal indicating when the eye is open or closed, and a transmitter on the frame is coupled to the sensor for wireless transmission of the output signal to a remote location.
- the frame may also include a processor for comparing the output signal to a predetermined threshold to detect drowsiness-induced eyelid movement.
- the emitter and sensor are preferably a solid state biosensor device for emitting and detecting infrared light, or alternatively an array of emitters and/or sensors in a predetermined configuration on the frame, e.g., in a vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or other linear or other geometric array of more than one emitter and/or sensor oriented towards one or both eyes.
- an array of emitters and/or sensors allows measurement of eyelid velocity, acceleration and deceleration, and calculation of “PERCLOS.”
- the emitter and/or sensors may be affixed to any number of points on the frame, e.g., around the lens and preferably in the nose bridge, or alternatively anywhere along the frame, including near or on the nasal portion of the frame, the attachment of a temple piece of the frame, and/or surface mounted on the lens of an eyeglass.
- the emitter and/or sensor may be embedded in the lens of an eyeglass, or otherwise such that they operate through the lens.
- the emitter(s) and/or sensor(s) are fixed on an eye-frame such that they move with the wearer's head movements, and continuously focus on the user's eyes, whether the user is in a vehicle, outdoors or in any other environment.
- a system in accordance with the present invention may detect eyelid movement of the user, distinguish normal blinks from other voluntary or involuntary eyelid movement, and produce a stream of data.
- the stream of data may be converted into an understandable message, such as a binary code, a command for controlling a piece of equipment, or an indicator of the user's physical, mental or emotional state.
- the system may provide a convenient and/or effective method for voluntary or involuntary communication based simply upon movement of the user's eye.
- a system for monitoring movement of a person's eye.
- the system includes a device configured to be worn on a person's head and an array of emitters on the device for directing light towards an eye of the person when the device is worn.
- the array of emitters is configured for projecting a reference frame towards the eye.
- a camera is oriented towards the eye for monitoring movement of the eye relative to the reference frame.
- the camera may be provided on the device or may be provided remote from the device, but in relatively close proximity to the user.
- the array of emitters includes a plurality of emitters disposed in a substantially vertical arrangement on the device, and a plurality of emitters disposed in a substantially horizontal arrangement on the device.
- the array of emitters may project a focused set of crossed bands towards the eye for dividing a region including the eye into four quadrants.
- the system preferably includes one or more scanning or nonscanning sensors on the device for detecting light from the array of emitters.
- the one or more sensors produce an output signal indicating when the eye is open or closed, similar to the embodiments described above.
- the sensors include an array of focused sensors in a predetermined relationship with the array of focused emitters for detecting light from the array of emitters that is reflected off of respective portions of the eye or its eyelid.
- the emitters because of their fixed position, produce a fixed reflection off of the surface of the eye and eyelid, appearing as a “glint,” i.e., a spot or band of light.
- Each sensor produces an output signal indicating when the respective portion of the eye is covered or not covered by the eyelid.
- the system may also include a processor for correlating the output signal from the one or more sensors with a video signal from the camera for determining the person's level of alertness.
- the system may also include a warning indicator on the device, the warning indicator being activated when the processor determines a predetermined level of drowsiness has occurred.
- Light from the array of emitters may be emitted towards the eye of a user wearing the device to project a reference frame onto the eye.
- the camera is capable of imaging light produced by the emitters, e.g., in the infrared light range, thereby detecting the projected light as a spot of light, band of light or other “glint.” Movement of the eye relative to the reference frame may be monitored with the camera. A graphical output of the movement monitored by the camera relative to the reference frame may be monitored. For example, infrared light from the emitters may be reflected off of the retina as a “red reflex” under white light, as a “white pupil” under infrared light, or as a dark pupil under subtraction, using methods known to those skilled in the art.
- the processor using these methods, may detect movement of the eye's pupil may be measured relative to the reference frame. This movement may be graphically displayed, showing the movement of the eye's pupil relative to the reference frame.
- the output signal from the one or more sensors may be correlated with video signals produced by the camera monitoring movement of the eye relative to the reference frame, thereby determining the person's level of drowsiness.

- the detection device 30 is placed on a user's head, i.e., by putting the eyeglasses 20 on as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the adjustable arm 31 and/or the clamp 27 may be adjusted to optimally orient the emitter 32 and sensor 33 towards the user's eye 300 (shown in FIGS. 6A-6C and 7 A- 7 C).
- the emitter 32 is activated and a beam of light 340 is directed from the emitter 32 towards the eye 300 .
- the intensity and/or frequency of the emitter 32 and/or the threshold sensitivity of the sensor 33 or other focus may then be adjusted (e.g. manually or automatically using self-adjusting features).
- FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate an open eye condition, in which a ray of light 340 produced by the emitter 32 strikes the surface of the eye 300 itself and consequently is scattered, as shown by the rays 350 .
- the resulting light intensity detected by the sensor 33 is relatively low, i.e., the sensor 33 may not receive any substantial return signal.
- the eye 300 is shown with the eyelid 302 closed as may occur during normal blinks, moments of drowsiness, intentional blinks, or other eyelid movement. Because the light 340 strikes the eyelid 302 , it is substantially reflected back to the sensor 33 , as shown by the ray 360 , resulting in a relatively high light intensity being detected by the sensor 33 . Alternatively, as shown in 7 C, the beam of light 340 may be broken or cut by the eyelid 302 when the eye 300 is closed.
- the sensor 33 consequently produces a light intensity signal that indicates when the eye 300 is open or closed, i.e., corresponding to the time during which reflected light is not detected or detected, respectively, by the sensor 33 .
- the intensity of the infrared light reflected from the surface of the eyelid is not substantially affected by skin pigmentation. If it is desired to adjust the intensity of light reflected from the eyelid, foil, glitter, reflective moisturizer creams and the like may be applied to increase reflectivity, or black eye liner, absorptive or deflective creams and the like may be applied to reduce reflectivity.
- the light intensity detected by the sensor 33 results in an output signal 142 including a series of time-dependent light intensity signals (as shown, for example, in FIG. 12 B).
- the output signal 142 is received by the CPU 140 coupled to the sensor 33 , which compares the length of time of each light intensity signal 142 , for example, corresponding to a closed eye condition, with a predetermined threshold.
- the timer circuitry 146 may provide a threshold time to the CPU 140 for distinguishing normal blinks from intentional and/or other unintentional eyelid movement, which the CPU 140 may then filter out of the output signal 142 .
- the CPU 140 then produces a stream of data 144 which may be used for voluntary and/or involuntary communication.
- the detection device 30 may be used to detect impending drowsiness or “micro-sleeps” (i.e., sleep intrusions into wakefulness lasting a few seconds) of a user, with the processing box 130 triggering a warning to alert the user, others in his or her presence, or monitoring equipment of the onset of drowsiness.
- the threshold of the timer circuitry 146 may be adjusted such that the CPU 140 detects relatively long periods of eye closure, as may occur when a person is falling asleep.
- the threshold may be set at a time ranging from close to zero seconds up to several seconds, preferably from about 200 milliseconds to about 300 milliseconds, and most preferably about 250 milliseconds, to distinguish normal blinks from drowsiness-induced eyelid movement.
- the CPU 140 may activate a warning device.
- the warning device may be included within the processing box 130 , such as the speaker 150 , or alternatively on the frame, for example, by mounting a warning light (not shown) or an alarm speaker (not shown in FIG. 9, see FIG. 10C) on the frame.
- the detection device 30 may be used to unobtrusively record or monitor drowsiness-induced eyelid movement, with the CPU 140 producing a stream of data 144 which the transmitter 152 may transmit to the receiving and processing unit 154 (FIG. 9 ).
- the device 30 may be used in conjunction with a vehicle safety system to monitor a driver's level of awareness or attentiveness.
- the stream of data 144 may be transmitted to a receiving and processing unit 154 mounted in a vehicle, which may store data on the driver's drowsiness and/or may use the data to make decisions and control the vehicle, e.g., adjust the vehicle's speed or even turn the vehicle's engine off.
- the detection device 30 may be used to monitor truck drivers, taxi drivers, ship or airline pilots, train conductors or engineers, radar or airport control tower operators, operators of heavy equipment or factory machinery, scuba divers, students, astronauts, entertainment participants or observers, and the like.
- the signals may be stored and analyzed in real time for trend changes measured over time to predict drowsiness effects of individuals using the device.
- the detection device 30 and system 14 may also be used in a medical diagnostic, therapeutic, research or professional setting to monitor the wakefulness, sleep patterns and/or the effects of drugs, which may affect blink rate, blink velocity, blink duration, or PERCLOS of a patient or vehicle operator. Similar to the method just described, the CPU 140 produces a stream of data 144 , which the transmitter may send to a remote receiving and processing unit 154 , which may store the stream of data 144 in the memory circuitry 160 for later retrieval and analysis by researchers, medical professionals, or safety personnel (e.g., similar to the way in which flight recorder data may be stored in an aircraft's “black box” recorder).
- the receiving and processing unit 154 may also display the stream of data 144 , for example at a nurse's station, as an additional parameter to continually monitor a patient's physical, mental, or emotional condition.
- the unit 154 may store and/or produce a signal, e.g., by a series of algorithms, that must be responded to within a predetermined time (e.g., performance vigilance monitoring) to prevent false positives and negatives.

- muscle diseases e.g., myotonia, myotonic muscular
- the detector device 30 may be used in biofeedback applications, for example, in biofeedback, hypnosis or psychological therapies of certain conditions (e.g. tic disorders).
- the detector device 30 may produce a stimulus, e.g. activating a light or speaker, and monitor the user's eyelid movement in anticipation of receiving a response, e.g., a specific sequence of blinks, acknowledging the stimulus within a predetermined time. If the user fails to respond, the processor may store the response, e.g. including response time, and/or may automatically transmit a signal, such as an alarm signal.
- the detection device 30 may be used to monitor individuals in non-medical settings, such as during normal activity in a user's home or elsewhere.
- individuals with involuntary medical conditions such as epilepsy or narcolepsy
- other individuals such as, infants and children, prison inmates, demented patients (e.g., with Alzheimer's disease), law enforcement personnel, military personnel, bank tellers, cashiers, casino workers, students, swing or graveyard shift workers, and the like, may be monitored.
- Similar application may be applied in a sleep laboratory for monitoring sleep patients to measure parameters, such as onset of sleep, sleep latency, time of eyelid closing or opening, time of awakening during the night, etc., or to animal research where eye blinking may be a factor to be studied.
- the performance and vigilance abilities of the user may be tested and analyzed as a direct function of, or in relationship to, PERCLOS.
- the CPU 140 When the CPU 140 detects the presence of particular eyelid movement, such as an extensive period of eye closure which may occur, for example, during an epileptic seizure, a syncopal episode, a narcoleptic episode, or when dozing off while driving or working, the CPU 140 may produce an output signal which activates an alarm.
- the transmitter 152 may send an output signal to shut off equipment being used, to notify medical personnel, such as by automatically activating a telephone to dial emergency services, to signal remote sites, such as police stations, ambulances, vehicle control centers, guardians, and the like.
- the system for communication 14 may also find useful application for voluntary communication.
- a user wearing the detection device 30 may intentionally blink in a predetermined pattern, for example, in Morse code or other blinked code, to communicate an understandable message to people or equipment (e.g., to announce an emergency).
- the CPU 140 may convert a light intensity signal 142 received from the sensor 33 and corresponding to the blinked code into a stream of data 144 , or possibly directly into an understandable message including letters, words and/or commands.
- the stream of data 144 may then be displayed on a video display 50 (see FIG. 1) coupled to the output port 148 , or emitted as synthesized speech on the internal speaker 150 .
- the stream of data 144 may be transmitted by the transmitter 152 via the signal 153 to the receiving and processing unit 154 for displaying messages, or for controlling equipment, such as household devices, connected to the control system 164 .

- the device may be used in any environment or domain, e.g., through water or other substantially transparent fluids. Further, the device 30 may also be used as an emergency notification and/or discrete security tool.
- a person who may be capable of normal speech may wear the device 30 in the event of circumstances under which normal communication, i.e., speech, is not a viable option. For example, a bank or retail employee who is being robbed or is otherwise present during the commission of a crime may be able to discretely blink out a preprogrammed warning to notify security or to call law enforcement.
- a person with certain medical conditions may wear the device in the event that they are physically incapacitated, i.e., are unable to move to call for emergency medical care, but are still able to voluntarily move their eyes.
- a pre-recorded message or identifying data e.g. name of the user, their location, the nature of the emergency, etc.
- identifying data may be transmitted to a remote location by a specific set of eyeblink codes or preprogrammed message.
- the detection device 30 may be used to monitor patients in an ICU setting, patients on ventilators, prisoners, elderly or disabled persons, heavy equipment operators, truck drivers, motorists, ship and aircraft pilots, train engineers, radar or airport control tower operators, or as a nonverbal or subliminal tool for communication by military guards, police bank tellers, cashiers, taxi-drivers, and the like.

- additional timer circuitry may be coupled to the CPU 140 such that the CPU 140 may compare the light intensity signals received from the sensor 33 to a second predetermined threshold provided by the timer circuitry.
- the second predetermined threshold corresponds to a time period during which a person would normally blink. If the CPU 140 fails to detect a normal blink within this time period or if the user fails to respond to a predetermined stimulus (e.g. a blinking light or sound), the CPU 140 may produce a signal, activating the speaker 150 or transmitting a warning using the transmitter 152 .
- the detection device 30 is removed by a perpetrator during commission of a crime, falls off because of the onset of a medical episode, as well as to prevent “false alarms,” or to measure the “state of attentiveness” of the user.
- performance vigilance tasks may be required of the user to determine whether the signal transmitted is a purposeful or “false alarm” signal, and also for measuring attention or drowsiness levels for purposes of biofeedback, and also to measure compliance of the user wearing the device.
- the polarity of the output signal 142 may be reversed such that a stream of data is produced only when the eye is opened, for example, when monitoring patients in a sleep lab to measure onset of sleep, sleep latency, time of eyelid closure, etc., or to monitor sleeping prison inmates.
