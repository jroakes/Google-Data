Definitions
- This disclosure relates to a scalable and reliable multi-source GPS Signal distribution framework.
- a communication network is generally a large distributed system for receiving information (e.g., a signal) and transmitting the information to a destination.
- information e.g., a signal
- the demand for communication access has dramatically increased.
- conventional wire and fiber landlines, cellular networks, and geostationary satellite systems have continuously been increasing to accommodate the growth in demand, the existing communication infrastructure is still not large enough to accommodate the increase in demand.
- the growth in demand is mainly attributable to the coming together of different technological systems that perform similar tasks. These technological systems perform different functions, such as voice (e.g., telephone service), data (e.g., World Wide Web), and video (e.g., television broadcast), and have now converged and share the same resources and interact with each other synergistically.
- voice e.g., telephone service
- data e.g., World Wide Web
- video e.g., television broadcast
- the communication infrastructure includes an optical line terminal (OLT) that sends a multiplexed signal (where the signal includes audio, video, and data signals) to a remote node, which ultimately distributes the received signal to multiple ends users.
- OLT optical line terminal
- High-precision time is important in a communication network. For example, femtocell or picocell stations in 4G/LTE communication networks depend on the accurate time and frequency for time-division duplexing (TDD) and frequency-division duplexing (FDD).
- TDD time-division duplexing
- FDD frequency-division duplexing
- One of the methods used to improve the communication system is to configure the OLT as a master server that receives high-precision time directly from a satellite of a Global Positioning System (GPS) and delivers phase and frequency signals via IEEE-1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) or Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE).
- GPS Global Positioning System
- PTP Precision Time Protocol
- GPS based time master server architecture supports a very limited number of clients due to constraints in the computation resources of the time master server.
- the time master server architecture fails to provide a scalable architecture due to its limited computation resources.

- the line card uses a time of day component of the selected signal having the highest quality score.
- Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following features.
- the global positioning system receiver, the management cards, and the line cards each include a replicator.

In some implementations, each line card includes at least as many selectors as global positioning system receivers in the signal distribution system.

- a communication network generally needs precision timing; therefore, the clocks of its individual devices should be synchronized. Clock synchronizing allows for synchronizing multiple devices or multiple communication networks, which leads to facilitating inter-network handoff of data. Accurate time becomes increasingly important with the surge of wireless application, such as 4G/LTE that include, for example, femtocell or picocell.
- LTE Long-Term Evolution, also known as 4G LTE
- 4G LTE is a wireless communication standard for high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals.
- LTE networks utilize improved digital signal processing techniques and modulations to increase the capacity and speed of wireless data networks.
- Femtocell and picocell are small cells that provide in-building and outdoor wireless service that allows a provider to extend its service coverage and/or increase network capacity. Therefore, communication service providers are constantly considering ways to maintain the time accuracy of their ever expanding network, to ultimately distribute very accurate time information over an Ethernet (e.g., gigabit) infrastructure to remote residential houses.

- the communication network 10 may also include a management server 400 (system manager).

- a first OLT 202 a and a second OLT 202 b are each in communication with first, second and third satellite receivers 100 a , 100 b , 100 c .
- Each GPS receiver 100 , 100 a - 100 n sends a signal to each of the MCs 210 of an OLT 202 . If there are N number of MCs 210 in an OLT 202 , there are be N GPS receivers 100 in the network 10 .

- each OLT 202 within the communication network 10 is accessible to time sources from multiple GPS receivers 100 . Although this adds redundancy to the network 10 , it protects the network 10 from failures and offers consistent and reliable service levels. For example, if one of the GPS receivers 100 that is sending a signal 30 to an OLT 202 fails, the OLT 202 can still determine an accurate time since it is receiving signals 30 from other GPS receivers 100 .
- This network 10 architecture is an improvement over the previous systems, where a GPS receiver 100 fails to send a time signal to the OLTs 202 , then the OLTs 202 fail to send a time to the end user 302 .
- the communication network 10 allows the OLT 202 to determine which GPS receiver 100 has a highest quality and use that GPS receiver 100 as opposed to using a GPS receiver 100 that is undergoing a failure and is not providing accurate time.

- the LC replication device 222 may only select and send a subset of GPS clock sources to the selector 224 at a time. As previously described, the LC replication device 222 selects and replicates one or more GPS signals 30 and sends the replicated signals 30 to different selectors 224 .
- the selector 224 receives multiple GPS signals 30 from multiple GPS receivers 100 .
- the selector 224 selects a primary GPS signal 30 from one GPS receiver 100 and iterates through each of the GPS signals ⁇ S aa , S ab , S ac ⁇ or ⁇ S ba , S bb , S bc ⁇ of the rest of the GPS receivers 100 .
- the selector 224 requests and receives from the receiver circuit a primary signal 30 being a currently selected GPS signal ⁇ S aa , S ab S ac ⁇ or ⁇ S ba , S bb , S bc ⁇ with the highest signal quality score S and the secondary signal 30 being the GPS signal 30 of the corresponding iterations.
- the selector 224 may spend several minutes on each secondary GPS source 100 and switch to the next source after timeout, by sending new request instructions to the LC replication device 222 (or other replication devices 110 , 210 ). Once an iteration of all GPS sources is complete, the selector 224 performs the best GPS source selection algorithm and recalculates the best GPS source ID as the primary input.
- the selector 224 determines the signal quality score of each of the received GPS signals ⁇ S aa , S ab , S ac ⁇ or ⁇ S ba , S bb , S bc ⁇ (as discussed above).
- the selector 224 requests and receives from the receiver circuit the source identification of the primary signal 30 and the source identification of the secondary signal 30 .
- the selector 224 triggers an error.
- an FPGA is used as the LC replication device 222 .
- the LC replication device 222 and the selector 224 may each need six pins to perform the bilateral communication protocol between the two devices. Other numbers of pins are also available.
- the selector 224 is a time chip, a time system on a chip (time SoC), or a circuit.
- the time chip 224 receives a GPS signal and extracts the time and frequency information (TOD signal and FREQ signal), then converts the extracted signals to IEEE-1588 and SyncE packets.
- the FPGA 222 includes five GPS signal output pins (pins 1 through 5 ) and one GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins enabled.
- the pins are: Primary (Master) PPS signal (output pin) P 1 ; Primary (Master) FREQ signal (output pin) P 2 ; Primary TOD signal (output pin) P 3 ; Secondary PPS signal (output pin) P 4 ; Secondary Freq signal (output pin) P 5 ; and FPGA and time chip communication (GPIO pin) P 6 .
- the selector 224 includes five GPS signal input pins and one GPIO pin enabled.
- the selector pins include: Primary (Master) PPS signal (input pin) P 1 ; Primary (Master) FREQ signal (input pin) P 2 ; Primary TOD signal (input pin) P 3 ; Secondary PPS signal (input pin) P 4 ; Secondary FREQ signal (input pin) P 5 ; and FPGA and time chip communication (GPIO pin) P 6 .
- Time-division duplexing is the application of time-division multiplexing to separate outward and return signals.
- TDD emulates full duplex communication over a half-duplex communication link.
- TDD is advantageous in situations where there is a difference between the uplink and downlink data rates, since as the amount of uplink data is increasing, more communication capacity can be dynamically allocated, and as the traffic load becomes lighter, the capacity may be taken away. Similar analysis applies for downlink. Therefore, a receiver circuit 230 (which optionally includes the LC 220 and/or MCs 210 ) sets the PPS signals to be with 50% duty cycle.
- the receiver circuit 230 (which optionally includes the LC 220 and/or MCs 210 ) detects a rising edge of the primary signal at pin P 1 of the selector 224 , the GPIO pin on the FPGA 222 is set to be an output pin, while the GPIO pin P 6 on the Selector 224 is set to be an input.
- the FPGA 222 waits a threshold time period before beginning communication signal transmission at its GPIO output pin P 6 . The threshold time period allows for sufficient time for the selector 224 to switch its GPIO pin P 6 from an input pin to an output pin before the transmission starts.
- the receiver circuit 230 detects the arrival of a falling edge of the primary PPS signal, the GPIO pin P 6 on the FPGA 222 is set to be an input pin, while GPIO pin P 6 on the selector 224 is set to be an output.
- the selector 224 can start transmitting communication signals immediately once the selector GPIO pin flips P 6 .
- the signal from FPGA 222 sent via the communication channel carries the current primary (and optionally the secondary) GPS source identification.
- the sixth pin P 6 of the selector 224 is an output pin, then the signal from the time selector 224 , via the communication channel, carries the requested primary GPS source identification and the requested secondary GPS source identification.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method 500 of determining the state of the FPGA 222 (replication device).
- the edge of the primary PPS signal is received.
- the receiver circuit 230 determines if the received edge is a rising edge or a falling edge. If the receiver circuit 230 determines that the received edge is a rising edge, then at block 506 , the receiver circuit 230 sets GPIO P 6 of the FPGA 222 to an output pin, then the receiver circuit 230 waits a threshold period at block 508 before determining and advertising, at block 510 , the primary and optionally the secondary GPS source ID.
- the receiver circuit 230 determines if the received edge is a falling edge, then at block 512 the receiver circuit 230 sets the GPIO pin P 6 of the FPGA 222 to be an input pin, and then listens to the input GPIO pin P 6 at block 514 , before extracting the primary and secondary GPS identifications at block 516 .
- the receiver circuit 230 determines if the OLT should change the GPS source (based on the signal analysis above). If the receiver circuit 230 determines that the GPS source should be changed, then at block 520 , the receiver circuit 230 switches the GPS receiver 100 being used as the source for the GPS signal and has a new primary source and a new secondary source, at block 520 .
- the selector 224 receives multiple GPS signals 30 from multiple GPS receivers 100 .
- the selector 224 selects a primary GPS signal 30 from one GPS receiver 100 and iterates and accesses different GPS receivers 100 via the secondary PPS signal and the secondary frequency. Since TOD does not affect the selection of the GPS receiver 100 , the TOD signal from the secondary GPS receiver 100 is not considered (also due to a limited number of pins, in some cases). Therefore, the selector 224 may spend several minutes on each secondary GPS source 100 , and switch to the next source after timeout, by sending new request instructions to the FPGA 222 . Once an iteration of all GPS sources is complete, the selector 224 performs the best GPS source selection algorithm, and recalculates the best GPS source ID as the primary input.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a method 600 of determining the state of the selector 224 .
- the selector 224 receives the edge of the primary PPS signal.
- the receiver circuit 230 determines at decision block 604 if the edge is a rising edge or a falling edge. If the receiver circuit 230 determines that the edge is a rising edge, then at block 606 the receiver circuit 230 sets the GPIO pin P 6 of the selector 224 to be an input pin, then at block 608 listens to input from the input GPIO pin P 6 .
- the selector 224 extracts the primary GPS identification ID.
- the selector 224 determines if the primary GPS ID from block 610 matches a requested primary GPS ID, and if yes, the selector 224 goes to block 602 . If the primary GPS ID from block 610 does not match the requested primary GPS ID, then the selector 224 triggers an error alert at block 614 and sends the alert to a remote management server 400 before going back to block 602 .
- the selector 224 sets the GPIO pin P 6 to an output pin at block 616 , and decides, at block 618 , which GPS source is the next secondary GPS source ID.
- the selector 224 determines if all GPS sources have been iterated, if so, then at block 622 the best GPS source selection is determined using the selection algorithms described above. However, if not all the GP sources have been iterated, then at block 624 , the selector 224 sends instruction signals via the GPIO pin P 6 to the LC replication device 222 so that the LC replication device 222 sends the primary and second GPS source IDs.
- the OLT 202 when the OLT 202 detects that the quality of a GPS signal 30 is less than a threshold quality or is worse than the other received GPS signals 30 (received from other GPS receivers 100 ), the OLT 202 triggers an alert to a remote management server 400 , which executes autonomous diagnostics on a data processing device 402 to localize the failed component(s) that is causing the reduced quality of the GPS signal 30 .
- Such diagnosis may be autonomous and in real time.
- the communication network 10 is configured to perform online diagnostics to locate a failure of a GPS receiver 100 of the cascaded multi-source GPS distributed hierarchy.
- a GPS clock source may fail at a selector 224 when its frequency drift J or its ⁇ D measured at the selector 224 is worse than a threshold (e.g., below or above the threshold).
- Each selector 224 reports the failure condition to a remote central server in real time.
- the central server gathers all failure conditions from all OLTs 202 , performs diagnostics, and finds the failure location (i.e., GPS receiver 100 , replication devices 110 , 212 , 222 , or selector 224 undergoing a failure) in real time.
- the online diagnostics process finds a lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the hardware components (i.e., GPS receiver 100 , replication devices 110 , 212 , 222 , or selector 224 ).
- the LCA is the unique node of greatest depth that is an ancestor of every node in a nonempty set of notes in a rooted tree.
- the cascaded GPS distribution framework establishes a GPS distribution multi-root forest, where each GPS receiver 100 including its replication devices (i.e., GPS replication device 110 ) is a root node, each selector 224 is a leaf node, and each replication in the OLT 202 (i.e., MC replication device 212 and LC replication device 222 ) is an intermediate node of the forest.
- each GPS receiver 100 including its replication devices i.e., GPS replication device 110
- each selector 224 is a leaf node
- each replication in the OLT 202 i.e., MC replication device 212 and LC replication device 222
- all the GPS clock sources fail at the first selector 224 a of the first LC 220 aa of the first OLT 202 a , while the phase and frequency measurement returns good results at the other selectors 224 b , 224 c , 224 d of the first LC 220 aa of the first OLT 202 a .
- the LCA node is the leaf node (failure node or location), which is the first selector 224 a of the first LC 220 aa of the first OLT 202 a.
- all the GPS clock sources fail at the selectors 224 a , 224 b , 224 c , 224 d of the first LC 220 aa of the first OLT 202 a , while the phase and frequency measurements return good results at other LCs 220 b , 220 c of the first OLT 202 a .
- the LCA node (failure node or location) is the intermediate node, which is the LC replication device 222 aa of the first LC 220 aa of the first OLT 202 a.
- the LCA node (the failure location or node) is the intermediate node, which is the MC replication device 212 aa of the first MC 210 aa on the first OLT 202 a .
- the LCA node or in other words, the failure location, is the root node, which is either the first GPS receiver 100 a , or its GPS replication component 110 a.
- more than one hardware component fails ( 100 , 110 , 210 , 212 , 220 , 222 , 224 ) at the same time.
- the system 10 uses a Breadth First Search (BFS) based algorithm.
- the manager server 400 first searches each root node (i.e., the GPS receivers 100 and their corresponding replication components 110 ), and check whether a root node is a LCA node. If a node is a LCA, then the manager server 400 adds it to the failure location set. Once the manager server 400 searches the root nodes, the manager server 400 searches the MCs 210 and their respective replication devices 212 .
- BFS Breadth First Search
