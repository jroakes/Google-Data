Fig. 6 A is the block diagram of database structure 600 according to some embodiments of the invention.In certain embodiments, database structure 600 is applicable to the multi-media events database 100 of server 106 at least conceptively.Yet in some other embodiment, database structure 600 can also be applicable to the local data base 420 of each client 102.When obtaining information from database 600, can call one or more mapping functions 602.Database structure 600 comprises the storage to low-res information 604, middle resolution information 606 and high-res information 608.Can be used in response to the client-requested of the type information is come to send to client 102 by each of these information types of server 106 visit.
When the request that receives from client such as search inquiry, obtain low-res information corresponding to this request from multi-media events database 110, and send this low-res information to client.Use this low-res information to show the essential information of relevant multi-media events corresponding to this request.For example, as mentioned above, can in the master map 308 (Fig. 3) of the landing page or result of page searching, show the low-res information that the is sent to client part of the low-res information of client (or be sent to).Because master map 308 can only show the event in the time period that falls into current appointment, so on master map 308, initially do not show any low-res information in the moment that is sent to client but is used for early than or is later than the time period of current appointment.In other words, client can be looked ahead for the low-res information of the event beyond the time window of current appointment.For example, if the time window of current appointment is initial corresponding to the current time, then client can be looked ahead for the low-res information of the next time window of the time window of current appointment and then, when making time window when user's " forward " (to the time window in future) rolling master map, the user will experience zero or zero time delay almost.The event information of all downloads of storage in the local data base 420 (Fig. 4) of client.When the user backward or forward during the rolling time window, can show the low-res information of looking ahead that has been stored in the client place immediately on main grid 308 on master map 308.In addition, can also look ahead corresponding to the middle resolution information of the low-res information that on master map, is showing.
Middle resolution information is data shown when the user hovers over designator on the television program titles that is showing on the master map.Therefore, be used for the resolution information of particular event if looked ahead, then when the user hovers over designator event header (for example, television program titles) and goes up, have time delay ground show in resolution information.In resolution information can comprise the information of channel about this TV programme, lasting, airtime and other type.
High-res information is data shown when the user is chosen in the event header (for example, television program titles) that shows on the master map 308.In certain embodiments, in embedding framework (being also referred to as embedded framework), show high-res information, this embedding framework partly makes the landing page or result of page searching blur in client application, but stays the appropriate location of the landing page or result of page searching.Referring to the exemplary schematic screen shot among Fig. 3 E.By close embed framework 356 or click be not embedded into that framework covers step on the part of the page, the user can return and step on the page or result of page searching.
Fig. 6 B is the block diagram of database structure according to other embodiments of the present invention.For example, this database structure can use in server 106 or each client 102 or the two.In this embodiment, multi-media events database or local data base comprise event set 612.By making the one or more mapping functions on the index of reference 602, can in database, find the data of presentation of events.For example, each mapping function or index can be mapped to event indicator logout or the record set in the database.Each event in the event set has corresponding low-res event information 614, middle resolution event information 616 and high-res event information 618.Although the most events in the database can have three all information sets, some events in the database may lack high-res information 618 or even middle resolution information.
For the purpose of explaining, with reference to specific embodiment aforementioned description has been described.Yet above illustrative discussion is not intended to limit or limits the invention to disclosed exact form.In view of above instruction, many modifications and variations are possible.In order to explain principle of the present invention and its practical application best, select and described embodiment, thereby with the present invention that utilizes who makes that others skilled in the art can be best, and has the specific use that the various embodiment of various modifications are suitable for expecting.
