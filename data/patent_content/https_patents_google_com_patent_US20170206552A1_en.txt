- This document describes methods, processes and systems for providing content to, and determining conversion tracking for, a user having or being associated with multiple devices, without storing personally identifiable information associated with the user to facilitate content selection. For example, when a user logs onto a user service from a first device (e.g., the user's home PC), a public key-private key pair can be determined and the public key can be published. The public key can be associated with the user's first device and stored by the user service. The private key can be stored locally. Subsequently, when the user logs into the service from a second different device, the second different device can also determine a public-private key pair. Each device can subsequently compute a secret key using the device's own private key and the other device's published public key.
- a first device e.g., the user's home PC
- the public key can be associated with the user's first device and stored by the user service.
- the private key can be stored locally.
- the second different device can also determine a public-private key
- the secret key can be stored in combination with anonymous identifiers of each device, thus creating a linking or association between the devices.
- the association can be used to link or associate an impression on one device to a user interaction (e.g., a conversion) on a second different device.
- a user's different devices provide one example of different requesting resources for which conversion tracking can be determined.
- different requesting sources can include a mobile device including a smart phone, a laptop computer, a tablet, a desktop device, a set-top box, a television, a browser, an application on a mobile device, or a stand-alone application. Other requesting sources are possible.
- the anonymous identifiers can be cookies, browser cookies, device identifiers, or other identifiers that are associated with each device.
- the mapping can identify all of the devices associated with the user without storing personally identifiable information (PII) associated with the user.
- PII personally identifiable information
- information included in the mapping can be used to assist in selecting relevant content to be provided to the user.
- the selection of relevant content can include decisions regarding how content is delivered to the user, such as and including, limitations on when or how content is delivered. For example, the number of impressions of an advertisement can be limited to a fixed number of impressions per user per time period regardless of how many devices the user uses.
- anonymous identifiers can be associated with different browsers or other applications on the same device.
- the techniques described in this disclosure can be used to link two or more identifiers of applications that may have different cookie spaces on the same device, or applications on different devices, or a combination of both.
- linking anonymous identifiers can be used in handshaking among mobile applications or a combination of mobile applications, browsers and other applications.
- mobile applications may each have their own cookie space even on the same device which can prevent handshaking with other applications.
- Each mobile application can use the techniques described herein to generate, for example, a private key an a public key, publish the public key, access public keys of other mobile applications (or associated with other devices), and compute secret keys using their own private keys and the public keys of other mobile applications (or associated with other devices).
- users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that allow the user to be discovered across multiple devices and/or to be provided content based on the discovery.
- the mapping process can be repeated periodically to ensure that the anonymous identifiers (e.g., cookies) are not stale, thus keeping session history information for the user up-to-date.
- the anonymous identifiers e.g., cookies
- the cookies on a computer can expire over time, or a user can clear a cookie, resulting in setting a new cookie. Repeating the cookie-mapping process periodically can ensure that the current set of cookies belonging to the user are correctly mapped. While reference is made to cookies, other forms of anonymous identifiers that include or have been derived from a seed can be used.
- user session history information can be stored anonymously.
- the session history information can include a user's browsing history, the times that the user has seen a particular advertisement, and other session history information.
- the information can be stored in association with the anonymous identifiers described herein.
- session history information associated with the user's session on a first device can be stored in a table that includes the anonymous identifier associated with the first device.
- the same table can also be used to store the same user's session history information for the user's session on a second device.
- a separate or the same table can be used to store associations among the anonymous identifiers.
- anonymous identifiers, the associations (e.g., linking to the secret key), and the session data all can be stored, for example, without any corresponding personally identifiable information for a given user.
- a request for content (e.g., an advertisement) can be sent from any of the devices associated with that user (the request including an anonymous identifier associated with a given device).
- the session history information stored in the tables can be used in determining, for example, advertisements that may be of interest to the user responsive to the received request. The determination can include inferences for the user based on the user's stored session history information.
- the session history information for the user can be aggregated, e.g., by joining tables using the anonymous identifiers. For example, a request for content can be received, and the request can include an anonymous identifier associated with a user's desktop device.
- the received anonymous identifier can be used to look up the user's other anonymous identifiers (e.g., for mobile and other devices of the user).
- the retrieved set of anonymous identifiers can be used access to session history information in the other tables (e.g., user browsing history).
- all of the session history information can be joined together for the respective devices producing aggregated information.
- the aggregated session history information can be provided to a content management system in order to determine and select eligible content for delivery to the user responsive to the received request. For example, because the session history information can include the number of times that the user has seen a particular advertisement, the content management system can help to avoid selecting an advertisement for the user which has already been presented a predetermined number of times.
- aggregating the information can occur on demand, e.g., in real time after a request for content occurs.
- the user's session history information stored individually by anonymous identifier in the various tables, can be joined. Aggregating the information in real time can solve issues, for example, related to whether the user has opted out of being provided content based on the devices used by the user. For example, session history information for a device for which the user has opted out will not be aggregated with other session history information.
- the information for a user can be aggregated and stored in advance of any requests for content. For example, all of the user session history information can be stored in a third table, e.g., that includes all of the user session history information across all of the user's devices.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the example environment 100 further includes a user login service 120 that can provide, for any particular user, access to the user's Web services, e-mail, social networks, business applications or other resources.
- the user login service 120 can receive login requests from the user, such as through a Web browser or other application running on any device associated with the user.
- the login request can include, for example, the user's login ID (e.g., a unique identifier, an email address, a phone number, or any other identifier for the user that can be used for verifying the user at login).
- the user login service 120 can also maintain information related to the devices on which the user is currently logged on, or has been logged into recently.
- the information can include, for example, a mapping of anonymous identifiers for the devices with a session key that does not contain personally identifiable information associated with the user.
- the mapping can be stored, for each user, in a data store of linked anonymous identifiers 122 , or in some data structure.
- the user login information 121 or some other data store can store user login IDs, public keys and initial seeds.
- the information can be used by a second device used by a user to access the public key published by a first device used by the same user.
- the user's first device can access the public key published by the second device.
- seed values can be read from the user login information 121 by any of the user's devices and used to determine a secret key.
- a data store of user opt-out and privacy preferences 142 can include information that the user has provided regarding if and how information about the user's different devices can be used. For example, users can use one or more user preferences web page that may be part of (or separate from) the user login service 120 . In some implementations, users can set a preference that says, “Do not link my different devices,” or selectively identify which devices are allowed (or not allowed) to be linked. Then, before any operation is performed that may link the anonymous identifiers of the user's different devices, the user's user opt-out and privacy preferences 142 can be checked, and the linking will be performed only if allowed by the user. In some implementations, the user may specify settings that prohibit providing content based on the linking. For example, while the user may allow his smart phone and PC to be linked, the user may decide that no content (e.g., advertisements) should be provided based on the linking.
- no content e.g., advertisements
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- a schedule e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals. Other information, such as user identifier information that is associated with the mappings described above, can be used and/or evaluated when selecting eligible content.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by recognizing a user when the user has accessed resources using multiple devices. For example, if it is known that a content item (e.g., an advertisement) has already been seen by a user on a first device (e.g., the user's home PC), then a determination can be made (e.g., through parameters) whether or not to provide the same content item to the same user on a different device (e.g., the user's smartphone). This can increase the likelihood of a conversion, for example, by either repeating impressions of an advertisement or avoiding subsequent impressions, depending on how multiple impressions for the advertisement to the same user are predicted to lead to a conversion in either case.
- a content item e.g., an advertisement
- a first device e.g., the user's home PC
- a determination can be made (e.g., through parameters) whether or not to provide the same content item to the same user on a different device (e.g., the user
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIGS. 2A-2E collectively show an example system 200 for providing content to a user who is recognized when using multiple different devices.
- recognition of the user across different devices can be achieved by linking anonymous identifiers of the user's multiple different devices.
- an anonymous identifier 206 a of a first device 106 a e.g., a desktop computer of a user 202
- an anonymous identifier 206 b of a second different device 106 b e.g., a laptop computer of the user 202
- the system 200 can be part of the environment 100 that is described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- An example sequence of events (e.g., with numbered steps 0 and 1a through 8) follows for associating the anonymous identifiers 206 a and 206 b and providing content based on the association.
- other sequences can also be used to link devices 106 a , 106 b and additional devices 106 associated with the user 202 .
- the devices 106 a , 106 b and additional devices 106 can be linked using associations stored in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- the associations can be stored, for example, without storing any personally identifiable information for the user 202 .
- the user login service 120 (or the content management system 110 ) can check 107 the user's user opt-out and privacy preferences 142 to see if the user has opted out of such linking. For example, if the user has specified not to allow the user's devices to be linked (or use information thereof), then steps 2a though 6b will not occur, and the content provided in step 8 may be different.
- a first step 1a (e.g., as allowed by the user) of the sequence of steps can occur, for example, when the user 202 logs into the first device 106 a (e.g., the user's desktop computer) using a login service (not shown in FIGS. 2A-2D ).
- the login service or some other component can receive a login request 208 a from the first device 106 a .
- the login request 208 a can be associated with the anonymous identifier 206 a (e.g., a cookie or device identifier) associated with the first device 106 a .
- the login request 208 a and/or other login requests can be requests to log into a social service.
- the user login information 121 can store user login IDs 210 , seeds 212 and public keys 214 associated with multiple users.
- the user login information 121 can serve as a directory that includes one or more entries, each entry indexed by an identifier associated with a given user (e.g., user login identifier, email address, or some other identifier).
- information stored for the user in the user login information 121 can include a login ID 210 a , a seed 212 a (e.g., a generator-prime pair, such as 7, 11, that is usable by all of the user's devices), and, as will be discussed in further detail below, a public key 214 .
- the public key 214 has not yet been determined for the current user.
- seeds 212 can vary by user, e.g., the seed 212 b (e.g., generator-prime pair 7, 13) for a second user can be different from the seed 212 a.
- the first device 106 a can read a seed 216 a (e.g., a generator-prime pair 7, 11 from the user login information 121 ) and create a private-public key pair that is associated with the user 202 using the first device 106 a .
- creating the private-public key pair can include, at step 3a, computing 218 a a private key (e.g., 9) and computing a public key (e.g., 4).
- generation of public and private keys can use generator G, prime P pair (e.g., 7, 11), where G ⁇ P, an example of which is described with reference to FIG. 2F .
- the public key is published 220 a , e.g., stored as the public key 214 a .
- the private key n and the public key 4 constitute the private-public key pair, yet each typically is stored in a different location.
- the private key n can be stored locally on the first device 106 a , e.g., in local storage 219 .
- the public key (e.g., 4) can be stored in the user login information 121 as the public key 214 a .
- the public key 214 a can be stored in a row 222 that includes user login information for the user 202 on one or more devices (e.g., devices 106 a and 106 b in the current example).
- the row 222 can serve as a directory entry associated with the user 202 .
- Each of the other rows can be used to store information for a different user.
- a seed 216 b (e.g., the generator-prime pair 7, 11) can be read (e.g., from the user login information 121 ) and a second private-public key pair that is associated with the user can be created.
- the second private-public key pair is associated with the user 202 using the second device 106 b .
- the second private-public key pair is different than the private-public key pair that is associated with the login by the user 202 on the first device 106 a .
- creating the second private-public key pair can include, at step 3b, computing 218 b a private key (e.g., m) and computing a second public key (e.g., 8).
- the second public key is published 220 b , e.g., by adding the second public key to the set of public keys stored as the public keys 214 a .
- the private key m and the public key 8 constitute the second private-public key pair (e.g., ⁇ m, 8>), the values of which are different from those of the private-public key pair computed for the first device 106 a (e.g., ⁇ n, 4>).
- the private key m can be stored locally on the second different device 106 b , e.g., in local storage 221 b .
- the public key (e.g., 8) can be stored, for example, in user login information 121 with the public key 4 from the first device 106 a .
- the directory entry stored in the row 222 (and associated with the user 202 ) is updated, now including two public keys.
- the second different device 106 b can create a secret key 226 a (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 4) from the first device 106 a and the second private key (e.g., private key m from local storage 221 b ).
- the second different device 106 b can also associate 228 a the second anonymous identifier (e.g., “Device ID 2”) with the secret key (e.g., 3).
- the association can include storing the association, e.g., in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- the linked anonymous identifiers 122 can include secret keys 230 and anonymous identifiers of the same users 232 .
- a row 234 can include a secret key 230 a (e.g., 3 or a hashed representation of 3) and the anonymous identifier 232 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) that corresponds to the association that occurred in step 6a.
- the user may log in again at the first device 106 a .
- a login request 208 c can be received (e.g., by the login service) from the user at the first device 106 a .
- the login request 208 c can be similar to the login request 208 a described above.
- the login service for example, can determine that a public key exists for another device associated with the user, e.g., the second different device 106 . Using the additional public key, a link or association can be made between the two devices 106 a and 106 b as described in further detail below.
- the stored value can be a hashed version of the secret key, e.g., using a one-way hash function.
- the first device 106 a can create a secret key 226 b (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 8) from the second different device 106 b and the first private key (e.g., private key n from local storage 221 a ).
- the secret key can match the secret key computed by the second different device 106 b .
- the first device 106 a can also associate 228 b the second anonymous identifier (e.g., Device ID 2) with the secret key (e.g., 3).
- the association can include storing the association, e.g., in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- the row 234 containing the secret key 230 a (e.g., 3) and the anonymous identifier 232 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) can be updated to also include the anonymous identifier 232 a (e.g., “Device ID 1”).
- the anonymous identifiers 206 a and 206 b as well as the devices 106 a and 106 b , are now linked. Further, the association among the user's various devices is achieved without storing any personally identifiable information associated with the user.
- one or more anonymous identifiers such as anonymous identifier 232 a or anonymous identifier 232 b can appear in multiple rows (e.g., three or more) in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- This can be an indication, for example, that the device associated with the anonymous identifier is a shared device (e.g., at a library or an Internet café).
- the logins by several different users e.g., three or more
- the highly-shared devices when highly-shared devices are detected in this way, the highly-shared devices can be un-linked, or other considerations can be taken. For example, thresholds can be established, and if a cookie or other anonymous identifier appears in more than three rows, the associated can be considered a shared machine.
- the content management system 110 can receive a request for content 240 a or 240 b (e.g., a request for advertising content) from either the first device 106 a or the second different device 106 b .
- the request for content 240 a can be a request for an advertisement to fill an advertisement slot 242 a on a web page 244 a displayed on the first device 106 a .
- the request for content 240 b can be a request for an advertisement to fill an advertisement slot 242 b on a web page 244 b displayed on the second different device 106 b .
- the request for content 240 a is from the first device 106 a , for example, then the request for content can include the first anonymous identifier 232 a . Otherwise, if the request for content 240 b is from the second different device 106 b , for example, then the request for content can include the second different anonymous identifier 232 b.
- the content management system 110 can provide a content item (e.g., content items 246 a or 246 b ) in response to the request and using the association that maps the user 202 to multiple devices (e.g., from the linked anonymous identifiers 122 ).
- the association can be represented by information in the row 234 that associates anonymous identifiers 232 a and 232 b , e.g., based on the same secret key 230 a .
- the content management system 110 can, for example, treat the requests for content as if they originate from the same user, regardless of the particular user device.
- identifying eligible content items for the request for content 240 b can depend on content already provided to the same user 202 on the first device 106 a .
- an advertisement for California vacations, for example, that is intended for one impression per user can be shown on the first device 106 a and not repeated again on the second different device 106 b .
- Devices 106 a and 106 b are two examples of devices that the user 202 may use.
- the user 202 may use a third different device 106 c (e.g., a smart phone).
- the user login service 120 can store a third different anonymous identifier 232 in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- all three devices 106 a - 106 c can be associated with the user 202 , e.g., using the secret key 230 a.
- the user login service 120 can store fourth and fifth different anonymous identifiers in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 (e.g., stored in association with the second user using a secret key 230 that is different from the secret key 230 a ).
- FIG. 2F shows example calculations of public, private and secret keys.
- Device A calculations 250 provide examples for computing a public key, a private key and a secret key on a first device, e.g., the first device 106 a .
- Device B calculations 252 provide examples for computing a public key, a private key and a secret key on a second different device, e.g., the second different device 106 b .
- Other methods can be used to determine public, private and secret keys.
- the calculations can occur in steps, e.g., steps 254 a - 254 e .
- steps 254 a - 254 e both devices A and B can exchange a prime P (e.g., 11) and a generator G (e.g., 7).
- the prime and generator can be stored in the user login information 121 , as described above. For example, a prime and a generator that is unique to a user (and the devices associated with the user) can be determined and stored at a time that one or more entries in the user login information 121 are created and stored.
- each device can generate its own private key, e.g., using a random number or in some other way.
- device A's private key can be 6, and device B's private key can be 9.
- These private keys can be used in combination with at least the generator and prime from step 1 254 a to determine public and private keys in the following steps.
- each device can compute a public key.
- computing the public key can use a formula that includes the generator raised to the power of the device's private key, and a modulo P can be performed on the result.
- the generator, prime, and each of the devices' private keys the resulting public keys for the devices can result in being 4 and 8, respectively.
- the devices can share their public keys, e.g., by publishing the keys in the user login information 121 as described above.
- device A can know device B's public key (e.g., 8), and device B can know device A's public key (e.g., 4).
- secret keys can be computed, e.g., using a formula that raises the other device's public key to power of the current device's private key, and the result can undergo a modulo P (prime).
- the secret key for the first and second devices can be 3.
- the value can be used by either device to update the row in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 with the device's anonymous identifier. This can be repeated for any other device associated with the same user that computes the secret key using its own private key and the public key from one of the other devices.
- FIG. 2G shows an example sequence of events for conversion tracking associated with a user receiving and interacting with content on multiple, anonymously-linked requesting sources.
- the requesting sources can include the first device 106 a (e.g., the user's mobile device) and the second different device 106 b (e.g., the user's personal computer).
- Step 1 of the example sequence of events can be the linking of the two devices 106 a and 106 b .
- the two devices 106 a and 106 b can be linked by the content management system 110 , e.g., using linked identifier information stored in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 .
- Each identifier for example, is associated with a user and a specific requesting source.
- the anonymous linking includes linking at least two different identifiers that are associated with two different requesting sources used by the user to access content, in this example, devices 106 a and 106 b .
- the linked anonymous identifiers 122 do not store user login information, account information, personal information or any other information that would make it possible to easily identify the user. While a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is described herein as one possible way for anonymously linking identifiers and achieving conversion tracking across multiple requesting sources of the same user, other techniques can be used to anonymously link requesting sources.
- conversion tracking can be accomplished using impression and interaction data that is stored for the user in association with respective identifiers.
- An example interaction can include a conversion which, as described above, is an action by the user that is associated with content presented to the user, such as a purchase, filling out a form, enrolling in a service, traversing to a threshold depth in a website, spending a threshold amount of time on the website, walking into a store, paying using a mobile wallet within the store, using a barcode scanner to scan a product, making a phone call, searching for the product in a browser, or following the product on a social network.
- Other types of conversions can exist, e.g., that are related to a user interaction in response to an impression of content (e.g., the display of an advertisement for product X).
- Step 2 of the example sequence can be an impression 260 , e.g., an impression of content, such as an advertisement for Camera X provided on the web page 244 a in the user's browser on the user's mobile device.
- the impression 260 for example, can occur at a time A 262 a .
- the impression 260 and/or other steps in the example sequence can occur substantially coincident with one or more steps of the linking process, e.g., login request 208 c , as described above with reference to FIG. 2D .
- conversion tracking across a user's multiple requesting sources can be determined after the fact, e.g., based on impressions and interactions that occurred before the user's multiple requesting sources may have been fully linked.
- an interaction 264 can be detected that is associated with a second different device (e.g., second different device 106 b ) associated with the same user.
- the second device is anonymously linked to, but different from, the device on which the impression 260 occurred.
- the interaction 264 may be the interaction of the user buying Camera X online, e.g., on web page 244 b , a Camera X purchase interface.
- the user may have waited, for example, to buy the Camera X on his personal computer until after performing research on the Camera X after having been presented an advertisement for Camera X on his mobile device.
- the personal computer may support better user interfaces for purchasing the camera than may be available using a small screen on the user's mobile device.
- the interaction 264 can occur, for example, at a time B 262 b .
- the time B 262 b associated with the interaction is after the time A 262 a associated with the impression, but still within a predetermined time 268 that can represent a maximum time duration for which to consider an interaction to be related to an impression.
- the interaction can be considered to be related to the impression, in this example, as long as the interaction occurs at a time that is before a time C 262 c , which is the time after the time A 262 a calculated from on a time offset representing the predetermined time 268 . While this example describes an interaction on a different device, conversion tracking as described herein can also occur when impressions and corresponding conversions occur on the same device, or any combination of same and different devices.
- a conversion 266 is logged based on the combination of the impression and the interaction (e.g., on their respective devices). For example, a determination can be made that an impression of content to the user has occurred on one of two different requesting sources and that an interaction has been recorded on another of the two different requesting sources, the interaction being associated with the impression.
- the content management system 110 can link the impression with the interaction, e.g., by analyzing recent and/or historical impression data and user interaction data in light of linked anonymous identifiers. For example, the content management system 110 can determine that the interaction 264 that occurred was associated with the same user who received the impression 260 . Conversion tracking as described requires that linking of resources be enabled.
- a user may opt in or out of such, such as based on user opt-out and privacy preferences 142 for the given user. If the user has requested, for example, not to allow linking, then conversion tracking based on impressions and interactions made by the user across multiple linked requesting sources may not be realized. In some implementations, the conversion is logged as the result of several events. For example, the user interaction 264 can be stored and evaluated to determine if there are any impressions that might have been associated with it, e.g., by the same user and within time constraints that would indicate a relationship between the impression(s) and user interaction. If there is an association, then the conversion can be logged.
- the advertiser associated with the impression can be charged for the conversion and/or the publisher can be credited.
- conversions There can be different types of conversions that are examples of user interactions described herein, including, for example, view-through conversions, click-through conversions, and other types of conversions.
- conversions can be associated with more than one impression, e.g., a group of impressions that may have occurred on one or more linked devices associated with a user.
- different predetermined times can be used, such as a different predetermined time between a first and second impression or a different predetermined time duration between the final of multiple impressions and the eventual conversion.
- content sponsors can specify one or more predetermined times that are to be used for determining whether a conversion has occurred.
- a content sponsor may use one or more content sponsor interfaces for defining linked-device conversion tracking settings for advertisement creatives in a campaign.
- the content sponsor can specify, for example, that certain types of user interactions that occur within 24 hours of an impression are to be counted as a conversion. Further, different times can be specified for different user interactions.
- default predetermined times can be established by the content management system 110 and/or provided as suggestions to content sponsors.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing content to a user on any of multiple devices associated with the user.
- the content management system 110 and/or the user login service 120 can perform steps of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.

- the content management system 110 and/or the user login service 120 can perform steps of the process 380 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.
- FIGS. 1-2G are referenced as example structures/interfaces associated with the steps of the process 380 .
- conversion tracking based on impressions and interactions made by a user across multiple linked requesting sources may occur only if permitted by the user, e.g., based on settings in the user opt-out and privacy preferences 142 .
- a plurality of identifiers associated with a user are anonymously linked. Each identifier is associated with a user and a specific requesting source ( 382 ).
- the anonymous linking includes linking at least two different identifiers that are associated with two different requesting sources used by the user to access content.
- the identifiers associated with the user's requesting sources can be linked anonymously, as described above with reference to FIGS. 2A-2F .
- Other ways of linking a user's requesting sources can be used.
- Impression, click and interaction data is stored for the user in association with respective identifiers ( 384 ).
- information about clicks, impressions such as impression 260 , and conversions such as interactions 264 can be stored.
- the content management system 110 can store the information, for example, in association with the linked anonymous identifiers 122 or in some other way.
- determining that the interaction has been recorded can include determining a first identifier associated with the interaction and determining when the first identifiers is linked with any other identifiers that have recorded an impression, on a different requesting source, of a content item that relates to the interaction. For example, using impression data associated with the impression 260 and interaction data associated with the interaction 264 , and in light of linked anonymous identifiers 122 , the content management system 110 can determine that the impression 260 and the interaction 264 are associated with the same user.
- determining when the first identifier is linked further includes determining when the first identifier is linked to any other identifier that has recorded an impression within a predetermined time associated with the interaction. For example, the content management system 110 can determine if the time B 262 b associated with the interaction 264 is within the predetermined time 268 . If so, then in this example the identifier associated with the user's non-mobile computing device can be associated, or linked, with the identifier associated with the user's mobile device.
- the impression is linked with the interaction and/or click, including charging a sponsor associated with the impression and/or click ( 388 ).
- the content management system 110 can use information in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 to associate the conversion on the user's non-mobile device to the impression on the user's mobile device. Then, the content sponsor associated with the advertisement for Camera X can be charged for the impression and/or click.
- charges described herein for conversions can be separate from, or in addition to, charges made to the content sponsor for clicks and impressions.
- a publisher associated with the impression can be credited. For example, if the impression occurs on Web Page Y, then the publisher associated with Web page Y can be paid a pre-arranged amount for an impression that has led to a conversion by a user on a second of multiple, anonymously-linked devices associated with the user.
- Some implementations can involve the use of surveys, e.g., where completing a survey can be the user interaction that occurs on the second device.
- the impression on the user's first device e.g., a mobile device
- the interaction can be associated with a survey that is presented on the user's second different device (e.g., a non-mobile, personal computer).
- the survey in this example can be designed to be delivered to users' non-mobile devices at a predetermined time after presentation of the advertisement on their mobile devices.
- Conversion tracking can be used, in this example, to determine which users, and/or what percentage of users, complete the survey on the second device.
- additional content can be presented to users and/or the types of users who have completed the survey.
- the content in this example can include content for which the initial impression occurs on mobile devices and for which conversion is potentially more likely to occur on a non-mobile device because of the specific user or the type of user (e.g., a user that distrusts making financial transactions on a mobile device).
- the process 380 can further include steps for providing content to similar types of users as the user who converted on the second device or other such users.
- the content management system 110 can identify a user associated with linked impressions and interactions from two different requesting sources, where the impression has occurred on a first requesting source of the user and the conversion has occurred on a second different requesting source of the user.
- An example result is categorizing users who react favorably to mobile-then-non-mobile content.
- Content can then be identified to serve to other users having similar traits, e.g., similar interactions.
- the content can be identified, for example, when the similar user is interacting with the first requesting source.
- mobile-then-non-mobile content can also be provided to the user.
- content providers can be presented with options to provide impressions of their content items to users who have certain types of multiple requesting sources and/or histories of converting on the linked requesting sources.

Abstract
Description
- This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13/458,124, filed on Apr. 27, 2012, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Content item slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content. The content can then be provided to the user on any devices associated with the user such as a personal computer (PC), a smartphone, a laptop computer, or some other user device.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for conversion tracking. The method comprises anonymously linking a plurality of identifiers, each identifier associated with a user and a specific requesting source, wherein anonymously linking includes linking at least two different identifiers that are associated with two different requesting sources used by the user to access content, and wherein anonymously linking includes linking the two different identifiers using an identifier that does not include any personally identifiable information. The method further comprises storing impression, click and interaction data for the user in association with respective identifiers. The method further comprises determining that an impression of content to the user has occurred on one of the two different requesting sources and that an interaction has been recorded on another of the two different requesting sources, wherein the interaction is associated with the impression. The method further comprises linking the impression and/or click with the interaction, including charging a sponsor associated with the impression and/or click.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Determining that the interaction has been recorded can further comprise determining a first identifier associated with the interaction and determining when the first identifier is linked with any other identifiers that have recorded an impression, on a different requesting source, of a content item that relates to the interaction. Determining when the first identifier is linked can further include determining when the first identifier is linked to any other identifier that has recorded an impression within a predetermined time associated with the interaction. The first identifier can be associated with a non-mobile computing device and the other identifier can be associated with a mobile device. The interaction can be a conversion. The conversion can be an action associated with the content, the action selected from the group comprising a purchase, filling out a form, enrolling in a service, traversing to a threshold depth in a website, spending a threshold amount of time on the website, walking into a store, paying using a mobile wallet within the store, using a barcode scanner to scan a product, making a phone call, searching for the product in a browser, or following the product on a social network. The method can further comprise crediting a publisher associated with the impression. The impression can be associated with an advertisement and the interaction is associated with a survey. The different requesting sources can be selected from the group comprising: a mobile device including a smart phone, a laptop computer, a tablet, a desktop device, a set-top box, a television, a browser, an application on a mobile device, or a stand-alone application. The method can further comprise identifying a user associated with linked impressions and interactions from two different requesting sources, wherein the impression has occurred on a first requesting source and the conversion has occurred on a second different requesting source, and identifying content to serve to other users having similar interactions with multiple requesting sources. Identifying content can include identifying content to provide to the user when the user is interacting with the first requesting source. Anonymously linking can include linking identifiers using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Anonymously linking can include linking identifiers using a secret key derived from a seed that is unique to the user.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Content can be provided to a user based at least in part on prior delivered content, such as content previously delivered to a user on one of a plurality of different devices. Associations among anonymous identifiers can be used enable delivery of interesting content to a user. Content sponsors can be provided with more precise mechanisms for delivering content to users.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- This document describes methods, processes and systems for providing content to, and determining conversion tracking for, a user having or being associated with multiple devices, without storing personally identifiable information associated with the user to facilitate content selection. For example, when a user logs onto a user service from a first device (e.g., the user's home PC), a public key-private key pair can be determined and the public key can be published. The public key can be associated with the user's first device and stored by the user service. The private key can be stored locally. Subsequently, when the user logs into the service from a second different device, the second different device can also determine a public-private key pair. Each device can subsequently compute a secret key using the device's own private key and the other device's published public key. The secret key can be stored in combination with anonymous identifiers of each device, thus creating a linking or association between the devices. The association can be used to link or associate an impression on one device to a user interaction (e.g., a conversion) on a second different device. A user's different devices provide one example of different requesting resources for which conversion tracking can be determined. For example, different requesting sources can include a mobile device including a smart phone, a laptop computer, a tablet, a desktop device, a set-top box, a television, a browser, an application on a mobile device, or a stand-alone application. Other requesting sources are possible.
- In some implementations, the anonymous identifiers can be cookies, browser cookies, device identifiers, or other identifiers that are associated with each device. As a result, the mapping can identify all of the devices associated with the user without storing personally identifiable information (PII) associated with the user. When content is subsequently provided to the user on any of the devices, information included in the mapping can be used to assist in selecting relevant content to be provided to the user. The selection of relevant content can include decisions regarding how content is delivered to the user, such as and including, limitations on when or how content is delivered. For example, the number of impressions of an advertisement can be limited to a fixed number of impressions per user per time period regardless of how many devices the user uses.
- In some implementations, anonymous identifiers can be associated with different browsers or other applications on the same device. For example, the techniques described in this disclosure can be used to link two or more identifiers of applications that may have different cookie spaces on the same device, or applications on different devices, or a combination of both.
- In some implementations, linking anonymous identifiers can be used in handshaking among mobile applications or a combination of mobile applications, browsers and other applications. For example, mobile applications may each have their own cookie space even on the same device which can prevent handshaking with other applications. Each mobile application can use the techniques described herein to generate, for example, a private key an a public key, publish the public key, access public keys of other mobile applications (or associated with other devices), and compute secret keys using their own private keys and the public keys of other mobile applications (or associated with other devices).
- In some implementations, users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that allow the user to be discovered across multiple devices and/or to be provided content based on the discovery.
- In some implementations, the mapping process can be repeated periodically to ensure that the anonymous identifiers (e.g., cookies) are not stale, thus keeping session history information for the user up-to-date. For example, cookies on a computer can expire over time, or a user can clear a cookie, resulting in setting a new cookie. Repeating the cookie-mapping process periodically can ensure that the current set of cookies belonging to the user are correctly mapped. While reference is made to cookies, other forms of anonymous identifiers that include or have been derived from a seed can be used.
- In some implementations, user session history information can be stored anonymously. For example, the session history information can include a user's browsing history, the times that the user has seen a particular advertisement, and other session history information. The information can be stored in association with the anonymous identifiers described herein. In some implementations, session history information associated with the user's session on a first device can be stored in a table that includes the anonymous identifier associated with the first device. The same table can also be used to store the same user's session history information for the user's session on a second device. In some implementations, a separate or the same table can be used to store associations among the anonymous identifiers. In some implementations, anonymous identifiers, the associations (e.g., linking to the secret key), and the session data all can be stored, for example, without any corresponding personally identifiable information for a given user.
- As will be described in further detail below, subsequent to the storage of the association and session history information, a request for content (e.g., an advertisement) can be sent from any of the devices associated with that user (the request including an anonymous identifier associated with a given device). In some implementations, the session history information stored in the tables can be used in determining, for example, advertisements that may be of interest to the user responsive to the received request. The determination can include inferences for the user based on the user's stored session history information. In some implementations, the session history information for the user can be aggregated, e.g., by joining tables using the anonymous identifiers. For example, a request for content can be received, and the request can include an anonymous identifier associated with a user's desktop device. The received anonymous identifier can be used to look up the user's other anonymous identifiers (e.g., for mobile and other devices of the user). The retrieved set of anonymous identifiers can be used access to session history information in the other tables (e.g., user browsing history). In some implementations, all of the session history information can be joined together for the respective devices producing aggregated information. In some implementations, the aggregated session history information can be provided to a content management system in order to determine and select eligible content for delivery to the user responsive to the received request. For example, because the session history information can include the number of times that the user has seen a particular advertisement, the content management system can help to avoid selecting an advertisement for the user which has already been presented a predetermined number of times.
- In some implementations, aggregating the information can occur on demand, e.g., in real time after a request for content occurs. For example, the user's session history information, stored individually by anonymous identifier in the various tables, can be joined. Aggregating the information in real time can solve issues, for example, related to whether the user has opted out of being provided content based on the devices used by the user. For example, session history information for a device for which the user has opted out will not be aggregated with other session history information. In some implementations, the information for a user can be aggregated and stored in advance of any requests for content. For example, all of the user session history information can be stored in a third table, e.g., that includes all of the user session history information across all of the user's devices.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for delivering content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andpublishers 109. - In some implementations, the
example environment 100 further includes auser login service 120 that can provide, for any particular user, access to the user's Web services, e-mail, social networks, business applications or other resources. For example, theuser login service 120 can receive login requests from the user, such as through a Web browser or other application running on any device associated with the user. The login request can include, for example, the user's login ID (e.g., a unique identifier, an email address, a phone number, or any other identifier for the user that can be used for verifying the user at login). Theuser login service 120 can also maintain information related to the devices on which the user is currently logged on, or has been logged into recently. The information can include, for example, a mapping of anonymous identifiers for the devices with a session key that does not contain personally identifiable information associated with the user. In some implementations, the mapping can be stored, for each user, in a data store of linkedanonymous identifiers 122, or in some data structure. - In some implementations, the
user login information 121 or some other data store can store user login IDs, public keys and initial seeds. For example, the information can be used by a second device used by a user to access the public key published by a first device used by the same user. Similarly, the user's first device can access the public key published by the second device. At the same time, seed values can be read from theuser login information 121 by any of the user's devices and used to determine a secret key. - A data store of user opt-out and
privacy preferences 142 can include information that the user has provided regarding if and how information about the user's different devices can be used. For example, users can use one or more user preferences web page that may be part of (or separate from) theuser login service 120. In some implementations, users can set a preference that says, “Do not link my different devices,” or selectively identify which devices are allowed (or not allowed) to be linked. Then, before any operation is performed that may link the anonymous identifiers of the user's different devices, the user's user opt-out andprivacy preferences 142 can be checked, and the linking will be performed only if allowed by the user. In some implementations, the user may specify settings that prohibit providing content based on the linking. For example, while the user may allow his smart phone and PC to be linked, the user may decide that no content (e.g., advertisements) should be provided based on the linking. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 can be data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. In some implementations, content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation). - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals. Other information, such as user identifier information that is associated with the mappings described above, can be used and/or evaluated when selecting eligible content. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In some implementations, the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by recognizing a user when the user has accessed resources using multiple devices. For example, if it is known that a content item (e.g., an advertisement) has already been seen by a user on a first device (e.g., the user's home PC), then a determination can be made (e.g., through parameters) whether or not to provide the same content item to the same user on a different device (e.g., the user's smartphone). This can increase the likelihood of a conversion, for example, by either repeating impressions of an advertisement or avoiding subsequent impressions, depending on how multiple impressions for the advertisement to the same user are predicted to lead to a conversion in either case.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

FIGS. 2A-2E collectively show anexample system 200 for providing content to a user who is recognized when using multiple different devices. In some implementations, recognition of the user across different devices can be achieved by linking anonymous identifiers of the user's multiple different devices. As an example, ananonymous identifier 206 a of afirst device 106 a (e.g., a desktop computer of a user 202) can be linked to ananonymous identifier 206 b of a seconddifferent device 106 b (e.g., a laptop computer of the user 202). In some implementations, thesystem 200 can be part of theenvironment 100 that is described above with reference toFIG. 1 . An example sequence of events (e.g., withnumbered steps 0 and 1a through 8) follows for associating theanonymous identifiers devices additional devices 106 associated with theuser 202. In some implementations, thedevices additional devices 106 can be linked using associations stored in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. The associations can be stored, for example, without storing any personally identifiable information for theuser 202. - Before any linking occurs using the anonymous identifiers associated with a user's different devices, the user login service 120 (or the content management system 110) can check 107 the user's user opt-out and
privacy preferences 142 to see if the user has opted out of such linking. For example, if the user has specified not to allow the user's devices to be linked (or use information thereof), then steps 2a though 6b will not occur, and the content provided instep 8 may be different. - In some implementations, a
first step 1a (e.g., as allowed by the user) of the sequence of steps can occur, for example, when theuser 202 logs into thefirst device 106 a (e.g., the user's desktop computer) using a login service (not shown inFIGS. 2A-2D ). For example, the login service or some other component can receive alogin request 208 a from thefirst device 106 a. Thelogin request 208 a can be associated with theanonymous identifier 206 a (e.g., a cookie or device identifier) associated with thefirst device 106 a. In some implementations, thelogin request 208 a and/or other login requests can be requests to log into a social service. - In some implementations, the
user login information 121 can store user login IDs 210,seeds 212 andpublic keys 214 associated with multiple users. Theuser login information 121, for example, can serve as a directory that includes one or more entries, each entry indexed by an identifier associated with a given user (e.g., user login identifier, email address, or some other identifier). For example, when theuser 202 logs into thedevice 106 a using the login service, information stored for the user in theuser login information 121 can include alogin ID 210 a, a seed 212 a (e.g., a generator-prime pair, such as 7, 11, that is usable by all of the user's devices), and, as will be discussed in further detail below, apublic key 214. At the current stage of the sequence of steps, thepublic key 214 has not yet been determined for the current user. In some implementations,seeds 212 can vary by user, e.g., the seed 212 b (e.g., generator-prime pair 7, 13) for a second user can be different from the seed 212 a. - At
step 2a, thefirst device 106 a can read aseed 216 a (e.g., a generator-prime pair user 202 using thefirst device 106 a. In some implementations, creating the private-public key pair can include, atstep 3a, computing 218 a a private key (e.g., 9) and computing a public key (e.g., 4). In some implementations, generation of public and private keys can use generator G, prime P pair (e.g., 7, 11), where G<P, an example of which is described with reference toFIG. 2F . Atstep 4a, the public key is published 220 a, e.g., stored as thepublic key 214 a. The private key n and thepublic key 4 constitute the private-public key pair, yet each typically is stored in a different location. For example, the private key n can be stored locally on thefirst device 106 a, e.g., in local storage 219. The public key (e.g., 4) can be stored in theuser login information 121 as thepublic key 214 a. In some implementations, thepublic key 214 a can be stored in arow 222 that includes user login information for theuser 202 on one or more devices (e.g.,devices row 222 can serve as a directory entry associated with theuser 202. Each of the other rows can be used to store information for a different user. - Referring now to
FIG. 2B , atstep 2b, after a login request (step 1b) by the user on a seconddifferent device 106 b, aseed 216 b (e.g., the generator-prime pair 7, 11) can be read (e.g., from the user login information 121) and a second private-public key pair that is associated with the user can be created. The second private-public key pair is associated with theuser 202 using thesecond device 106 b. For example, the second private-public key pair is different than the private-public key pair that is associated with the login by theuser 202 on thefirst device 106 a. In some implementations, creating the second private-public key pair can include, atstep 3b, computing 218 b a private key (e.g., m) and computing a second public key (e.g., 8). Atstep 4b, the second public key is published 220 b, e.g., by adding the second public key to the set of public keys stored as thepublic keys 214 a. The private key m and thepublic key 8 constitute the second private-public key pair (e.g., <m, 8>), the values of which are different from those of the private-public key pair computed for thefirst device 106 a (e.g., <n, 4>). In some implementations, the private key m can be stored locally on the seconddifferent device 106 b, e.g., inlocal storage 221 b. The public key (e.g., 8) can be stored, for example, inuser login information 121 with thepublic key 4 from thefirst device 106 a. As a result, the directory entry stored in the row 222 (and associated with the user 202) is updated, now including two public keys. - Referring now to
FIG. 2C , atstep 5a, the seconddifferent device 106 b can create a secret key 226 a (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 4) from thefirst device 106 a and the second private key (e.g., private key m fromlocal storage 221 b). At step 6a, the seconddifferent device 106 b can also associate 228 a the second anonymous identifier (e.g., “Device ID 2”) with the secret key (e.g., 3). In some implementations, the association can include storing the association, e.g., in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. For example, the linkedanonymous identifiers 122 can includesecret keys 230 and anonymous identifiers of thesame users 232. For example, arow 234 can include a secret key 230 a (e.g., 3 or a hashed representation of 3) and theanonymous identifier 232 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) that corresponds to the association that occurred in step 6a. At a time subsequent to the publishing of the second public key (e.g., 8), and after thesecret key 3 has been computed and an association stored (e.g., as a hashed representation) with the seconddifferent device 106 b, the user may log in again at thefirst device 106 a. As a result, alogin request 208 c can be received (e.g., by the login service) from the user at thefirst device 106 a. For example, thelogin request 208 c can be similar to thelogin request 208 a described above. However, in this case, the login service, for example, can determine that a public key exists for another device associated with the user, e.g., the seconddifferent device 106. Using the additional public key, a link or association can be made between the twodevices - Referring now to
FIG. 2D , atstep 5b, in response to thelogin request 208 c, thefirst device 106 a can create asecret key 226 b (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 8) from the seconddifferent device 106 b and the first private key (e.g., private key n fromlocal storage 221 a). For example, the secret key can match the secret key computed by the seconddifferent device 106 b. Atstep 6b, thefirst device 106 a can also associate 228 b the second anonymous identifier (e.g., Device ID 2) with the secret key (e.g., 3). In some implementations, the association can include storing the association, e.g., in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. For example, therow 234 containing the secret key 230 a (e.g., 3) and theanonymous identifier 232 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) can be updated to also include theanonymous identifier 232 a (e.g., “Device ID 1”). As a result of storing the association, theanonymous identifiers devices - In some implementations, it is possible that one or more anonymous identifiers such as
anonymous identifier 232 a oranonymous identifier 232 b can appear in multiple rows (e.g., three or more) in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. This can be an indication, for example, that the device associated with the anonymous identifier is a shared device (e.g., at a library or an Internet café). In this example, the logins by several different users (e.g., three or more) would result in the creation of multiple rows in theanonymous identifiers 122, each having the same anonymous identifier. In some implementations, when highly-shared devices are detected in this way, the highly-shared devices can be un-linked, or other considerations can be taken. For example, thresholds can be established, and if a cookie or other anonymous identifier appears in more than three rows, the associated can be considered a shared machine. - Referring to
FIG. 2E , atstep 7, thecontent management system 110 can receive a request forcontent first device 106 a or the seconddifferent device 106 b. For example, the request forcontent 240 a can be a request for an advertisement to fill anadvertisement slot 242 a on aweb page 244 a displayed on thefirst device 106 a. In another example, the request forcontent 240 b can be a request for an advertisement to fill anadvertisement slot 242 b on aweb page 244 b displayed on the seconddifferent device 106 b. If the request forcontent 240 a is from thefirst device 106 a, for example, then the request for content can include the firstanonymous identifier 232 a. Otherwise, if the request forcontent 240 b is from the seconddifferent device 106 b, for example, then the request for content can include the second differentanonymous identifier 232 b. - Regardless of where the request for content originates, at
step 8, thecontent management system 110 can provide a content item (e.g.,content items user 202 to multiple devices (e.g., from the linked anonymous identifiers 122). For example, the association can be represented by information in therow 234 that associatesanonymous identifiers content management system 110 can, for example, treat the requests for content as if they originate from the same user, regardless of the particular user device. In some implementations, identifying eligible content items for the request forcontent 240 b, for example, can depend on content already provided to thesame user 202 on thefirst device 106 a. As a result, an advertisement for California vacations, for example, that is intended for one impression per user can be shown on thefirst device 106 a and not repeated again on the seconddifferent device 106 b. In some implementations, it can be beneficial to provide the same advertisement once and only once to each of the user's multiple devices. -
Devices user 202 may use. For example, theuser 202 may use a thirddifferent device 106 c (e.g., a smart phone). When theuser 202 uses the thirddifferent device 106 c to log in, for example, theuser login service 120 can store a third differentanonymous identifier 232 in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. As a result, all threedevices 106 a-106 c can be associated with theuser 202, e.g., using the secret key 230 a. - Similarly, other users can use the
user login service 120 for logging in from multiple different devices. As a result of a second user logging into a fourth and afifth device 106, for example, theuser login service 120 can store fourth and fifth different anonymous identifiers in the linked anonymous identifiers 122 (e.g., stored in association with the second user using asecret key 230 that is different from the secret key 230 a). -
FIG. 2F shows example calculations of public, private and secret keys. Device A calculations 250 provide examples for computing a public key, a private key and a secret key on a first device, e.g., thefirst device 106 a.Device B calculations 252 provide examples for computing a public key, a private key and a secret key on a second different device, e.g., the seconddifferent device 106 b. Other methods can be used to determine public, private and secret keys. - In some implementations, the calculations can occur in steps, e.g., steps 254 a-254 e. For example, in
step 1 254 a, both devices A and B can exchange a prime P (e.g., 11) and a generator G (e.g., 7). In some implementations, the prime and generator can be stored in theuser login information 121, as described above. For example, a prime and a generator that is unique to a user (and the devices associated with the user) can be determined and stored at a time that one or more entries in theuser login information 121 are created and stored. - In
step 2 254 b, each device can generate its own private key, e.g., using a random number or in some other way. For example, device A's private key can be 6, and device B's private key can be 9. These private keys can be used in combination with at least the generator and prime fromstep 1 254 a to determine public and private keys in the following steps. - In
step 3 254 c, each device can compute a public key. In some implementations, computing the public key can use a formula that includes the generator raised to the power of the device's private key, and a modulo P can be performed on the result. Using the generator, prime, and each of the devices' private keys, the resulting public keys for the devices can result in being 4 and 8, respectively. - At
step 4 254 d, once the public keys are determined, the devices can share their public keys, e.g., by publishing the keys in theuser login information 121 as described above. As a result, device A can know device B's public key (e.g., 8), and device B can know device A's public key (e.g., 4). - At
step 5 254 e, secret keys can be computed, e.g., using a formula that raises the other device's public key to power of the current device's private key, and the result can undergo a modulo P (prime). As a result of the calculations, the secret key for the first and second devices can be 3. Once the secret key is determined, the value can be used by either device to update the row in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122 with the device's anonymous identifier. This can be repeated for any other device associated with the same user that computes the secret key using its own private key and the public key from one of the other devices. -
FIG. 2G shows an example sequence of events for conversion tracking associated with a user receiving and interacting with content on multiple, anonymously-linked requesting sources. For example, the requesting sources can include thefirst device 106 a (e.g., the user's mobile device) and the seconddifferent device 106 b (e.g., the user's personal computer).Step 1 of the example sequence of events can be the linking of the twodevices FIGS. 2A-2F , the twodevices content management system 110, e.g., using linked identifier information stored in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. Each identifier, for example, is associated with a user and a specific requesting source. The anonymous linking includes linking at least two different identifiers that are associated with two different requesting sources used by the user to access content, in this example,devices anonymous identifiers 122 do not store user login information, account information, personal information or any other information that would make it possible to easily identify the user. While a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is described herein as one possible way for anonymously linking identifiers and achieving conversion tracking across multiple requesting sources of the same user, other techniques can be used to anonymously link requesting sources. - In some implementations, conversion tracking can be accomplished using impression and interaction data that is stored for the user in association with respective identifiers. An example interaction can include a conversion which, as described above, is an action by the user that is associated with content presented to the user, such as a purchase, filling out a form, enrolling in a service, traversing to a threshold depth in a website, spending a threshold amount of time on the website, walking into a store, paying using a mobile wallet within the store, using a barcode scanner to scan a product, making a phone call, searching for the product in a browser, or following the product on a social network. Other types of conversions can exist, e.g., that are related to a user interaction in response to an impression of content (e.g., the display of an advertisement for product X).
-
Step 2 of the example sequence, for example, can be animpression 260, e.g., an impression of content, such as an advertisement for Camera X provided on theweb page 244 a in the user's browser on the user's mobile device. Theimpression 260, for example, can occur at atime A 262 a. In some implementations, theimpression 260 and/or other steps in the example sequence can occur substantially coincident with one or more steps of the linking process, e.g.,login request 208 c, as described above with reference toFIG. 2D . Moreover, conversion tracking across a user's multiple requesting sources can be determined after the fact, e.g., based on impressions and interactions that occurred before the user's multiple requesting sources may have been fully linked. - At
step 3 in the example sequence, aninteraction 264 can be detected that is associated with a second different device (e.g., seconddifferent device 106 b) associated with the same user. The second device is anonymously linked to, but different from, the device on which theimpression 260 occurred. For example, theinteraction 264 may be the interaction of the user buying Camera X online, e.g., onweb page 244 b, a Camera X purchase interface. The user may have waited, for example, to buy the Camera X on his personal computer until after performing research on the Camera X after having been presented an advertisement for Camera X on his mobile device. The personal computer may support better user interfaces for purchasing the camera than may be available using a small screen on the user's mobile device. Theinteraction 264 can occur, for example, at atime B 262 b. For example, thetime B 262 b associated with the interaction is after thetime A 262 a associated with the impression, but still within apredetermined time 268 that can represent a maximum time duration for which to consider an interaction to be related to an impression. The interaction can be considered to be related to the impression, in this example, as long as the interaction occurs at a time that is before atime C 262 c, which is the time after thetime A 262 a calculated from on a time offset representing thepredetermined time 268. While this example describes an interaction on a different device, conversion tracking as described herein can also occur when impressions and corresponding conversions occur on the same device, or any combination of same and different devices. - At
step 4 of the example sequence, aconversion 266 is logged based on the combination of the impression and the interaction (e.g., on their respective devices). For example, a determination can be made that an impression of content to the user has occurred on one of two different requesting sources and that an interaction has been recorded on another of the two different requesting sources, the interaction being associated with the impression. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can link the impression with the interaction, e.g., by analyzing recent and/or historical impression data and user interaction data in light of linked anonymous identifiers. For example, thecontent management system 110 can determine that theinteraction 264 that occurred was associated with the same user who received theimpression 260. Conversion tracking as described requires that linking of resources be enabled. A user may opt in or out of such, such as based on user opt-out andprivacy preferences 142 for the given user. If the user has requested, for example, not to allow linking, then conversion tracking based on impressions and interactions made by the user across multiple linked requesting sources may not be realized. In some implementations, the conversion is logged as the result of several events. For example, theuser interaction 264 can be stored and evaluated to determine if there are any impressions that might have been associated with it, e.g., by the same user and within time constraints that would indicate a relationship between the impression(s) and user interaction. If there is an association, then the conversion can be logged. In some implementations, when the conversion is logged, the advertiser associated with the impression can be charged for the conversion and/or the publisher can be credited. There can be different types of conversions that are examples of user interactions described herein, including, for example, view-through conversions, click-through conversions, and other types of conversions. - In some implementations, conversions can be associated with more than one impression, e.g., a group of impressions that may have occurred on one or more linked devices associated with a user. Further, different predetermined times can be used, such as a different predetermined time between a first and second impression or a different predetermined time duration between the final of multiple impressions and the eventual conversion. In some implementations, content sponsors can specify one or more predetermined times that are to be used for determining whether a conversion has occurred. For example, a content sponsor may use one or more content sponsor interfaces for defining linked-device conversion tracking settings for advertisement creatives in a campaign. The content sponsor can specify, for example, that certain types of user interactions that occur within 24 hours of an impression are to be counted as a conversion. Further, different times can be specified for different user interactions. In some implementations, default predetermined times can be established by the
content management system 110 and/or provided as suggestions to content sponsors. -
FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing content to a user on any of multiple devices associated with the user. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 and/or theuser login service 120 can perform steps of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2F are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 300. - A first login request is received from a first device used by a user for logging into a service, the first login request being associated with a first anonymous identifier associated with the first device (302). For example, referring to
FIG. 2A , theuser login service 120 can receive thelogin request 208 a from thefirst device 106 a (e.g., a personal computer) being used by theuser 202. The login request can be associated, for example, with theanonymous identifier 206 a (e.g., “Device ID 1”) that is associated with thefirst device 106 a. - A seed is read, and a first private-public key pair is created that is associated with the user when using the first device (304). As an example, the
user login service 120 can read the seed 212 a (e.g., generator-prime pair 7, 11) and provide the seed 212 a to thefirst device 106 a. Using the seed, thefirst device 106 a can determine the private key (e.g., 9) and the public key (e.g., 4) associated withfirst device 106 a. - A first private key associated with the first private-public key pair is stored locally in the first device, and a first public key is published in a directory entry associated with the user (306). The
first device 106 a, for example, can store the private key inlocal storage 221 a. Thefirst device 106 a can also provide the public key (e.g., 4) to theuser login service 120 for storage inuser login information 121. - A second login request is received from a second different device used by the user, the second login request being associated with a second different anonymous identifier associated with the second different device (308). As an example, referring to
FIG. 2B , thesame user 202 can log into the second different device (e.g., a laptop computer). Theuser login service 120, for example, can receive thelogin request 208 b. The login request can be associated, for example, with theanonymous identifier 206 b (e.g., “Device ID 2”) that is associated with the seconddifferent device 106 b. - Responsive to the received second login request (310), the seed is read, and a second private-public key pair is created that is associated with the user when using the second different device including a second different public key (312). As an example, the
user login service 120 can read the seed 212 a (e.g., generator-prime pair 7, 11) and provide the seed 212 a to the seconddifferent device 106 b. Using the seed, the seconddifferent device 106 b can determine its private key (e.g., 6) and the public key (e.g., 8). - A second private key associated with the second private-public key pair is stored locally in the second different device, and the second public key is published in the directory entry associated with the user (314). The second
different device 106 b, for example, can store the private key inlocal storage 221 b. The seconddifferent device 106 b can also provide the public key (e.g., 8) to theuser login service 120 for storage inuser login information 121. - A secret key is created using the first public key (316). For example, referring to
FIG. 2C , the seconddifferent device 106 b can compute the secret key 230 a (e.g., 3) using the public key (e.g., 4) from the first device and the second different device's own private key (e.g., 6). Device B calculations 502 shown inFIG. 2F provide example steps and formulas for computing the secret key. - The second anonymous identifier is associated with the secret key (318). For example, the second different anonymous identifier (e.g., Device ID 2) can be stored with the secret key (e.g., a hashed version), e.g., in the linked
anonymous identifiers 122, which is stored separately from theuser login information 121. - At a time subsequent to the publishing of the second public key, a login request is received from the user when accessing the first device (320) and, responsive to the received request, the secret key is created using the second public key (322). As an example, the
user 202 can log back into thefirst device 106 a. Thelogin request 208 a, for example, can be received by theuser login service 120. At this time, thefirst device 106 a can also compute thesecret key 3 using the first device's private key (e.g., 9) and the public key (e.g., 8) from the seconddifferent device 106 b. Device A calculations 500 shown inFIG. 2F provide example steps and formulas for computing the secret key. - The first anonymous identifier is associated with the secret key (324). For example, the first anonymous identifier (e.g., Device ID 2) can be stored with hashed version of the secret key in the linked
anonymous identifiers 122. As a result, both anonymous identifiers are now linked. For example, the secret key, the first anonymous identifier, and the second different anonymous identifier are stored as an entry in a table, e.g.,row 234. In some implementations, the association maps the secret key to both the first and the second different anonymous identifiers. In some implementations, one or more associations can be removed (e.g., deleted from the linked anonymous identifiers 122) after expiration of a first time period (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, or some other time period). In some implementations, the time period can be associated with an amount of time after which the user would have been expected to have logged out from either the first device or the second different device. - A request for content is received from either the first device including the first anonymous identifier or the second different device including the second different anonymous identifier (326). In one example, referring to
FIG. 2E , thecontent management system 110 can receive, from thefirst device 106 a, the request forcontent 240 a that includes the anonymousidentifier Device ID 1. In another example, thecontent management system 110 can receive, from the seconddifferent device 106 b, the request forcontent 240 b that includes the anonymousidentifier Device ID 2. - Content is provided in response to the request using the association (328). For example, depending on which device sent the request for
content content management system 110 can providecontent items first device 106 a or the seconddifferent device 106 b, respectively. - In some implementations, providing content in response to the request can further include identifying the user based on the association and providing content of interest to the user. For example, information (e.g., an interest in sports) that the user has provided in a user profile (or other information provided by and/or known about the user) can be used to select content which is likely of interest to the user.
- Some implementations of the process 300 can include steps for linking additional devices, e.g., a third device and/or additional devices. For example, a login request can be received from a third different device used by the user, the login request being associated with a third different anonymous identifier associated with the third different device. A third different public-private key pair can be created, including a third public key. The third private key can be stored locally on the third different device, and the third public key can be published (e.g., in the user login information 121). A secret key can be created using one of either the first public key or the second public key, in addition to the third different device's private key, e.g., using steps and formulas shown in
FIG. 2F . An association between the secret key, the first anonymous identifier, the second different anonymous identifier and the third different anonymous identifier can be stored, e.g., in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122. Subsequently, a request for content can be received from either the first device including the first anonymous identifier, the second different device including the second different anonymous identifier, or the third different device including the third different anonymous identifier. In response to request, content (e.g.,content items -
FIG. 3B is a flowchart of anexample process 340 for providing content to a user on any of multiple linked devices associated with the user. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 and/or theuser login service 120 can perform steps of theprocess 340 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2F are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 340. - Multiple anonymous identifiers associated with a user are linked by a service using a key exchange protocol without storing personally identifiable information associated with the user in the linking (342). For example, anonymous identifiers (e.g., browser cookies, or
device Device IDs 1 and 2) of thefirst device 106 a and the seconddifferent device 106 b, respectively, can be linked by theuser login service 120. The linking, for example, can occur using key exchange techniques described above, including using public, private and secret key calculations shown inFIG. 2E . In some implementations, public keys can be published on theuser login service 120, private keys can be stored on the corresponding local device, and secret keys can be stored in a third location (e.g., linked anonymous identifiers 122). Other techniques can be used to link the devices, and more than two devices can be linked. - In some implementations, linking multiple anonymous identifiers can include receiving a login request (e.g., login
requests anonymous identifiers 122, which does not include information about the user that can be traced back to the user (i.e., without having access to the information from theuser login information 121, the linkedanonymous identifiers 122, and private keys stored on the various user devices). - In some implementations, determining the secret key can include, at each device, creating a public-private key pair, publishing a public key of the public-private key pair, and using a private key of the public-private key pair and a public key of another device to compute the secret key.
- Requests for content from a client device associated with the user are received at the service, where each request includes one of the anonymous identifiers (344). For example, referring to
FIG. 2E , thecontent management system 110 can receive the request forcontent 240 a that includes the anonymousidentifier Device ID 1 corresponding to thefirst device 106 a. In another example, thecontent management system 110 can receive the request forcontent 240 b that includes the anonymousidentifier Device ID 2 corresponding to the seconddifferent device 106 b. - Content associated with the user is provided that is responsive to the received requests and based on the linking (346). For example, the
content management system 110 can providecontent items first device 106 a or the seconddifferent device 106 b, respectively, depending on which device sent the request forcontent -
FIG. 3C is a flowchart of anexample process 360 for providing content to a user on any of multiple devices linked using public-private keys. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 and/or theuser login service 120 can perform steps of theprocess 360 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2F are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 360. - Public-private key pairs are created for a user each time the user logs into a service from a different device including publishing respective public keys of the user in a directory entry associated with the user (362). For example,
FIGS. 2A-2D show a sequence of actions that use public-private key pairs to link thefirst device 106 a and the seconddifferent device 106 b. The public keys in this example are stored in theuser login information 121. - A secret key is created by each device using a public key of another device that is stored in the directory (364). For example,
FIGS. 2C-2D show a sequence of actions that determine the secret key for each of thefirst device 106 a and the seconddifferent device 106 b using the public key of the other device. - The secret keys are associated with a plurality of anonymous identifiers, each anonymous identifier assigned to the user during a session associated with a respective different device (366). As an example, the secret key is stored in the linked
anonymous identifiers 122. Steps and formulas for computing the secret keys are shown inFIG. 2E . - Content is provided that is associated with the user and based at least in part on the association (368). For example, depending on which device sent the request for
content content management system 110 can providecontent items first device 106 a or the seconddifferent device 106 b, respectively. -
FIG. 3D is a flowchart of anexample process 380 for associating impressions with interactions by a user on any of multiple linked devices associated with the user. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 and/or theuser login service 120 can perform steps of theprocess 380 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2G are referenced as example structures/interfaces associated with the steps of theprocess 380. As described above, conversion tracking based on impressions and interactions made by a user across multiple linked requesting sources may occur only if permitted by the user, e.g., based on settings in the user opt-out andprivacy preferences 142. - A plurality of identifiers associated with a user are anonymously linked. Each identifier is associated with a user and a specific requesting source (382). The anonymous linking includes linking at least two different identifiers that are associated with two different requesting sources used by the user to access content.
- For example, the identifiers associated with the user's requesting sources, such as mobile and non-mobile devices, can be linked anonymously, as described above with reference to
FIGS. 2A-2F . Other ways of linking a user's requesting sources can be used. - Impression, click and interaction data is stored for the user in association with respective identifiers (384). For example, information about clicks, impressions such as
impression 260, and conversions such asinteractions 264 can be stored. Thecontent management system 110 can store the information, for example, in association with the linkedanonymous identifiers 122 or in some other way. - It is determined that an impression of content to the user has occurred on one of the two different requesting sources and that an interaction has been recorded on another of the two different requesting sources, the interaction being associated with the impression (386). In some implementations, determining that the interaction has been recorded can include determining a first identifier associated with the interaction and determining when the first identifiers is linked with any other identifiers that have recorded an impression, on a different requesting source, of a content item that relates to the interaction. For example, using impression data associated with the
impression 260 and interaction data associated with theinteraction 264, and in light of linkedanonymous identifiers 122, thecontent management system 110 can determine that theimpression 260 and theinteraction 264 are associated with the same user. - In some implementations, determining when the first identifier is linked further includes determining when the first identifier is linked to any other identifier that has recorded an impression within a predetermined time associated with the interaction. For example, the
content management system 110 can determine if thetime B 262 b associated with theinteraction 264 is within thepredetermined time 268. If so, then in this example the identifier associated with the user's non-mobile computing device can be associated, or linked, with the identifier associated with the user's mobile device. - The impression is linked with the interaction and/or click, including charging a sponsor associated with the impression and/or click (388). For example, the
content management system 110 can use information in the linkedanonymous identifiers 122 to associate the conversion on the user's non-mobile device to the impression on the user's mobile device. Then, the content sponsor associated with the advertisement for Camera X can be charged for the impression and/or click. In some implementations, charges described herein for conversions can be separate from, or in addition to, charges made to the content sponsor for clicks and impressions. - In some implementations, a publisher associated with the impression can be credited. For example, if the impression occurs on Web Page Y, then the publisher associated with Web page Y can be paid a pre-arranged amount for an impression that has led to a conversion by a user on a second of multiple, anonymously-linked devices associated with the user.
- Some implementations can involve the use of surveys, e.g., where completing a survey can be the user interaction that occurs on the second device. For example, the impression on the user's first device (e.g., a mobile device) can be or be associated with an advertisement, and the interaction can be associated with a survey that is presented on the user's second different device (e.g., a non-mobile, personal computer). The survey in this example can be designed to be delivered to users' non-mobile devices at a predetermined time after presentation of the advertisement on their mobile devices. Conversion tracking can be used, in this example, to determine which users, and/or what percentage of users, complete the survey on the second device. In some implementations, using conversion tracking statistics for example, additional content can be presented to users and/or the types of users who have completed the survey. The content in this example can include content for which the initial impression occurs on mobile devices and for which conversion is potentially more likely to occur on a non-mobile device because of the specific user or the type of user (e.g., a user that distrusts making financial transactions on a mobile device). In some implementations, the
process 380 can further include steps for providing content to similar types of users as the user who converted on the second device or other such users. For example, thecontent management system 110 can identify a user associated with linked impressions and interactions from two different requesting sources, where the impression has occurred on a first requesting source of the user and the conversion has occurred on a second different requesting source of the user. An example result is categorizing users who react favorably to mobile-then-non-mobile content. Content can then be identified to serve to other users having similar traits, e.g., similar interactions. The content can be identified, for example, when the similar user is interacting with the first requesting source. At that time, mobile-then-non-mobile content can also be provided to the user. In some implementations, content providers can be presented with options to provide impressions of their content items to users who have certain types of multiple requesting sources and/or histories of converting on the linked requesting sources. -

The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 404, thestorage device 406, or memory onprocessor 402. - The
high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while thelow speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled tomemory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled tostorage device 406 and low-speed expansion port 414. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure.

standard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 424. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device 400, 450, and an entire system may be made up ofmultiple computing devices 400, 450 communicating with each other. -
Computing device 450 includes aprocessor 452,memory 464, an input/output device such as adisplay 454, acommunication interface 466, and atransceiver 468, among other components. Thedevice 450 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 452 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 450, including instructions stored in thememory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 450, and wireless communication bydevice 450. -
Processor 452 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 458 anddisplay interface 456 coupled to adisplay 454.

Thedisplay interface 456 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 452. In addition, anexternal interface 462 may be provided in communication withprocessor 452, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 450 with other devices.External interface 462 may provide, for example, for wired communication (e.g., via a docking procedure) or for wireless communication (e.g., via Bluetooth or other such technologies). - The
memory 464 stores information within thecomputing device 450. In one implementation, thememory 464 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 464 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 464 is a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 474 may also be provided and connected todevice 450 through expansion interface 472, which may include, for example, a subscriber identification module (SIM) card interface.Such expansion memory 474 may provide extra storage space fordevice 450, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 450. Specifically,expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module fordevice 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include for example, flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above.

memory 464,expansion memory 474, or memory onprocessor 452. -
Device 450 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 466, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 466 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 468. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition,GPS receiver module 470 may provide additional wireless data todevice 450, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 450. -
Device 450 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 460, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 460 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 450. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating ondevice 450. - The
computing device 450 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 482, personal digital assistant, or other mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
