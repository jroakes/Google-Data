User interface 128 can comprise one or more parts, and such as touch-screen, screen are together with keyboard and mouse, loudspeaker etc.Network interface 126 can support such communication protocol, such as, at the TCP/IP of wired or wireless agreement higher slice.
Continue with reference to figure 1, map server 101 can comprise one or more general processor 140, non-provisional computer-readable memory 142 and network interface 146 to communicate with 160 with database 120,150 with client device 102A-C.Map server 101 can comprise the Multi-instance of the parts shown in extra parts or Fig. 1 in some embodiments.In addition, in some implementations, system 100 can comprise the multiple separate servers providing mapping (enum) data and business data individually.These servers can be correlated with from same online service or the online service separated safeguarded by different operators.
Map data base 160 can store map content, such as street and road information, terrain data, satellite image, the information relevant with public transportation route, about enterprise or the information of other point of interest (POI), the information etc. about current traffic condition.Map data base 160 can store the map datum with any appropriate format or form set, such as vector graphics, raster image etc.Map datum at database 160 can be divided into the map tile of certain size, and it can be specific to zoom level.In some cases, one in customer equipment 102A-C or several receives the data from map data base 160 via map server 101, thus provides interactive digital map via respective user interfaces.
Commercial content database 150 can store the advertisement, proposal, reward voucher etc. that receive from various business entity (comprising the traditional forms of enterprises).Each description of the unit of commercial content can comprise for the various rules in client device place display commercial content.Such as, the operator of some business can ask their advertisement to be shown in some time and some place place.Usually, commercial content database 150 can store the rule of any expectation complexity for providing commercial content to user via portable set.
In some cases, correlated activation processing engine 116 creates the rule being used for showing commercial content based on the association detected between the access of the business entity to some geographical location automatically.Such as, at geographic position L
1the enterprise B at place
1operator its commercial content can be asked to be presented at user's most probable makes response position to proposal, advertisement, reward voucher etc.Correlated activation processing engine 116 can detect to enterprise B
1access and at position L
2the enterprise B at place
2former access between sufficiently high association (such as correlation coefficient exceedes certain threshold value), and according to enterprise B
1which commercial content frequently be presented at position L
2place creates rule automatically.
In some cases, correlated activation processing engine 116 uses the association detected to produce electronic information for enterprise owners and operator, comprises the suggestion of the effective placement to commercial content.In order to continue example above, correlated activation processing engine 116 can be enterprise B
1operator produce email message, it has at position L
2the suggestion that place advertises.The electronic information of other suitable type comprises such as helping automatic notice that people builds its website, that provide via the user interface of online service and suggestion.
In operation, the user of client device 102A can be interactive via user interface 128 and digit mapping module 110.User selectively manages region, and responsively, digit mapping module 110 can ask corresponding map datum from map server 101.Alternatively, digit mapping module 110 can ask the map datum in region automatically, comprises the current location of client device 102A.Responsively, map generation module 138 can be provided for the map datum of the numerical map reproducing geographic area from map data base 160, and provide in some cases according to store rules selection in the database 150 and display, from the commercial content of database 150.Refer again to illustrative case above, when the user of client device 102A accesses enterprise B
2or more specifically at position L
2during place, map server 101 can provide and enterprise B
1relevant commercial content is used for numerical map or otherwise shows via user interface 128.
In order to explain the exemplary operations of correlated activation processing engine 116 further, Fig. 2 schematically shows the User Activity relevant with the enterprise 202 and 204 in geographic region 200.The position of enterprise 202 and 204 is represented by position mark.In shown situation, user A accesses enterprise 204 and goes to enterprise 202 along path or track 210.Because user A operates some control and reports current location to allow her portable set at different time, correlated activation processing engine 116 can rebuild track 210 to determine that such as user A may conclude the business at place of enterprise 202 and at place of enterprise 204 on room and time.
The portable set of user B can not report its current location.But, user B can certain time corresponding to enterprise 204 position " registration " (event 212) and subsequently in the position " registration " (event 214) corresponding to enterprise 202.If user and map data base 101 share this data, then correlated activation processing engine 116 can determine that user B may conclude the business at place of enterprise 202 and at place of enterprise 204.
Continue with reference to figure 2, user C accesses enterprise 204 and goes to enterprise 202 along track 216.Track 216 can very be different from track 210, and can be different to the time between enterprise 202 and the access of 204 to user A and B.
Based on the activity of user A, B and C, correlated activation processing engine 116 can be determined at the possible causa relation to the access between enterprise 202 and 204.More specifically, correlated activation processing engine 116 can based on these users access the order of enterprise, the Distance geometry between enterprise access between time etc. determine possible causa relation.For this purpose, correlated activation processing engine 116 can apply any suitable statistical technique, is included in those technology as known in the art.Certainly, correlated activation processing engine 116 generally considers that the sample comprising a large amount of track and registration carrys out identification activity, the activity of such as Fig. 2.Sample can comprise by the only a lot of user trajectory, registration etc. of in enterprise 202 and 204, and correlated activation processing engine 116 can determine to access enterprise 202 with one of 204 how many users also access another and how many users so do with the order identical with C with user A, B.Therefore, if user A, B and C individually access the only user in hundreds of users of enterprise 202 and 204, then correlated activation processing engine 116 can produce the correlation coefficient lower than threshold value, and determines may not have causa relation between enterprise 202 and the access of 204.On the other hand, if the user of large number percent accesses enterprise 202 and 204, be similar to user A, B and C, then correlated activation processing engine 116 can produce the correlation coefficient higher than threshold value, and determines may have causa relation between enterprise 202 and the access of 204.
Except direct position report and registration, correlated activation processing engine 116 also can utilize user to use social networking service actual access place, other instructions in virtual " access " place and/or other instructions in user place interested.Such as, user is by checking that via online business service, online interaction formula mapping services, social networks etc. distribute the star of certain quantity to check place.Check it can is private or public.As another example, user can submit the search inquiry relevant with place to via search engine or submit the geographic query relevant with this place to via interactive mapping services.
In addition, when attempting the possible cause relation between test access, correlated activation active process engine 116 can analysis time pattern, such as working day/weekend mode or dinner/lunchtime pattern or summer/winter.More specifically, can in lunchtime instead of closely related at other times to the access in paired place.Therefore, holding in the industry at relevant venue provider in the lunchtime may be meaningful, but provides identical commercial content may be useless at other times at same position.Further, correlated activation processing engine 116 can consider other factors, such as rainy, cloudy or other weather conditions.
Then, Fig. 3 illustrate can realize in such as correlated activation processing engine 116 in view of relevant user activities produce commercial content for being presented at the process flow diagram of the exemplary method 300 of geographical location.Method 300 can be implemented as and be stored on computer-readable memory and executable one group of instruction on one or more processor (such as processor 140).
At block 302, detect by first group of user the access of the first business entity.Such as, describe a large number of users track, registration, coupon are cashed, electronics buys the data set to confirm etc. can be analyzed to determine that some users have accessed the first business entity being arranged in first position.At block 304, data set is further analyzed to determine that some users have accessed the second business entity being arranged in second position.The group of accessing the user of the first business entity and the second business entity can be overlapping to specify certain subset of user.As discussed above, the size (and in some cases subset and the ratio in the total collection of the user of data centralization) of this subset can be being identified in one of factor considered during possible causa relation between the first business entity and the access of the second business entity.
At block 306, any suitable statistical technique is used to determine to indicate the correlation coefficient of possible causa relation.Correlation coefficient and certain predetermined threshold can be compared at block 308.If determine that correlation coefficient exceedes threshold value, then flow process proceeds to block 310.Otherwise method 300 terminates.
At block 310, produce the commercial content relevant with the second business entity for being presented at the subscriber equipment of the first geographical location.In some embodiments, method 300 can only have an impact several factors of display of commercial content.Therefore at block 310, method 300 can produce signal in these cases, and balance is conducive to producing the commercial content relevant with the second business entity and produces this content on the subscriber equipment being presented at the first geographical location instead of directly by it.But, more generally, the commercial content relevant with the second business entity can be produced for being presented at the subscriber equipment of directly or indirectly relevant with the first geographic position multiple positions.As an example, the commercial content relevant with the second business entity can be provided in response to user submits to the research relevant with the first geographic position to inquire about.
In addition, in some embodiments, method 300 comprises generation electronic information, and it comprises the suggestion of the operator to the second business entity.According to realization, this electronic information in a block 310 shown in action before or replace the action that illustrates in a block 310 and produce.
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of another exemplary method 400 for generation of commercial content that can realize in the system of fig. 1.Be similar to method 300, method 400 can be implemented as and be stored on computer-readable memory and executable one group of instruction on one or more processor (such as processor 140).
At block 402, receive the instruction in the path that user advances and corresponding persond eixis.Then, at block 404, be received in the potential association between the first business entity and the access of the second business entity.The technology summarized can be used above or detect these potential associations in another appropriate manner.
At block 406, produce according to detected association and/or select commercial content.Such as, the portable set place for being presented at the second geographical location such as the advertisement relevant with the first business entity, proposal, coupon can be produced.
