- PDF Portable Document Format
- the user's 112 a interaction with articles, the client applications 120 , and the client device 102 a creates event data that may be observed, recorded, analyzed or otherwise used.
- An event can be any occurrence possible associated with an article, client application 120 , or client device 102 a , such as inputting text in an article, displaying an article on a display device, sending an article, receiving an article, manipulating an input device, opening an article, saving an article, printing an article, closing an article, opening a client application program, closing a client application program, idle time, processor load, disk access, memory usage, bringing a client application program to the foreground, changing visual display details of the application (such as resizing or minimizing) and any other suitable occurrence associated with an article, a client application program, or the client device whatsoever.
- event data can be generated when the client device 102 a interacts with an article independent of the user 112 a , such as when receiving an email or performing a scheduled task.
- the memory 108 of the client device 102 a can also contain a capture processor 124 , a queue 126 , and a search engine 122 .
- the client device 102 a can also contain or is in communication with a data store 140 .
- the capture processor 124 can capture events and pass them to the queue 126 .
- the queue 126 can pass the captured events to the search engine 122 or the search engine 122 can retrieve new events from the queue 126 .
- the queue 126 notifies the search engine 122 when a new event arrives in the queue 126 and the search engine 122 retrieves the event (or events) from the queue 126 when the search engine 122 is ready to process the event (or events).
- the search engine When the search engine receives an event it can be processed and can be stored in the data store 140 .
- the search engine 122 can receive an explicit query from the user 112 a or generate an implicit query and it can retrieve information from the data store 140 in response to the query.
- the queue is located in the search engine 122 .
- the client device 102 a does not have a queue and the events are passed from the capture processor 124 directly to the search engine 122 .
- the event data is transferred using an information exchange protocol.
- the information exchange protocol can comprise, for example, any suitable rule or convention facilitating data exchange, and can include, for example, any one of the following communication mechanisms: Extensible Markup Language—Remote Procedure Calling protocol (XML/RPC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared memory, sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- XML/RPC Extensible Markup Language—Remote Procedure Calling protocol
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol
- shared memory sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.
- the capture processor 124 can capture an event by identifying and compiling event data associated with an event. Examples of events include sending or receiving an instant messenger message, a user viewing a web page, saving a word processing document, printing a spreadsheet document, inputting text to compose or edit an email, opening a presentation application, closing an instant messenger application, entering a keystroke, moving the mouse, and hovering the mouse over a hyperlink.
- An example of event data captured by the capture processor 124 for an event involving the receipt of an instant messenger message by the user 112 a can comprise the sender of the message, the recipients of the message, the time and date the message was received, the content of the message, a file associated with the message, and a conversation identifier.
- a conversation identifier can be used to associate messages that form a conversation and can be provided by the instant messenger application or can be generated by the capture processor 124 .
- a conversation can be one or more messages between the user 112 a and at least one other user until the user 112 a logs out of or closes the instant messenger application or the instant messenger application is inactive for a certain period of time (for example, 30 minutes).
- the capture processor 124 comprises multiple capture components.
- the capture processor 124 shown in FIG. 1 comprises a separate capture component for each client application in order to capture events associated with each application.
- the capture processor 124 can also comprises a separate capture component that monitors overall network activity in order to capture event data associated with network activity, such as the receipt or sending of an instant messenger message.
- the capture processor 124 shown in FIG. 1 also can comprise a separate client device capture component that monitors overall client device performance data, such as processor load, idle time, disk access, the client applications in use, and the amount of memory available.
- 1 also comprises a separate capture component to monitor and capture keystrokes input by the user and a separate capture component to monitor and capture items, such as text, displayed on a display device associated with the client device 102 a .
- An individual capture component can monitor multiple client applications and multiple capture components can monitor different aspects of a single client application.
- the capture processor 124 can monitor activity on the client device and can capture events by a generalized event definition and registration mechanism, such as an event schema.
- Each capture component can define its own event schema or can use a predefined one.
- Event schema can differ depending on the client application or activity the capture component is monitoring.
- the event schema can describe the format for an event, for example, by providing fields for event data associated with the event (such as the time of the event) and fields related to any associated article (such as the title) as well as the content of any associated article (such as the document body).
- An event schema can describe the format for any suitable event data that relates to an event.
- an event schema for an instant messenger message event sent by the user 112 a can include a recipient or list of recipients, the time sent, the date sent, content of the message, a file associated with the message, and a conversation identifier.
- An event schema for a web page currently being viewed by a user can include the Uniform Resource Locator or URL of the web page, the time being viewed, and the content of the web page.
- An event schema for a word processing document being saved by a user can include the title of the document, the time saved, the location of the document, the format of the document, the text of the document, and a pointer to the location of the document. More generally, an event schema can describe the state of the system around the time of the event.
- an event schema can contain a URL for a web page event associated with a previous web page that the user navigated from.
- an event schema can describe fields with more complicated structure like lists.
- an event schema can contain fields that list multiple recipients.
- An event schema can also contain optional fields so that an application can include additional event data if desired.
- An event can be captured by compiling event data into fields described by an associated event schema.
- the capture processor 124 can capture events occurring presently (or “real-time events”) and can capture events that have occurred in the past (or “historical events”).
- Real-time events can be “indexable” or “non-indexable”.
- the search engine 122 indexes indexable real-time events, but does not index non-indexable real-time events.
- the search engine 122 may determine whether to index an event based on the importance of the event. Indexable real-time events can be more important events associated with an article, such as viewing a web page, loading or saving a file, and receiving or sending an instant message or email. Non-indexable events can be deemed not important enough by the search engine 122 to index and store the event, such as moving the mouse or selecting a portion of text in an article.
- Non-indexable events can be used by the search engine 122 to update the current user state. While all real-time events can relate to what the user is currently doing (or the current user state), indexable real-time events can be indexed and stored in the data store 140 . Alternatively, the search engine 122 can index all real-time events.
- Real-time events can include, for example, sending or receiving an article, such as an instant messenger message, examining a portion of an article, such as selecting a portion of text or moving a mouse over a portion of a web page, changing an article, such as typing a word in an email or pasting a sentence in a word processing document, closing an article, such as closing an instant messenger display area or changing an email message being viewed, loading, saving, opening, or viewing an article, such as a word processing document, web page, or email, listening to or saving an MP3 file or other audio/video file, or updating the metadata of an article, such as book marking a web page, printing a presentation document, deleting a word processing document, or moving a spreadsheet document.
- an article such as an instant messenger message
- examining a portion of an article such as selecting a portion of text or moving a mouse over a portion of a web page
- changing an article such as typing a word in an email or pasting a sentence in a word processing document
- closing an article such
- Historical events are similar to indexable real-time events except that the event occurred before the installation of the search engine 122 or was otherwise not captured, because, for example, the search engine 122 was not operational for a period of time while the client device 102 a was operational or because no capture component existed for a specific type of historical event at the time the event took place.
- Examples of historical events include the user's saved word processing documents, media files, presentation documents, calendar entries, and spreadsheet documents, the emails in a user's inbox, and the web pages book marked by the user.
- the capture processor 124 can capture historical events by periodically crawling the memory 108 and any associated data storage device for events not previously captured by the capture processor 124 .
- the capture processor 124 can also capture historical events by requesting certain client applications, such as a web browser or an email application, to retrieve articles and other associated information. For example, the capture processor 124 can request that the web browser application obtain all viewed web pages by the user or request that the email application obtain all email messages associated with the user. These articles may not currently exist in memory 108 or on a storage device of the client device 102 a . For example, the email application may have to retrieve emails from a server device. In one embodiment, the search engine 122 indexes historical events.
- events captured by the capture processor 124 are sent to the queue 126 in the format described by an event schema.
- the capture processor 124 can also send performance data to the queue 126 .
- Examples of performance data include current processor load, average processor load over a predetermined period of time, idle time, disk access, the client applications in use, and the amount of memory available.
- Performance data can also be provided by specific performance monitoring components, some of which may be part of the search engine 122 , for example.
- the performance data in the queue 126 can be retrieved by the search engine 122 and the capture components of the capture processor 124 .
- capture components can retrieve the performance data to alter how many events are sent to the queue 126 or how detailed the events are that are sent (fewer or smaller events when the system is busy) or how frequently events are sent (events are sent less often when the system is busy or there are too many events waiting to be processed).
- the search engine 122 can use performance data to determine when it indexes various events and when and how often it issues implicit queries.
- the queue 126 holds events until the search engine 122 is ready to process an event or events.
- the queue 126 uses the performance data to help determine how quickly to provide the events to the search engine 122 .
- the queue 126 can comprise one or more separate queues including a user state queue and an index queue.
- the index queue can queue indexable events, for example.
- the queue 126 can have additional queues or comprise a single queue.
- the queue 126 can be implemented as a circular priority queue using memory mapped files.
- the queue can be a multiple-priority queue where higher priority events are served before lower priority events, and other components may be able to specify the type of events they are interested in.
- real-time events can be given higher priority than historical events, and indexable events can be given higher priority than non-indexable real-time events.
- Other implementations of the queue 126 are possible.
- the client device 102 a does not have a queue 126 .
- events are passed directly from the capture processor 124 to the search engine 122 .
- events can be transferred between the capture components and the search engine using suitable information exchange mechanisms such as: Extensible Markup Language—Remote Procedure Calling protocol (XML/RPC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), shared memory, sockets, local or remote procedure calling, or any other suitable information exchange mechanism.

- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol
- the search engine 122 can contain an indexer 130 , a query system 132 , and a formatter 134 .
- the query system 132 can retrieve all real-time events and performance data from the queue 126 .
- the query system 132 can use performance data and real-time events to update the current user state and generate an implicit query.
- An implicit query can be an automatically generated query based on the current user state.
- the query system 132 can also receive and process explicit queries from the user 112 a .
- Performance data can also be retrieved by the search engine 122 from the queue 126 for use in determining the amount of activity possible by the search engine 122 .

- the data store 140 comprises a local index.
- the local index in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 may comprise information, such as articles, which are associated with the client device 102 a , a user 112 a of the client device 102 a , or a group of users of the client device 102 a .
- the local index in the data store 140 shown in FIG. 1 may comprise an index of articles created, edited, received, or stored by the client user 112 a using the client machine 102 a , or articles otherwise associated with the client user 102 a or the client machine 112 a .
- the local index may be stored in a client machine, such as in data store 140 , in a data store on a local network in a manner accessible by the client machine, on a server accessible to the client machine through the Internet, or in another accessible location.
- a global index may comprise information relevant to many users or many servers, such as, for example, an index of web pages located on multiple servers in communication with the World Wide Web.
- a global index is an index used by the GoogleTM search engine to provide search results in response to a search query.
- a single index may comprise both a local and a global index.
- an index may comprise both local and global information, and include a user or client identifier with the local information so that it may be identified with the user(s) or client(s) to which it pertains.
- an index, local or global may be present in one or multiple logical or physical locations.
- the indexer 130 when the indexer 130 receives an event, the indexer 130 can determine, from the event schema, terms (if any) associated with the event, the time of the event (if available), images (if any) associated with the event, and/or other information defining the event. The indexer 130 can also determine if the event relates to other events and associate the event with related events. For example, for a received instant messenger message event, the indexer can associate the message event with other message events from the same conversation. The messages from the same conversation can be associated with each other in a conversation object, which can be stored in the data store 140 .
- the indexer 130 can send and incorporate the terms and times, associated with the event in the index 142 of the data store 140 .

In one such embodiment, if the relevance measure between the first and second instant messenger events does not meet or exceed the threshold value, it may be determined whether the first instant messenger event is associated with at least a previously indexed third instant messenger event.
- the determination of whether the first instant messenger event is associated with at least a previously indexed third instant messenger event may be made. Similar to the determination of whether the first instant messenger event was associated with the second instant messenger event, the determination of whether the first instant messenger event is associated with the third instant messenger event may be based, at least in part, on a relevance measure.
- the first instant messenger event may be associated with a conversation identifier associated with the third instant messenger event if the relevance measure exceeds a predetermined threshold value.

- the relevance measure may exceed the threshold value if the first conversation roster matches the second conversation roster.
- One embodiment may comprise determining an elapsed time between a first time associated with the first instant messenger event, and a second time associated with the second instant messenger event.
- the elapsed time may comprise a time period between a first time that a first instant messenger message associated with the first instant messenger message was sent, and a second time that a second instant messenger message associated with the second instant messenger event was sent.
- the elapsed time may be measured differently, such as by measuring the time passage between the receipt of a first instant messenger message and a time of sending of a second instant messenger message, or a time period between a first time of capture of the first instant messenger event and a second time of capture of the second instant messenger event.
- the relevance measure may exceed the threshold value if the first conversation roster matches the second conversation roster and the elapsed time is lesser than a predetermined value. In one such embodiment, the elapsed time may be determined only if the first display area identifier does not match the second display area identifier.
- the type of data associated with an instant messenger event may be used in one embodiment to help determine the relevance measure. For example, in one embodiment, determining the relevance measure may further comprise comparing a first data type associated with the first instant messenger event with a second data type associated with the second instant messenger event.
- an instant messenger event may comprise a data type associated with a engineering design application configured to use an instant messenger application to communicate a specification of a design to another engineer, product designer, marketer, etc. If a first instant messenger event comprising the aforementioned engineering design application data type is identified, a data store may be searched for a previously indexed second instant messenger event comprising the same data type. If such a second instant messenger event is found, a relevance measure may be determined between the first and second instant messenger events.

- a relevance measure may be determined by comparing a first keyword, a first conversation roster, and a first data type associated with a first instant messenger event with a second keyword, a second conversation roster, and a second data type, respectively, associated with a second instant messenger event.
- an instant messenger conversation may take place between two entities.
- certain instant messenger conversations may take place between more than two entities.
- certain instant messenger conversations may involve entities that joined the conversation after it began, entities that left the conversation before it concluded, entities that left a conversation and later rejoined the same conversation, and/or entities that joined a conversation after it began and left before it concluded.
- one method according to the present invention may further comprise identifying a conversation participant identifier signal, and modifying the second conversation roster associated with the previously indexed second instant messenger event and/or a conversation identifier in response.
- Conversation participant identifier signals may comprise, for example, an additional conversation participant's identity, a departing conversation participant's identity, and/or a reference to a conversation identifier associated with the second instant messenger event.

- the indexer 130 can associate the two events with the same conversation. Additionally, if user A sends user B a number of messages in a row, these messages may be associated with the same conversation. In other embodiment, messages between multiple users, such as in a “chat room” can be associated with the same conversation, messages from a user to himself can be associated with the same conversation, and messages from a user to an automated service or computer can be associated with the same conversation.
- a conversation object can associate an instant messenger event with related instant messenger events from the same conversation.
- a conversation object may comprise a conversation object identifier (such as a conversation identifier). Conversations can also be associated with each other through an associated conversation thread.
- the indexer 130 determines that the instant messenger event should be associated with an existing conversation, then the indexer 130 , as shown in 408 , can load the relevant conversation object from the database 144 of the data store 140 . By associating instant messenger events with a conversation, a user is able to search for and retrieve complete instant messenger conversations.

- the user 112 a may be able to specify which instant messenger events the capture processor 124 captures, such as by specifying that only instant messenger events associated with instant messenger messages to or from a particular instant messenger “buddy” with which the user 112 a regularly converses via instant messages should be captured.
- the user 112 a may set a criterion that allows all instant messenger events to be captured by the capture processor 124 , but allows only those instant messenger events that satisfy the criterion to be indexed by the indexer 130 .
- the user 112 a may set a criterion that permits the query system 132 to identify previously indexed instant messenger events in the data store 140 that were indexed during a particular time period.
- a criterion may alternatively or additionally be generated automatically based, at least in part, on the past preferences, activities, and proclivities of the user 112 a .
- Examples of criteria comprise when an instant message associated with the instant messenger event was sent or received, who sent such an instant message, where the client device that sent such an instant message is physically located, how such an instant message was transmitted, etc.

- the relevance measure may comprise, for example, a quantification of how relevant the first instant messenger event is to the second instant messenger event, and/or a conversation identifier associated with the second instant messenger event.
- the relevance measure may be determined using a variety of different methods. For example, in one embodiment, a first display area identifier, such as an instant messenger window name, associated with the first instant messenger event may be compared with a second display area identifier associated with the second instant messenger event.
- a match between display area identifiers may indicate that the two instant messenger events took place in the same instant messenger display area, are relevant to one another, and should be associated with each other and a common conversation identifier.
- Other aspects, attributes, and information associated with an instant messenger event may be used to determine a relevance measure, such as, for example, conversation rosters, data types, keywords, and conversation participant identifier signals.
- a first conversation roster associated with the first instant messenger event may be compared with a second conversation roster associated with the second instant messenger event.
- a conversation roster may comprise a plurality of conversation participant identifiers, such as a list of the entities involved with a particular instant messenger event, such as the sender of an associated instant messenger message, and the recipient of that instant messenger message.

For example, in one embodiment an elapsed time may be determined, wherein the elapsed time comprises a measure of time between a first time associated with the first instant messenger event, and a second time associated with the second instant messenger event.
- a time associated with an instant messenger event may comprise, for example, a time an instant messenger message was sent, a time an instant messenger message was received, or a time the instant messenger event was captured.
- the relevance measure may exceed a threshold value when the first conversation roster matches the second conversation roster, and the determined elapsed time between the time the first time and the second time is less than a predetermined value.
- a relevance measure may indicate that, although the two instant messenger events are associated with two respective instant messenger messages that did not occur in the same instant messenger display area, they involved the same participants, occurred close in time together, and therefore may be relevant to one another and comprise a conversation.
- association of a common keyword with two separate instant messenger events may contribute to a relevance measure between the two instant messenger events that exceeds the threshold value.
- a first instant messenger event may be associated with a first instant messenger message comprising the term “Hulk.”
- a second instant messenger event comprising a different display area identifier than the first instant messenger event, but the same conversation roster may be associated with a second instant messenger message also comprising the term “Hulk.”
- the association of the same keyword with the two instant messenger events, along with the match of the first and second conversation rosters may cause the relevance measure to exceed the threshold value.
- the elapsed time between a first time the first instant messenger message was received by an entity and a second time the second instant messenger event was sent by the same entity may be determined, and the relevance measure may exceed the threshold value if the first and second conversation rosters match, and at least one of the elapsed time is lesser than a predetermined value, and the first and second instant messenger events comprise the same keyword.
- an instant messenger event may comprise a data type associated with a long distance chess game application configured to use an instant messenger application to communicate a move of a first player's chess piece to an opponent second player. If a first instant messenger event comprising the aforementioned chess game application data type is identified, the query system 132 may search the data store 140 for a previously indexed second instant messenger event comprising the same data type. If such a second instant messenger event is found, the indexer 130 may determine a relevance measure between the first and second instant messenger events.
- the first instant messenger event may be associated with the second instant messenger event if the two events have matching conversation rosters, and the first instant messenger event comprises a first data type that matches a second data type associated with the second instant messenger event.
- the indexer 130 associates the first instant messenger event with a conversation identifier associated with the previously indexed second instant messenger event. For example, in one embodiment, the relevance measure may exceed the threshold value when a first display area identifier associated with the first instant messenger event matches a second display area identifier associated with the second instant messenger event. In another embodiment, the relevance measure may exceed the threshold value when the first and second conversation rosters match, and the elapsed time is lesser than a predetermined value.
- One embodiment of the present invention may comprise determining whether the first instant messenger event is associated with a plurality of previously indexed instant messenger events and/or conversation identifiers.
- the indexer 130 may determine whether the first instant messenger event is associated with at least a previously indexed third instant messenger event. Such a determination may also be made based, at least in part, on a relevance measure.
- the first instant messenger event may be associated with a conversation identifier associated with the third instant messenger event.
- the query system 132 may continue to attempt to identify conversations, conversation identifiers and/or previously indexed instant messenger events in the data store 140 to which an identified first instant messenger event may be relevant. If the indexer 130 is unable to associate a first instant messenger event with any conversation identifier or previously indexed instant messenger event in the data store 140 , the indexer 130 may generate a new conversation identifier, and associate the first instant messenger event with the new conversation identifier.
- the capturing of instant messenger message events that are indexed and stored by the search engine 122 may allow the user 112 a to search for and retrieve instant messenger messages on the client device 102 a and may allow the search engine to automatically search for instant messenger messages on the client device 102 a . Indexing instant messenger events while they happen without waiting for the end of the conversation may provide the user with access to the event data before the end of the conversation.
- the environment shown reflects a client-side search engine architecture embodiment. Other embodiments are possible, such as a stand-alone client device or a network search engine.
