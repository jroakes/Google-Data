Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. A request is received for an advertisement for presentation in a slot. The request includes selection criteria. At least one selection criterion indicates a preference for display advertisements. Using the selection criteria, without regard for the preference, candidate advertisements are identified from an inventory that includes both display and other types of advertisements. An auction is conducted, including the identified candidates, determining a winning bid. A type of advertisement for the winning bid is determined. When the winning bid is associated with a display advertisement, a display advertisement is provided. When the winning bid is associated with a text advertisement, rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement are adjusted or added to enable display of an image-like version of the text advertisement, which is provided with the adjusted rendering parameters.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes receiving a request for an advertisement for presentation in a slot associated with a resource, wherein the request includes one or more selection criteria, and wherein at least one selection criterion indicates a preference for display advertisements. The method further includes identifying candidate advertisements from an inventory using the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference, wherein the inventory includes both display advertisements and other types of advertisements including text advertisements. The method further includes conducting an auction including the identified candidates, wherein conducting includes determining a winning bid. The method further includes determining a type of advertisement associated with the winning bid. When the winning bid is associated with a display advertisement, providing the display advertisement responsive to the request. When the winning bid is associated with a text advertisement, adjusting or adding rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement so as to enable display of an image-like version of the text advertisement and providing the text advertisement with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The rendering parameters can include a background shading. The background shading can be configured to darken on hover. The rendering parameters can include a selection of typeface, and adjusting can include selecting a typeface that is different than a typeface originally associated with the text advertisement. The rendering parameters can include spacing, and adjusting can include expanding spacing between elements of the text advertisement including adjusting spacing for one or more of the title, uniform resource locator, or body text. The method can further include adding an item to the text advertisement, wherein the item is selected from the group comprising a control, an arrow, a chevron, or favicon. The control can be a call-to-action control. The rendering parameters can include a positioning parameter, and adjusting can include adjusting positioning of elements of the textual advertisement to fill the slot. The rendering parameters can include a background color, and adjusting can include setting the background color to a new single color. The rendering parameters can include a spacing parameter, and adjusting can include tightening spacing, as compared to an original spacing, in a title of the text advertisement.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: receive a request for an advertisement for presentation in a slot associated with a resource, wherein the request includes one or more selection criteria, and wherein at least one selection criterion indicates a preference for display advertisements; identify candidate advertisements from an inventory using the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference, wherein the inventory includes both display advertisements and other types of advertisements including text advertisements; conduct an auction including the identified candidates, wherein conducting includes determining a winning bid; and determine a type of advertisement associated with the winning bid including: when the winning bid is associated with a display advertisement, provide the display advertisement responsive to the request; and when the winning bid is associated with a text advertisement, adjust or add rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement so as to enable display of an image-like version of the text advertisement, and provide the text advertisement with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The rendering parameters can include a background shading. The background shading can be configured to darken on hover. The rendering parameters can include a selection of typeface, and adjusting can include selecting a typeface that is different than a typeface originally associated with the text advertisement. The rendering parameters can include spacing, and adjusting can include expanding spacing between elements of the text advertisement including adjusting spacing for one or more of the title, uniform resource locator, or body text.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system comprising one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: receive a request for an advertisement for presentation in a slot associated with a resource, wherein the request includes one or more selection criteria, and wherein at least one selection criterion indicates a preference for display advertisements; identify candidate advertisements from an inventory using the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference, wherein the inventory includes both display advertisements and other types of advertisements including text advertisements; conduct an auction including the identified candidates, wherein conducting includes determining a winning bid; and determine a type of advertisement associated with the winning bid including: when the winning bid is associated with a display advertisement, provide the display advertisement responsive to the request; and when the winning bid is associated with a text advertisement, adjust or add rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement so as to enable display of an image-like version of the text advertisement, and provide the text advertisement with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The rendering parameters can include a background shading. The background shading can be configured to darken on hover. The rendering parameters can include a selection of typeface, and adjusting can include selecting a typeface that is different than a typeface originally associated with the text advertisement. The rendering parameters can include spacing, and adjusting can include expanding spacing between elements of the text advertisement including adjusting spacing for one or more of the title, uniform resource locator, or body text.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Image-like versions of text ads can be generated in response to requests for content from resources associated with publishers that have specified “display-only” as a preference. For example, image-like versions of text ads can be automatically generated and provided, e.g., for publishers who prefer not to show text ads because of their visual appearance, or for other reasons. Publishers may receive additional revenue when more content items in inventory are eligible for presentation (hence increasing competition in the selection process). Content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) can opt into using, for their creatives, specially-designed formats that automatically render display-like versions of their text ads without additional efforts by the advertiser.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Systems, methods, and computer program products are described for providing an image-like version of a text only content item (e.g., advertisement). For example, a request for an advertisement (or “ad”) for presentation in a slot associated with a resource can be received, such as to fill the slot on a resource associated with a publisher. The publisher may have a preference for display-type ads to be used on the resource, such preference being known to the serving system or being included in the received request. For example, the request can include one or more selection criteria, including, for example, at least one selection criterion that indicates a preference for display ads. Candidate ads that satisfy the request can be identified from an inventory of eligible content items. Identification of the candidate ads can use the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference (for display ads). The identification can be made from the inventory that includes both display ads and other types of ads, including text ads. A selection process can be used (e.g., an auction can be conducted) that includes the identified candidates, and one or more winners of the selection process can be identified. A type of content item associated with the one or more winners can be determined. When a winner is associated with a display ad, for example, the display ad can be provided (e.g., as-is) responsive to the request. When the winner is associated with a text ad, for example, rendering parameters associated with the text ad can be adjusted or added so as to enable display of an image-like version of the text ad. The text ad can be provided with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request. Example adjusted rendering parameters include a background shading parameter (e.g., including configuring the background shading to darken on hover), a typeface parameter (e.g., using a typeface that is different than a typeface originally associated with the text ad), an expansion parameter (e.g., for expanding spacing between elements of the text ad), a control parameter (e.g., for adding an arrow, a chevron, or favicon, and/or including a call-to-action control), a positioning parameter (e.g., to adjust positioning of elements of the textual ad to fill the slot), and/or a spacing parameter (e.g., to tighten spacing of characters or words in the ad).

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers),publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, content sponsors 108 andpublishers 109. - The
environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by thecontent management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using thenetwork 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. Further, some data stores described herein may include identifiers that can be used to match or access corresponding data records or other information that are stored elsewhere, e.g. locally and/or remotely. - An inventory of
content items 132, for example, can include content items (e.g., advertisements) that can be selected from in response to a received request for content (e.g., an ad request). The inventory ofcontent items 132 can include, for example, an inventory of content items (e.g., creatives) provided bycontent sponsors 108 for presentation to users. - A data store of
candidate advertisements 134, for example, can include eligible content items that have been identified as being responsive to a particular request for content. For example, thecandidate advertisements 134 associated with a given request for content can include content items that match keywords for the request and/or other signals (e.g., user information, location, slot size and other parameters). - A
content identification engine 121, for example, can identify candidate content items from the inventory ofcontent items 132 that are responsive to a received request for content. For example, thecontent identification engine 121 can identifycandidate advertisements 134 from inventory, the identification performed, at least in part, by matching keywords or other information in the request for content. - A
bidding engine 123, for example, can conduct a selection process (e.g., an auction), including using bids associated with content items (e.g., advertisements), to determine a winning bid associated with a winning content item. For example, a winning bid in an auction can be determined based on one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, the likelihood of user interaction with the content item, and/or other factors. - A
formatting engine 125, for example, can determine a type of a content item (e.g., an advertisement) associated with the winning bid (e.g., display, text, etc.). Theformatting engine 125 can also adjust and/or add rendering parameters to text-type content items. For example, theformatting engine 125 can create an image-like version of a text ad. The image-like version can be provided in response to an ad request (e.g., resulting in selection of the text ad) to enable display of the image-like version in lieu of the normal text ad presentation. Adding and adjusting are discussed in greater detail below - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 can, for example, access the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 can be data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In addition, when no search is performed or no keywords are available (e.g., because the user is not browsing a webpage), other information, such as information obtained from one or more snapshots, can be used to respond to the received request. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive offers fromcontent sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.

FIG. 2 shows anexample system 200 for providing an image-like version of a text ad. For example, in response to anad request 202, thecontent management system 110 can identify a winningcontent item 210, e.g., that is associated with a winning bid among other bids associated withother candidate advertisements 134. If the winningcontent item 210 is adisplay type ad 212 a, for example, then thedisplay type ad 212 a can be provided (e.g., as is) in response to thead request 202. Otherwise, if the winningcontent item 210 is atext type ad 212 b, then an image-like version 212 c can be created from thetext type ad 212 b, and the image-like version 212 c can be provided in response to thead request 202. In some implementations, the image-like version 212 c can be generated, for example, by adjusting or adding rendering parameters associated with the text ad, so as to enable display of the image-like version 212 c, which can be provided with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request. - At
stage 1, for example, thecontent management system 110 can receive a request for content (e.g., the ad request 202). Thead request 202, for example, can be received from auser device 106 a for presentation of an ad in a slot 204 (e.g., an ad slot) associated with theresource 206. Thead request 202 can include one or more selection criteria (e.g., slot size, keywords, etc.), including at least one selection criterion that indicates a preference for display advertisements. For example, theresource 206 can be a web page for which the associated publisher has designated that display ads are to appear in the slot 204 (or generally, any slots on the publisher's page). - At
stage 2, for example, thecontent identification engine 121 can identify candidate content items (e.g., candidate advertisements 134) from the inventory ofcontent items 132 using the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference (for display advertisements). For example, the candidate content items can be identified, at least in part, by matching keywords or other information in thead request 202, as described above with reference toFIG. 1 . The inventory of content items 132 (and resulting identified candidate advertisements 134) can include both display ads and other types of ads, including text ads for which associated content sponsors have designated that generation of image-like ads is allowed. - At
stage 3, for example, thebidding engine 123 can initiate a selection process. In some implementations, thebidding engine 123 can conduct an auction, including using bids associated with the identifiedcandidate advertisements 134, to determine a winningbid 208 associated with a winningcontent item 210. The auction can be conducted, for example, without regard to the preference (for display advertisements) that may exist relative to thead request 202. For example, the winning content item 210 (having the winning bid 208) can be a text type advertisement. In this regard, one or more otherwise ineligible content items that are in inventory (i.e., ineligible because they are not of the correct format (e.g., text rather than display type)) can still be processed as part of the selection process and still be declared winners of a given selection process. - At
stage 4, for example, theformatting engine 125 can determine a type of the content item (e.g., advertisement) associated with the winning bid 208 (e.g., associated with the winning content item 210). For example, depending on whether the winningcontent item 210 is adisplay type ad 212 a or atext type ad 212 b, theformatting engine 125 can perform additional processing. - At
stage 5 a, for example, when the winningbid 208 is associated with a display advertisement, thecontent management system 110 can directly provide thedisplay type ad 212 a responsive to the request, e.g., including providing thedisplay type ad 212 a as-is, without making any changes in formatting. - At
stage 5 b, for example, when the winningbid 208 is associated with atext type ad 212 b or other type advertisement, then theformatting engine 125 can adjust or add rendering parameters prior to providing the content item. For example theformatting engine 125 can adjust or add rendering parameters associated with thetext type ad 212 b. For example, the image-like version 212 c can be created, such as to enable display of an image-like version of thetext type ad 212 b, and the image-like version 212 c can be provided with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for providing an image-like version of the text content item in response to a received request for content. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can perform steps of theprocess 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 300. In some implementations, theprocess 300 can be used to generate and provide image-like versions of other types of content items, i.e. in addition to advertisements for which examples are provided in this document. - A request is received for an advertisement for presentation in a slot associated with a resource (302). The request includes or is associated with one or more selection criteria, wherein at least one selection criterion indicates a preference for display advertisements. As an example, the
content management system 110 can receive thead request 202 from theuser device 106 a, requesting an ad to fill theslot 204. Thead request 202 can include one or more selection criteria (e.g., slot size, keywords, etc.) including at least one selection criterion that indicates a preference for display advertisements. Theresource 206, for example, can be a web page for which the associated publisher has designated that display ads are to appear in theslot 204. - Candidate advertisements are identified from an inventory using the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference, wherein the inventory includes both display advertisements and other types of advertisements including text advertisements (304). For example, the
content identification engine 121 can identifycandidate advertisements 134 from the inventory ofcontent items 132 using the one or more selection criteria without regard for the preference (for display advertisements). Accordingly, the content identification engine can identify, ascandidate advertisements 134, ads that are of multiple different types, including at least some ads that are display ads and at least some of which are text ads. Thecandidate advertisements 134 can be identified, at least in part, by matching keywords or other information in thead request 202. Thecandidate advertisements 134 that are identified can include display ads (and other non-text ads), and can also include text ads, e.g., for which associated content sponsors have designated that generation of image-like ads is allowed. - An auction is conducted, including the identified candidates, wherein conducting includes determining a winning bid (306). The
bidding engine 123, for example, can conduct an auction, including using bids associated with the identifiedcandidate advertisements 134, to determine a winningbid 208 associated with a winningcontent item 210. For example, the auction can be conducted without regard to the preference (for display advertisements) that may exist relative to thead request 202. As a result of the auction, for example, the winningcontent item 210 may be a text type advertisement. - A type of advertisement associated with the winning bid is determined (308). For example, the
formatting engine 125 can determine a type of the winningcontent item 210, e.g., either thedisplay type ad 212 a or thetext type ad 212 b. - When the winning bid is associated with a display advertisement, a display advertisement is provided responsive to the request (310). As an example, when the winning
bid 208 is associated with thedisplay type ad 212 a, thecontent management system 110 can provide adisplay type ad 212 a responsive to the request as-is, i.e., without making any changes in formatting. - When the winning bid is associated with a text advertisement, rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement are adjusted or added so as to enable display of an image-like version of the text advertisement and the text advertisement is provided with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request (312). For example, when the winning
bid 208 is associated with thetext type ad 212 b, then theformatting engine 125 can adjust or add rendering parameters associated with thetext type ad 212 b. The image-like version 212 c can be created, for example, such as to enable display of an image-like version of thetext type ad 212 b. Thetext type ad 212 b can be provided in response to thead request 202, for example, with the adjusted rendering parameters for display responsive to the received request. - In some implementations, the rendering parameters that are adjusted can relate to a background shading. For example, if the original text ad includes text with a plain background, the rendering parameters that are updated or added can include parameters that provide a color background for the text. Different forms of the background can occur, for example, including a single color, gradients of a single color, multi-color patterns, hash patterns, or other background shading.
- In some implementations, the background shading of the rendering parameters is configured to darken on hover in order to make the winning content item more “display like”. As an example, the image-
like version 212 c of an ad can initially be displayed in one way, such as using a particular color shade (e.g., light blue). Subsequently, if the user employs controls (e.g., touch, mouse, keyboard keys, trackball, stylus or other input) to cause the cursor to be located on ad, the shade of the ad can darken (e.g., to a medium blue). One or more other colors or other visual features can also change. In some implementations, one or more sounds can be used at a time of hovering, e.g., in addition to (or instead of) changes to color and/or other visual aspects. - In some implementations, the rendering parameters that are adjusted or added can include a selection of typeface, wherein adjusting includes selecting a typeface that is different than a typeface originally associated with the text advertisement. For example, for a text ad selected from the
content items 132 that has Font A, theformatting engine 125 can change the font to something different, such as a different presentation of Font A, a presentation that uses Font B or another font, or some other text style or typeface change, e.g., bolding, italics, underlining, or other style change(s). - In some implementations, the rendering parameters can include spacing, wherein adjusting includes expanding spacing between elements of the text advertisement including adjusting spacing for one or more of the title, uniform resource locator, or body text. For example, to create the image-
like version 212 c from thetext type ad 212 b, theformatting engine 125 can make changes to spacing between words and/or phrases, such as to present the text in a unique way and/or to grab the attention of the user viewing the ad. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include adding an item (e.g., a control) to the text advertisement, e.g., a control, an arrow, a chevron, or favicon. For example, theformatting engine 125 can add, to the image-like version 212 c, a control with which the user can interact. In some implementations, the control can be or include a call-to-action control. For example, the arrow, chevron, favicon or other control that is added to the ad can be associated with an additional user action or interaction point, such as indicated by descriptive text that indicates an action that is to be performed or completed by the user. For example, a control, if selected by the user, can provide more information (e.g., phone number, address, URL, etc.) associated with the ad. - In some implementations, rendering parameters can include a positioning parameter, and adjusting the rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement can include adjusting positioning of elements of the textual advertisement to fill the slot. For example, the
formatting engine 125 can include rendering parameters that will cause the text to be presented in a certain way, e.g., with a particular justification. In another example, the rendering parameters can cause the text to be adjusted in one or more particular ways, e.g., to increase the size of the font to fill the ad slot. - In some implementations, the rendering parameters can include a background color, and adjusting the rendering parameters associated with the text advertisement can include setting the background color to a new single color. For example, the
formatting engine 125 can include rendering parameters that cause the background of image-like ads to be a particular color, e.g., blue, or some other color that is device-dependent in order to provide an offsetting background color for an ad. - In some implementations, the rendering parameters can include a spacing parameter, and wherein adjusting includes tightening spacing, as compared to an original spacing, in a title of the text advertisement. As an example, the
formatting engine 125 can include rendering parameters that cause special spacing to occur in titles, e.g., to increase or decrease letter spacing in title, or to change margins, in order to provide a visually interesting title. - In some implementations, instead of (or in addition to) real-time creation of image-like ads from text ads, the generation of image ads from text ads can occur ahead of time (e.g., prior to received requests for ads to fill ad slots), and the images ads can be stored as available inventory. In some implementations, image ads that are generated in real-time, as described above, can be stored for re-use in response to subsequent requests for the same ads.
- In some implementations, different formats of image-
like versions 212 c can be used (e.g., selected at random), and machine learning or other techniques can be used over time to determine which formats and/or presentations of image-like versions 212 c are most successful. For example, user interactions, including click-throughs and conversions, can be tracked (e.g., anonymously), and formats that have the best performance can be retained, and low-performance formats/presentations can be used less or can be discontinued. - In some implementations, content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) can be presented with interfaces (or have included in existing content sponsor interfaces) one or more interfaces for agreeing to allow the content sponsors content item (e.g., advertisement) to be converted from a text for mat to the more image-like format. For example, when the content sponsor is configuring a campaign, an option can be presented (e.g., for a creative) to provide content sponsor agreement to produce image-like content items from text content items. In some implementations, content sponsors can be provided with controls to select specific formats of the image-like content items that will be produced. For example, content sponsors can select the formats of the content items and specify the appearance of functionality of call-to-action controls, if any, that are to be presented. Other content sponsor interfaces are possible.
