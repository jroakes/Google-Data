- This description relates to determining the visual appeal of items of online content and more particularly, to a network-based method and system for automatically determining the visual appeal of online content items.
- Online content items can be displayed on webpages.
- the content items generally include graphic content mixed with textual content that are selected and arranged to create interesting and informative content items that convey the content item provider's message and hopefully succeeds in getting a viewer to respond to the message.
- the content items are designed by human designers who apply their creative talents, experience, and rules of thumb to create the content item. If content items were able to be created automatically, a designer's knowledge would be needed to verify the quality of the content item.
- Most users of content item serving systems are not designers and lack an ability to determine the effectiveness or quality of online content items on their own. Hiring a design agency to check quality and effectiveness may be prohibitively expensive for many users. Using known techniques that aid users in checking the design of the content item are based on static templates that do not take into account the various elements of design that may be known by human designers.

- Each algorithm includes one or more rules capable of recognizing graphic content parameters, recognizing textual content parameters, and relating the graphic content parameters and the textual content parameters to a set of desired parameters accessible to the rules.
- a system for algorithmically determining the visual appeal of a content item includes a processor and a computer-readable memory device having encoded thereon computer readable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to store a plurality of software implemented algorithms in the memory device, receive one or more generated online content, determine graphic content parameters and textual content parameters of the received online content, compare the determined parameters to the set of desired parameters, rank the online content based on the comparisons, and output the ranked online content.
- Each algorithm includes one or more rules capable of recognizing graphic content parameters, recognizing textual content parameters, and combining graphic content parameters and textual content parameters wherein the parameters relate to the appearance of the graphic content and the textual content.
- one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon, wherein when executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to store a plurality of software implemented algorithms in the memory device, receive one or more generated online content, determine graphic content parameters and textual content parameters of the received online content, compare the determined parameters to the set of desired parameters, rank the online content based on the comparisons, and output the ranked online content, where each algorithm includes one or more rules capable of recognizing graphic content parameters, recognizing textual content parameters, and combining graphic content parameters and textual content parameters, the parameters relating to the appearance of the graphic content and the textual content.
- a system for algorithmically determining the visual appeal of content items includes means for storing a plurality of software implemented algorithms in a memory device. Each algorithm includes one or more rules capable of recognizing graphic content parameters in a content item, recognizing textual content parameters in the content item, and combining graphic content parameters and textual content parameters. The parameters relate to the appearance of the graphic content and the textual content.
