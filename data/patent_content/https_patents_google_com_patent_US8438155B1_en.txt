Definitions
- This description relates to providing computer search results.
- Conventional search engines operate by indexing, and/or otherwise categorizing or characterizing, large numbers of documents (or other content files) which may potentially be included within search results provided to users in response to search requests from the users.
- a conventional search engine may have access to an index of documents or other content files, where the index may include a very large number of such content files.
- the search engine may receive one or more search requests from a user, and may parse or otherwise analyze the search request, for a subsequent comparison of the parsed and/or analyzed search request to content files within the index.
- conventional search engines serve to provide a user with a relatively small set of search results which are identified within the larger index, based on the search request of the user.
- conventional search engines may be configured to provide the search results in a manner which assists the user in identifying desired information therein.
- conventional search engines may rank the search results, and/or may provide quick review information for one or more of the content files of the search results, where such quick review information is designed to assist the user in quickly and easily identifying desired information within the search results.
- quick review information may be designed to assist the user in evaluating individual search results, and may include, e.g., one or more of snippets, summaries, selected and/or representative portions, partial or complete snapshots, or other representations of some or all of the content files of the search results.
- an index utilized by a conventional search engine may contain and/or reference a very large number of documents or other content files, so that it may be difficult or time-consuming to pre-generate quick review information for all such content files.
- a computer system may include instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by at least one processor.
- the computer system may include a coverage evaluator configured to cause the at least one processor to determine search results that are a subset of potential search results, the search results provided in response to search requests, wherein a covered portion of the potential search results are associated with quick review information and a non-covered portion of the potential search results are not associated with quick review information.
- the coverage evaluator may include an impressions mapper configured to determine a plurality of impressions of the search results provided to a plurality of users in response to the search requests, and further configured to perform a mapping of the plurality of impressions to the search results to obtain mapped impressions, an impressions based sampler configured to sample the search results based on the mapped impressions, to thereby obtain sampled search results, a weight calculator configured to weight the mapped impressions for each sampled search result, based on a number thereof, to thereby obtain weighted impressions for each of the sampled search results, and a coverage calculator configured to calculate a coverage of the search results, based on a relation of covered, weighted impressions of the covered portion to the weighted impressions, wherein the weighted impressions include non-covered, weighted impressions of the non-covered portion, if any.
- an impressions mapper configured to determine a plurality of impressions of the search results provided to a plurality of users in response to the search requests, and further configured
- a computer-implemented method may include executing instructions stored on a computer-readable medium.
- the method may include determining search results that are a subset of potential search results, the search results provided in response to search requests, wherein a covered portion of the potential search results are associated with quick review information and a non-covered portion of the potential search results are not associated with the quick review information.
- the method may include determining a plurality of impressions of the search results provided to a plurality of users in response to the search requests, performing a mapping of the plurality of impressions to the search results to obtain mapped impressions, and sampling the search results based on the mapped impressions, to thereby obtain sampled search results.
- the method may include weighting the mapped impressions for each sampled search result, based on a number thereof, to thereby obtain weighted impressions for each of the sampled search results and calculating a coverage of the search results, based on a relation of covered, weighted impressions of the covered portion to the weighted impressions, wherein the weighted impressions include non-covered, weighted impressions of the non-covered portion, if any.
- a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer-readable medium and may include executable code that, when executed, may be configured to cause a data processing apparatus to determine search results that are a subset of potential search results, the search results provided in response to search requests, wherein a covered portion of the potential search results are associated with quick review information and a non-covered portion of the potential search results are not associated with the quick review information.
- the instructions when executed, may be further configured to cause the data processing apparatus to determine a plurality of impressions of the search results provided to a plurality of users in response to the search requests, perform a mapping of the plurality of impressions to the search results to obtain mapped impressions, sample the search results based on the mapped impressions, to thereby obtain sampled search results, weight the mapped impressions for each sampled search result, based on a number thereof, to thereby obtain weighted impressions for each of the sampled search results, and calculate a coverage of the search results, based on a relation of covered, weighted impressions of the covered portion to the weighted impressions, wherein the weighted impressions include non-covered, weighted impressions of the non-covered portion, if any.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system 100 for providing impressions-weighted coverage monitoring for search systems.
- a search engine 102 receives search requests 104 from, and provides search results 106 to, a plurality of users 108 .
- a coverage evaluator 110 is illustrated which may be configured to evaluate a success of the search engine 102 in selecting documents, webpages, or other content files from among a larger pool of such content files for association with corresponding quick review information. By judging the success of the search engine 102 in this regard, the coverage evaluator 110 may improve an efficiency of the search engine 102 , and may increase an enjoyment and productivity of the users 108 with respect to the search results 106 .
- the search engine 102 may represent any one of a number of conventional search engines.
- the search engine 102 may include many conventional features and functions which are not necessarily described here in detail, except as may be necessary or helpful in understanding operations of the system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the search engine 102 may include an indexer 112 which may be configured to construct an index 114 of webpages, documents, audio and/or video files, or various other types of content files, for use thereof in providing the search results 106 in response to the search requests 104 .
- the indexer 112 may include, or may communicate with, a crawler (not specifically illustrated in the example of FIG. 1 ) which is configured to collect, identify, or otherwise determine webpages, documents, or other content files for potential inclusion within the index 114 .
- the indexer 112 may thereby obtain the various content files, and may parse the content of the content files so as to, e.g., identify specific words, phrases, images, or other discrete contents within the identified content files.
- the discrete, extracted content may be included in the index 114 , and thereafter matched against content of the search request 108 in order to correspond specific search requests with potentially relevant ones of the indexed content files.
- the search results 106 may be provided to the users 108 , and may be likely to include particular content which satisfies the corresponding search requests 104 .
- the search results 106 also may include many content files which do not adequately satisfy the corresponding search request to a satisfaction of the relevant user, or, in some cases, may not include any content which satisfies the search requests 106 of the user. Consequently, as referenced above and is as well known, the search results 106 may be provided in conjunction with, or represented by, corresponding quick review information, which may allow the users 108 to quickly and easily discern whether a particular search result is likely (or not likely) to provide the user's desired information.
- a search request of the search requests 104 yields 100 documents that are ultimately included within the search results 106 .
- a search engine 102 may initially provide the top 10 (or some other subset) of the 100 documents within the search results (e.g., may provide links to the top 10 search results within a single screenshot or view), where the top 10 results may be assumed for the sake of the example to include the desired document.
- each of the top 10 documents may be represented to the user using corresponding quick review information for each of the 10 documents.
- the user may easily tell from the quick review information associated with each of the 10 documents which of the 10 documents is the desired document, and may thereby select a corresponding link and obtain the desired document.
- the search engine 102 may include a coverage generator 116 which may be configured to generate quick review information for any selected document or other content file from the index 114 .
- a coverage generator 116 may be configured to generate quick review information for any selected document or other content file from the index 114 .
- quick review information may be provided by the coverage generator 116 .
- the coverage generator 116 may generate quick review information for a selected document from the index 114 by extracting portions of the document which are thought to be representative of the document as a whole.
- Various algorithms are known which may be implemented by the coverage generator 116 to perform such extractions, or otherwise to represent content of the selected document in a manner which provides for quick review thereof by the user in conjunction with, or as part of, the search results 106 .
- the coverage generator 116 may generate a visual snapshot of a representative portion (e.g., a first page) of a document or other content file within the index 114 . Such a visual snapshot may be particularly useful in enabling the user to determine whether the underlying document is a desired document, and therefore enables the user 108 to obtain desired information in a fast and convenient manner.
- the search engine 102 provides the top 10 search results by transmitting a snippet of each document of the top 10 search results, so that 10 snippets are displayed within a browser or other graphical user interface of the user in conjunction with 10 corresponding links to the underlying documents.
- each of the top 10 search results has been provided with quick review information in the form of a visual snapshot by the coverage generator 116 , it may occur that the user may hover a cursor over (or otherwise select or designate) a selected one of the 10 snippets (and/or associated one of the 10 links), and may immediately be provided with a visual snapshot of the underlying document within the browser or other GUI, without any additional navigation being required on the part of the user.
- visual snapshots may be useful in enabling the user to ascertain whether a particular document referenced in the top 10 search results represents a desired document.
- techniques for generating such visual snapshots or other quick review information are currently known and/or may be developed in the future, and are not necessarily described herein in further detail, except as necessary or helpful in understanding an operation of the coverage evaluator 110 or other elements of the system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the search engine 102 may operate in a largely conventional manner, e.g., including indexing a large number of documents or other content files within the index 114 , using the indexer 112 .
- the coverage generator 116 may select a subset or portion of the indexed content files, and may generate quick review information (e.g., visual snapshots) for the selected content files, where the quick review information may be stored within, or in association with, the index 114 and/or the corresponding content files.
- the search request 104 may be received at the search engine 102 by a request handler 118 .
- a result provider 120 may analyze the received search request, and may select search results using the index 114 to provide to the users 108 with the search results 106 , and, where available, with associated quick review information.
- the search engine 102 may generally utilize and deploy an available, finite amount of resources.
- the search engine 102 may take a certain amount of time to obtain, index, and provide coverage (e.g., generate quick review information) for some or all of the content files of the index 114 .
- the search engine 102 also uses an available, finite amount of computer memory, processing resources, and various other physical and/or human resources in performing the various features and functions described herein.
- designers and operators of the system 100 including the search engine 102 , may seek to obtain a balance in deploying available resources, so as to optimize the providing of the search results 106 in a manner which is fast and accurate, and which minimizes any wasteful or inefficient use of the available resources.
- the index 114 includes or references a large number of webpages which have been indexed for searching by the indexer 112 .
- the index 114 may contain or reference virtually any type of searchable, indexable content files.
- the users 108 may interact with the search engine 102 (e.g., submit search requests 104 ) using a web browser or other suitable graphical user interface which is configured to communicate with the search engine 102 over a computer network (e.g., the public internet, or a private intranet).
- search engine 102 may be executed in various other contexts, and that the system 100 as a whole may provide the features and functions described herein in a manner appropriate to a particular context. For example, it may occur that the users 108 interact directly with the search engine 102 on a single computing device, rather than over a network, or that the system 100 is implemented as part of a private network, e.g., a corporate network provided by an enterprise for its employees and/or customers.
- a private network e.g., a corporate network provided by an enterprise for its employees and/or customers.
- the coverage generator 116 may be configured to implement one or more algorithms for selecting a subset or portion of the indexed webpages of the index 114 , and thereafter generating quick review information for each such webpage within the selected subset and/or portion.
- the coverage generator 116 may be configured to implement one or more such algorithms in a manner which optimizes a likelihood that webpages included within the search results 106 are associated with quick review information when provided to the users 108 . That is, as described, the coverage generator 116 may be configured to provide such optimization relative to an amount of available resources assigned to the coverage generator 116 .
- the index 114 may be understood to contain or reference a very large number of indexed webpages.
- webpages thus represent potential search results in that it is possible that at some future time the request handler 118 may receive a search request 104 such that the result provider 120 identifies a specific webpage within the potential search results of the index 114 for inclusion within the actual search results 106 .
- the coverage generator 116 may be configured to provide coverage for (e.g., generate and store quick review information for) the portions of the potential search results of the index 114 which are most likely, most frequently, or most often to be included within the search results 106 that are actually provided to the user 108 .
- the potential search results associated with the index 114 may include a covered portion or subset thereof which the coverage generator 116 has associated with corresponding quick review information for each included webpage, as well as a non-covered portion or subset which is not associated with coverage by the coverage generator 116 with corresponding quick review information.
- the covered portion of the potential search results thus represents a subset thereof which is considered to be likely to be frequently provided within the search results 106
- the non-covered portion of the potential search results of the index 114 are generally thought to correspond to the majority of the potential search results which are unlikely to be, or infrequently are, included within the search results 106 .
- the coverage evaluator 110 may thus be understood to be configured to evaluate or otherwise judge an efficacy of the coverage generator 116 in selecting webpages and generating associated coverage (e.g., quick review information) for an optimal or otherwise appropriate subset of the potential search results of the index 114 .
- the coverage evaluator 110 may determine that the coverage generator 116 has provided an unnecessarily large covered portion within the potential search results of the index 114 (e.g., has generated quick review information for webpages of the index 114 which are rarely or never included, or likely to be included, within the search results 106 ).
- the coverage evaluator 110 may determine that the coverage generator 116 has provided an inadequately-sized covered portion within the potential search results of the index 114 (e.g., has failed to generate quick review information for webpages which have, in fact, been included frequently or in large number within the search results 106 ).
- the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to determine in the former case that the coverage generator 110 has used available resources inefficiently by generating unnecessary coverage of webpages within a potential search results of the index 114 , or, in the latter case, that the coverage generator 116 is likely to have caused an inconvenience to the users 108 by failing to provide coverage (e.g., quick review information) for an unacceptable number of webpages that are actually included in the search results 106 .
- the coverage evaluator 110 may perform a straightforward storing of webpages included within the actual search results 106 , and to simply compute a percentage of the search results 106 which are provided with quick review information.
- such techniques may not always be sufficient, optimal, and/or preferable.
- the techniques described herein with respect to the system 100 of FIG. 1 provide an independent evaluation of provided coverage, as compared to the additional or alternative technique(s) just referenced. Further, the described techniques may be used when no quick review information is currently being provided by the result provider 120 (e.g., related feature(s) are currently turned off), and/or without requiring any changes to the result provider 120 or other components of the search engine 102 , relative to conventional implementations thereof.
- the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to evaluate the efficacy of the coverage generator 116 in generating coverage for the selected portion of the potential search results of the index 114 by utilizing an activity log 122 which is configured to log the activities of the request handler 118 and the result provider 120 in evaluating the search request 104 against the potential search results within the index 114 , to thereby correspond and select webpages therefrom which are thought to satisfy the search request 104 .
- the activity log 122 may be configured to store a number of times that a particular webpage was requested and selected for providing thereof, in addition to storing an identity of each such webpage.
- an occurrence of such a search request and subsequent selection of a webpage for providing to the users 108 may be referred to as an impression of the thus-selected webpage.
- an impression simply refers to an instance in which a webpage is selected during providing a response to a search request, regardless of an identity of the requesting user.
- a webpage that is thus-requested 10 times by a single user, or once each by 10 users, or twice each by 5 users, would represent 10 impressions of the webpage in question in any such scenario.
- the coverage evaluator 110 evaluates an efficacy of the coverage generator 116 simply by determining a total number of impressions for covered webpages associated with quick review information relative to a total number of impressions for all the webpages of the index 114 .
- the index 114 may be associated with a very large number of individual webpages, so that it may be impossible or impractical to evaluate coverage in the manner just described.
- the coverage evaluator 110 may selectively sample webpages from the index 114 , in order to obtain a smaller set of webpages to evaluate, based on the assumption that the results determined for the sample will be reflective of coverage provided for the index 114 as a whole. For example, the coverage evaluator 110 may select every 1000 th or 10,000 th web page from the index 114 , or may use other known sampling techniques used to extract a sampled subset from the index 114 .
- the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to determine a total number of impressions for covered webpages included in the sample, relative to a total number of impressions for all the webpages in the sample subset (i.e., including impressions for non-covered webpages).
- Such techniques may, however, be insufficient to adequately and consistently represent a level of success of the coverage generator 116 in designating the covered portion of the index 114 .
- such techniques may suffer from a high degree of variance, and may therefore make it difficult for an operator of the system 100 to accurately judge whether or what modifications may be needed, if any, with respect to operations of the coverage generator 116 .
- the coverage generator 116 is determined to be highly accurate and complete with regard to determining a covered portion of the index 114 .
- the coverage evaluator 110 may determine that an unacceptable number of impressions designated for providing to the users 108 are uncovered and not associated with quick review information.
- Such variances in coverage evaluations may result from the use of the above referenced sampling techniques. Specifically, for example, it may commonly occur that a first webpage from the index 114 may be selected for providing to the users 108 only a single time, while a second webpage from the index 114 may be selected for providing to the user 108 many hundreds or thousands of times or more. In other words, particular webpages may have a high degree of variation in terms of a number of impressions associated with each, simply stemming from the fact that some webpages are more popular or otherwise more frequently viewed than others.
- the coverage evaluator 110 may judge that the coverage generator 116 has done a relatively poorer job of providing coverage for the search results 106 .
- the use of sampling techniques in evaluating operations of the coverage generator 116 with respect to the index 114 may be advantageous in terms of reducing a computational load of the coverage evaluator 110 .
- advantages may be offset in whole or in part by variances in the evaluation results which are related, e.g., to the inherently skewed nature of the impressions distribution of webpages of the index 114 .
- the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to take into account the highly skewed nature of the impressions distribution of webpages of the index 114 , e.g., by providing impressions-weighted coverage evaluations, as described in detail herein.
- the activity log 122 may be configured to store all received search requests 104 , including relative information such as included search terms, time and date of receipt, and other relevant information, and to thereafter log webpages selected for providing to the users 108 in response to the search request 104 .
- the activity log 122 may thus store a record of each individual impression of a given webpage.
- an impressions mapper 124 of the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to perform a mapping of the impressions of the given webpage to the webpage itself, and to store such mapping data within a mapping repository 125 .
- a record of 100 impressions is stored by the activity log 122 , so that the impressions mapper 124 may identify or otherwise determine each webpage (e.g., 5 different webpages) represented in the set of impressions, and to thereafter map a number of impressions for each webpage to the corresponding webpage (e.g., to map, in a simplified example, 20 impressions of the 100 impressions to each of the 5 webpages).
- a sampler 126 of the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to perform impressions-based sampling of search results (e.g., webpages selected for providing to the users 108 within the search results 106 ) based on a number of impressions of each search result. Specific techniques for such impressions-based sampling are described in detail below with respect to FIGS. 2-4 . However, it may be generally understood that the sampler 126 may be configured to be more likely to include a high impression webpage within a sample subset of search results than to include a webpage having few or no impressions within the search results.
- the sampler 126 may thus be configured to individually input webpages from the index 114 , and to sample (e.g., to keep or discard) the webpages based on an assigned probability factor along with a number of impressions, if any, of the currently considered webpage of the index 114 , based on the mapping 125 of the impressions mapper 124 which relates impressions from the activity log 122 to corresponding webpages of the index 114 .
- a weight calculator 128 may thereafter be configured to assign a weight to the impressions of each webpage of the sample search results received from the sampler 126 .
- the weight calculator 128 may be configured to assign relatively higher weights to high impression webpages within the sample search results. In this way, the weight calculator 128 may enable the coverage evaluator 110 to accurately reflect the fact that coverage or non-coverage of high impression websites to generally be considered more important in evaluating operations of the coverage generator 116 than coverage or non-coverage of low impression webpages.
- a coverage calculator 130 may receive outputs of the weight calculator 128 and the sampler 126 , and may calculate a measure or other evaluation of the operation of the coverage generator 116 based thereon. For example, similarly to the coverage metric referenced above, the coverage calculator 130 may simply determine a total number of weighted impressions of the sample search results which are provided with coverage, relative to a total number of weighted impressions of all the sampled search results (independently of coverage or non-coverage thereof).
- the system 100 is illustrated as executing using at least one computing device 132 , which is further illustrated as including at least one processor 132 A and a computer readable storage medium 132 B.
- instructions for executing the system 100 may be stored using the computer readable storage medium 132 B, and executed by the at least one processor 132 A to enable and perform the various features and functions of the system 100 described herein.
- system 100 may be implemented using a computing device having multiple processors and/or multiple memories, or other computer readable storage media.
- instances of the computer readable storage medium 132 B may be used for storage of data associated with the index 114 , the activity log 122 , the mapping data of the mapping repository 125 , or other data necessary or useful for implementation of the system 100 .
- the system 100 may be executed using multiple computing devices which are in communication with one another, e.g., over a network.
- some or all of the search engine 102 may be implemented using multiple computing devices, while the coverage evaluator 110 executes on one of such computing devices, or on a separate computing device in communication therewith.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a number of separate and discrete components implementing the functionalities described herein, it may be appreciated that, in other implementations of the system 100 , multiple ones of such functions may be combined for execution by a single component, or, conversely, a single component of FIG. 1 may be separated for separate execution by two or more components. Many other implementation variations are possible, and would be apparent to one of skill in the art, and therefore are not described here in detail.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating simplified implementation examples of portions of the system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- mapped impressions 125 are represented as including illustrated webpages numbered consecutively between 201 and 210 in the example of FIG. 2 .
- each of the pages 201 - 210 have been mapped to a corresponding number of impressions associated therewith as determined by the impressions mapper 124 .
- an indication of coverage or lack of coverage of each individual webpage is also indicated.
- the webpage 201 of the index 114 is illustrated as being mapped to 0 impressions, and not having associated coverage of quick review information.
- the webpage 202 is illustrated as having 0 impressions and no coverage.
- the webpage 203 is illustrated as having 10 impressions and as being covered.
- the webpage 204 is illustrated as having 2 impressions with no coverage, while the webpage 205 is illustrated as having 100 impressions, as well as associated coverage.
- the webpages 206 and 207 have no impressions and no coverage, while the webpage 208 has 10 impressions and has coverage.
- the webpage 209 has 5 impressions and no coverage, and, finally, the webpage 210 has 1000 impressions and has coverage.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a highly simplified example in which the index 114 includes the 10 documents 201 - 210 , and in which the coverage generator 116 has executed its one or more coverage algorithms in order to determine that coverage should be provided for webpages 203 , 205 , 208 , and 210 , but that no coverage should be provided for webpages 201 , 202 , 204 , 206 , 207 , and 209 .
- the coverage generator 116 may be configured to execute such coverage algorithms with the goal of providing coverage for as many impressions included in the search results 106 as possible, given whatever resource constraints may be faced by the coverage generator 116 with respect to executing such operations.
- the coverage evaluator 110 may be configured to judge the operations of the coverage generator 116 in achieving this goal.
- the impression-based sampler 126 may be configured to sample the webpages of the index 114 based on the mapped impressions, so that, generally speaking, high impression webpages are more likely to be included in the sample than low impression webpages.
- sampled search results 212 may be obtained.
- the sample search results 212 may include the webpages 203 , 205 , 208 , 209 , and 210 .
- the sampled search results 212 are thus illustrative of the fact that high impression webpages are generally more likely to be included therein than low impression webpages.
- the weight calculator 128 may thereafter assign a weight to each of the number of impressions of the webpages 203 , 205 , 208 , 209 , and 210 , in order to reflect the fact that coverage or non-coverage of high impression webpages may be considered more important than coverage or non-coverage of low impression webpages.
- the coverage calculator 130 may consider all of the total number of weighted impressions of the covered webpages 203 , 205 , 208 , and 210 , relative to the total number of impressions of all webpages in the search results (i.e., 203 , 205 , 208 , 209 , and 210 ). In this way, as described, a coverage of the impressions selected for providing to the users 108 may be quickly and accurately evaluated, with a low degree of variance between different iterations of the evaluations.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart 300 illustrating example operations of the system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- example operations 302 - 312 are illustrated as separate, sequential operations. However, it may be appreciated that such illustrations are merely for the sake of example, and that additional or alternative implementations are possible.
- two or more of the operations 302 - 312 may be executed in a wholly or partially overlapping or parallel manner, or in a nested or looped manner.
- additional operations may be included and/or may replace one or more of the illustrated operations, while one or more of the operations may be modified or removed.
- search results that are a subset of potential search results may be determined, where the search results are provided in response to search requests, and wherein a covered portion of potential search results are associated with quick review information and a non-covered portion of the potential search results are not associated with the quick review information ( 302 ).
- the index 114 may include potential search results in the form of webpages, documents, or other content files, and may potentially be selected for providing a response to a search request 104 .
- potential search results may each be associated with quick review information generated by the coverage generator 116 and designed to assist users 108 and quickly reviewing search results 106 provided to the users 108 .
- the covered portion of potential search results may represent a minority of the potential search results, and may reflect the fact that a majority of the potential search results may rarely or never be provided within the search results 106 , so that generation of quick review information therefore would be inefficient or wasteful.
- a plurality of impressions of the search results provided to a plurality of users in response to search requests may be determined ( 304 ).
- the activity log 122 may store a record of the impressions associated with webpages or other content files selected from the index 114 by the result provider 120 in response to the search request 104 .
- the search results selected for providing a response to search requests may be determined using the activity log 122 , based on historical data of searches conducted over the previous day, week, or other selected time frame.
- a mapping of the plurality of impressions to the search results may be performed to obtain mapped impressions ( 306 ).
- the impressions mapper 124 may map impressions from the activity log 122 to individual webpages selected for inclusion in the search results.
- webpages 201 - 210 illustrate a result of such impressions mapping with respect thereto.
- the search results may be sampled based on the mapped impressions, to thereby obtain sampled search results.
- the impressions based sampler 126 may sample the search results from the activity log 122 , based on a sampling probability and on a number of corresponding mapped impressions associated therewith.
- the impressions based sampler 126 may sample the search results 201 - 210 in a manner which increases a likelihood that a particular webpage will be included in the sample search results 212 when the particular webpage has been mapped to a relatively large number of impressions.
- the mapped impressions for each sampled search result may be weighted based on a number thereof, to thereby obtain weighted impressions for each of the sample search results ( 310 ).
- the weight calculator 328 may associate a weight with a number of impressions of each of the sampled search results 203 , 205 , 208 , 209 and 210 of FIG. 2 .
- a coverage of the search results may thus be calculated, based on a relation of covered weighted impressions to the weighted impressions, where the weighted impressions include non-covered, weighted impressions of the non-covered portion, if any ( 312 ).
- the coverage calculator 130 may count all the weighted impressions of the sampled search results 203 , 205 , 208 , 210 , and relate these to all of the weighted impressions of the sampled search results 212 as a whole (e.g., including both the just-mentioned covered, weighted impressions for the webpages 203 , 205 , 208 , 210 , as well as the non-covered sample webpage 209 ).
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart 400 illustrating more detailed example implementations of the system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- activity logs may be aggregated over a selected period of time to obtain aggregated search results and corresponding impressions ( 402 ).
- an initial sampling may be implemented to reduce a size of the resulting aggregated search results and impressions ( 404 ).
- the sampler 126 or another sampler may be used to perform a conventional sampling in which every 1000 th or 10,000 th or other selected probability factor webpage may be included.
- Such initial sampling may be performed very conservatively, e.g., may utilize a sampling probability factor which produces a sampled subset of the aggregated search result impressions which is relatively large compared to the aggregated search result impressions as a whole, i.e., which does not reduce the aggregated search results and impressions sufficiently to introduce the types of difficulties referenced above, e.g., increased variances and coverage evaluations.
- the impressions mapper 124 may thereafter perform the mapping of the impressions to the search results within the activity logs ( 406 ). Thereafter, sampling may proceed with selection of a search result from the mapped search results and impressions ( 408 ). In one example sampling technique, a pseudo-random number may be calculated ( 410 ), while a sampling inclusion probability is also calculated based on a sample factor P and a number of impressions mapped to the selected search result ( 412 ).
- the impressions based sampler 126 may calculate such a sampling inclusion probability using Equation 1, as illustrated below. 1 ⁇ (1 ⁇ P ) N Equation (1)
- the selected search result may be discarded ( 416 ), i.e., may be non-included in the sample search results (if, however, the inclusion probability is lower than the pseudo-random number ( 414 ), then the selected search result may be added to the sampled search results set ( 418 ). If sampling is not finished ( 420 ), then a subsequent search result may be selected ( 408 ), and operations 410 - 418 may proceed as described above.
- a weighting for impressions of each sample search result in the sample search result set may be calculated ( 422 ), e.g., using the weight calculator 128 .
- the weight calculator 128 may assign a weight to each number of impressions associated with a given sampled search result using Equation (2) below.
- Equation 2 may be understood to represent a conditional expected number of impressions of the sampled search result in question which is included in the sample, given that at least one impression was included, and assuming, as described, that each individual impression may be selected or not with the probability P according to Equation 1 above.
- the weighted number of impressions for each search result may be individually selected, and if the search result in question is covered (e.g., is associated with quick review information), then the weighted number of impressions may be added to a numerator of coverage calculation Equation (3) provided below ( 426 ).
- coverage (weighted impressions of covered search results/weighted impressions of non-covered search results) Equation (3)
- the corresponding weighted number of impressions are ultimately added to the denominator of the coverage calculation of Equation (3) ( 428 ).
- coverage may be calculated based thereon by the coverage calculator 130 ( 430 ).
- the calculated coverage may be compared against a desired or threshold level of coverage which was previously designated by an operator of the system 100 , e.g., in conjunction with a design and operation of the coverage generator 116 . In this way, the operator may be enabled to judge whether the coverage generator 116 is operating in a desired manner to provide desired coverage results.
