- FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a flight search engine
- FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a process for determining an origin airport of a user
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a computer system by which the above-mentioned systems and processes may be implemented.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a system 10 for providing users with information about airline flights.
- the system 10 includes a flight search engine 12 that, in some embodiments, is capable of inferring an origin airport from which the user is likely to depart so that relevant information can be provided to a user who has not yet specified an origin airport.
- the origin airport is determined by obtaining a geographic location of the user, determining which airports are within a threshold distance (e.g. 30 km) of the location, and selecting from among these airports the airport having the largest number of scheduled flights for some duration (e.g., six months) in the future.
- a threshold distance e.g. 30 km
- some embodiments infer what is likely to be the origin airport of the user by identifying an airport that is both near the user and is relatively large. Based on this determination, some embodiments provide the user with one or more flights (e.g., information describing those flights) from the inferred origin airport without imposing on the user the burden of specifying the airport from which they wish to depart.
- a user in Mountain View Calif. may submit a query for “flights to New York,” which indicates an intent to obtain information about flights, but does not indicate from where the user wishes to fly in the text of the query.
- some embodiments of the flight search engine 12 determine the user's location (e.g. a latitude and longitude of the user) based on, for example, an Internet Protocol address of the user (or with other techniques described below). These embodiments may further determine that both the San Jose International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport are within 30 km of the user's location and that, between these two airports, San Francisco International Airport has more flights scheduled over the next six months.
- the flight search engine 12 may infer that the user is interested in flights from San Francisco International Airport to New York and, in response, provide the user with descriptions of one or more flights satisfying these criteria, thereby providing the user with information that is likely more relevant than would be produced by a search based on the query text alone.
- the flight search engine 12 cooperates with other components of the system 10 to provide information about flights to users.
- the system 10 includes user devices 14 , a search engine 16 , a geographic information system 18 , and an advertisement server 20 .
- These components 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , and 20 may communicate with one another via the Internet 22 and various other networks, such as cellular networks and local area networks.
- the user devices 14 may be desktop computers, laptops, handheld battery-powered mobile personal computing devices, such as smartphones or tablet computers, through which users interact with the search engine 16 or the flight search engine 12 . User interaction may occur via a browser or special-purpose application executing on the user devices 14 .
- the search engine 16 may be a general-purpose search engine that is responsive to queries other than those about airline flights.
- the search engine 16 may be operative to determine which queries express an intent of the user to obtain information about airline flights, for example by detecting the presence of keywords, phrases, or patterns in query text, like “flight,” “fly,” “flights,” “plane to,” or the names of various airports (e.g., airport codes).
- the search engine 16 may submit the query to the flight search engine 12 .
- the search engine 16 may be operative to determine whether a query relates to an airport near the user and, in response, request that the flight search engine 12 identify a likely origin airport for the user.
- Some embodiments include a geographic information system 18 that is operative to geocode search terms, such as airport names, by retrieving a geographic location associated with (e.g., uniquely matched to) the search term, such as a latitude and longitude of an airport.
- the geographic information system 18 may also be operative determine a likely travel (e.g., driving, biking, or rail) route between the user and the airport, the distance along this route, and travel time along this route.
- the advertisement server 20 may be operative to receive requests for advertisements related to queries and select a responsive advertisement for display on user devices 14 , for example advertisements related to travel to a destination airport, or offers to buy airline tickets for flights from the inferred origin airport.
- the selected advertisements are communicated to the user devices 14 for display to the user.
- the flight search engine 12 includes a query categorizer 24 , an origin selector 26 , a flight finder 28 , a flight ranker 30 , and a flights data store 32 .
- These components 24 , 26 , 28 , 30 , and 32 are illustrated as discrete functional blocks, but it should be appreciated that code or hardware by which these components are implemented may be distributed, conjoined, intermingled, or otherwise differently organized than is illustrated by FIG. 1 .
- the flight search engine 12 and the components thereof are embodied by a data processing apparatus, such as one or more processors in communication with memory storing instructions that when executed by the processors cause the processors to perform operations providing the functionality described herein.
- the flight search engine 12 in operation, may perform a process described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- Some embodiments include the illustrated query categorizer 24 , which is operative to determine whether a query identifies an origin airport.
- the flight search engine 12 may return flights from the identified origin airport rather than inferring an origin airport based on the user's location.
- the query categorizer 24 may determine that an origin airport is identified based on, for example, the presence of strings corresponding to multiple airports preceded by the term “from” and including the term “to,” such as “flights from AUS to Portland” for Austin Bergstrom International Airport and Portland. If an origin airport is detected in the query text, in response, the query analyzer 24 may bypass the origin selector 26 and request that the flight finder 28 identify flights responsive to the query. Alternatively, if an origin airport is not detected, in response, the query categorizer 24 may request that the origin selector 26 infer an origin airport.
- the origin selector 26 is operative to obtain the geographic location of the user and select an origin airport. The selection may be based on both a distance from the geographic location of the user to a geographic location of the airport and a flight-volume value indicative of an amount of flights departing from the airport. Examples of selections are described in detail below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the origin selector 26 is also operative to receive a user location from the search engine 16 and respond with a likely origin airport of that user based on the same selection process.
- the flight finder 28 is operative to receive an inferred origin airport from the origin selector 26 and identify flights from the origin airport responsive to the received query. For example, a query from a user geocoded to a location in Mountain View Calif. may state “flights to New York,” and the origin selector 26 may identify to the flight finder 28 that the likely origin airport is San Francisco International Airport. In response, the flight finder 28 may query the flights data store 32 for flights from San Francisco International Airport to airports near New York City (e.g., the closest airport or airports within a threshold distance to New York City, such as within 30 km).
- the identified flights may be of varying interest to the user, for example, because some of the flights include multiple legs, layovers, higher costs, or are during times at which it is less likely that the user will wish to fly, such as in the relatively near (e.g. within two days) or relatively distant (e.g. more than three months) future. Accordingly, the flight ranker 30 may rank the identified flights by calculating a flight ranking score based on these parameters. Further, some embodiments may filter from the results flights that have sold out to avoid burdening the user with information upon which it would be difficult for the user to act.
- Flights ranking higher than a threshold rank may be presented to the user by, for example, transmitting to the user device 14 from which the query was received a description of the flight and instructions to display the description in a browser of the user device.
- the flight search engine 12 may also transmit with the description a link to a service by which the corresponding flights can be purchased by the user or advertisements selected by the advertisement server 20 based on the query or flights.
- the flights data store 32 of this embodiment includes a plurality of flight records, each record corresponding to one flight and specifying an origin airport, a destination airport, an airline, a price, a number of seats available at the price, a departure time, an arrival time, a flight duration, and a number of intermediate stops at intermediate airports.
- the flights data store 32 also includes a plurality of records about airports, each record corresponding to one airport and including one or more names of the airport (e.g., various names by which the airport is known to users, including three-letter airport codes) and a geographic location of the airport, for example expressed as a latitude and longitude of the airport or as a tile identifier corresponding to a record in the geographic information system 18 .
- the airport records may be stored in the geographic information system 18 .
- the components of the flight search engine 12 may cooperate to infer an origin airport of a user based on the user's location and identify flights from the origin airport to the user without imposing upon the user the burden of identifying the origin airport for the flight search engine 12 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a process 34 for providing information about flights.
- the process 34 may be performed by the flight search engine 12 described with reference to FIG. 1 , and in some embodiments, the process 34 is performed by one or more computer systems storing in memory program code that, when executed, causes the computer systems to perform process 34 .
- the steps of process 34 may be performed in a different order from the order in which they are illustrated.
- the process 34 includes receiving a user request to obtain information about flights, as illustrated by block 36 .
- Receiving a user request may include receiving any of a variety of different indications that a user has performed an act expressing an interest in obtaining information about flights. For example, a user may navigate their browser to a URL of a flight search engine that is dedicated to providing information about flights, such as “www.google.com/flights.” Or the user may launch a smartphone application that is operative to obtain information about flights and is dedicated to obtaining such information, e.g., a flight search app.
- a user may submit a query including search terms that indicate an intent to obtain information about flights, such as a query including the strings “flights,” “fly,” or “airplanes to.”
- the request may be received by the search engine 16 or flight search engine 12 of FIG. 1 from one of the user devices 14 .
- the process 34 includes obtaining a geographic location of the user, as indicated by block 38 .
- Obtaining a location of the user may include determining that the user has opted to have their location detected and determining the geographic location of only those users who have so elected.
- the geographic location of the user may be expressed in a variety of formats, for example as a point identified with a latitude and a longitude, as an area having a center from which distance can be calculated, or as a relative geographic location, such as a direction and a distance from some landmark.
- the user's location may be identified with various amounts of specificity, depending on the embodiment and desire for precision, e.g., to a point, to within less than a 1 km radius, or to within less than a 10 km radius.
- the geographic location may be obtained with a variety of techniques.
- the user request may be received via a protocol (like TCP/IP, HTTP, or SPDY) that identifies the Internet Protocol address of the user (e.g., a network node through which the user's request enters the Internet), and the Internet Protocol address may be geocoded to a location of the user.
- the user may have an account (e.g., an email account or social network account) in a user data store accessible to the flight search engine 12 , and the user account may be identified based on credentials provided by the user.
- the user account may include a location specified by the user, e.g., a residential address.
- the location of the user may be determined based on the current wireless environment of the user device 14 of the user, for instance based on global positioning system signals (such as from the GPS, GLONASS or Galileo satellite systems), cell tower triangulation, or the presence of wireless area networks having a known location and for which the administrator has opted in to storing the location.
- global positioning system signals such as from the GPS, GLONASS or Galileo satellite systems
- cell tower triangulation such as from the GPS, GLONASS or Galileo satellite systems
- the presence of wireless area networks having a known location and for which the administrator has opted in to storing the location.
- the process 34 further includes selecting an origin airport based on both the distance from the geographic location of the user to a geographic location of the airport and a flight-volume value indicative of an amount of flights departing from the airport, as illustrated by block 40 .
- This step 40 is performed by the origin selector 26 described above. Some embodiments also perform the selection based on other parameters by, e.g., removing from consideration airports that are not accessible via public transportation.
- selecting an origin airport includes determining that a plurality of airports are within a threshold distance. This determination may be performed by querying the flights data store 32 or the geographic information system 18 for airports and their corresponding locations and filtering out from further consideration those airports that are further than the threshold distance, such as further than a distance between 20 km and 80 km, 5 km and 150 km, or 1 km and 250 km, e.g. a 30 km threshold distance. Distance may be calculated with a variety of techniques. For example, a distance may be calculated by subtracting the latitudes of the airport and the user and the longitudes of the airport and the user and calculating the square root of the sum of squares of these differentials to calculate distance as a crow flies.
- distance may be calculated based on estimated travel time between the user location and the airport location by querying the geographic information system 18 for a route and a travel time between the two locations. Such a query may specify a mode of transport, such as driving or travel on public transportation.
- the selection based on distance may be made by determining that the travel time along such a route is less than a threshold travel time.
- a threshold travel time may be less than those airports within the threshold distance of the user.
- selecting an origin airport further includes determining which of a plurality of candidate airports (e.g., the airports within the threshold distance) has the largest flight-volume value among the candidate airports.
- the flight-volume value may be any of a variety of different values that indicate the relative amount of flights departing from each of the candidate airports.
- the flight-volume value may be obtained by querying the flights data store 32 from the origin selector 26 of FIG. 1 for an amount (e.g., a number or frequency) of flights departing from the candidate airports within some duration in the future, for instance a duration more than one month and less than one year, such as over the next six months.
- the flight-volume value may be based on other data indicative of the number of flights departing from an airport, such as a number of hits for an airport's name in a search engine index, survey responses from flyer surveys indicating the popularity of airports, or the amount of area occupied the by the airport as indicated by the geographic information system 18 of FIG. 1 . Larger airports, carrying a higher volume of passengers, are expected to be more likely to be an origin airport for the user relative to smaller airports used less frequently.
- the flight-volume value is based on (e.g., equal to, proportional to, or a function of) the number of flights from the respective candidate airport that satisfy certain criteria. For instance, when the user query specifies a destination, the flight-volume value may be based on the number of flights to that destination. Or (i.e., and/or) in some cases, the contribution of the flights is weighted (or flights are filtered) according to additional criteria, e.g., flights to the destination may be down-weighted for each additional leg of the flight, such that a non-stop flight is weighted more heavily than multi-leg flights. Or some embodiments may calculate a flight-volume value by selecting only non-stop flights and disregarding flights with multiple legs.
- the process 34 includes obtaining a flight (i.e., information about the flight) departing from the selected airport, as indicated by block 42 .
- Obtaining a flight departing from the selected airport may be performed by the flight finder 28 of FIG. 1 querying the flights data store 32 for flights from the selected origin airport to a destination airport within a window of time.
- the destination airport may be indicated by a query from the user, or the destination airport may be inferred as well, for example based on the frequency of flights to destinations from the origin airport, with the top two or three destinations being used to query the flights data store 32 .
- the window of time specified in the query to the flights data store 32 may either be specified in a query from the user or may be a default value, for example flights between one month in the future and two months in the future.
- a plurality of flights may be obtained, and each flight may be associated with (e.g., with a one-to-one correlation) an airline name, a flight departure time, a flight cost, a flight duration, a number of available seats, and an indicator of whether the flight is a non-stop flight or includes a plurality of flight segments landing at intermediate airports.
- Other examples of flight information that may be obtained for one or more responsive flights includes information on flight schedules, aggregate or summarized information on flights, and information on all flights satisfying the criteria. Further, in some embodiments, the obtained flights may be ranked, and flights ranking lower than a threshold rank number may be omitted from subsequent steps.
- the process 34 includes presenting the obtained flights to the user, as indicated by block 44 .
- Presenting the obtained flights may include transmitting to the user device 14 a description of the obtained flights and instructions to display the description.
- the presented flights may be displayed in a browser executing on the client devices 14 of FIG. 1 .
- the process 34 may include additional steps by which additional flight criteria are obtained before obtaining flights or presenting the obtained flights.
- the origin airport may be used to initialize an airline search interface displayed on the client devices 14 .
- the airline search interface may be a web page with user input fields for providing an origin airport, a destination airport, and travel dates.
- the origin airport in this interface may be initialized to the origin airport selected with step 40 , and the user may change this value and input additional values into the interface, which are then used by the flight search engine 12 to identify responsive flights to be presented to the user.
- Initializing the origin airport to a likely value is expected to relieve users of the burden of further specifying their query in instances in which the value is correct. Similarly, inferring an origin airport when none is provided in a user query allows users to express a query with less data entry than would otherwise be required while still receiving relevant results.
