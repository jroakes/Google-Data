Definitions
- Paper documents have an enduring appeal, as can be seen by the proliferation of paper documents in the computer age. It has never been easier to print and publish paper documents than it is today. Paper documents prevail even though electronic documents are easier to duplicate, transmit, search and edit.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to associate scanned information with electronic content.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system to access restricted content from multiple sources.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a content index.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a process of applying scanned information to identify associated content and compile document access statistics.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a process of locating content associated with a rendered document using an offset representation of scanned information.
- FIG. 9 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a process of locating content associated with a rendered document using text resulting from application of optical character recognition to scanned information.
- a system for searching for images using both text-based and image-based search techniques searches an index that facilitates text queries and image matching.
- the system may query the index using text within an image (i.e. some or all of the contents of an image).
- the system may capture a portion of an image using a portable capture device (such as a mobile phone with a camera or other devices described herein), extract any text from the captured image, and perform a search for the image by searching for images that include the extracted text as well as images that have similar features to those within the captured image.
- the captured images are advertisements, which include graphical elements (such as pictures of people, objects, logos, products for purchase and so on) and text (such as company names, slogans, text phrases, phone numbers, and so on.
- the system may perform an image search and use the text to further disambiguate and identify matches for the captured image.
- the system may apply additional constraints to the image search in order to further disambiguate any retrieved results. For example, the system may identify a document or context in which a user has captured an image, and may constrain a searched corpus of images accordingly. Further details regarding the use of contextual and other information as search constraints are described herein.
- information is captured from a rendered document, electronic content or data related to the scanned information is located, and various actions relating to the rendered document and associated electronic content are initiated.
- These accounts can include internet-hosted repositories of user data related to captures (“Life Libraries”), search and retrieval services for capture activity, purchasing and other financial transaction support (for example, support for having users' purchases billed to their account statement, or alternatively to their credit cards), etc.
- a cellular telephone operator acts as a service provider for some of the described services, with billing activity integrated with, or associated with, the user's cellular telephone bill.
- the search engine may compile information about interest in the paper document. For example, the number of queries originating in a particular issue of a magazine can be counted.
- the system uses a sample of text captured from a paper document, for example using a handheld scanner, to identify and locate an electronic counterpart of the document.
- the amount of text needed by the facility is very small in that a few words of text from a document can often function as an identifier for the paper document and as a link to its electronic counterpart.
- the system may use those few words to identify not only the document, but also a location within the document.
- the system implements these and many other examples of “paper/digital integration” without requiring changes to the current processes of writing, printing and publishing documents, giving such conventional rendered documents a whole new layer of digital functionality.
- Scanning or capturing is the process of systematic examination to obtain information from a rendered document.
- the process may involve optical capture using a scanner or camera (for example a camera in a cellphone), or it may involve reading aloud from the document into an audio capture device or typing it on a keypad or keyboard.
- a scanner or camera for example a camera in a cellphone
- This section describes some of the devices, processes and systems that constitute a system for paper/digital integration.
- the system builds a wide variety of services and applications on this underlying core that provides the basic functionality.
- Text from a rendered document is captured 100 , typically in optical form by an optical scanner or audio form by a voice recorder, and this image or sound data is then processed 102 , for example to remove artifacts of the capture process or to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
- a recognition process 104 such as OCR, speech recognition, or autocorrelation then converts the data into a signature, comprised in some embodiments of text, text offsets, or other symbols.
- the system performs an alternate form of extracting document signature from the rendered document.
- the signature represents a set of possible text transcriptions in some embodiments. This process may be influenced by feedback from other stages, for example, if the search process and context analysis 110 have identified some candidate documents from which the capture may originate, thus narrowing the possible interpretations of the original capture.
- next stage will be to construct a query 108 or a set of queries for use in searching.
- Some aspects of the query construction may depend on the search process used and so cannot be performed until the next stage, but there will typically be some operations, such as the removal of obviously misrecognized or irrelevant characters, which can be performed in advance.
- the query or queries are then passed to the search and context analysis stage 110 .
- the system optionally attempts to identify the document from which the original data was captured.
- the system typically uses search indices and search engines 112 , knowledge about the user 114 and knowledge about the user's context or the context in which the capture occurred 116 .
- Search engine 112 may employ and/or index information specifically about rendered documents, about their digital counterpart documents, and about documents that have a web (internet) presence). It may write to, as well as read from, many of these sources and, as has been mentioned, it may feed information into other stages of the process, for example by giving the recognition system 104 information about the language, font, rendering and likely next words based on its knowledge of the candidate documents.
- FIG. 2 is a component diagram of components included in a typical implementation of the system in the context of a typical operating environment.
- the operating environment includes one or more optical scanning capture devices 202 or voice capture devices 204 .
- Each capture device is able to communicate with other parts of the system such as a computer 212 and a mobile station 216 (e.g., a mobile phone or PDA) using either a direct wired or wireless connection, or through the network 220 , with which it can communicate using a wired or wireless connection, the latter typically involving a wireless base station 214 .
- the capture device is integrated in the mobile station, and optionally shares some of the audio and/or optical components used in the device for voice communications and picture-taking.
- Computer 212 may include a memory containing computer executable instructions for processing an order from scanning devices 202 and 204 .
- an order can include an identifier (such as a serial number of the scanning device 202 / 204 or an identifier that partially or uniquely identifies the user of the scanner), scanning context information (e.g., time of scan, location of scan, etc.) and/or scanned information (such as a text string) that is used to uniquely identify the document being scanned.
- scanning context information e.g., time of scan, location of scan, etc.
- scanned information such as a text string
- the operating environment may include more or less components.
- the network 220 may be a corporate intranet, the public Internet, a mobile phone network or some other network, or any interconnection of the above.
- the devices may all be operable in accordance with well-known commercial transaction and communication protocols (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP)).
- IP Internet Protocol
- the functions and capabilities of scanning device 202 , computer 212 , and mobile station 216 may be wholly or partially integrated into one device.
- scanning device, computer, and mobile station can refer to the same device depending upon whether the device incorporates functions or capabilities of the scanning device 202 , computer 212 and mobile station 216 .
- some or all of the functions of the search engines 232 , document sources 234 , user account services 236 , markup services 238 and other network services 239 may be implemented on any of the devices and/or other devices not shown.
- Scanners are well known devices that capture and digitize images.
- portable optical scanners have been introduced in convenient form factors, such as a pen-shaped handheld device.
- the portable scanner is used to scan text, graphics, or symbols from rendered documents.
- the portable scanner has a scanning element that captures text, symbols, graphics, etc, from rendered documents.
- rendered documents include documents that have been displayed on a screen such as a CRT monitor or LCD display.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a scanner 302 .
- the scanner 302 comprises an optical scanning head 308 to scan information from rendered documents and convert it to machine-compatible data, and an optical path 306 , typically a lens, an aperture or an image conduit to convey the image from the rendered document to the scanning head.
- the scanning head 308 may incorporate a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD), a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device, or an optical sensor of another type.
- CCD Charge-Coupled Device
- CMOS Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
- Feedback to the user is possible through a visual display or indicator lights 332 , through a loudspeaker or other audio transducer 334 and through a vibrate module 336 .
- the scanner 302 comprises logic 326 to interact with the various other components, possibly processing the received signals into different formats and/or interpretations.
- Logic 326 may be operable to read and write data and program instructions stored in associated storage 330 such as RAM, ROM, flash, or other suitable memory. It may read a time signal from the clock unit 328 .
- the scanner 302 also includes an interface 316 to communicate scanned information and other signals to a network and/or an associated computing device.
- the scanner 302 may have an on-board power supply 332 .
- the scanner 302 may be powered from a tethered connection to another device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection.
- USB Universal Serial Bus
- a reader may scan some text from a newspaper article with scanner 302 .
- the text is scanned as a bit-mapped image via the scanning head 308 .
- Logic 326 causes the bit-mapped image to be stored in memory 330 with an associated time-stamp read from the clock unit 328 .
- Logic 326 may also perform optical character recognition (OCR) or other post-scan processing on the bit-mapped image to convert it to text.
- Logic 326 may optionally extract a signature from the image, for example by performing a convolution-like process to locate repeating occurrences of characters, symbols or objects, and determine the distance or number of other characters, symbols, or objects between these repeated elements.
- the reader may then upload the bit-mapped image (or text or other signature, if post-scan processing has been performed by logic 326 ) to an associated computer via interface 316 .
- a reader may capture some text from an article as an audio file by using microphone 310 as an acoustic capture port.
- Logic 326 causes audio file to be stored in memory 328 .
- Logic 326 may also perform voice recognition or other post-scan processing on the audio file to convert it to text.
- the reader may then upload the audio file (or text produced by post-scan processing performed by logic 326 ) to an associated computer via interface 316 .
- End-to-end feedback can be applied by performing an approximation of the recognition or interpretation, identifying a set of one or more candidate matching documents, and then using information from the possible matches in the candidate documents to further refine or restrict the recognition or interpretation.
- Candidate documents can be weighted according to their probable relevance (for example, based on then number of other users who have scanned in these documents, or their popularity on the Internet), and these weights can be applied in this iterative recognition process.
- the selective power of a search query based on a few words is greatly enhanced when the relative positions of these words are known, only a small amount of text need be captured for the system to identify the text's location in a corpus.
- the input text will be a contiguous sequence of words, such as a short phrase.
- the system can identify the location in that document and can take action based on this knowledge.
- search query In addition to the captured text, other factors (i.e., information about user identity, profile, and context) may form part of the search query, such as the time of the capture, the identity and geographical location of the user, knowledge of the user's habits and recent activities, etc.
- the document identity and other information related to previous captures, especially if they were quite recent, may form part of a search query.
- the identity of the user may be determined from a unique identifier associated with a capturing device, and/or biometric or other supplemental information (speech patterns, fingerprints, etc.).
- this pre-loaded information can improve the performance of the local device, reduce communication costs, and provide helpful and timely user feedback.
- Section 13.1 discusses the importance of the time of capture in relation to earlier captures. It is important to note that the time of capture will not always be the same as the time that the query is executed.
- multiple queries may be launched in response to a single capture, either in sequence or in parallel.
- queries may be sent in response to a single capture, for example as new words are added to the capture, or to query multiple search engines in parallel.
- the system sends queries to a special index for the current document, to a search engine on a local machine, to a search engine on the corporate network, and to remote search engines on the Internet.
- the results of particular searches may be given higher priority than those from others.
- the response to a given query may indicate that other pending queries are superfluous; these may be cancelled before completion.
- search engines may be enhanced or modified in a number of ways to make them more suitable for use with the described system.
- the search engine and/or other components of the system may create and maintain indices that have different or extra features.
- the system may modify an incoming paper-originated query or change the way the query is handled in the resulting search, thus distinguishing these paper-originated queries from those coming from queries typed into web browsers and other sources.
- the system may take different actions or offer different options when the results are returned by the searches originated from paper as compared to those from other sources.
- the same index can be searched using either paper-originated or traditional queries, but the index may be enhanced for use in the current system in a variety of ways.
- Extra fields can be added to such an index that will help in the case of a paper-based search.
- the first example is a field indicating that the document is known to exist or be distributed in paper form.
- the system may give such documents higher priority if the query comes from paper.
- statistical data concerning the popularity of paper documents (and, optionally, concerning sub-regions within these documents)—for example the amount of scanning activity, circulation numbers provided by the publisher or other sources, etc—is used to give such documents higher priority, to boost the priority of digital counterpart documents (for example, for browser-based queries or web searches), etc.
- semantic information that can be deduced from the source markup but is not apparent in the paper document, such as the fact that a particular piece of text refers to an item offered for sale, or that a certain paragraph contains program code, may also be recorded in the index.
- queries from a capture device can reach the engine by a different channel or port or type of connection than those from other sources, and can be distinguished in that way.
- some embodiments of the system will route queries to the search engine by way of a dedicated gateway.
- the search engine knows that all queries passing through the dedicated gateway were originated from a paper document.
- Section 13 describes a variety of different factors which are external to the captured text itself, yet which can be a significant aid in identifying a document. These include such things as the history of recent scans, the longer-term reading habits of a particular user, the geographic location of a user and the user's recent use of particular electronic documents. Such factors are referred to herein as “context.”
- the search engine may use some of the further information it now maintains to affect the results returned.
- the described system In addition to performing the capture-search-retrieve process, the described system also associates extra functionality with a document, and in particular with specific locations or segments of text within a document. This extra functionality is often, though not exclusively, associated with the rendered document by being associated with its electronic counterpart. As an example, hyperlinks in a web page could have the same functionality when a printout of that web page is scanned. In some cases, the functionality is not defined in the electronic document, but is stored or generated elsewhere.
- markup This layer of added functionality is referred to herein as “markup.”
- the markup may include human-readable content, but is often invisible to a user and/or intended for machine use. Examples include options to be displayed in a popup-menu on a nearby display when a user captures text from a particular area in a rendered document, or audio samples that illustrate the pronunciation of a particular phrase.
- markup may be largely static and specific to the document, similar to the way links on a traditional html web page are often embedded as static data within the html document, but markup may also be dynamically generated and/or applied to a large number of documents.
- dynamic markup is information attached to a document that includes the up-to-date share price of companies mentioned in that document.
- An example of broadly applied markup is translation information that is automatically available on multiple documents or sections of documents in a particular language.
- any word, phrase, etc. may have associated markup.
- the system may add certain items to a pop-up menu (e.g., a link to an online bookstore) whenever the user captures the word “book,” or the title of a book, or a topic related to books.
- digital counterpart documents or indices are consulted to determine whether a capture occurred near the word “book,” or the title of a book, or a topic related to books—and the system behavior is modified in accordance with this proximity to keyword elements.
- markup enables data captured from non-commercial text or documents to trigger a commercial transaction.
- Annotations are another type of electronic information that may be associated with a document.
- a user can attach an audio file of his/her thoughts about a particular document for later retrieval as voice annotations.
- a multimedia annotation a user may attach photographs of places referred to in the document.
- the user generally supplies annotations for the document but the system can associate annotations from other sources (for example, other users in a work group may share annotations).
- markup data may often be supplied by third parties, such as by other readers of the document. Online discussions and reviews are a good example, as are community-managed information relating to particular works, volunteer-contributed translations and explanations.
- Another example of third-party markup is that provided by advertisers.
- markup By analyzing the data captured from documents by several or all users of the system, markup can be generated based on the activities and interests of a community.
- An example might be an online bookstore that creates markup or annotations that tell the user, in effect, “People who enjoyed this book also enjoyed . . . ”
- the markup may be less anonymous, and may tell the user which of the people in his/her contact list have also read this document recently.
- Other examples of datastream analysis are included in Section 14.
- Markup will often be based on external events and data sources, such as input from a corporate database, information from the public Internet, or statistics gathered by the local operating system.
- Data sources may also be more local, and in particular may provide information about the user's context—his/her identity, location and activities.
- the system might communicate with the user's mobile phone and offer a markup layer that gives the user the option to send a document to somebody that the user has recently spoken to on the phone.
- One of the simplest and yet most useful functions that the system can perform is to keep a record for a user of the text that s/he has captured and any further information related to that capture, including the details of any documents found, the location within that document and any actions taken as a result.
- This stored history is beneficial for both the user and the system.
- the user may wish to make the library public, such as by publishing it on the web in a similar manner to a weblog, so that others may see what s/he is reading and finds of interest.
- a record of a user's past captures is also useful for the system. Many aspects of the system operation can be enhanced by knowing the user's reading habits and history. The simplest example is that any scan made by a user is more likely to come from a document that the user has scanned in the recent past, and in particular if the previous scan was within the last few minutes it is very likely to be from the same document. Similarly, it is more likely that a document is being read in start-to-finish order. Thus, for English documents, it is also more likely that later scans will occur farther down in the document. Such factors can help the system establish the location of the capture in cases of ambiguity, and can also reduce the amount of text that needs to be captured.
- this device may be used as a key that identifies the user and authorizes certain actions.
- a user scans a quote from a book and is offered the option to buy the book from an online retailer
- the user can select this option, and is then prompted to scan his/her fingerprint to confirm the transaction.
- An advantage of the described system is that there is no need to alter the traditional processes of creating, printing or publishing documents in order to gain many of the system's benefits. There are reasons, though, that the creators or publishers of a document—hereafter simply referred to as the “publishers”—may wish to create functionality to support the described system.
- the system allows for printed documents to have an associated electronic presence.
- Conventionally publishers often ship a CD-ROM with a book that contains further digital information, tutorial movies and other multimedia data, sample code or documents, or further reference materials.
- some publishers maintain web sites associated with particular publications which provide such materials, as well as information which may be updated after the time of publishing, such as errata, further comments, updated reference materials, bibliographies and further sources of relevant data, and translations into other languages. Online forums allow readers to contribute their comments about the publication.
- the described system allows such materials to be much more closely tied to the rendered document than ever before, and allows the discovery of and interaction with them to be much easier for the user.
- the system can automatically connect the user to digital materials associated with the document, and more particularly associated with that specific part of the document.
- the user can be connected to online communities that discuss that section of the text, or to annotations and commentaries by other readers. In the past, such information would typically need to be found by searching for a particular page number or chapter.
- Some publishers may have mailing lists to which readers can subscribe if they wish to be notified of new relevant matter or when a new edition of the book is published.
- the user can register an interest in particular documents or parts of documents more easily, in some cases even before the publisher has considered providing any such functionality.
- the reader's interest can be fed to the publisher, possibly affecting their decision about when and where to provide updates, further information, new editions or even completely new publications on topics that have proved to be of interest in existing books.
- Such symbols may be intended purely for the reader, or they may be recognized by the system when scanned and used to initiate some action. Sufficient data may be encoded in the symbol to identify more than just the symbol: it may also store information, for example about the document, edition, and location of the symbol, which could be recognized and read by the system.
- the printed document is a gateway to extra materials and functionality, access to such features can also be time-limited. After the expiry date, a user may be required to pay a fee or obtain a newer version of the document to access the features again.
- the paper document will, of course, still be usable, but will lose some of its enhanced electronic functionality. This may be desirable, for example, because there is profit for the publisher in receiving fees for access to electronic materials, or in requiring the user to purchase new editions from time to time, or because there are disadvantages associated with outdated versions of the printed document remaining in circulation. Coupons are an example of a type of commercial document that can have an expiration date.
- Section 10.5 discusses the use of the system's statistics to influence compensation of authors and pricing of advertisements.
- the degree or nature of the access granted to a particular user may be different if it is known that the user already has access to a printed copy of the document.
- a trusted “document escrow” service can retrieve the document on behalf of the user, such as upon payment of a modest fee, with the assurance that the copyright holder will be fully compensated in future if the user should ever request the document from the service.
- the described system could be coupled to a database which records the location of an original document, for example in an archiving warehouse, making it easy for somebody with access to a copy to locate the archived original paper document.
- OCR Optical Character Recognition
- OCR optical character recognition
- the OCR process can be informed by the contents of the document corpus as it progresses, potentially offering substantially greater recognition accuracy.
- Such a connection will also allow the device to inform the user when sufficient text has been captured to identify the digital source.
- the font may be downloaded to the device to help with the recognition.
- While component characters of a text fragment may be the most recognized way to represent a fragment of text that may be used as a document signature, other representations of the text may work sufficiently well that the actual text of a text fragment need not be used when attempting to locate the text fragment in a digital document and/or database, or when disambiguating the representation of a text fragment into a readable form.
- Other representations of text fragments may provide benefits that actual text representations lack. For example, optical character recognition of text fragments is often prone to errors, unlike other representations of captured text fragments that may be used to search for and/or recreate a text fragment without resorting to optical character recognition for the entire fragment. Such methods may be more appropriate for some devices used with the current system.
- Such characterizations of text fragments may include, but are not limited to, word lengths, relative word lengths, character heights, character widths, character shapes, character frequencies, token frequencies, and the like.
- the offsets between matching text tokens i.e., the number of intervening tokens plus one are used to characterize fragments of text.
- Embodiments of the present invention are different; they employ a variety of methods that use the rendered text itself to assist in the recognition process. These embodiments use characters (or tokens) to “recognize each other.”
- One way to refer to such self-recognition is “template matching,” and is similar to “convolution.” To perform such self-recognition, the system slides a copy of the text horizontally over itself and notes matching regions of the text images.
- Prior template matching and convolution techniques encompass a variety of related techniques. These techniques to tokenize and/or recognize characters/tokens will be collectively referred to herein as “autocorrelation,” as the text is used to correlate with its own component parts when matching characters/tokens.
- the offset number is the distance (number of tokens) to the next occurrence of the same token. If the token is unique within the text string, the offset is zero (0).
- the sequence of token offsets thus generated is a signature that can be used to identify the scanned text.
- the token offsets determined for a string of scanned tokens are compared to an index that indexes a corpus of electronic documents based upon the token offsets of their contents (Section 4.1.2). In other embodiments, the token offsets determined for a string of scanned tokens are converted to text, and compared to a more conventional index that indexes a corpus of electronic documents based upon their contents
- a similar token-correlation process may be applied to speech fragments when the capture process consists of audio samples of spoken words.
- the shapes of characters in most commonly used fonts are related. For example, in most fonts, the letter “c” and the letter “e” are visually related—as are “t” and “f,” etc.
- the OCR process is enhanced by use of this relationship to construct templates for letters that have not been scanned yet. For example, where a reader scans a short string of text from a paper document in a previously unencountered font such that the system does not have a set of image templates with which to compare the scanned images the system can leverage the probable relationship between certain characters to construct the font template library even though it has not yet encountered all of the letters in the alphabet. The system can then use the constructed font template library to recognize subsequent scanned text and to further refine the constructed font library.
- images cannot be machine-transcribed into a form suitable for use in a search process, the images themselves can be saved for later use by the user, for possible manual transcription, or for processing at a later date when different resources may be available to the system.
- the user may be offered that document for purchase either in paper or electronic form.
- the user may also be offered related documents, such as those quoted or otherwise referred to in the paper document, or those on a similar subject, or those by the same author.
- the user captures other text from which their potential interest in a commercial transaction may be deduced.
- a reader of a novel set in a particular country might be interested in a holiday there. Someone reading a review of a new car might be considering purchasing it.
- the user may capture a particular fragment of text knowing that some commercial opportunity will be presented to them as a result, or it may be a side-effect of their capture activities.
- the system allows for a new kind of advertising which is not necessarily explicitly in the rendered document, but is nonetheless based on what people are reading.
- advertisements In a traditional paper publication, advertisements generally consume a large amount of space relative to the text of a newspaper article, and a limited number of them can be placed around a particular article.
- advertising can be associated with individual words or phrases, and can selected according to the particular interest the user has shown by capturing that text and possibly taking into account their history of past scans.
- the system may gather a large amount of information about other aspects of a user's context for its own use (Section 13); estimates of the geographical location of the user are a good example. Such data can also be used to tailor the advertising presented to a user of the system.
- the system enables some new models of compensation for advertisers and marketers.
- the publisher of a printed document containing advertisements may receive some income from a purchase that originated from their document. This may be true whether or not the advertisement existed in the original printed form; it may have been added electronically either by the publisher, the advertiser or some third party, and the sources of such advertising may have been subscribed to by the user.
- Analysis of the statistics generated by the system can reveal the popularity of certain parts of a publication (Section 14.2).
- a newspaper for example, it might reveal the amount of time readers spend looking at a particular page or article, or the popularity of a particular columnist.
- An author whose work becomes a frequently read authority on a subject might be considered differently in future contracts from one whose books have sold the same number of copies but are rarely opened. (See also Section 7.6)
- Decisions about advertising in a document may also be based on statistics about the readership.
- the advertising space around the most popular columnists may be sold at a premium rate. Advertisers might even be charged or compensated some time after the document is published based on knowledge about how it was received.
- the “Life Library” or scan history described in Sections 6.1 and 16.1 can be an extremely valuable source of information about the interests and habits of a user. Subject to the appropriate consent and privacy issues, such data can inform offers of goods or services to the user. Even in an anonymous form, the statistics gathered can be exceedingly useful.
- Advertising and other opportunities for commercial transactions may not be presented to the user immediately at the time of text capture. For example, the opportunity to purchase a sequel to a novel may not be available at the time the user is reading the novel, but the system may present them with that opportunity when the sequel is published.
- a user may capture data that relates to a purchase or other commercial transaction, but may choose not to initiate and/or complete the transaction at the time the capture is made.
- data related to captures is stored in a user's Life Library, and these Life Library entries can remain “active” (i.e., capable of subsequent interactions similar to those available at the time the capture was made).
- a user may review a capture at some later time, and optionally complete a transaction based on that capture. Because the system can keep track of when and where the original capture occurred, all parties involved in the transaction can be properly compensated.
- OSs Modern Operating Systems
- other software packages have many characteristics that can be advantageously exploited for use with the described system, and may also be modified in various ways to provide an even better platform for its use.
- New and upcoming file systems and their associated databases often have the ability to store a variety of metadata associated with each file.
- this metadata has included such things as the ID of the user who created the file, the dates of creation, last modification, and last use.
- Newer file systems allow such extra information as keywords, image characteristics, document sources and user comments to be stored, and in some systems this metadata can be arbitrarily extended. File systems can therefore be used to store information that would be useful in implementing the current system. For example, the date when a given document was last printed can be stored by the file system, as can details about which text from it has been captured from paper using the described system, and when and by whom.
- capture devices such as pen scanners
- the same will be true for other aspects of the system's operation.
- the entire described system, or the core of it is provided by the OS.
- support for the system is provided by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be used by other software packages, including those directly implementing aspects of the system.
- APIs Application Programming Interfaces
- OSs include support for speech or handwriting recognition, though it is less common for OSs to include support for OCR, since in the past the use of OCR has typically been limited to a small range of applications.
- recognition components As recognition components become part of the OS, they can take better advantage of other facilities provided by the OS. Many systems include spelling dictionaries, grammar analysis tools, internationalization and localization facilities, for example, all of which can be advantageously employed by the described system for its recognition process, especially since they may have been customized for the particular user to include words and phrases that he/she would commonly encounter.
- the operating system includes full-text indexing facilities, then these can also be used to inform the recognition process, as described in Section 9.3.
- an optical scan or other capture occurs and is presented to the OS, it may have a default action to be taken under those circumstances in the event that no other subsystem claims ownership of the capture.
- An example of a default action is presenting the user with a choice of alternatives, or submitting the captured text to the OS's built-in search facilities.
- the OS may have a standard action that it will take when that particular document, or a document of that class, is scanned.
- Applications and other subsystems may register with the OS as potential handlers of particular types of capture, in a similar manner to the announcement by applications of their ability to handle certain file types.
- Markup data associated with a rendered document, or with a capture from a document can include instructions to the operating system to launch specific applications, pass applications arguments, parameters, or data, etc.
- a typical use of the system may be for the user to scan an area of a paper document, and for the system to open the electronic counterpart in a software package that is able to display or edit it, and cause that package to scroll to and highlight the scanned text (Section 12.2.1).
- the first part of this process, finding and opening the electronic document is typically provided by the OS and is standard across software packages.
- the availability of a standard API for this functionality could greatly enhance the operation of this aspect of the system.
- the system uses the application pop-up menus traditionally associated with clicking the right mouse button on some text. The system inserts extra options into such menus, and causes them to be displayed as a result of activities such as scanning a paper document.
- the OS keeps a simple record of when any document was printed and by whom.
- the OS takes one or more further actions that would make it better suited for use with the system. Examples include:
- An OS often maintains certain categories of folders or files that have particular significance.
- a user's documents may, by convention or design, be found in a “My Documents” folder, for example.
- Standard file-opening dialogs may automatically include a list of recently opened documents.
- Categories may be enhanced or augmented in ways that take into account a user's interaction with paper versions of the stored files. Categories such as “My Printed Documents” or “My Recently-Read Documents” might usefully be identified and incorporated in its operations.
- markup Since important aspects of the system are typically provided using the “markup” concepts discussed in Section 5, it would clearly be advantageous to have support for such markup provided by the OS in a way that was accessible to multiple applications as well as to the OS itself. In addition, layers of markup may be provided by the OS, based on its own knowledge of documents under its control and the facilities it is able to provide.
- Digital Rights Management the ability to control the use of particular data according to the rights granted to a particular user, software entity or machine. It may inhibit unauthorized copying or distribution of a particular document, for example.
- the user interface of the system may be entirely on a PC, if the capture device is relatively dumb and is connected to it by a cable, or entirely on the device, if it is sophisticated and with significant processing power of its own. In some cases, some functionality resides in each component. Part, or indeed all, of the system's functionality may also be implemented on other devices such as mobile phones or PDAs.
- a handheld scanner may have a variety of ways of providing feedback to the user about particular conditions.
- the most obvious types are direct visual, where the scanner incorporates indicator lights or even a full display, and auditory, where the scanner can make beeps, clicks or other sounds.
- Important alternatives include tactile feedback, where the scanner can vibrate, buzz, or otherwise stimulate the user's sense of touch, and projected feedback, where it indicates a status by projecting onto the paper anything from a colored spot of light to a sophisticated display.
- Important immediate feedback that may be provided on the device includes:
- the device may provide a variety of ways for the user to provide input in addition to basic text capture. Even when the device is in close association with a host machine that has input options such as keyboards and mice, it can be disruptive for the user to switch back and forth between manipulating the scanner and using a mouse, for example.
- the handheld scanner may have buttons, scroll/jog-wheels, touch-sensitive surfaces, and/or accelerometers for detecting the movement of the device. Some of these allow a richer set of interactions while still holding the scanner.
- the system presents the user with a set of several possible matching documents.
- the user uses a scroll-wheel on the side of the scanner is to select one from the list, and clicks a button to confirm the selection.
- the user can indicate a large region of text by scanning the first few words in conventional left-to-right order, and the last few in reverse order, i.e. right to left.
- the user can also indicate the vertical extent of the text of interest by moving the scanner down the page over several lines.
- a backwards scan might indicate cancellation of the previous scan operation.
- network connectivity may depend on network connectivity, either between components of the system such as a scanner and a host laptop, or with the outside world in the form of a connection to corporate databases and Internet search. This connectivity may not be present all the time, however, and so there will be occasions when part or all of the system may be considered to be “offline.” It is desirable to allow the system to continue to function usefully in those circumstances.
- the device may be used to capture text when it is out of contact with other parts of the system.
- a very simple device may simply be able to store the image or audio data associated with the capture, ideally with a timestamp indicating when it was captured.
- the various captures may be uploaded to the rest of the system when the device is next in contact with it, and handled then.
- the device may also upload other data associated with the captures, for example voice annotations associated with optical scans, or location information.
- More sophisticated devices may be able to perform some or all of the system operations themselves despite being disconnected. Various techniques for improving their ability to do so are discussed in Section 15.3. Often it will be the case that some, but not all, of the desired actions can be performed while offline. For example, the text may be recognized, but identification of the source may depend on a connection to an Internet-based search engine. In some embodiments, the device therefore stores sufficient information about how far each operation has progressed for the rest of the system to proceed efficiently when connectivity is restored.
- the operation of the system will, in general, benefit from immediately available connectivity, but there are some situations in which performing several captures and then processing them as a batch can have advantages. For example, as discussed in Section 13 below, the identification of the source of a particular capture may be greatly enhanced by examining other captures made by the user at approximately the same time. In a fully connected system where live feedback is being provided to the user, the system is only able to use past captures when processing the current one. If the capture is one of a batch stored by the device when offline, however, the system will be able to take into account any data available from later captures as well as earlier ones when doing its analysis.
- the host device When the host device receives a capture, it may initiate a variety of activities. An incomplete list of possible activities performed by the system after locating and electronic counterpart document associated with the capture and a location within that document follows.
- the scanner device projects a popup menu onto the paper document.
- a user may select from such menus using traditional methods such as a keyboard and mouse, or by using controls on the capture device (Section 12.1.2), gestures (Section 12.1.3), or by interacting with the computer display using the scanner (Section 12.2.4).
- the popup menus which can appear as a result of a capture include default items representing actions which occur if the user does not respond—for example, if the user ignores the menu and makes another capture.
- the system provides a real-time display of the documents or the locations found, for example in list, thumbnail-image or text-segment form, and for the number of elements in that display to reduce in number as capture continues.
- the system displays thumbnails of all candidate documents, where the size or position of the thumbnail is dependent on the probability of it being the correct match.
- this fact may be emphasized to the user, for example using audio feedback.
- the system may indicate this on the screen, for example by grouping documents containing a quoted reference around the original source document.
- Some optical scanners may be able to capture text displayed on a screen as well as on paper. Accordingly, the term rendered document is used herein to indicate that printing onto paper is not the only form of rendering, and that the capture of text or symbols for use by the system may be equally valuable when that text is displayed on an electronic display.
- the optics of the scanner allow it to be used in a similar manner to a light-pen, directly sensing its position on the screen without the need for actual scanning of text, possibly with the aid of special hardware or software on the computer.
- Another example of useful context is the user's geographical location.
- a user in Paris is much more likely to be reading Le Monde than the Seattle Times, for example.
- the timing, size and geographical distribution of printed versions of the documents can therefore be important, and can to some degree be deduced from the operation of the system.
- the time of day may also be relevant, for example in the case of a user who always reads one type of publication on the way to work, and a different one at lunchtime or on the train going home.
- the user's recent use of electronic documents can also be a helpful indicator.
- Section 14 covers the analysis of the data stream resulting from paper-based searches, but it should be noted here that statistics about the popularity of documents with other readers, about the timing of that popularity, and about the parts of documents most frequently scanned are all examples of further factors which can be beneficial in the search process.
- the system brings the possibility of Google-type page-ranking to the world of paper.
- This stream is a record of what users are reading and when, and is in many cases a record of what they find particularly valuable in the things they read. Such data has never really been available before for paper documents.
- Section 10.6 has already mentioned the idea of offering products and services to an individual user based on their interactions with the system.
- Current online booksellers for example, often make recommendations to a user based on their previous interactions with the bookseller. Such recommendations become much more useful when they are based on interactions with the actual books.
- the user will also not just be capturing some text, but will be causing some action to occur as a result. It might be emailing a reference to the document to an acquaintance, for example. Even in the absence of information about the identity of the user or the recipient of the email, the knowledge that somebody considered the document worth emailing is very useful.
- the aggregated statistics of that group can be used to deduce the importance of a particular document to that group.
- the device implements the majority of the system itself. In some embodiments, however, it often communicates with a PC or other computing device and with the wider world using communications facilities.
- these communications facilities are in the form of a general-purpose data network such as Ethernet, 802.11 or UWB or a standard peripheral-connecting network such as USB, IEEE-1394 (Firewire), BluetoothTM or infra-red.
- a wired connection such as Firewire or USB
- the capture device may appear to a connected machine to be a conventional peripheral such as a USB storage device.
- the device may in some circumstances “dock” with another device, either to be used in conjunction with that device or for convenient storage.
- Sections 3.5 and 12.1.4 have raised the topic of disconnected operation.
- the device can still be useful, though the functionality available will sometimes be reduced.
- the device can record the raw image or audio data being captured and this can be processed later.
- it can be important to give feedback where possible about whether the data captured is likely to be sufficient for the task in hand, whether it can be recognized or is likely to be recognizable, and whether the source of the data can be identified or is likely to be identifiable later.
- the user will then know whether their capturing activity is worthwhile. Even when all of the above are unknown, the raw data can still be stored so that, at the very least, the user can refer to them later.
- the user may be presented with the image of a scan, for example, when the scan cannot be recognized by the OCR process.
- the SimpleScanner has a scanning head able to read pixels from the page as it is moved along the length of a line of text. It can detect its movement along the page and record the pixels with some information about the movement. It also has a clock, which allows each scan to be time-stamped. The clock is synchronized with a host device when the SimpleScanner has connectivity. The clock may not represent the actual time of day, but relative times may be determined from it so that the host can deduce the actual time of a scan, or at worst the elapsed time between scans.
- the SimpleScanner does not have sufficient processing power to perform any OCR itself, but it does have some basic knowledge about typical word-lengths, word-spacings, and their relationship to font size. It has some basic indicator lights which tell the user whether the scan is likely to be readable, whether the head is being moved too fast, too slowly or too inaccurately across the paper, and when it determines that sufficient words of a given size are likely to have been scanned for the document to be identified.
- the SimpleScanner has a USB connector and can be plugged into the USB port on a computer, where it will be recharged. To the computer it appears to be a USB storage device on which time-stamped data files have been recorded, and the rest of the system software takes over from this point.
- the SuperScanner also depends on connectivity for its full operation, but it has a significant amount of on-board storage and processing which can help it make better judgments about the data captured while offline.
- the captured pixels are stitched together and passed to an OCR engine that attempts to recognize the text.
- a number of fonts including those from the user's most-read publications, have been downloaded to it to help perform this task, as has a dictionary that is synchronized with the user's spelling-checker dictionary on their PC and so contains many of the words they frequently encounter.
- Also stored on the scanner is a list of words and phrases with the typical frequency of their use—this may be combined with the dictionary. The scanner can use the frequency statistics both to help with the recognition process and also to inform its judgment about when a sufficient quantity of text has been captured; more frequently used phrases are less likely to be useful as the basis for a search query.
- the full index for the articles in the recent issues of the newspapers and periodicals most commonly read by the user are stored on the device, as are the indices for the books the user has recently purchased from an online bookseller, or from which the user has scanned anything within the last few months.
- the titles of several thousand of the most popular publications which have data available for the system are stored so that, in the absence of other information the user can scan the title and have a good idea as to whether or not captures from a particular work are likely to be retrievable in electronic form later.
- the system informs user that the captured data has been of sufficient quality and of a sufficient nature to make it probable that the electronic copy can be retrieved when connectivity is restored. Often the system indicates to the user that the scan is known to have been successful and that the context has been recognized in one of the on-board indices, or that the publication concerned is known to be making its data available to the system, so the later retrieval ought to be successful.
- the SuperScanner docks in a cradle connected to a PC's Firewire or USB port, at which point, in addition to the upload of captured data, its various onboard indices and other databases are updated based on recent user activity and new publications. It also has the facility to connect to wireless public networks or to communicate via Bluetooth to a mobile phone and thence with the public network when such facilities are available.
- Some embodiments of the system use a scanner that scans in contact with the paper, and which, instead of lenses, uses an image conduit a bundle of optical fibers to transmit the image from the page to the optical sensor device.
- a scanner that scans in contact with the paper, and which, instead of lenses, uses an image conduit a bundle of optical fibers to transmit the image from the page to the optical sensor device.
- Such a device can be shaped to allow it to be held in a natural position; for example, in some embodiments, the part in contact with the page is wedge-shaped, allowing the user's hand to move more naturally over the page in a movement similar to the use of a highlighter pen.
- the conduit is either in direct contact with the paper or in close proximity to it, and may have a replaceable transparent tip that can protect the image conduit from possible damage.
- the scanner may be used to scan from a screen as well as from paper, and the material of the tip can be chosen to reduce the likelihood of damage to such displays.
- some embodiments of the device will provide feedback to the user during the scanning process which will indicate through the use of light, sound or tactile feedback when the user is scanning too fast, too slow, too unevenly or is drifting too high or low on the scanned line.
- the capture device may form an important part of identification and authorization for secure transactions, purchases, and a variety of other operations. It may therefore incorporate, in addition to the circuitry and software required for such a role, various hardware features that can make it more secure, such as a smartcard reader, RFID, or a keypad on which to type a PIN.
- the scanning head may also be able to read a fingerprint.
- the voice pattern of the user may be used.
- the device is able to form an association with other nearby devices to increase either its own or their functionality.
- it uses the display of a nearby PC or phone to give more detailed feedback about its operation, or uses their network connectivity.
- the device may, on the other hand, operate in its role as a security and identification device to authenticate operations performed by the other device. Or it may simply form an association in order to function as a peripheral to that device.
- the functionality of the capture device is integrated into some other device that is already in use.
- the integrated devices may be able to share a power supply, data capture and storage capabilities, and network interfaces. Such integration may be done simply for convenience, to reduce cost, or to enable functionality that would not otherwise be available.
- Some examples of devices into which the capture functionality can be integrated include:
- the phone hardware is not modified to support the system, such as where the text capture can be adequately done through voice recognition, where they can either be processed by the phone itself, or handled by a system at the other end of a telephone call, or stored in the phone's memory for future processing.
- voice recognition can either be processed by the phone itself, or handled by a system at the other end of a telephone call, or stored in the phone's memory for future processing.
- Many modern phones have the ability to download software that could implement some parts of the system.
- voice capture is likely to be suboptimal in many situations, however, for example when there is substantial background noise, and accurate voice recognition is a difficult task at the best of times.
- the audio facilities may best be used to capture voice annotations.
- the camera built into many mobile phones is used to capture an image of the text.
- the phone display which would normally act as a viewfinder for the camera, may overlay on the live camera image information about the quality of the image and its suitability for OCR, which segments of text are being captured, and even a transcription of the text if the OCR can be performed on the phone.
- the phone is modified to add dedicated capture facilities, or to provide such functionality in a clip-on adaptor or a separate Bluetooth-connected peripheral in communication with the phone.
- the phone has connectivity with the wider world, which means that queries can be submitted to remote search engines or other parts of the system, and copies of documents may be retrieved for immediate storage or viewing.
- a phone typically has sufficient processing power for many of the functions of the system to be performed locally, and sufficient storage to capture a reasonable amount of data. The amount of storage can also often be expanded by the user. Phones have reasonably good displays and audio facilities to provide user feedback, and often a vibrate function for tactile feedback. They also have good power supplies.
- the Life Library (see also Section 6.1.1) is a digital archive of any important documents that the subscriber wishes to save and is a set of embodiments of services of this system. Important books, magazine articles, newspaper clippings, etc., can all be saved in digital form in the Life Library. Additionally, the subscriber's annotations, comments, and notes can be saved with the documents.
- the Life Library can be accessed via the Internet and World Wide Web.
- the system creates and manages the Life Library document archive for subscribers.
- the subscriber indicates which documents the subscriber wishes to have saved in his life library by scanning information from the document or by otherwise indicating to the system that the particular document is to be added to the subscriber's Life Library.
- the scanned information is typically text from the document but can also be a barcode or other code identifying the document.
- the system accepts the code and uses it to identify the source document. After the document is identified the system can store either a copy of the document in the user's Life Library or a link to a source where the document may be obtained.
- One embodiment of the Life Library system can check whether the subscriber is authorized to obtain the electronic copy. For example, if a reader scans text or an identifier from a copy of an article in the New York Times (NYT) so that the article will be added to the reader's Life Library, the Life Library system will verify with the NYT whether the reader is subscribed to the online version of the NYT; if so, the reader gets a copy of the article stored in his Life Library account; if not, information identifying the document and how to order it is stored in his Life Library account.
- NYT New York Times
- the system maintains a subscriber profile for each subscriber that includes access privilege information.
- Document access information can be compiled in several ways, two of which are: 1) the subscriber supplies the document access information to the Life Library system, along with his account names and passwords, etc., or 2) the Life Library service provider queries the publisher with the subscriber's information and the publisher responds by providing access to an electronic copy if the Life Library subscriber is authorized to access the material. If the Life Library subscriber is not authorized to have an electronic copy of the document, the publisher provides a price to the Life Library service provider, which then provides the customer with the option to purchase the electronic document.
- the Life Library service provider either pays the publisher directly and bills the Life Library customer later or the Life Library service provider immediately bills the customer's credit card for the purchase.
- the Life Library service provider would get a percentage of the purchase price or a small fixed fee for facilitating the transaction.
- the system can archive the document in the subscriber's personal library and/or any other library to which the subscriber has archival privileges. For example, as a user scans text from a printed document, the Life Library system can identify the rendered document and its electronic counterpart. After the source document is identified, the Life Library system might record information about the source document in the user's personal library and in a group library to which the subscriber has archival privileges.
- Group libraries are collaborative archives such as a document repository for: a group working together on a project, a group of academic researchers, a group web log, etc.
- the life library can be organized in many ways: chronologically, by topic, by level of the subscriber's interest, by type of publication (newspaper, book, magazine, technical paper, etc.), where read, when read, by ISBN or by Dewey decimal, etc.
- the system can learn classifications based on how other subscribers have classified the same document. The system can suggest classifications to the user or automatically classify the document for the user.
- annotations may be inserted directly into the document or may be maintained in a separate file.
- the article is archived in his Life Library with the scanned text highlighted.
- the article is archived in his Life Library along with an associated annotation file (thus leaving the archived document unmodified).
- Embodiments of the system can keep a copy of the source document in each subscriber's library, a copy in a master library that many subscribers can access, or link to a copy held by the publisher.
- the Life Library stores only the user's modifications to the document (e.g., highlights, etc.) and a link to an online version of the document (stored elsewhere). The system or the subscriber merges the changes with the document when the subscriber subsequently retrieves the document.
- the source document and the annotation file are provided to the subscriber and the subscriber combines them to create a modified document.
- the system combines the two files prior to presenting them to the subscriber.
- the annotation file is an overlay to the document file and can be overlaid on the document by software in the subscriber's computer.
- Subscribers to the Life Library service pay a monthly fee to have the system maintain the subscriber's archive. Alternatively, the subscriber pays a small amount (e.g., a micro-payment) for each document stored in the archive. Alternatively, the subscriber pays to access the subscriber's archive on a per-access fee. Alternatively, subscribers can compile libraries and allow others to access the materials/annotations on a revenue share model with the Life Library service provider and copyright holders. Alternatively, the Life Library service provider receives a payment from the publisher when the Life Library subscriber orders a document (a revenue share model with the publisher, where the Life Library service provider gets a share of the publisher's revenue).
- a small amount e.g., a micro-payment
- subscribers can compile libraries and allow others to access the materials/annotations on a revenue share model with the Life Library service provider and copyright holders.
- the Life Library service provider receives a payment from the publisher when the Life Library subscriber orders a document (a revenue share model with the publisher, where
- the Life Library service provider acts as an intermediary between the subscriber and the copyright holder (or copyright holder's agent, such as the Copyright Clearance Center, a.k.a. CCC) to facilitate billing and payment for copyrighted materials.
- the Life Library service provider uses the subscriber's billing information and other user account information to provide this intermediation service. Essentially, the Life Library service provider leverages the pre-existing relationship with the subscriber to enable purchase of copyrighted materials on behalf of the subscriber.
- the Life Library system can store excerpts from documents. For example, when a subscriber scans text from a paper document, the regions around the scanned text are excerpted and placed in the Life Library, rather than the entire document being archived in the life library. This is especially advantageous when the document is long because preserving the circumstances of the original scan prevents the subscriber from re-reading the document to find the interesting portions. Of course, a hyperlink to the entire electronic counterpart of the paper document can be included with the excerpt materials.
- the system also stores information about the document in the Life Library, such as author, publication title, publication date, publisher, copyright holder (or copyright holder's licensing agent), ISBN, links to public annotations of the document, readrank, etc.
- information about the document is a form of paper document metadata.
- Third parties may create public annotation files for access by persons other than themselves, such the general public. Linking to a third party's commentary on a document is advantageous because reading annotation files of other users enhances the subscriber's understanding of the document.
- the system archives materials by class. This feature allows a Life Library subscriber to quickly store electronic counterparts to an entire class of paper documents without access to each paper document. For example, when the subscriber scans some text from a copy of National Geographic magazine, the system provides the subscriber with the option to archive all back issues of the National Geographic. If the subscriber elects to archive all back issues, the Life Library service provider would then verify with the National Geographic Society whether the subscriber is authorized to do so. If not, the Life Library service provider can mediate the purchase of the right to archive the National Geographic magazine collection.
- a variation on, or enhancement of, the Life Library concept is the “Life Saver,” where the system uses the text captured by a user to deduce more about their other activities.
- the scanning of a menu from a particular restaurant, a program from a particular theater performance, a timetable at a particular railway station, or an article from a local newspaper allows the system to make deductions about the user's location and social activities, and could construct an automatic diary for them, for example as a website.
- the user would be able to edit and modify the diary, add additional materials such as photographs and, of course, look again at the items scanned.
- Portable scanners supported by the described system have many compelling uses in the academic setting. They can enhance student/teacher interaction and augment the learning experience. Among other uses, students can annotate study materials to suit their unique needs; teachers can monitor classroom performance; and teachers can automatically verify source materials cited in student assignments.
- a child's interaction with a paper document, such as a book, is monitored by a literacy acquisition system that employs a specific set of embodiments of this system.
- the child uses a portable scanner that communicates with other elements of the literacy acquisition system.
- the literacy acquisition system includes a computer having a display and speakers, and a database accessible by the computer.
- the scanner is coupled with the computer (hardwired, short range RF, etc.).
- the literacy acquisition system compares the scanned text with the resources in its database to identify the word.
- the database includes a dictionary, thesaurus, and/or multimedia files (e.g., sound, graphics, etc.).
- the system uses the computer speakers to pronounce the word and its definition to the child.
- the word and its definition are displayed by the literacy acquisition system on the computer's monitor.
- Multimedia files about the scanned word can also be played through the computer's monitor and speakers. For example, if a child reading “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” scanned the word “bear,” the system might pronounce the word “bear” and play a short video about bears on the computer's monitor. In this way, the child learns to pronounce the written word and is visually taught what the word means via the multimedia presentation.
- the literacy acquisition system provides immediate auditory and/or visual information to enhance the learning process.
- the child uses this supplementary information to quickly acquire a deeper understanding of the written material.
- the system can be used to teach beginning readers to read, to help children acquire a larger vocabulary, etc. This system provides the child with information about words with which the child is unfamiliar or about which the child wants more information.
- the system creates customized spelling and vocabulary tests for students. For example, as a student reads an assignment, the student may scan unfamiliar words with the portable scanner. The system stores a list of all the words that the student has scanned. Later, the system administers a customized spelling/vocabulary test to the student on an associated monitor (or prints such a test on an associated printer).
- the arrangement of notes on a musical staff is similar to the arrangement of letters in a line of text.
- the same scanning device discussed for capturing text in this system can be used to capture music notation, and an analogous process of constructing a search against databases of known musical pieces would allow the piece from which the capture occurred to be identified which can then be retrieved, played, or be the basis for some further action.
- Teachers can use the system to detect plagiarism or to verify sources by scanning text from student papers and submitting the scanned text to the system. For example, a teacher who wishes to verify that a quote in a student paper came from the source that the student cited can scan a portion of the quote and compare the title of the document identified by the system with the title of the document cited by the student. Likewise, the system can use scans of text from assignments submitted as the student's original work to reveal if the text was instead copied.
- capturing text from an academic textbook links students or staff to more detailed explanations, further exercises, student and staff discussions about the material, related example past exam questions, further reading on the subject, recordings of the lectures on the subject, and so forth. (See also Section 7.1.)
- the system is used to teach foreign languages. Scanning a Spanish word, for example, might cause the word to be read aloud in Spanish along with its definition in English.
- the system provides immediate auditory and/or visual information to enhance the new language acquisition process.
- the reader uses this supplementary information to acquire quickly a deeper understanding of the material.
- the system can be used to teach beginning students to read foreign languages, to help students acquire a larger vocabulary, etc.
- the system provides information about foreign words with which the reader is unfamiliar or for which the reader wants more information.
- Reader interaction with a paper document, such as a newspaper or book, is monitored by a language skills system.
- the reader has a portable scanner that communicates with the language skills system.
- the language skills system includes a computer having a display and speakers, and a database accessible by the computer.
- the scanner communicates with the computer (hardwired, short range RF, etc.).
- the database includes a foreign language dictionary, thesaurus, and/or multimedia files (sound, graphics, etc.).
- the system compares the scanned text with the resources in its database to identify the scanned word. After the word has been identified, the system uses the computer speakers to pronounce the word and its definition to the reader.
- the word and its definition are both displayed on the computer's monitor.
- Multimedia files about grammar tips related to the scanned word can also be played through the computer's monitor and speakers. For example, if the words “to speak” are scanned, the system might pronounce the word “hablar,” play a short audio clip that demonstrates the proper Spanish pronunciation, and display a complete list of the various conjugations of “hablar.” In this way, the student learns to pronounce the written word, is visually taught the spelling of the word via the multimedia presentation, and learns how to conjugate the verb. The system can also present grammar tips about the proper usage of “hablar” along with common phrases.
- the user scans a word or short phrase from a rendered document in a language other than the user's native language (or some other language that the user knows reasonably well).
- the system maintains a prioritized list of the user's “preferred” languages. The system identifies the electronic counterpart of the rendered document, and determines the location of the scan within the document. The system also identifies a second electronic counterpart of the document that has been translated into one of the user's preferred languages, and determines the location in the translated document corresponding to the location of the scan in the original document. When the corresponding location is not known precisely, the system identifies a small region (e.g., a paragraph) that includes the corresponding location of the scanned location. The corresponding translated location is then presented to the user. This provides the user with a precise translation of the particular usage at the scanned location, including any slang or other idiomatic usage that is often difficult to accurately translate on a word-by-word basis.
- a user researching a particular topic may encounter all sorts of material, both in print and on screen, which they might wish to record as relevant to the topic in some personal archive.
- the system would enable this process to be automatic as a result of scanning a short phrase in any piece of material, and could also create a bibliography suitable for insertion into a publication on the subject.
- Conventional Internet search engines typically provide free search of electronic documents, and also make no charge to the content providers for including their content in the index.
- the system provides for charges to users and/or payments to search engines and/or content providers in connection with the operation and use of the system.
- subscribers to the system's services pay a fee for searches originating from scans of paper documents.
- a stockbroker may be reading a Wall Street Journal article about a new product offered by Company X.
- the stockbroker uses the system to search special or proprietary databases to obtain premium information about the company, such as analyst's reports.
- the system can also make arrangements to have priority indexing of the documents most likely to be read in paper form, for example by making sure all of the newspapers published on a particular day are indexed and available by the time they hit the streets.
- Content providers may pay a fee to be associated with certain terms in search queries submitted from paper documents. For example, in one embodiment, the system chooses a most preferred content provider based on additional context about the provider (the context being, in this case, that the content provider has paid a fee to be moved up the results list). In essence, the search provider is adjusting paper document search results based on pre-existing financial arrangements with a content provider. See also the description of keywords and key phrases in Section 5.2.
- Such content may be protected by a firewall and thus not generally indexable by third parties.
- the content provider may nonetheless wish to provide an index to the protected content.
- the content provider can pay a service provider to provide the content provider's index to system subscribers.
- a law firm may index all of a client's documents. The documents are stored behind the law firm's firewall.
- the law firm wants its employees and the client to have access to the documents through the portable scanner so it provides the index (or a pointer to the index) to the service provider, which in turn searches the law firm's index when employees or clients of the law firm submit paper-scanned search terms via their portable scanners.
- the law firm can provide a list of employees and/or clients to the service provider's system to enable this function or the system can verify access rights by querying the law firm prior to searching the law firm's index.
- the index provided by the law firm is only of that client's documents, not an index of all documents at the law firm.
- the service provider can only grant the law firm's clients access to the documents that the law firm indexed for the client.
- the search function revenue can be generated from paid subscriptions from the scanner users, but can also be generated on a per-search charge.
- the content delivery revenue can be shared with the content provider or copyright holder (the service provider can take a percentage of the sale or a fixed fee, such as a micropayment, for each delivery), but also can be generated by a “referral” model in which the system gets a fee or percentage for every item that the subscriber orders from the online catalog and that the system has delivered or contributed to, regardless of whether the service provider intermediates the transaction.
- the system service provider receives revenue for all purchases that the subscriber made from the content provider, either for some predetermined period of time or at any subsequent time when a purchase of an identified product is made.
- the subscriber scans information from the catalog that identifies the catalog. This information is text from the catalog, a bar code, or another identifier of the catalog. The subscriber scans information identifying the products that s/he wishes to purchase.
- the catalog mailing label may contain a customer identification number that identifies the customer to the catalog vendor. If so, the subscriber can also scan this customer identification number.
- the system acts as an intermediary between the subscriber and the vendor to facilitate the catalog purchase by providing the customer's selection and customer identification number to the vendor.
- a consumer scans paper coupons and saves an electronic copy of the coupon in the scanner, or in a remote device such as a computer, for later retrieval and use.
- An advantage of electronic storage is that the consumer is freed from the burden of carrying paper coupons.
- a further advantage is that the electronic coupons may be retrieved from any location.
- the system can track coupon expiration dates, alert the consumer about coupons that will expire soon, and/or delete expired coupons from storage.
- An advantage for the issuer of the coupons is the possibility of receiving more feedback about who is using the coupons and when and where they are captured and used.
- the system may be used to auto-populate an electronic document that corresponds to a paper form.
- a user scans in some text or a barcode that uniquely identifies the paper form.
- the scanner communicates the identity of the form and information identifying the user to a nearby computer.
- the nearby computer has an Internet connection.
- the nearby computer can access a first database of forms and a second database having information about the user of the scanner (such as a service provider's subscriber information database).
- the nearby computer accesses an electronic version of the paper form from the first database and auto-populates the fields of the form from the user's information obtained from the second database.
- the nearby computer then emails the completed form to the intended recipient. Alternatively, the computer could print the completed form on a nearby printer.
- the system has a portable scanner that contains the user's information, such as in an identity module, SIM, or security card.
- the scanner provides information identifying the form to the nearby PC.
- the nearby PC accesses the electronic form and queries the scanner for any necessary information to fill out the form.
- the system can be used to automatically populate electronic address books or other contact lists from paper documents. For example, upon receiving a new acquaintance's business card, a user can capture an image of the card with his/her cellular phone. The system will locate an electronic copy of the card, which can be used to update the cellular phone's onboard address book with the new acquaintance's contact information. The electronic copy may contain more information about the new acquaintance than can be squeezed onto a business card. Further, the onboard address book may also store a link to the electronic copy such that any changes to the electronic copy will be automatically updated in the cell phone's address book.
- the business card optionally includes a symbol or text that indicates the existence of an electronic copy.
- the system can enhance the proofreading and editing process.
- One way the system can enhance the editing process is by linking the editor's interactions with a paper document to its electronic counterpart.
- the system will make the appropriate annotations or edits to an electronic counterpart of the paper document. For example, if the editor scans a portion of text and makes the “new paragraph” control gesture with the scanner, a computer in communication with the scanner would insert a “new paragraph” break at the location of the scanned text in the electronic copy of the document.
- a user can make voice annotations to a document by scanning a portion of text from the document and then making a voice recording that is associated with the scanned text.
- the scanner has a microphone to record the user's verbal annotations. After the verbal annotations are recorded, the system identifies the document from which the text was scanned, locates the scanned text within the document, and attaches the voice annotation at that point. In some embodiments, the system converts the speech to text and attaches the annotation as a textual comment.
- the system keeps annotations separate from the document, with only a reference to the annotation kept with the document.
- the annotations then become an annotation markup layer to the document for a specific subscriber or group of users.
- the system identifies the document, opens it using a software package, scrolls to the location of the scan and plays the voice annotation. The user can then interact with a document while referring to voice annotations, suggested changes or other comments recorded either by themselves or by somebody else.
- a markup layer associated with a paper document contains help menu information for the document. For example, when a user scans text from a certain portion of the document, the system checks the markup associated with the document and presents a help menu to the user. The help menu is presented on a display on the scanner or on an associated nearby display.
- a public kiosk displays a dynamic session ID on its monitor.
- the kiosk is connected to a communication network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet.
- the session ID changes periodically but at least every time that the kiosk is used so that a new session ID is displayed to every user.
- the subscriber scans in the session ID displayed on the kiosk; by scanning the session ID, the user tells the system that he wishes to temporarily associate the kiosk with his scanner for the delivery of content resulting from scans of printed documents or from the kiosk screen itself.
- the scanner may communicate the Session ID and other information authenticating the scanner (such as a serial number, account number, or other identifying information) directly to the system.
- the scanner can communicate directly (where “directly” means without passing the message through the kiosk) with the system by sending the session initiation message through the user's cell phone (which is paired with the user's scanner via BluetoothTM).
- the scanner can establish a wireless link with the kiosk and use the kiosk's communication link by transferring the session initiation information to the kiosk (perhaps via short range RF such as BluetoothTM, etc.); in response, the kiosk sends the session initiation information to the system via its Internet connection.
- the system can prevent others from using a device that is already associated with a scanner during the period (or session) in which the device is associated with the scanner. This feature is useful to prevent others from using a public kiosk before another person's session has ended.
- the user scans a barcode on a monitor of a PC which s/he desires to use; in response, the system sends a session ID to the monitor that it displays; the user initiates the session by scanning the session ID from the monitor (or entering it via a keypad or touch screen or microphone on the portable scanner); and the system associates in its databases the session ID with the serial number (or other identifier that uniquely identifies the user's scanner) of his/her scanner so another scanner cannot scan the session ID and use the monitor during his/her session.
- information such as an image
- electronic content or data related to the scanned information is located, and various actions relating to the rendered document or display of information and associated electronic content are initiated.
- electronic counterparts of rendered documents are delivered to the user in response to captured data.
- the electronic counterparts can be delivered to a user's personal computer.
- electronic counterparts are delivered via email to an account associated with the capture device or user of the capture device, or delivered directly to the user via a display of the capture device (such as a touch screen of the user's mobile phone).
- users can subscribe to various services offered by a service provider. These services support the use of handheld document data capture devices. Such services can include communication, transaction intermediation (e.g., providing payment to a vendor for purchases made by the subscriber with the handheld device), search, content indexing, data processing, data archiving (e.g., life library), and many others.
- a service provider might provide communication and search functions for a mobile phone so that it can be used to capture information from a rendered document and wirelessly communicate the information to a search engine.
- a service provider can provide user accounts associated with handheld data capture devices.
- These accounts can include internet-hosted repositories of user data related to captures (“Life Libraries”), search and retrieval services for capture activity, purchasing and other financial transaction support (for example, support for having users' purchases billed to their account statement, or alternatively to their credit cards), etc.
- a cellular telephone operator acts as a service provider for some of the described services, with billing activity integrated with, or associated with, the user's cellular telephone bill.
- the search engine may compile information about interest in the paper document. For example, the number of queries originating in a particular issue of a magazine can be counted.

- Scanning can employ a CMOS image sensor to distinguish contrasts between rendered information and a background of a page.
- the scanner memory may be, for example, a flash memory or a dynamically refreshed random access memory.
- the scanned information may include one or more image fragments of the document 426 .
- the scanner 402 , the computing device 404 , or the network 406 may process the scanned information, resulting in scanned information in the form of text produced from one or more image fragments. Alternatively, the processing may result in scanned information in the form of a parametric representation of scanned symbols, or a statistical representation of scanned symbols. Examples of a parametric representation of scanned symbols include information about a type or types of the scanned symbols (e.g.
- Numerous scans may be performed. Information from each scan may be stored in the scanner memory. Subsequent to scanning or as scanning occurs, upon communication between the scanner 402 and the separate computing device 404 or network 406 , the scanned information which has previously been obtained and is stored in scanned memory or at that point is being obtained may be transferred to the separate computing device 404 or to the network 406 . Communication between the scanner 402 and the separate computing device 404 or network 406 may involve wires or optical fibers or may be accomplished via wireless communication such as BlueToothTM communication.
- Establishing communication between the scanner 402 and the separate computing device 404 or the network 406 may be triggered, for one example, by docking the scanner 402 in a cradle coupled to the separate computing device 404 or network 406 .
- a second example communication is established by establishing a wireless connection when the scanner 402 comes within wireless communication range of the separate computing device 404 or network 406 .
- a third example communication is established by completing a Plug and Play connection between the scanner 402 and the separate computing device 404 or network 406 (e.g. via a Universal Serial Bus connection).
- the scanner 402 , computing device 404 , and/or the network 406 may process scanned information as it is collected for various reasons.
- the scanned information may be processed as collected to determine when sufficient information has been scanned to identify actions which may be performed with or involving the scanned information.

- the scanner 402 may include a light emitting diode (LED) to notify a user of the scanner 402 when sufficient scanned information has been obtained to locate a document comprising the scanned information.
- LED light emitting diode
- Other manners of signaling the user include providing a tone, beep, or other auditory signal, providing an indication on a display, or producing a vibration.
- Processing of information associated with the electronic content may determine actions and/or behaviors available to a user of the scanner. Many actions may be associated with the scanned information. Examples comprise commerce operations (e.g. purchasing a product, reviewing product information, linking to an affiliate sales site, promotional site, or marketing site, and so on); retrieving the scanned document or a portion thereof electronically to a display or memory; associating user created content such as annotations with the content; identifying or retrieving other information related to the content such as advertisements, definitions, translations, or biographical or historical information. Additionally, actions may be identified to occur after the information retrieved as a result of the scanning is further analyzed, for example, formatted into regions (e.g. marked up) which are considered to contain a certain type of content, such as advertising regions or editorial regions.
- regions e.g. marked up
- the scanner 402 while in an off-line state (e.g. not in active communication with the computing device 404 and/or network 406 ), may perform processing to determine at least one of an action or actions associated with the scanned information or to facilitate the recognition of a document or documents associated with the scanned information. Alternatively or additionally, such processing may be performed upon establishing communication between the scanner 402 and the computing device 404 or network 406 .
- the scanned information is processed for use in a search query that is submitted to a search engine or other location function 408 , to locate an electronic document or documents 416 - 418 either comprising the scanned information, or comprising related information.
- the scanned information may be processed to form, at least in part, a Uniform Resource Locator or other link to content of a network, for example to form a link to product information.
- the scanned information may be processed to, at least in part, determine a product or class of products, or advertisements associated therewith.
- the results of such processing (for example, associated actions, one or more determined target locations in associated documents, search query results, links to other content) may be stored in a user repository 410 associated with the scanned information.
- the scanned information may be processed to determine the contents of a menu of options presented in conjunction with interaction with the document 426 , e.g. to provide document interaction options for a user of the scanner.

- a different menu of options may be presented if the same material is scanned.
- instances of scanned information stored in a user repository 410 are marked with an indication of the status of the scanned information.
- Such status information may include, for example, an indication as to whether the instance was collected when the scanner was in an off-line state, whether the user has already responded by selecting one or more choices from a presented menu of options associated with the instance, and whether the instance has been designated by the user as having a particular status.
- Electronic content may be located corresponding to the scanned information, e.g. the document 426 from which the information was scanned.
- Examples of electronic content include web pages, images, text files, Adobe Portable Document Format files, and word processing files.
- a fee may be charged to locate and provide, display, and/or archive the electronic content corresponding to the scanned information.
- the electronic content is provided by emailing the electronic content, or a link to the electronic content, to an email account associated with the scanner 402 , or a user or users of the scanner 402 . Where a link to the electronic content is provided, the link may be a Uniform Resource Locator or other network address or pointer.
- the electronic content or a link to the electronic content may be stored in a repository 410 for subsequent access by the user or users of the scanner 402 .
- the repository 410 may include one or more online repositories, or one or more repositories stored on a computing device 404 of the user.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system 522 to access restricted content from multiple sources 502 , 503 , 504 .
- Indexes 506 , 508 , 520 from multiple restricted sources may be compiled or otherwise organized so that they may be searched together.
- the indexes may be obtained from multiple access-restricted sources 502 , 503 , 504 , such as multiple corporate intranets or multiple subscription and/or fee-based content sources.
- the access restriction 512 , 514 , 516 may take the form of firewalls and/or mandatory authentication and/or authorization schemes.
- the search system may also be capable of determining if the user has permission to access the digital version of the paper document. For instance, some publishers may charge a subscription fee to access the electronic version. Some publishers may provide free access to the electronic version but still require that users register (for example, the NY Times online newspaper requires that all readers create a free account to access the articles). In either case, the user must satisfy certain conditions to gain access to the electronic data.
- the system 522 may include logic 524 to determine which access permissions for selected electronic content are available to a user or users of the scanner 402 . For example, upon a selection by the user to access content identified in search results, the system 522 may determine if the user is a subscriber to the publisher (source) of the electronic content. The system 522 may determine if registration with the content publisher is required to access the electronic content, and if so, may assist the user of the scanner 402 with registration with the content publisher.
- the user of the scanner 402 may be prompted for access credentials to the electronic content, and the provided access credentials applied to obtain access to the electronic content.
- the system 522 may authenticate the user or users.
- the system 522 may have access to stored access credentials 528 to enable the user or users to access content of different sources.
- the system 522 may (having already authenticated the user or users) locate the user's access credentials for the source of the content and apply the credentials to the source to provide the user or users with access to the content.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a content search index 602 .
- the search index 602 may comprise document indexes 604 , 605 , 606 from multiple restricted sources, such as corporate intranets or fee and/or subscription based publishers, and/or may comprise one or more indexes to freely-available online content.
- One or more of the indexes 604 - 606 may be specific to at least one of particular publications or periodicals.
- index 605 may be specific to the New York TimesTM 616
- index 606 may be specific to the Wall Street JournalTM 617 .
- Other of the indexes 604 - 606 may be specific to a particular entity such as a corporation.
- index 604 may be specific to documents of a particular corporation 618 (e.g., “Bigco”).
- the content of the Bigco corporate intranet are marked as restricted access at 608 .
- the content of the New York Times are marked at 613 as corresponding to the printed version of the newspaper, and at 627 as requiring registration for access.
- the content of the Wall Street Journal is marked as restricted access at 610 , and as corresponding to a printed version of the newspaper at 614 .
- the index may include indications of the geographic distribution of a printed document, indications of the publication date of the printed document, and indications of the popularity (read rank, as deduced from search queries originating from paper documents) of a printed document.
- the index is document specific, which results in quicker searches when the document is known and enhances the system's capability to cache indexes locally.
- the index 602 may be accessed by a search engine or other location function 408 , and search results matching the query provided.
- a search engine or other location function 408 may search the search index and provide search results matching the query, and may facilitate access to restricted content associated with a search results.
- the search engine and/or other logic may also compile access information for a print document associated with the electronic content, as described more fully in conjunction with FIG. 7 .
- the scope of a document search may be determined at least in part by scan context information, e.g. information related and relevant to the scan.
- the search results returned from one or more queries may also be adapted according to the scan context.
- context information is also an input to the search engine. For instance, if a user scans some text from an Associated Press newspaper article, context data can be used to determine the correct newspaper from which the text was scanned. Context data could be about the user's environment (location, time of scan, etc.), data associated with prior and subsequent scans from the user, or, once a document has been identified, information about the document being scanned.
- Context can also include an awareness of the geographical distribution of the paper document (in other words, knowledge of the areas in which the document was published as opposed to knowledge of the scanner's location).
- Scan context may comprise statistical information about the document from which the information was scanned.
- Statistical information may include probabilities that certain symbols would occur in the document if the document belonged to one or more predetermined classifications.
- Other statistical information that may be relevant includes usage statistics, transaction statistics, and access statistics for related documents (e.g. search indexes for more highly trafficked documents first).
- the statistics may be for one individual, such as the user initiating the scan, or for more than one people who have interacted with versions of the same or similar documents.
- the statistics may be for access to, or for usage of, or for transactions initiated for, a region of the document (e.g. a page or paragraph), the entire document (e.g. an entire article), a document higher in a document hierarchy (e.g. magazine or on-line website), prior usage of articles with associated content categories, or many other statistical aggregations.
- Scan context may include proximity to titles, headings, photos, illustrations, captions, footnotes, endnotes, citations, keywords, names, locations, phone numbers, or addresses, among other things.
- the distance of the scanned information these items may include the number of intervening words, or the physical distance, among possible measures.
- Document regions may include identifying delineated physical areas of the document, or regions defined by way of rules or the nature of the content therein. Regions may be assigned a type or types. A document may include regions that at least partially overlap. Region types which may be identified include a product or products region, advertising, sports, news, political, science, technology, hobby, entertainment, opinion, finance, business, classifieds, art, real estate, or a subject region, among other things.
- the scan context may comprise categories previously associated with the documents related to the one from which the information was scanned, or an “on the fly” analysis of at least a portion of the document to determine categories to associate with the document.
- the scan context may include a manner in which the scan was performed, a time of day or date or combination thereof at which or during which the scan was performed, a location in the document from which the scanned information was obtained (see above), a physical location at which the scan was performed, and/or environment signals proximate in time with the scan. Examples of a physical location at which the scan may be performed include a vehicle, a room, a building, a town or city, a neighborhood, a block, a geographic location, or a functional area.
- the scan context may include information derived at least in part from the information from the scan (such as fonts, keywords, etc.), scan habits for a person performing the scan, and/or scan habits for a group with which the person performing the scan is associated.
- the scan context may include at least one attribute of a person performing the scan, and/or at least one attribute of a group with which the person performing the scan is associated.
- the scan context may include signals proximate in time with the scan e.g. a short time prior to the scan, substantially contemporaneous with the scan, a short time after the scan, or a time interval prior to or after the scan wherein there are no intervening events or signals to indicate that the environment has changed or is changing.
- Examples of environment signals include at least one of a spoken word, phrase, command, name, or sound that is not a language element.
- Environment signals may include at least one of sounds made by proximate activity, conversational sounds, animal, weather, water, or other natural sounds, and sounds of machinery or appliances or tools.
- Environment signals may also include at least one of temperature signals, light level signals, touch pad signals, or signals resulting from the operation of buttons or other controls.
- Environment signals may also include image information from the local environment.
- environment signals include at least one of persons identified from voice information collected from the local environment, persons identified from image information collected from the local environment, and objects identified from image information collected from the local environment.
- Scan habits for a person may include information the person has scanned in the past, subscriptions of or related to the person, or expressed or inferred content preferences of the person.
- Habits for a group with which the person performing the scan is associated may include scan habits of people in at least one of the same age group, income group, people who had scanned the same or similar information in the past, people of the same gender, race, belief system, and people who live in the same geographic region.
- the scan context information may at least partially determine a scope of the search for electronic content associated with the rendered document, and/or the content of results returned in response to one or more search queries.
- Scanned information may partially or completely determine the likely document from which the information was scanned. For example, a short phrase may sufficiently identify the document. As another example, it may be known that based on the known user and the time of day and font size and contrast, a particular newspaper comprises the document from which the information was scanned.
- the scan context may include a manner in which the scan was performed. Examples of a manner in which the scan was performed include a direction of the scan over the document, one or more velocity metrics of the scan over the document, one or more acceleration metrics of the scan over the document, or one or more paths or path components of the scan over the document. Paths or path components of the scan may include a predetermined gesture, symbol, or behavioral pattern.
- Information scanned from a document may include textual information, symbols, graphics, icons, watermarks, or codes such as barcodes.
- the graphics, icons, watermarks or codes may comprise scan context information.
- the scanned information may additionally or alternatively provide scan context by providing an indication of a publication comprising or likely comprising the document (such as an ISBN number).
- an advertisement, series of words within text, page header or portion thereof, or page footer or portion thereof may be used in article or publication identification.
- Examples of an indication of a publication comprising or likely comprising the document include an indication of a periodical comprising the document, the indication of the periodical ascertained according to at least one of words or phrases of the information from the scan.
- fonts, contrast, and other information of the document may be obtained by scanning.
- Examples of information derived at least in part from the information from the scan include at least one of a keyword, icon, symbol, phrase, name or other identifying indicia of a person, place, organization, entity, belief system, philosophy, role, status, job title, or thing.
- FIG. 7 is flow chart of an embodiment of a process of applying scanned information to identify associated content and compile document access statistics.
- a search engine or other location function receives a query.
- the search engine determines whether the query information results from information scanned from a paper document.
- the search engine compiles, at 706 , information about interest in the paper document, such as: the number of people capturing from the paper document, the number of captures per person in a paper document, number of captures in a sub-region in a paper document.
- the process concludes.
- the search engine may determine whether query information results from information scanned from a paper document in various manners.
- One such manner is by including distinguishing data, for example special fields or field values, within the search query.
- Another manner of determining whether query information results from information scanned from a paper document is by associating a particular source of query information with information scanned from documents. For example, receiving a query from a particular server or servers, gateway or gateways, internet protocol addresses, and/or a special portal or portals could signify that the information is the result of scanning from a paper document.
- Query information derived from scans from paper documents can receive different treatment in the search engine from the treatment received by other types of queries.
- the search engine can process search queries from rendered documents in a special index that is optimized for such searches.
- data stored in the index or indices used by the search engine will include special fields related to scan-based queries.
- the search engine can initiate special billing procedures when it receives a search query that was scanned from a paper document.
- the search engine can optionally charge different fees for searches originating from rendered documents as compared to searches coming from web browsers and other sources (which in some cases may have no associated fees).
- search queries derived from scans are routed through designated ports or gateways. Some or all of the traffic on these connections incurs charges for searching the index.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a process of locating content associated with a rendered document using a representation of scanned information.
- the scanned information is processed using OCR (optical Character Recognition) technology and converted to text.
- OCR optical Character Recognition
- a representation of the scanned information is stored by the scanner 402 .
- the scanned information may be stored as image data, compressed image data, text from OCR, or a combination of these and/or other representations.
- information is scanned and optionally stored.
- the scanned information is optionally converted to text at 804 .
- search queries are formed for each valid text string at 808 .
- a search string is formed for the single valid text string that can be derived from the scanned information.
- queries are submitted for each valid text string.
- results of these searches are examined, and based upon the results the most likely electronic content is identified corresponding to the document from which the information was scanned.
- the search results can be prioritized or restricted or classified based on whether the search query was from a paper document and/or whether the result is available as a paper document. Search results can also be adjusted based on the read rank of the paper document. Some embodiments can track both read rank (search and other activity originating from scans in rendered documents) and conventional page ranking (links from websites to documents and/or their associated web pages, the ranking of the linked-from website, number of browser-based visits to documents on the web, web-based download activity associated with documents, etc.). Some embodiments can adjust returned search results and other activities based on read ranks which include or are weighted by the print circulation numbers for the paper documents.
- search results and activities can be adjusted based on a combination of read rank and traditional methods of ranking and prioritizing.
- search results and search-related activities can be determined or influenced by financial compensation from paper document publishers, distributors, authors, copyright holders, etc., to the search engine provider, indexing service, or other service provider.
- this compensation includes fees, payments, or charges for special (e.g., prioritized) handling of queries originating from paper documents.
- special handling includes forwarding queries to a network location specified by the sponsoring party or otherwise processing queries associated with fees in a manner distinct from those with no association with fees.
- FIG. 9 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a process of locating content associated with a rendered document using text resulting from application of optical character recognition to scanned information.
- Information is scanned from a printed document at 902 .
- the scanned information is converted to text using optical character recognition or by way of some other technique at 904 .
- the system determines whether there are errors in the text. In some embodiments this error detection is based on comparing the words in the text to words in a dictionary; words not in the dictionary can be considered to have errors. If the dictionary includes word frequency data, then words in the text that match low frequency words in the dictionary are also suspect. In some embodiments n-gram analysis is applied; words having improbable character sequences are flagged at 906 as possibly having errors.
- the system can determine multiple possible interpretations of the text. For example, if the application of OCR at 904 results in the text string “teyt errors,” the system would determine that “teyt” is not a word in the dictionary, but “tent,” “test,” and “text” are in the dictionary.
- the techniques applicable at 906 to detect errors and at 908 to develop alternatives can be taken from known art in the field of spell-checking, or OCR error correction.
- the described system could instead form a single query using wildcards or other representations to represent possible choices.
- the “teyt errors” example above would result in a query for “te*t errors.”
- a search query is formed from the text at 910 .
- the search query or queries are submitted to a search engine at 912 .
- the search results are examined at 914 to determine which of the returned results most likely identifies electronic content corresponding to the document from which the information was scanned. In some cases step 914 results in a list of candidate documents. The read rank of these documents can be used to determine which are the more probable matches.
- the process concludes.
- the results of a search involves returning an electronic document or hyperlink to a document.
- the document is the electronic counterpart of the rendered document from which the capture was made.
- the system identifies or returns a markup document or markup data associated with the rendered document and/or the electronic counterpart.
- a local cache or data store can allow a capture device to provide increased function when disconnected from the network or other components of the system. For example, when a user next performs a capture, the capture device can directly consult the local cache or data store to determine whether the capture is from the same document as the previous capture, whether the captured data identifies a unique location in the document, whether there are special actions associated with the captured data and/or with the location of the capture in the document, etc.
- downloaded markup data is sufficient to complete actions while disconnected from the network.
- a capture device having markup data for a magazine about computers can process a capture of the phrase “ . . . Jake Anderson's new book, ‘The Art of Programming,’ was just released . . . ”
- the markup data for this issue of the magazine includes a list of all items mentioned or advertised which are available for purchase at Amazon.com, including their price, last-known availability, etc.
- the handheld capture device performs OCR on the above phrase, determines that ‘The Art of Programming’ is an item for sale at Amazon for $29.95 plus $5.50 shipping, offers to order the book for the user (for example via a screen and keyboard on the user's PDA), and accepts the user's order.
- the capture device is next reconnected to the other components of the described system, the transaction can be forwarded for fulfillment and billing.
- the local cache or data store is moved relatively closer to the capture device, but not to the device itself.
- the capture device is connected to a personal computer (for example by a Bluetooth wireless connection), which is in turn connected to search and/or retrieval components of the described system across the internet, digital counterparts and markup and other data related to rendered documents can be downloaded onto the personal computer for ready access without network accesses—or with fewer such accesses.
- the capture functionality is integrated in a cell phone, or the capture device uses a connection to a cell phone and the cellular network to connect to search and/or retrieval components of the described system
- traffic across the cellular network can be reduced, and latency in responding to captures can be reduced, if data that has a reasonable probability of being useful in future captures is downloaded to the cell phone or to the capture device in advance.
- a markup and other data associated with documents and publications a given user is known to frequently read, or may likely read is downloaded to their capture device so that the device can provide interactivity with rendered documents (e.g., context-dependent menu interactions) while the device is offline—for example while the user is traveling.
- the search service provider keeps a history of captures performed and/or queries submitted by each subscriber or device.
- Each user's history of such queries and/or captures may be of significant value to the user and can be maintained in a separate, secure database that can only be accessed by the user.
- the search history may be kept with the user account information, life library, or any other suitable storage location.
- the search history and other context can be used by some embodiments of the system to guide and modify future searches—for example, by first searching frequently-read periodicals, or by prioritizing or qualifying results according to the user's previous behavior.
- the capture and query activities of groups of users are used in a manner similar to the way they are used for individuals (e.g., to optimize the search process and prioritize or qualify) both for members of the group and for others having similar characteristics.
- the system makes use of users' histories of queries and/or captures to determine what data to locate close to a particular user (for example, by storing the data on the user's local device, or making it available on a nearby server).
- the service provider will answer a search query by returning limited excerpts from a result document—for example a single paragraph or page containing a capture.
- a result document for example a single paragraph or page containing a capture.
- the searcher may be required to pay a fee, be a regular subscriber to a service provided by the system, etc.
- the system maintains two or more indexes of the same document or body of documents. With multiple indexes, the system can perform separate searches for scan-originated and browser-initiated queries, where each index is optimized for one or more specific types of query.
- the search engine maintains the user's recent search history and uses the previous results for subsequent searches. In some embodiment, the search engine keeps track of the user's most recent search results and searches them first for the user's subsequent searches. The recent search results can be searched before (or in parallel with) searching the search engine's main index, thus resulting in quicker searches and less latency. Pending parallel searches can be cancelled when one a capture is recognized or handled by another search which finished earlier—thus saving processing and/or network resources.
- communications between the handheld document data capture device and the search engine are encrypted or otherwise secured to maintain privacy.
- Some or all of the results of queries are returned to the user—optionally to the capture device itself—across a secure connection.
- some or all records of queries and their results are deleted by the system, thus insuring that a user's data cannot be accessed by others.
- some or all records are encrypted by the system to ensure user privacy.
- inventive concepts can similarly be used for search and delivery of any digital information such as digital music and/or videos, or of a digital service such as product purchasing.
- Data captures have primarily been discussed in the context of optical captures such as scans, but voice captures are also possible in many embodiments.
- the searches may be initiates from captures of images.
- the system may perform a hybrid search for an image in which searches for the image using characteristics of the image as well as the contents of the image, such as the text within the image.
- the search may be generalized, such that an index has different feature extraction, indexing and/or search approaches based on the types of material encountered (in a whole image and/or in parts, including filtered views of the whole and/or parts). For example, the capture of highly gradual content may cause the system to focus on algorithms that work well with gradients, whereas the capture of high contrast content may cause the system to focus on edges, corners, etc. (and their relationships). An additional capture of text and characters (and other repetitive) content may cause the system to focus on auto-correlation patterns, OCR output, etc.
- the system may consider strong image signals that are typically useful for classification (e.g. half-toning patterns) as long as the imaging system is able to capture the patterns.
- the index is multi-tiered (using text to constrain, or merely remove images from consideration) or single-tiered (the text itself within the image is a separate metadata field).
- the system may search for the text first (whether in a separate index or as part of image metadata), and use image characteristics (and time, date, etc) to further disambiguate any ambiguous search results. For example, knowing a user is in the New York Times on a certain day based on previous text or image captures can provide an additional constraint to search results.
- the system uses text and other characters or repetitive strings to position and/or anchor an image in preparation for searching.
- the system upon capturing and/or receiving a capture of an image, may adjust the image based on knowledge of how the text within the image should be positioned. That is, the system may slightly rotate, translate, or otherwise readjust an image based on the text and before searching for the image.
- the system may adjust the image based on corrections made to the text within the image, as the system is more likely to have knowledge of the text (via OCR, for example), and its correct form.
- the system may facilitate searching for images by combining traditional image search techniques and inputs (e.g., color, texture and edge information) while adapting to the content (e.g., text) within an image, enabling the system to accurately and quickly find images captured from displays of content, among other benefits.
- image search techniques and inputs e.g., color, texture and edge information
- content e.g., text
