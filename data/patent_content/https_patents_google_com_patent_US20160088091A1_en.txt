Description
- The present disclosure relates to identifying existing synchronous communication sessions. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to identifying existing synchronous communication sessions associated with a particular user.
- The development of the Internet has provided convenient and efficient tools for users to stay in communication with each other. Specifically, the Internet has provided useful tools for users to engage in real-time audio and video communication with each other. Recently, social network portals have also added this capability to their functionality.
- Historically, if users wanted to engage is in this type of communication, the user had to proactively invite specific users to also engage. A user may also search for existing on-line text-based chat rooms. However, it may be quite cumbersome and time-consuming to find text-based chat rooms that have participants that the user wants to chat with. Existing social networks provide the capability for users to engage in one-on-one communication with their connections in their social network and even have indications of which connections are currently on-line. However, these indications typically show a listing of which of the users connections is on-line. Therefore, it would be beneficial for users to have convenient access to communication sessions that are most relevant to the user.
- The present embodiments overcome the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art by providing a system and method for identifying existing synchronous communication sessions associated with a particular user.
- A method of identifying existing synchronous communication sessions associated with a user is performed by one or more computing devices. A request to display information about the user is received at the one or more computing devices. A plurality of existing synchronous communication sessions is identified. Each existing synchronous communication session includes at least one participant and the user has an association with the existing synchronous communication session. An affinity score for each of the plurality of synchronous communication sessions is determined based on an affinity between the user and at least one of the participant of the synchronous communication session. The plurality of existing synchronous communication sessions associated with the user is ranked based on the affinity score. In some embodiments, an indication of a subset of the plurality of existing synchronous communication sessions is sent for display on the one more computing devices. In some embodiments, an indication of one of the existing synchronous communication sessions is sent for display on the one more computing devices.
- A system for identifying existing synchronous communication sessions associated with a user is also disclosed. A request to display information about the user is received by a request receiver. A sessions identifier identifies a plurality of existing synchronous communication sessions. Each existing synchronous communication session includes at least one participant and the user has an association with the existing synchronous communication session. An affinity score for each of the plurality of synchronous communication sessions is determined by a sessions ranking module based on an affinity between the user and at least one of the participant of the synchronous communication session. The plurality of existing synchronous communication sessions associated with the user is ranked based on the affinity score. In some embodiments, an output generator sends an indication of a subset of the plurality of existing synchronous communication sessions for display on the one more computing devices. In some embodiments, the output generator sends an indication of one of the existing synchronous communication sessions for display on the one more computing devices.
- The embodiments are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

FIG. 9 is an example of a graphical user interface showing a notification of existing communication sessions associated with a user in accordance with another embodiment. -
FIG. 10 is example of another graphical user interface showing a notification of existing communication sessions associated with a user in accordance with yet another embodiment. - A system and method for identifying existing synchronous communication sessions associated with a user is described. In an example embodiment, a user logs into a social network portal. The user has the ability to participate in synchronous communication sessions through the social network portal. The user also has connections (e.g., friends or people in the user's “circles”) within the social network portal and the connections may be categorized into groups or organized into categories based on various factors. For example, the user may have a group of connections for members who are family members. The user may also have a group of connections for members who are co-workers. The social network portal provides the capability for the user to group the connections into different groups and engage in synchronous communication sessions with the members of the group. When a user logs on, the user can automatically see information about live synchronous communication sessions that are most relevant to the user. In some embodiments, the system automatically shows the user information about the X (e.g., three) most relevant synchronous communication sessions and gives the user the ability to join the live synchronous communication sessions. The relevance of the synchronous communication sessions may be determined by the system based on social affinity of the user with the users in the synchronous communication sessions, the history of the user engaging in synchronous communication sessions, the coherence of the participants in the synchronous communication sessions, and other techniques described herein.
- In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the embodiments. For example, the present disclosure is described in one embodiment below with reference to user interfaces and particular hardware. However, the present disclosure applies to any type of computing device that can receive data and commands, and any peripheral devices providing services.
- Reference in the specification to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
- Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like.
- It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “processing” or “computing” or “calculating” or “determining” or “displaying” or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
- Some embodiments also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memories including USB keys with non-volatile memory or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer system bus.
- Furthermore, embodiments can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.
- The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read/write (CD-R/W) and DVD.
- A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.
- Input/output or I/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers.
- Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.
- Finally, the algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present embodiments are not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the embodiments as described herein.
