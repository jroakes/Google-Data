Definitions
- This disclosure relates to the field of content delivery platforms and, in particular, to dynamically adapting media content based on user feedback.
- content delivery platforms or other applications allow users to upload, consume, and share digital content such as media items.
- media items may include audio clips, movie clips, TV clips, and music videos, as well as amateur content such as video blogging, short original videos, pictures, other multimedia content, etc.
- Users may use computing devices (such as smart phones, cellular phones, laptop computers, desktop computers, netbooks, tablet computers) to use, play, and/or consume the media items (e.g., watch digital videos, listen to digital music).
- a method for dynamically adapting media content delivered to a user based on user feedback includes receiving from a user device, such as computer or mobile device, a selection of a seed media item.
- the seed media item includes a seed label.
- the method further includes generating a list including the seed label and a set of labels related to the seed label.
- the seed label and related labels each include a separate label weight.
- the method also includes identifying multiple media items associated with the seed label and/or related labels (i.e., associate label).
- the method additionally includes transmitting to the user device a media item of the multiple media items of the associate label.
- the method also includes receiving user feedback from the user device on the media item of the associate label and adjusting the label weight of the associate label based on the user feedback.
- the label weight is adjusted based on a temporal relation to the user feedback.
- a label is an artist identifier (e.g., artist), and a media item is a video identifier (e.g., video).
- the method includes explicit user feedback such as a like action, a dislike action, a comment, and a sharing action.
- the method also includes implicit user feedback such as a long watch action, a removal action, or a skip action.
- the method includes identifying a second set of related labels based on the adjusted label weight of the associate label.
- the method also includes updating the list to contain the second set of related labels.
- the method includes identifying an additional label when the adjusted label weight of the associate label exceeds a first threshold value.
- the additional label may be related to the associate label.
- the method includes calculating a cumulative weight.
- the cumulative weight may be the weight of all the separate label weights of the list.
- the method includes comparing the cumulative weight of the list to a second threshold value.
- the method further includes replacing one of the more related labels of the list with a second set of related labels when the cumulative weight is under the second threshold.
- the second set of related labels is based on the seed. In one implementation, the second set of related labels is related to the seed label.
- the method includes assigning a media weight to each of the multiple media items associated with an associate label (i.e., seed label or related label). In one implementation, the method includes transmitting to the user device a media item based on the media weight.
- the method includes calculating a full-rank weight for each of the plurality of media items associated with the associate label.
- the full-rank weight may include a combination of label weight and media weight.
- computing devices for performing the operations of the above described implementations are also disclosed.

- Content delivery platforms can include one or more stations and the one or more stations can be consumable over the Internet.
- a station is a mechanism for providing certain media items and/or for providing access to media items to users.
- Media items for the station can be selected by a user, uploaded by a user, selected by a content provider, or selected by a broadcaster.
- Stations allow users to receive, create, customize, and consume media items. Users can create one or more stations, and upon creation, the user can view his or her stations from the homepage of the content hosting site or from a user interface.
- a station may provide a continuous stream of media items and as such, a user may consume a continuous stream of media content through a station.
- a station may include a playlist.
- a playlist may include a list of media items that are played sequentially or in some order. In a station, new media items are continuously added to a station playlist so that playback on a station may continue uninterrupted.
- Implementations of the disclosure pertain to dynamically adapting media content for a user based on user feedback. Because of the large number of media items that are currently available on the Internet (e.g., the Web and/or other networks) or from a content sharing platform, users may often have difficulty choosing and/or finding new media items to consume. Implementations of the present disclosure may automatically and dynamically curate media content (i.e., media items) for the user. Feedback from the user (such as "likes,” “dislikes,” comments, long watch actions, or skip actions) associated with media items may be analyzed in order to determine media content for the user to consume. A station module may create a station based on an initial selection of a media item, i.e., seed media item.
- media content i.e., media items
- a station module may create a station based on an initial selection of a media item, i.e., seed media item.
- a user feedback module may dynamically update a station's media content based on user feedback.
- a user may modify or delete a station.
- a user's inaction for example a user not consuming a media item within a threshold period of time, may cause a station or a station's media content to be modified or deleted.
- the implementations described herein may allow the user to more easily and more quickly consume media items without manually searching for media items.
- a user may search for videos by performing a search query of, for example, classical music.
- the query may return numerous videos for classical music, and the user may select a video, for example Mozart - The Marriage of Figaro, from the search query results.
- the user may create a station based on video by, for example, clicking a create station button associated with the video (e.g., Figure 4, button 452).
- the user feedback module e.g., user feedback module 135) may create the station and use "The Marriage of Figaro," as the seed media item.
- the seed media item is the first video from which the station is created.
- Media content may be based on the seed media item.
- the user feedback module may also determine a seed label associated with the seed media item.
- the seed label is Mozart.
- the user feedback module may curate videos for the station relevant to the seed label.
- the user feedback module may curate videos by composers such as Bach and Vivaldi.
- Each composer can be considered a relevant label, that is, relevant to the seed label (e.g., composer), Mozart.
- the labels, the seed label and the relevant labels, for example Mozart, Bach, and Vivaldi respectively, may have numerous associated media items (e.g., videos).
- the user feedback module will select video items for each composer to curate the station's playlist.
- the user feedback module may update the labels and associated media items in the station playlist. For example, if the user feedback on the Bach video is positive, the user feedback module may curate more videos of music by Bach or curate videos by composers related to Bach. User feedback may be, for example, a user like of a video, a comment on a video, or a user skipping a video, or the like.

- processing logic may perform all or part of the operations of user feedback module 135 to perform all or part of the disclosed method.
- processing logic may perform all or part of the operations of the data store 106 to perform all or part of the disclosed method.
- method 500 may be performed by user feedback module 135, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
- method 500 begins at block 505 when processing logic receives from a user device (e.g., user device 110A though user device 110Z) a selection of a seed media item (e.g., media item 125 and media item 128).
- the seed media item e.g., media item 125 and media item 128) includes a seed label (e.g., seed label 121 and seed label 123).
- the seed media item may function as the initial media item on which a station and subsequent selection of related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 124) is based. For example, a user may select a media item such as a video of the song, "Video A," by Artist A.
- the selected media item in this case the video, "Video A”
- the selected media item in this case the video, "Video A”
- the video, "Video A” has an associated seed label, in this case, the seed label is the artist, "Artist A”.
- Other examples of labels might include “rock,” “British,” “classic rock,” etc.
- Method 500 continues to block 510, where processing logic generates a list including the seed label (e.g., seed label 121 and seed label 123) and a first set of related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 124) based on the seed label.
- the seed label and each related label may include a separate label weight.
- the artist, "Artist A” is the seed label.
- Processing logic takes the seed label, Artist A, and finds a group of related artists.
- the related artists may be, for example, Artist L and Artist W.
- the set of related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 124) may be based on the seed label and popularity, number of "likes" of a community of users, or recent views by a community of users. In another implementation, a set of related labels may be based on the seed label and the user's user history.
- method 500 uses the seed media item (e.g., media item 125 and media item 128), and not necessarily current user feedback, to determine a first set of related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 124). In another implementation, method 500 uses one or both of the seed media item (e.g., media item 125 and media item 128) and the user's history to determine the related labels.
- processing logic may assign a label weight to all the labels, including the seed label (e.g., seed label 121 and seed label 123) and the set of related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 124).
- the seed label e.g., seed label 121 and seed label 123

- Related label 122 has been assigned a label weight 722 of a value of "3,” and related label 723 has been assigned a label weight 724 of a value of "2.”
- processing logic assigns various weights as label weights (e.g. label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 723).
- a network administrator assigns various weights as label weights.
- the seed label (e.g., seed label 121) is initially assigned a higher weight than the related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 723), because the seed media item is the initial user selection.
- the seed media item reflects the user's desired media content, and the desire may be appropriately reflected with a larger initial label weight, like label weight 721.
- label weights e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724
- the label weights may be initialized at predetermined values. For example, label weight 721 of seed label 121 may be initialized at a value of "6" while all the label weights of related labels (e.g. label weight 722 of related label 122) are initially assigned a value of "3.”
- Method 500 continues to block 515, wherein processing logic identifies multiple media items associated with an associate label, wherein the associate label includes at least one of the seed label (e.g., seed label 121) or a related label of the first set of labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 723).
- a label e.g. seed label 121 or related label 122
- media items e.g., media item 125 or media item 728, respectively
- the label may be considered an associate label.
- Media items such as videos

- media items 750 are associated with related label 122 (e.g., associate label)
- media items 760 are associated with related label 723 (e.g., associate label).
- Method 500 continues to block 520, wherein processing logic, in one
- media items 740 are associated with seed label 121. Each media item of the multiple media items 740 has a media weight. For example media item 125 has a media weight of "10.” The subsequent individual media items of media items 740 has a media weight 730 value of "7,” media weight 732 value of "6,” and media weight 733 value of "3.”
- the set of media weights e.g., media weight 725, media weight 730, media weight 732, and media weight 733 may be based on popularity, number of "likes" of a community of users, or recent views by a community of users.
- media weights may be based on the user's user history stored.
- processing logic assigns various weights as media weights (e.g., media weight 725, media weight 730, media weight 732, and media weight 733).
- a network administrator assigns various weights as media weights (e.g., media weight 725, media weight 730, media weight 732, and media weight 733).
- Method 500 continues to block 525, wherein processing logic transmits to the user a first media item of the multiple media items with an associate label.
- all the labels e.g., seed label 121, related labels 122, and related label 723 have been associated with media items (e.g., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760,
- Processing logic may choose a media item out of all the media items (e.g., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760) to transmit to the user device.
- processing logic randomly selects a label (e.g., seed label 121, related label 122, or related label 723) and chooses the media item with the highest media weight.
- processing logic selects the label (e.g., seed label 121, related label 122, or related label 723) that has not yet been consumed by the user and selects the media item with the highest weight.
- processing logic more often selects labels with a higher label weight, and selects the media item of the label with the highest weight.
- Method 500 continues to block 530, wherein processing logic adjusts the label weight (e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, or label weight 724) of the associate label (e.g., seed label 121, related label 122, or related label 723) of the first media item based on a user feedback, wherein the user feedback is received from the user device (e.g., user device 110A though user device 110Z) for the first media item.
- the user feedback is received from the user device (e.g., user device 110A though user device 110Z) for the first media item.
- media item 728 under related label 122 e.g., associate label
- label weight 722 is adjusted for the media item 728.
- label weight 722 of related label 122 may be increased from a value of "3" to a value of "4,” an increase of 1.
- label weight 722 of related label 122 may be decreased from a value of "3" to a value of "2,” a decrease of 1.
- label weight 722 of related label 122 may be increased from a value of "3" to a value of "3.33,” an increase of 0.34.
- label weight 722 of related label 122 may be decreased from a value of "3" to a value of "1.66,” a decrease of 0.34.
- different types of user feedback user feedback of different users may increase or decrease the label weight by different values as determined by processing logic.
- processing logic may identify labels that are unrelated to related label 122, but related to the seed label 121 and/or to related label 723. In one implementation, labels with low label weights may be replaced by the second set of related labels. Method 500 continues to block 510, wherein processing logic updates the list to contain the second set of related labels.
- processing logic updates the list of related labels based on the adjusted label weight. In one implementation, processing logic identifies and associates new and additional media items for the updated list of related labels.
- a user may select an initial video (e.g., seed media item), for example, a music video, and create a station based on the initial video.
- the initial video has at least one artist (e.g., a seed label).
- additional related artists e.g., associate labels
- the related artists may be determined by community popularity, recent activity, or by other methods.
- a group or list of artists is generated; the list includes the initial artist and related artists.
- Each of the artists may be assigned a weight (e.g., label weight).
- videos e.g., media items
- These videos may populate the station; and may be considered a baseline or initial set of videos for the station.
- Each of the videos may be assigned a weight (e.g., media weight).
- the feedback may be implicit, explicit, and/or temporal.
- the weights assigned to the artists are adjusted accordingly. For example, if a video receives negative feedback, the weight of the artist associated with the video may decrease. If a video receives positive feedback, the weight of the artist associated with the video may increase.
- the adjusted weight may be more or less. For example, if the feedback is an explicit "like" of a video, it is a strong indication the user actually likes the artist, and the associated artist weight may be adjusted more than if the feedback (e.g. implicit feedback) is a long watch of a video.
- the weights for the artists are adjusted, some artists may be removed from the station and some artists may be added to the station.
- the method presented above may be used iteratively. For example, as new artists populate the station, new videos associated with the new artists may also populate the station. Likewise, when artists are removed from the station, the associated videos of the removed artist may also be removed. As the user continually consumes the videos of a station, feedback is received, label weights are adjusted, and media content of the station adjusted, etc.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for delivering media content to user devices based on user feedback, according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- the method 600 may be performed by processing logic that comprises hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device to perform hardware simulation), or a combination thereof.
- processing logic may perform all or part of the operations of user feedback module 135 to perform all or part of the disclosed method.
- processing logic may perform all or part of the operations of the data store 106 to perform all or part of the disclosed method.
- method 600 begins at block 605 when processing logic receives from a user device (e.g., user device 110A though user device 110Z) feedback on a media item (e.g., media item 728).
- processing logic adjust the label weight 722 of the related label 122 (i.e., associate label, associated with media item 728).
- processing logic compares the adjusted label weight (i.e., label weight 722) of the associate label (i.e., related label 122) to a first threshold value.
- processing logic adds one or more additional labels to the list (e.g., station list) that relate to the associate label (i.e., related label 122).
- the additional labels may be related to the associate label (i.e., related label 122) based on popularity, number of "likes" of a community of users, or recent views by a community of users.
- the additional labels may be related to the associate label (i.e., related label 122) based on the user's user history stored.
- processing logic identifies and associates additional media items for the additional labels. The additional labels are added to the station list of media items.
- method 600 determines whether the adjusted label weight (i.e., label weight 722) of associate label (i.e., related label 122) exceeds the first threshold value.
- method 600 proceeds to block 615 where processing logic compares the cumulative weight of the separate label weights of the list (e.g., station list).
- the list of labels includes seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 723.
- Media items e.g., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760 have been associated with seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 723, respectively.
- seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 723 may be considered associate labels since they have been associated with media items (i.e., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760, respectively).
- Each label e.g., seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 72
- a separate label weight e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724.
- processing logic adjusts the separate label weights (e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724) associated with the consumed media items.
- processing logic takes the cumulative weight of the separate label weights (e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724).
- label weight 721 has a value of "5”
- label weight 722 has a value of "3”
- label weight 724 has a value of "2.”
- processing logic takes the cumulative weight of the related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 723), while leaving out the label weight (e.g., label weight 721) of the seed label (e.g., 121). The cumulative weight is compared to a second threshold value.
- one or more of the related labels are replaced with a second set of related labels.
- the second set of related labels are related or based on the seed label (e.g. seed label 121). For example if the cumulative weight is "10" and the second threshold value is "15,” then processing logic may select a second set of related labels and replace some, all, or none of the related labels in the station list.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating full-rank based feedback, according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- Full-rank based feedback 800 may be used in conjunction with the method 500 and method 600, presented above.
- Processing logic receives a seed media item from a user device (e.g., user device 110A through user device 110Z).
- the seed media item includes a seed label (e.g., seed label 121).
- Processing logic generates a list of labels including the seed label and related labels (e.g., related label 122 and related label 723), the related labels are based on the seed label.
- the processing logic assigns the seed label and the related labels an initial label weight (e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724).
- initial label weight e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724.
- the seed label and the related labels are part of a list, or list of labels, and belong to a user created station.
- Processing logic associates media items (e.g., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760, respectively) with seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 723.
- seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 723 may be considered associate labels since they have been associated with media items (i.e., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760, respectively).
- the media items are included in the station playlist.
- Each label (e.g., seed label 121, related label 122, and related label 72) is initially assigned, by processing logic, a separate label weight (e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724).
- a separate label weight e.g., label weight 721, label weight 722, and label weight 724.
- a full-rank weight for each media item may be calculated.
- Each media item e.g., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760, respectively
- an associated media weight e.g., media weight 725, media weight 730, media weight 732, and media weight 733 for media items 740
- seed label 121 is the associate label for media items 740
- related label 122 is the associate label for media items 750
- related label 723 is the associate label for media items 760.
- the media items may be multiplied by various weights.
- the initial media weight for the media items may be based on popularity, user history, or other criteria. Additionally, in Figure 8, the media weight of media items 740 are multiplied by the label weight 721 of their associated label, seed label 121. For example, media weight 725 with a value of "10" is multiplied by label weight 721 with a value of "5" to generate full-rank media weight 825 with a value of "50.” In one implementation, every media item of station (e.g., media items 740, media items 750, and media items 760) may have a full-rank media weight (e.g., full- rank media weight 825).
- a full-rank media weight e.g., full- rank media weight 825.
- a full-rank weight for each media item may be calculated using various different weights.
- the label weight (e.g., label weight 722) of the associate label (e.g., related label 122) is adjusted based on a temporal relation to the user feedback. Adjusting label weight based on a temporal relation may occur, for example, when feedback is received within 30 minutes of the current time. Such feedback has a positive temporal relation and may be weighed more heavily than feedback received outside of 30 minutes from the current time (i.e., negative temporal feedback).
- temporal weight 880 with a value of "2” may be multiplied with label weight 722 with a value of "3,” generating a value of "6.”
- Temporal weight 880 with a value of "2” may be multiplied with label weight 722 with a value of "3,” and be further multiplied with the media weights (e.g., media weight 726) to generate a full-rank media weight (e.g., full-rank media weight 826).
- media item 728 with media weight 726 with value of "9” may be multiplied by label weight 722 with a value of "3,” and multiplied by temporal weight 880 with a value of "2,” to generate a full-rank media weight 826 with a value of "54" for media item 728.
- a list of all the media items that have a full-rank may be listed in full-rank media item list 810.
- full-rank based feedback allows for a single ranked list of media items.
- processing logic may choose media items from the full-rank media item list 810 to transmit to a user device (e.g., user device 110A through 110Z) based on the highest full-rank media weight (e.g., full-rank media weight 825).
- some or all of the label weights of the list may be adjusted by a temporal relation to user feedback. In another implementation, some or all of the label weights of a list may be adjusted by other criteria such as user history, lists of other stations created by the user, etc.
- the media item may be other types of media content that can be consumed (e.g., view, watch, listen, hear, or read) by a user such as radio, documents, books, news feeds, photos, etc.
- labels may be sub-artists (e.g., the Beatles at different musical periods), genre (e.g., classical), sub-category of artists (e.g., parodies of Lady Gaga), news programs, political programs, sources of news, sports programs, sub-categories of each, eras, styles, hot tracks, etc.
- a user may create a station with a label for football videos, or for fashion videos, or photos of craftsman-style architecture, etc.
