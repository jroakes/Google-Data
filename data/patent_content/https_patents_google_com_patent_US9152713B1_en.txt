Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to web page searches, and more particularly, to finding web pages relevant to a stream of information.
- a stream of information such as a stream of text or a multimedia stream.
- radio and television news broadcasts provide a one-way stream of information to the viewers.
- Telephone calls, meetings, simple conversations with others, web browsing, desktop productivity applications e.g. word processing, presentation generation, and email applications, etc.
- desktop productivity applications e.g. word processing, presentation generation, and email applications, etc.
- people using this information could benefit from supplemental information related to the topics that are being discussed.
- the World Wide Web presents a convenient source of supplemental information. Supplementing television broadcasts is particularly attractive due to the passive nature of television viewing. Interaction is severely constrained, usually limited to just changing the channel. There is no real way for the viewer to direct what kind of information will be presented.
- HTML hyper-text markup language
- URLs in an alternative data channel interleaved with closed caption data.
- a specially equipped box detects one of these URLs, it displays an icon on the screen through which the viewer may direct the box to fetch the corresponding web page over the Internet.
- Systems and methods consistent with the present invention find documents relevant to a multimedia stream by forming a search query based on the stream and using the search query to access a search engine.
- One aspect of the invention is directed to a method of locating documents relevant to a media stream.
- the method includes generating search queries from a text stream corresponding to the media stream, receiving documents relevant to the media stream based on the search queries, and associating the received documents and the media stream together for presentation to a user.
- a second aspect of the invention is directed to a device that includes at least one display device for simultaneously presenting a multimedia stream and a web document related to topics in the multimedia stream.
- the device further includes a query generation component configured to periodically generate search queries based on a content of the multimedia stream.
- the search queries result in a set of ranked web documents related to topics in the multimedia stream.
- a post processing component re-ranks the set of web documents based on relevance to the multimedia stream.
- the system includes a text converter, a query generation component, a search engine, and a display device.
- the text converter convert the media stream into a corresponding stream of text.
- the query generation component generates search queries from the stream of text.
- the search engine generates a set of documents relevant to the stream of text based on the search queries, where the set of documents are ranked according to relevance.
- the display device displays highest ranking ones of the set of documents to a user of the media stream.

- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a stem vector
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating another search query generation technique.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating post processing via filtering.
- a media stream is supplemented with external documents, such as web pages, relevant to the media stream.
- the external documents are gathered based on search queries derived from the content of the media stream.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system in which concepts consistent with the invention may be implemented.
- System 100 may include a network 101 , such as the Internet. Numerous entities may be connected to network 101 , two of which are shown in FIG. 1 : search engine 110 and user device 120 .
- Search engine 110 may index and provide search services for a collection of documents.
- the documents may be, for example, a collection of web pages publicly available on the world wide web. Such a collection of web pages may include approximately one billion or more web pages.
- search engine 110 may receive search queries, and based on the search queries, return a set of web pages or a set of links to web pages that the search engine 110 determines are relevant to the search query.
- the web pages in the returned set may be ranked by the search engine so that the web pages more relevant to the search query are given a higher rank than less relevant web pages.
- Search engines 110 are generally known in the art, and thus, the operation of search engine 110 will not be described in additional detail.
- User device 120 may generally denote an end user device that presents/operates on a media stream, such as a multimedia stream.
- the media stream may be, for example, a television or radio broadcast.
- a television broadcast is illustrated.
- system 100 may include multiple user devices 120 , only one is shown for descriptive clarity.
- a user may view the television signal on a conventional television 121 .
- the television signal may also be input to a computing device 122 , such as a personal computer, which converts the signal to a stream of text.
- computing device 122 may, for example, extract closed caption information from the signal to obtain the text stream.
- computing device 122 may query search engine 110 for documents relevant to the television broadcast. These documents may be displayed on display device 123 .
- Display device 123 may be, for example, a conventional computer monitor.
- the user may thus simultaneously (or with a few seconds delay) experience the television broadcast through television 121 and browse web pages that supplement the information in the television broadcast.
- the web pages may automatically update as the television broadcast progresses. If the user is particularly interested in a particular web page, computing device 122 may allow the user to select the web page for further viewing or archiving.
- multimedia or textual documents stored locally may be supplemented with web documents.
- text from (or generated from) a file or a textual stream generated by a user typing a document may be supplemented with web documents.
- the textual stream may be obtained from a user's direct input, such as via a keyboard, or may be based on a user's selection of portions of a document, such as highlighting of a portion of the document.
- the location of the input cursor or mouse pointer within a portion of a document or file can be used to generate a source of information (e.g. a word, a sentence, a paragraph, an entire document, etc.) to be supplemented via the methods described in other aspects of the present invention.
- a source of information e.g. a word, a sentence, a paragraph, an entire document, etc.
- television 121 and display device 123 are illustrated as two separate components in FIG. 1 , in operation, the television broadcast may be displayed next to the supplemental web documents on a single monitor.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating functional components that may be used to supplement multimedia broadcasts consistent with an aspect of the invention.
- a multimedia source 201 may provide a media stream that is received by a user 120 .
- the media stream may be converted to a textual stream by text converter 221 .
- Text converter 221 may be implemented in a number of ways depending on the type of multimedia broadcast. For television broadcasts, for example, text converter 221 may get a corresponding textual stream from the closed-caption information in the television signal. Alternatively, text converter 221 may use automated speech recognition techniques to convert audio information from television or radio broadcasts to text.
- “multimedia source” 120 may be, for example, a local hard drive or a stream of information received from the user.
- Query generation component 222 derives search queries from the textual stream.
- the goal of query generation component 222 is to generate queries relevant to the topics contained in the textual stream. Such queries may be generated periodically, such as every 15 seconds, from the text received in the previous period. In this manner, a series of search queries, each relevant to the current topic in the multimedia stream, are generated.
- the generated search queries may be input to a search engine 110 , which, as previously mentioned, may index documents (i.e., web pages) on the world wide web. Search engine 110 may thus return a list of URLs (links) that point to web pages.
- the search results from search engine 110 can the be used to retrieve the corresponding documents from their host locations (e.g., from servers on the web). In some implementations, search engine 110 could also store the actual documents as well as an indexed version of the documents.
- the set of documents retrieved based on the results of search engine 110 may be processed by post processing component 223 and then displayed to a user on display component 224 .
- Post processing component 223 filters the returned documents so that ideally, only relevant and non-redundant documents are displayed to the user.
- Display component 224 may correspond to television 121 and/or display device 123 .
- Display component 224 may include, for example, a television, personal computer, or a combination of both a television and a personal computer. Through display component 224 , a user may view the original media stream and simultaneously view the documents from post processing component 223 . For example, a user may watch a news broadcast on television and simultaneously view web pages that supplement topics discussed in the news broadcast. The displayed web pages may change as the news broadcast progresses. Web pages of particular interest may be selected by the user for further viewing.
- query generation component 222 and post processing component 223 may be implemented by computing device 122 . In other implementations, one or both of these components may be implemented externally to user device 120 , such as at search engine 110 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating methods of operating the functional components shown in FIG. 2 .
- text converter 211 converts the media stream to a stream of text (Act 301 ).
- search queries are periodically generated (Acts 302 and 303 ).
- the stream of text generated during the s seconds is labeled as text segment T.
- a search query based on segment T (and possibly based on previous segments T) would be generated every s seconds.
- Each search query may be input to search engine 110 , which returns a list of references to potentially relevant documents (Act 304 ).
- the list may be sorted based on a determination by the search engine of the relevancy or importance of the documents.
- the list may be used to retrieve the set of actual documents (Act 305 ). A maximum number of documents from the list, such as 15, may be retrieved.
- search engine 110 may perform Acts 304 and 305 , thus returning the set of actual documents.
- Post processing component 223 may filter the set of relevant documents to return a set number of the most relevant documents (e.g., the two most relevant documents) (Act 306 ). Post processing component 223 may perform other functions, such as removing redundant documents from the set.
- the most relevant documents may be displayed to the user simultaneously (or after a slight delay) with the broadcast signal.
- query generation component 222 derives search queries from text segments T.
- the search query may include terms in segment T that define the topic being discussed. Consistent with an aspect of the invention, a number of techniques are possible for generating such queries. These techniques will now be described. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that variations on the techniques described below, or combinations of these techniques, may also be used.
- the inverse document frequency (idf) of a term is defined as a function of the frequency f of the term in a collection and the number N of documents in the collection.
- the collection may refer to the set of web pages (documents) indexed by the search engine. More specifically, the idf may be defined as
- N may be equal to approximately 1 billion documents.
- frequency f may refer to the frequency of occurrence of terms in the text stream instead of a collection of web pages.
- the media stream is a television broadcast
- some words may have a low idf for the television broadcast and a high idf in the document collection indexed by the search engine.
- examples of such words are “reporter” and “analyst.”
- these words tend to be relatively common in television news broadcasts but relatively uncommon in the document collection indexed by the search engine. Accordingly, in the baseline technique, and in the other techniques described below, these terms are ignored in the text segments T.
- the baseline technique is based on the formula: tf ⁇ idf, (1) where tf is the frequency of the term in the text segment T
- tf is the frequency of the term in the text segment T
- Each term in the text segment T has its baseline value computed using formula (1).
- a predetermined number of the terms with the highest value are returned as the search query. For example, the two terms in text segment T with the highest values may be used as the search query.
- query generation component 222 gives distinctive terms more weight than common terms. Terms used multiple times are given more weight than terms used once.
- a variation on formula (1) may use just tf in calculating the term values.
- Other variations may use a combination of the idf computed based on web documents and the text stream.
- Query generation component 222 applies the modified baseline technique similarly to the baseline technique, except that the following formula is substituted for formula (1): tf ⁇ idf 2 . (2)
- the motivation here is that rare words, such as named entities, are particularly important for issuing focused queries. Thus, idf is more important than tf.
- query generation component 222 assigns each term in text segment T a weight.
- A3-STEM instead assigns a weight to each stem, where the stem of a term is approximated by taking the first five letters of the word. For example, congress and legislative would share the same stem, congr. In this manner, the weight of terms that describe the same thing are aggregated.
- More or fewer than five letters could be used to define a stem.
- other techniques can be used to define stems. For example, known programs exist for finding stems and could be used.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating the A3-STEM technique in additional detail.
- query generation component 222 may calculate the weight of each term in the text segment T (Act 401 ).
- the weight may be computed as: c ⁇ tf ⁇ idf 2 , (3) where c is equal to one if the term is a noun and 0.5 otherwise. Using the factor c tends to emphasize nouns, which are often more useful for formulating focused queries.
- the terms may then be grouped based on their corresponding stems (Act 402 ). That is, terms with the same stems are assigned to the same group.
- a weight can then be calculated for each group as the sum of the weights of all the terms in the group (Act 403 ). Functions other than a sum may alternatively be used to combine the weights of the terms in a group to find a weight for the group.
- query generation component 222 sorts the groups based on their weight.
- the top X groups where X is a positive integer (e.g., two), having the highest weights are selected as groups from which terms for the search query may be selected (Act 404 ).
- the term within the group that has the largest weight is selected to represent that group in the search query (Act 405 ). In this manner, the search query will contain X terms, selected as one term corresponding to each of the most relevant stems.
- stems are extended to also include two word compounds.
- Stems may be built not only for one word terms, but also for two word terms.
- Compound stems are computed by stemming both terms in the compound. For example, the compound “veterans administration” has the stem “veter-admin.”
- Compound stems may be constructed for any two adjacent terms that are in a predefined list of possible compounds. This list of allowed compounds can be compiled from the documents in the document collection indexed by the search engine. In particular, terms that occur frequently together, such as “veterans administration,” may be classified as a possible compound.
- Compounds may be located through techniques other than stemming. For example, for each word, a list of all compounds containing that word could be stored.
- the compounds are treated like terms in the methods shown in FIG. 4 , with the exception that c in formula (3) may be modified for compounds.
- c may be set to one if the term is a non-compound noun, 1.2 if the term is a compound, and 0.5 otherwise.
- the resultant query may contain more than X terms.
- the resultant query may contain two, three, or four words.
- Compounds located in a text segment T can be used in techniques other than A3-STEM, such as A1-BASE.
- This technique is similar to A4-COMP but also includes a history feature.
- the previously discussed technique used the current text segment T when generating the search query.
- A5-HIST may use, in addition to the current text segment T, previous text segments.
- the rationale for this technique is that context leading up to the current text segment T may contain terms that are still valuable in generating the query.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a stem vector 500 .
- Stem vector 500 corresponds to the stem groups generated in technique A3-STEM for a particular text segment.
- Technique A4-COMP may alternatively be used to generate the stem groups.
- stem vector 500 includes one or more stems, stem 1 through stemN 501 , (which correspond to the groups generated in A3-STEM or A4-COMP).
- Each stem 501 includes a corresponding weight W 1 through W N 502 .
- weights 502 can be calculated for each stem 501 as the sum of the weights of all the terms in the group.
- Terms 503 and corresponding weights 504 for each term in each of stems 501 , may also be stored in stem vector 500 .
- Query generation component 222 may store stem vectors corresponding to the current text segment T and also a number of previous text segments. For example, the three most previous text segments may be used.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating the A5-HIST technique in detail.
- query generation component 222 may build stem vectors 500 corresponding to the current text segment T and the previous three text segments (Act 601 ). That is, in this implementation, four stem vectors 500 are used.
- the use of the three previous text segments as history information can be modified in other implementations to be more or less than three.
- the stem vectors corresponding to the three previous text segments are summed (Act 602 ) to form a stem vector labeled StemVectorOld.
- the stem vectors may be expanded to have the same stems and terms by suitably adding missing stems and terms with a weight of zero. Then, the two vectors are added by adding the corresponding weights of the stems and of the terms.
- Query generation component 622 may then compute a similarity score, s, between StemVectorOld and the current stem vector (Act 603 ).
- the similarity score may be computed as the dot-product of StemVectorOld and the current stem vector in which only the weights of the terms are used and the weights of the stems are ignored.
- the similarity score s calculated in Act 603 may then be used to classify StemVectorOld as either similar, somewhat similar, or dissimilar to the current stem vector (Act 604 ).
- a “similar” similarity score implies that the topic has stayed the same. Accordingly, it is appropriate to use previous text segments in calculating the search query.
- a “somewhat similar” similarity score implies that the topic may be changing. The previous text segments are still used in calculating the search query, but the influence of the previous text segments is deemphasized.
- a “dissimilar” similarity score indicates that the topic has changed and the previous text segments are not used to generate the search query.
- the determination of whether the similarity score is “similar,” “somewhat similar,” or “dissimilar” may be based on comparison of the similarity score s to threshold levels a 1 and a 2 . If the similarity score is above a 1 , then text segment T is considered to be similar. If the similarity score is between a 1 and a 2 , then text segment T is considered to be somewhat similar. If the similarity score is below a 2 , then text segment T is considered to be dissimilar.
- the thresholds a 1 and a 2 may be selected based on an empirical analysis of the media broadcasts. For example, in one implementation, a 1 is set at 0.001 and a 2 is set at 0.0003.
- StemVectorOld may be “aged” by multiplying every weight by a factor, such as 0.9.
- the factor 0.9 is not critical and may be adjusted up or down (Act 605 ).
- StemVectorOld may be aged by multiplying by a factor less than the factor used when text segment T is similar (Act 606 ).
- this factor may be based on s, such as 0.9 2-(1000)s .
- the factor used in Act 606 will be less than 0.9, i.e., the weights are more decreased than in the case when T is similar to the previous text segments.
- the aged version of StemVectorOld that is calculated in Acts 605 or 606 may next be added to the current stem vector to create a new stem vector (Act 607 ).
- StemVectorOld When text segment T is dissimilar, StemVectorOld is ignored and the current stem vector is used as the new stem vector (Act 608 ). Stated differently, in this situation, the weights in StemVectorOld may be reset to zero, and then StemVectorOld may be added to the current stem vector as in Act 607 .
- the new stem vector formed in Acts 605 - 608 may then be used to determine the search query in a manner similar to the search query formed in Acts 404 and 405 of the simple stemming technique. That is, query generation component 222 may find the X stems that have the largest weight in the new stem vector (Act 609 ). X may have a value of two. For each of these top X stems, the term within the stem that has the largest weight is selected to represent that stem in the search query (Act 610 ).
- the specific history technique described above uses previous text segments as well as the current text segment to generate a search query.
- the general idea is that text segments from the recent past may be useful in formulating the current search query.
- Other history-based techniques to generate search queries may also be used.
- technique A1-BASE may be applied to the above history-based technique to generate search queries without using stemming.
- the previous search query generation techniques generate queries with two to four terms (i.e., X is generally set at two or more).
- One term queries are often not specific enough, returning a wide variety of results that are mostly not relevant.
- the query shortening technique may operate to reduce the length of search queries that are too specific.
- search generation component 222 may initially generate a search query using any of the previously described five search query generation techniques. If the search query returns no results, search generation component 222 shortens and reissues the search query. In particular, for an initial three or more term query that returns no results, the search generation component 222 may remove the lower weighted terms in the query to return the top-weighted terms and then reissue the query.
- queries can be logically ORed to shorten multiple queries with common terms.
- A7-IDF may be identical to A5-HIST, with idf 2 replaced by idf.
- post processing component 223 enhances the quality of the search results.
- One way post processing component 223 performs this is by examining the search results, and if a result is a duplicate or near duplicate of one that has already been presented to the user, it selects the next result in the ranking
- Another way that post processing component 223 can enhance search results is by re-ranking the returned search results to more closely correspond to the text segment.
- post processing component 223 may only operate based on titles and summaries of the documents. Search engine 110 may return the titles and summaries as part of normal search result generation. In other implementations, post processing component 223 may fetch the entire documents for all of the search results.
- the post processing techniques performed by post processing component may include boosting, similarity ranking, and filtering. These techniques can be used in conjunction with one another. For example, returned documents can be boosted and then filtered. Each of these techniques is described further below.
- Search engine 110 may get a two word query and does not know anything else about the text stream.
- the idea behind boosting is to use additional high-weighted terms to select the most relevant documents from the search results.
- post processing component 223 receives the search query from query generation component 222 . Additionally, query generation component 222 transmits additional terms to post processing component 223 outside of the X terms in the search query. For example, if X is equal to two, query generation component 222 may use the top two terms for the search query but return the top X+three (five) terms to post processing component 223 . The three additional terms and their weights are referred to as boost terms and boost values herein.
- post processing component 223 re-ranks the documents returned from the search by computing a weight for each result based on the boost terms.
- the weight for the document may be incremented by the value (idf ⁇ 4f)/(f+3).
- the weight may be further incremented for boost terms in the title according to the formula (idf ⁇ 8f)/(f+3).
- the documents may then be re-ordered based on their incremented weights.
- post processing component 223 may refine the returned document rankings by perform a similarity ranking of the current text segment T relative to the text of the returned documents.
- post processing component 223 may estimate similarity by generating a similarity vector for the current text segment Tin which each term of the text segment T is assigned a weight according to: tf ⁇ idf, where, as in the baseline technique, tf is the frequency of the term in the text segment T and idf is the inverse document frequency.
- Post processing component 223 also generates a similarity vector for each term in one of the returned documents (or, in some implementations, for the first 500 terms of the returned document). Based on these two vectors, a similarity value is calculated as the dot product of the two vectors.
- a similarity value may be similarly calculated for each of the returned documents and the returned documents ranked by these similarity values.
- Post processing component 223 may filter returned documents to remove documents that are dissimilar to the current text segment T. Additionally, when the issued search query is too vague, the top returned documents are often very dissimilar. Thus, in this situation also, post processing component 223 may filter returned documents to discard such documents unless they are highly similar to the text segment T.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary filtering technique in additional detail.
- Post processing component 223 may begin by calculating a similarity score, s 1 (d), between the current text segment T and a document d (Act 701 ).
- the similarity score between the text segment T and the current document is calculated as described above in the similarity re-ranking technique. That is, a weighted term vector is constructed for the text segment and the document in which the weights are based on tf ⁇ idf. The dot-product of the two vectors is taken to generate the similarity score.
- s 1 (d) is below a threshold b
- the document is discarded (Acts 702 and 703 ). This indicates that the document d is not similar enough to the text segment.
- the threshold b may be set at, for example, 0.1. Acts 701 - 703 may be repeated for each document in the returned set of relevant documents (Act 704 ).
- the top two documents may additionally be compared to one another to determine if these documents are dissimilar to one another.
- post processing component 223 computes a second similarity score, s 2 , between these two documents.
- the second similarity score s 2 may be computed as the dot-product of the two vectors formed from the two documents (Act 706 ). Assume that these two documents are called d 1 and d 2 . If s 2 is less than a second threshold, p, and the similarity score s 1 (d 1 ) for the first document of the pair is less than a third threshold, g, then the first document d 1 may be discarded (Acts 707 - 709 ).
- s 2 is less than p and the similarity score s 1 (d 2 ) is less than g, then document d 2 may be discarded (Acts 710 and 711 ).
- p may be equal to 0.35 and g may be set equal to 0.3.
- the thresholds b, p, and g may be predetermined thresholds based on an empirical analysis of a test document set.
- web pages can be found based on a text stream typed in by a user, such as a user typing a document in a word processing program, highlighting or selecting text or multimedia information from within a file, or using a local search tool (e.g. using the “find” feature in a word processing application or a local information search application such as the “search” feature of Windows Explorer or Internet Explorer).
- a local search tool e.g. using the “find” feature in a word processing application or a local information search application such as the “search” feature of Windows Explorer or Internet Explorer.
- the information to be supplemented may be based on content extracted or derived from a file or other means other than direct user input.
- a user writing a research paper utilizing a word processing tool may be presented with supplemental information related to the topic on which she is writing, or a user creating a presentation may be presented with images or “clip art” suitable for including in the presentation.
- a search engine geared to returning current news articles or a web page containing news articles. Television broadcasts could be automatically annotated off-line with news articles from the search engine and stored. Users reading the news articles returned by the search engine may be presented with multimedia links to the television broadcasts.
Abstract
Description
Higher idf values indicate that a term is relatively more important than a term with a lower idf value. For a web search engine, N may be equal to approximately 1 billion documents. In other implementations, frequency f may refer to the frequency of occurrence of terms in the text stream instead of a collection of web pages.
tf·idf, (1)
where tf is the frequency of the term in the text segment T Each term in the text segment T has its baseline value computed using formula (1). A predetermined number of the terms with the highest value are returned as the search query. For example, the two terms in text segment T with the highest values may be used as the search query.
tf·idf2. (2)
The motivation here is that rare words, such as named entities, are particularly important for issuing focused queries. Thus, idf is more important than tf.
c·tf·idf2, (3)
where c is equal to one if the term is a noun and 0.5 otherwise. Using the factor c tends to emphasize nouns, which are often more useful for formulating focused queries.
tf·idf,
where, as in the baseline technique, tf is the frequency of the term in the text segment T and idf is the inverse document frequency.
