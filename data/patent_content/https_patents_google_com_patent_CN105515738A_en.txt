For some application comprising voice, divide into groups to arrive with the speed of relative constancy.For such as VoIP application, vocoder frame can arrive by approximately every 20ms.Refer again to Fig. 3, for VoIP application, vocoder frame can from the section start of long frame being numbered 0, and approximately every 20ms arrives.Base station is added header data to vocoder frame and is encoded to form packets of voice to this frame.Base station is modulated the symbol at least partially that comprises this packets of voice subsequently and in the long frame being numbered 0, the symbol at least partially comprising this packets of voice is transmitted into mobile radio station.This transmission is called as the first transmission.
The mobile radio station receiving this grouping by trial to this packet decoding to obtain voice messaging.If mobile radio station successfully transmits to from first the packets of voice decoding obtained, then this mobile radio station will send response (ACK) message to base station.After receiving ACK, any additional information will not be launched in base station, that is, in long frame 3,6 and 9, will not retransmit packets of voice to mobile radio station.In fact, mobile radio station assignments field, such as assignments field 510, allow other mobile radio stations to use these resources.But if mobile radio station can not successfully to packets of voice decoding, then mobile radio station sends negative response (NACK) message to base station.
After receiving NACK message, base station sends additional packets of voice symbol by the long frame being numbered 3 to mobile radio station.This is called as the second transmission.If mobile radio station is successfully to packets of voice decoding after the second transmission, then mobile radio station can send ACK message to base station.After receiving this ACK message, base station will to be avoided any additional information transmitting in long frame 6 and 9 to mobile radio station.But if mobile radio station is decoded to this packets of voice with failing, then mobile radio station will send NACK message to base station, and responsively, base station will send additional packets of voice symbol in the long frame being numbered 6 in the 3rd transmission.
Similarly, depend on the successful decoding of mobile radio station to the 3rd transmission, mobile radio station can send ACK or NACK message, and for NACK message, base station, by the long frame being numbered 9, sends additional packets of voice symbol in the 4th transmission.Again, depend on the successful decoding of mobile radio station to this grouping, mobile radio station can send ACK or NACK message.
Fig. 8 describes the moment be in time after the example shown in Fig. 7, is namely numbered the snapshot of the long frame of 3, and the situation wherein shown in Fig. 7 is the snapshot of the long frame being numbered 0.Therefore in the figure 7, after long frame 0, MS
3may have sent NACK message, and MS
6and MS
7may have sent ACK message.Based on the quene state of ACK and the NACK message received and each mobile radio station about group 830, in the long frame being numbered 3, base station mobile radio station can be used to assign and size field 850 to MS
3distribute two blocks, to MS
14distribute two blocks and to MS
17distribute four blocks.Based on mobile radio station assignment and size field 850, as shown, the mobile radio station of group 830 is assigned resource 810.
In mixing voice and data system, movable voice and data mobile station may be there is simultaneously.Due to the statistic multiplexing attribute be associated with VoIP business, may exist in each Scheduling instances not by system resource that voip user uses.Such as, if non-instruct MS
17be movable, then the 5th, the 6th, the 7th and the 8th shared resource will be untapped.Monitor that any mobile radio station of shared control channel can calculate this load variations.Therefore, in certain embodiments, mobile radio station can assign to not by those resources that group uses by base station.In order to determine the mobile radio station assignment in each VoIP image duration, mobile station monitors shared control channel and its resource is defined as the resource being not yet assigned to group members.For the situation that long frame is made up of multiple frame, resource can not used to different data users assignment in each frame.And a more than mobile radio station can be assigned to and not use resource.Such as, if there is Z not use resource, then the first mobile radio station can be assigned and initial N number of available not use resource, and the second mobile radio station can be assigned ensuing Z-N and not use resource, wherein Z>=N.
Alternatively, instruction can share and not use the mobile radio station of resource equally to divide not use resource.In another interchangeable method, can use the deviant that do not use resource available relative to first by instructs mobile station, wherein this deviant is used for this mobile radio station being pointed to its assignment.This allows for sharing any assignment not using each mobile radio station of resource.When available do not use resource be less than required for supporting the resource of specific mobile radio station time, in this long frame, this mobile radio station is not assigned with any resource.Such as, if deviant points to the shared resource exceeding the end of shared resource set, then in this long frame, any resource is not distributed to this specific mobile radio station.
As described, utilize mobile radio station assignment and the size field of two bits for each mobile radio station in each long frame, the assignment of this mobile radio station and size field may need unexpected system resource allocation for shared control channel, such as power, OFDM subcarrier or OFDM symbol.Therefore, in certain embodiments, by setting up the predetermined relation between mobile radio station group position and mobile radio station HARQ transmission chance, such shared control channel expense can be reduced.Fig. 9 describes the example of this predetermined relation according to each embodiment.
In the illustrative embodiment of Fig. 9, original Mobile Station group is further subdivided into four subgroups, wherein assigns specific sequence to each subgroup for its HARQ transmission chance.Therefore Fig. 9 describes two coding groups continued, and it is represented as grouping N909 and grouping N+1911, and wherein N is positive integer.Therefore as shown, base station can be defined in the first, second, third and fourth HARQ transmission chance of the grouping N for subgroup 0901 occurred in the long frame being numbered 0,3,6 and 9 respectively.Similarly, as shown, base station can be defined in second, third and the 4th HARQ transmission chance of the grouping N for subgroup 1903 occurred in the long frame being numbered 0,3,6 and 9 and the first HARQ transmission chance of grouping N+1 respectively.
As shown in Figure 9, this process is repeated for subgroup 2905 and 3907.For follow-up grouping, the particular sequence of HARQ transmission chance repeats with known interval, such as, repeats in each superframe as shown in Figure 9.Based on the relation between set up subgroup and HARQ transmission chance, mobile radio station can be assigned to subgroup by the mode of any system by base station, as long as all mobile radio stations in this group are had gained some understanding to it.
Such as, be the mobile radio station group of " K " for size, base station can define first K/4 group position and belong to K/4 group position, 0, second, subgroup and belong to K/4 group position, the 1, three, subgroup and belong to subgroup 2, and last K/4 group position belongs to subgroup 3.
The predetermined relation importantly understood between group position and HARQ transmission chance enables the HARQ transmission chance of the every other member in each mobile radio station priori knowledge group in group.Can on a control channel by this predetermined relation from Base Transmitter to mobile radio station, or by this predetermined relational storage at mobile radio station place, such as, can to store in memory.
In certain embodiments, with the order corresponding to defined HARQ transmission chance by Resourse Distribute to subgroup.Such as, be indicated as movable in shared control channel and there is the mobile radio station of their the first HARQ transmission chance in current long frame, first can be assigned with in shared resource set.Be indicated as movable in shared control channel and there is the mobile radio station of their the second HARQ transmission chance in current long frame, can in shared resource set second be assigned with, etc.
If subgroup corresponds to continuous print group location sets, described above, wherein first K/4 group position corresponds to subgroup 0, second K/4 group position corresponds to subgroup 1 etc., then this can be regarded as rotating bitmap in a circulating manner, first bit map location corresponds to the first mobile radio station in group thus, defines the first HARQ transmission chance for the first mobile radio station in this group.The instruction that bitmap rotates from Base Transmitter to mobile radio station, or can be stored in mobile radio station place by the instruction that can be rotated by bitmap on a control channel.
Figure 10 and Figure 11 describes the exemplary allocation policy of each embodiment with continuity bitmap field 540.Figure 11 hypothesis locate in time moment after example shown in Figure 10, be namely numbered 3 the snapshot of long frame, the situation wherein shown in Figure 10 is the snapshot of the long frame being numbered 0.
Therefore, in the example of Figure 10, mobile radio station assignment and size field 1050 indicate the block number of each mobile radio station distributing to group 1030, and wherein binary system " 00 " corresponds to not transmission, " 01 " corresponding to a block, " 10 " corresponding to two blocks and " 11 " corresponding to four blocks.Continuity field 1060 provides individual bit, and a block is distributed to mobile radio station by the instruction of this individual bit.Rotating bitmap as described above for guaranteeing that the mobile radio station of the first HARQ transmission chance with them is by first Resources allocation, has the mobile radio station of their the second HARQ transmission chance by second Resources allocation, etc.
With reference to Figure 10, eight mobile radio stations are assigned to group 1030 and are assigned group position 1 to 8.Mobile radio station 3 (MS
3) be assigned group position 1, MS
6be assigned group position 2, MS
7be assigned group position 3, MS
9be assigned group position 4, MS
10be assigned group position 5, MS
13be assigned group position 6, MS
14be assigned group position 7 and MS
17be assigned group position 8.
Group position 1 and 2 is assigned to subgroup 0, and group position 3 and 4 is assigned to subgroup 1, and group position 5 and 6 is assigned to subgroup 2, and group position 7 and 8 is assigned to subgroup 3.Relation between subgroup and HARQ transmission chance is similar to the relation shown in Fig. 9.Except assignment positional information, the instruction of shared resource set 1010 and the sequencing model 1070 of assignment are launched to group 1030 in base station, and the sequencing model 1070 of assignment indicates the order of Resources allocation 1010.Can on a control channel by this information from Base Transmitter to mobile radio station.

3can determine that it is first mobile radio station being assigned with resource and due to binary system " 10 ", so it is assigned two blocks.Therefore, MS
3determine as its Resourse Distribute shown in 1010.Similarly, MS
6can determine that it is second mobile radio station being assigned with resource, it is assigned four blocks.MS
6determine previously to be assigned with two blocks and therefore determine as its distribution shown in resource 1010.MS
7therefore determine that it is the 3rd mobile radio station being assigned with resource, and determine to it is assigned a block according to continuity field 1060.Owing to being previously assigned with six blocks, therefore MS
7determine as its distribution shown in resource 1010.Due to MS in continuity field 1060
9and MS
10not movable, therefore MS
13determine that it is the 4th mobile radio station being assigned with resource, and therefore determine to it is assigned a block.MS
13determine previously to be assigned with seven Resource Block and therefore determine as its distribution shown in resource 1010.

6may have sent ACK message to base station, and MS
3and MS
13may have sent NACK message.And base station may have will to such as MS
14and MS
17the new grouping of launching.Therefore base station will send mobile radio station assignment and size field 1150, and pointer is to subgroup 3, namely for MS
14and MS
17first transmission size.Therefore base station uses mobile radio station assignment and size field 1150 couples of MS
14send " 10 " (2 blocks) and to MS
17send " 11 " (four blocks).Base station also uses continuity field 1160 to carry out pointer to MS
3and MS
13continuity transmission (1 block).
