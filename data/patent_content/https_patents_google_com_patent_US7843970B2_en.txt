Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to a wireless communication system and, more specifically, to techniques for generating and detecting a physical random access channel signal in a wireless communication system.
- a physical random access channel is a contention-based channel that has been implemented in various wireless communication systems for initial uplink (UL) transmission.
- PRACH physical random access channel
- a particular PRACH implementation is dependent on the technology employed by an associated wireless communication system.
- a PRACH can be used to access a network, request resources, carry control information, adjust a time offset of a UL, and/or adjust transmitted power.
- the PRACH may experience collisions when different user equipment (UE) attempts to simultaneously utilize the PRACH.
- UE user equipment
- a system may employ a preamble (which is a short signal that is typically sent prior to a transmission of an associated message) for a PRACH access.
- a PRACH access may include a transmission of a preamble (that is selected from a set of preambles) and a subsequent transmission of an associated message.
- a PRACH In a long-term evolution (LTE) compliant wireless communication system, a PRACH only includes a preamble.
- LTE long-term evolution
- a UE may persist in sending a preamble (at least for a predetermined number of times) until the UE receives an acquisition indicator (AI) or a random access response message from a serving base station (BS) that indicates the BS correctly detected the preamble.
- AI acquisition indicator
- BS serving base station
- a positive AI or a positive random access response message is received by a UE, a subsequent transmission of an associated message is contention free, except where multiple UEs have transmitted the same PRACH signal substantially simultaneously (in which case collision resolution is needed).
- a UE is informed, via a broadcast channel (BCH), which access slots the UE can use for a PRACH.
- BCH broadcast channel
- downlink (DL) power is measured (e.g., from the BCH) and an initial transmit power is computed from the measurement.
- the preamble does not include the identity of a transmitting UE. If a BS successfully detects the preamble, the BS sends back a random access response message that includes a replica of the preamble, an indication, and resources reserved for uplink (UL) transmission if the indication is positive.
- a high-speed PRACH in an LTE compliant wireless communication system employs a relatively complicated waveform.
- An LTE PRACH occupies seventy-two tones at 15 kHz in the frequency-domain and a time-period in the time-domain that is based on a format of the PRACH signal.
- an LTE PRACH signal that employs format ‘0’ has a time duration of about 0.8 milliseconds.
- many PRACH waveforms may be possible.
- PRACH waveform generation at a UE and PRACH waveform detection at a serving BS has conventionally been highly complex.
- the receiver 100 receives multiple baseband (BB) signals (i.e., via antennas 1 to M).
- BB baseband
- a BB signal from antenna 1 may be processed using a 12288-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) block 102 , which filters the BB signal.
- FFT fast Fourier transform
- the filtered received signal (which may include a PRACH signal) is then provided to an extraction block 104 that extracts tones (e.g., 839 tones) for the PRACH signal, when the PRACH signal is present in the filtered signal.
- the extracted PRACH tones are then processed by an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) block 106 , which performs an appropriate sized (e.g., an 839-point) IDFT on the extracted PRACH tones to provide a time-domain signal.
- IDFT inverse discrete Fourier transform
- a demasking block 108 demasks the time-domain signal with a demasking signal (X u (n)), i.e., multiplies the time-domain signal with the demasking signal.
- a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) block 110 then performs an appropriate sized DFT (e.g., an 839-point DFT) on the demasked signal to provide a frequency-domain signal to facilitate time correlation.
- the frequency-domain signal is then provided to a power combine block 112 that accumulates power for each PRACH signal location of interest. For example, the block 112 may combine power from three peaks associated with the PRACH signal.
- a noise variance estimation block 114 performs a noise variance estimation based on a predetermined number (e.g., fifty) of the PRACH signal locations with the lowest power.
- the noise variance estimation is provided to a threshold block 118 , which sets a detection threshold based on the noise variance estimation.
- a peak power selection block 116 performs a peak power selection from a predetermined number (e.g., fourteen) of the PRACH signal locations with the highest power.
- the peak power and the detection threshold are provided to a threshold and time delay estimation block 120 , which provides an indication of whether a PRACH signal detection has occurred.
- an associated BS may transmit a preamble associated with the PRACH signal in an acquisition indicator (AI) signal along with a positive or negative acknowledgement (based on capacity, etc.).
- AI acquisition indicator
- a BB signal from antenna M may be processed using a 12288-point FFT block 122 , which filters the BB signal.
- the filtered signal (which may include a PRACH signal) is then provided to an extraction block 124 that extracts tones (e.g., 839 tones) for the PRACH signal, when the PRACH signal is present in the filtered signal.
- the extracted PRACH tones are then processed by an IDFT block 126 , which performs an appropriate sized (e.g., an 839-point) IDFT on the extracted PRACH tones to provide a time-domain signal.
- a demasking block 128 demasks the time-domain signal with a demasking signal (X u (n)) i.e., multiplies the time-domain signal with the demasking signal.
- a DFT block 130 then performs an appropriate sized DFT (e.g., an 839-point DFT) on the demasked signal to provide a frequency-domain signal to facilitate time correlation.
- the frequency-domain signal is then provided to the power combining block 112 , which (as discussed above) accumulates power for each PRACH signal location.
- calculating IDFTs and DFTs for relatively large numbers is computationally expensive and, as such, the PRACH signal detection performance of the conventional receiver 100 is far from ideal.

- LTE long-term evolution
- PRACH physical random access channel
- the term “coupled” includes both a direct electrical connection between blocks or components and an indirect electrical connection between blocks or components achieved using one or more intervening blocks or components.
- the term “user equipment” is utilized to broadly denote a wireless communication device and is synonymous with the term “subscriber station.”.
- a structure of a sequence may be exploited to reduce generation complexity of a PRACH waveform.
- a re-indexing technique with a table look-up may be implemented to generate a PRACH root sequence and associated cyclic shifts.
- a structure of a sequence may be exploited to reduce detection complexity associated with a PRACH waveform. For example, a low complexity two-step procedure may be implemented to detect a PRACH waveform.
- a PRACH, a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), and a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) from a number of UEs may combine at antennas of a serving BS.
- PUSCH physical uplink shared channel
- PUCCH physical uplink control channel
- the PRACH channel may be extracted using a number of different techniques. For example, the separation of the PRACH from the PUSCH/PUCCH may be performed in the frequency-domain (see FIG. 2 ).
- the frequency-domain implementation may employ a 6144-point FFT (for a 5 MHz system with a tone-space of 1.25 kHz) or a 12288-point FFT (for a 10 MHz system with a tone-space of 1.25 kHz) to filter a received baseband (BB) signal prior to extraction of the PRACH from the BB signal.
- the tones, e.g., 839 tones, corresponding to the PRACH signal can then be readily extracted from the filtered signal.
- the hybrid technique for separating the PRACH from the PUSCH/PUCCH is conducted in the time-domain.
- a designed receiver architecture is configured to: perform digital image rejection down-conversion; pass the PRACH waveform through a low-pass filter (which requires flatness from 0 to 32/256 and high attenuation after 41/256), under-sample the filtered waveform by three times using a cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filter and an associated compensation filter; perform a 2048-point FFT on the down-sampled filtered waveform; extract the PRACH tones (e.g., 839 tones); demask the frequency-domain signal by multiplying it with a demasking signal; and perform an FFT of 839-points or a multiple of 839-points (using the Bluestein FFT algorithm) to facilitate finding the peak.
- CIC cascaded integrator comb
- the digital image rejection down-conversion may be modified such that two PRACH waveforms are extracted at the same time.
- An FFT/IFFT based approach may be implemented to estimate a time-domain channel response by assuming a certain PRACH preamble root index.
- the power profiles of the time-domain channel responses from multiple receive antennas are combined to test the existence of a PRACH request and determine a timing offset.
- the time-domain approach typically places a critical filtering requirement on the filtering and decimation stage. It should be appreciated from this disclosure that a demasking signal may be generated in a number of manners.
- a combined signal is frequency shifted and passed through a low-pass filter, similar to the time-domain technique for separating the PRACH illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the design specification for the low-pass filter in FIG. 4 can generally be much looser than that required in the time-domain technique of FIG. 3 .
- Many tones from the PUSCH/PUCCH, which are adjacent to the PRACH, are typically allowed in the filtered signal.
- the filtered signal is provided to an FFT block (which, for example, performs a 2048-point FFT) to further separate the PRACH from the PUSCH/PUCCH.
- an FFT block which, for example, performs a 2048-point FFT
- the dynamic range of a filtered signal is much less at various internal stages of an FFT processor (as compared with the frequency-domain technique for separating the PRACH from the PUSCH/PUCCH).
- the implementation cost of the hybrid technique for separating the PRACH from the PUSCH/PUCCH can be significantly lower.
- low-pass filtering needs to be performed for each PRACH opportunity or each pair of PRACH opportunities if digital image rejection conversion is used.
- a PRACH waveform (s(t)), as defined in 36.211 of the LTE standard, is set forth below:
- Nzc i.e., the length of a Zadoff-Chu sequence
- ‘u’ is the PRACH root index
- ‘v’ is the preamble index
- Ncs is a cyclic shift that is determined by an associated cell radius.
- a UE chooses a PRACH waveform for transmission based on the PRACH root index ‘u’ broadcast from a serving BS. For cells with a relatively large radius, multiple PRACH root indices may be employed.
- each UE may be configured to choose one out of sixty-four possible PRACH waveforms for a PRACH transmission.
- a PRACH detector at a serving BS is required to be capable of testing for all sixty-four of the PRACH waveforms.
- a straightforward matching filter bank cannot typically be utilized. Due to the extended duration of the PRACH signal, PRACH signals can be detected at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as compared with PUSCH and PUCCH signals. Consequently the operating SNR for the PUSCH and PUCCH signals can be quite different from that of the PRACH signal.
- SNR signal-to-noise ratio
- a PRACH channel towards a channel edge.
- FDD frequency division duplex
- TDD time division duplex
- PRACH sequences are generated (at a UE) in a simplified way and PRACH requests in incoming signals are detected (at a serving BS) in a simplified way.
- frequency offset e.g., caused by local oscillator difference between a UE and a serving BS, Doppler shift, or both
- three peaks of interest may be present in a time-domain of a received signal.
- the power observed on the three peaks can vary. In this case, it is usually desirable to combine the power at the three peaks and perform PRACH signal detection based on the combined power.
- Timing alignment is exact only when an 839-point DFT (or a DFT that is a multiple of 839) is performed.
- misalignment occurs if any other point, which is not a multiple of 839, is employed.
- Ncs i.e., the number of cyclic shifts
- the underlying task is conducted multiple times for each PRACH root sequence.
- detection of a PRACH signal is facilitated by generation of a demasking signal as set forth below:
- the demasking signal (DFT(X u (n))) is then employed to demask a received signal to remove the dependence on the PRACH root index ‘u’.
- DFT(X u (n)) is then employed to demask a received signal to remove the dependence on the PRACH root index ‘u’.
- an 839-point DFT is then performed (using the Bluestein FFT algorithm) on the demasked frequency-domain signal. Multiple copies (e.g., 3 copies) of the peak may then be power combined to detect a preamble index. Combining the power from multiple peaks usually ensures that a signal is of sufficient power to be detected.
- the frequency-domain demasking signal is directly generated according to the PRACH root index ‘u’. An output from the combined peaks may be compared with a threshold which is set according to a noise variance estimate. Negative/positive results may then be reported on the preamble indices. The above-described procedure may then be repeated for any un-examined PRACH root index ‘u’.
- a frequency-domain representation of a PRACH signal may be derived for the DFT of
- the frequency-domain representation of the PRACH signal for the general case may be derived as follows. Consider the DFT of X u,v (n).
- a noisy version of the frequency-domain signal ⁇ tilde over (x) ⁇ u,v (k) may be obtained after a relatively large FFT.
- the derivation may be performed as if there is no noise.
- the preamble index ‘v’ may be estimated from the frequency-domain signal ⁇ tilde over (x) ⁇ u,v (k), which may be masked with the conjugate of
- the masked signal includes multiple complex exponential functions.
- ⁇ ⁇ ( u , v ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( u ) ⁇ e - j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ uvN cs ⁇ ( vN cs + 1 ) ) N zc can be ignored. Ignoring the scaling factor provides:
- the PRACH waveform can then be generated at a UE as follows: oversampling . . . by . . . 12 . . . times(IFFT 512 ( ⁇ f v (2n) ⁇ ))+frequency . . . shift(oversampling . . . by . . . 12 . . . times(IFFT 512 ( ⁇ f v (2n+1) ⁇ )).
- the received waveform may then be simplified as follows:
- N zc ⁇ ⁇ ( u , vN cs ) ⁇ e j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ ( kw + vN cs + dw ) ⁇ ( kw + vN cs + 1 + dw )
- N zc ⁇ ⁇ ( u , vN cs ) ⁇ e j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ ⁇ ( kw + vN cs ) ⁇
- the three images should not overlap with each other for all allowed preamble indices ‘v’.
- d u min(w,N zc ⁇ w mod N zc ).
- the demasked signal includes multiple sinusoidal signals (plus noise).
- a solution may be achieved by employing a DFT of 839 points (or a DFT of a multiple of 839 points) to achieve higher timing resolution.
- an 839-point DFT can be calculated efficiently using a chirp z-transform (also known as the Bluestein FFT algorithm) as set forth below:
- Y(k) may be expressed as:
- Y ⁇ ( k ) e - j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ k 2 / N zc ⁇ IFFT 2048 ⁇ ⁇ FFT 2048 ⁇ ( y ⁇ ⁇ ( n ) ) ⁇ FFT 2048 ⁇ ( e j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( n - N zc ) 2 / N zc ) ⁇ ⁇ truncated ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ from ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ point ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ N zc + 1 ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ to ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ N zc .
- the following procedure may be employed to determine the 839-point DFT.
- B 1 (k) FFT(b 1 (n))
- the Bluestein FFT algorithm is applicable for arbitrary point DFTs, one can see from the above equations that the Bluestein FFT algorithm can be used to calculate the DFT for 1678, 2517 and 3356 (i.e., 839 ⁇ 2, 839 ⁇ 3, and 839 ⁇ 4, respectively). It should be appreciated that a larger DFT size results in higher complexity. As such, a trade-off needs to be made between timing estimate accuracy and implementation cost. In the case a large FFT is used, circuit reuse should be considered. In the example shown in FIG. 2 , a 12288-point FFT is used to separate the PRACH signal from PUCCH/PUSCH signals.
- a 12288-point FFT can be decomposed into a 4096-point FFT and a 3-point FFT.
- circuit reuse is possible such that cyclic correlation can reuse the circuit of the 12288-point FFT.
- three cyclic correlations can be performed in parallel. This is especially desirable when a cell has a large radius, as multiple root sequences may be required to generate 64 preambles. In this case, the cyclic correlation needs to be performed for each root sequence. If the same PRACH processing latency is required for a cell with a large radius as for other cells, too many resources may be required. When the cell radius is small enough such that only one root sequence is required, reusing the circuit for extracting PRACH signals for cyclic correlation is especially beneficial in terms of resource saving.
- the PRACH signal Due to the extended duration of the PRACH signal, the PRACH signal can be detected at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
- the PUSCH channel can operate at various SNR levels to provide different spectral efficiency. Consequently, there is a relatively large difference between the operational SNR of PRACH and PUSCH signals and other channel signals.
- the PRACH resource is normally set aside according to a load condition with consideration of initial access, hand-off, timing adjustment, etc. In general, as long as the PRACH load is met, the fewer PRACH opportunities configured the better. As such, it is likely the PRACH will see PUSCH interference from other cells as it cannot be guaranteed that all neighboring cells will configure PRACH at the same frequency and time resources.
- Challenges related to PRACH receiver design include: extracting the PRACH signal from a combined signal including PRACH, PUCCH, and PUSCH signals that operate at various different SNR levels; and reducing high-powered PUSCH interference from other cells.
- extracting the PRACH signal from a combined signal including PRACH, PUCCH, and PUSCH signals that operate at various different SNR levels and reducing high-powered PUSCH interference from other cells.
- a technique is also described below to suppress PUSCH interference from other cells.
- a detection threshold To set a detection threshold correctly, at least two different techniques may be employed.
- a first technique among the sixty-four PRACH signal locations or preamble intervals, the intervals with the lowest powers are selected (e.g., the lowest fourteen preamble intervals may be selected).
- the number of selected lowest preamble intervals should be small enough such that the probability any of them is actually used for a UE is small and large enough the averaged power presents a good estimate of the noise variance.
- a detection threshold may be derived in a number of different manners. For example, with an FFT based approach, a peak may be found as follows:
- the estimate of ⁇ 2 may be, for example, performed over PRACH regions of low detected power.
- PRACH resources are partitioned into two pools: contention and non-contention based pools.
- the assignment of non-contention based resources to UEs are at the discretion of the BS.
- One technique sets aside resources that are needed for estimating interference plus noise variance in addition to the non-contention based resources (i.e., one can over budget the non-contention based resources and use some of them which are never assigned to any UE to estimate the interference plus noise variance). It should be noted that there are multiple variations to the basic scheme. For example, one can set aside some preambles in the non-contention based resource pool which are never assigned by the serving BS to any UE.
- a PRACH receiver may be informed by higher layers what preambles in a non-contention based access resource pool are not assigned currently.
- a serving BS may set aside some preambles in a non-contention based access resource pool (and these preambles and other preambles, which are indicated by higher layers as currently unassigned, may be used by the PRACH receiver to estimate the other cell interference-plus-noise variance matrix).
- the other cell interference-plus-noise variance matrix is then used to whiten the extracted PRACH signals from multiple antennas.
- each neighboring cell can schedule up to 6 UEs in the same resource as used by the PRACH. As such, it is desirable to reduce the number of UEs which can potentially sit on the PRACH resource in a neighboring cell.
- Various approaches may be employed to reduce the number of UEs that can potentially sit on a PRACH resource in a neighboring cell.
- the PRACH configurations in neighboring cells may be obtained through serving BS communication and taken into consideration by a scheduler so to reduce the number of UEs sitting on a PRACH resource of a neighbor.
- a scheduler may be configured to assume a PRACH configuration in neighbor cells is similar to a PRACH load in a cell associated with the scheduler.
- a scheduler may also assume a PRACH of neighbor cells is located towards an edge of a channel to avoid fragmentation of PUSCH resources (as a PUSCH transmission uses contiguous resource blocks). This assumption is typically valid as very high throughput PUSCH cannot typically be supported with a PRACH that sits in a middle of a channel. As such, a scheduler can make an “educated guess” on the location of the PRACH in neighboring cells. Depending on a velocity profile of UEs in a cell, weights for power combining can be different. A technique for assigning weights for power combining is illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- N zc mod N zc
- N zc ⁇ 2 (837) is b1101000101.
- f u ⁇ ( k ) e j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ⁇ w ⁇ ⁇ ( k ⁇ ⁇ w + 1 )
- N zc e j ⁇ ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ⁇ w ⁇ ⁇ ( k ⁇ ⁇ w + 1 ) 2 ⁇ N zc ,
- a value of f u (k) is provided by the set
- k ranges from 0 to 838 for an 839-point FFT.
- ukw(kw+1)mod 2N zc can be precalculated and ukw(kw+1)mod 2N zc can be utilized to find the value for f u (k). It should be noted that ukw(kw+1) is an even number and, as such, ukw(kw+1)mod 2N zc is an even number, which means there are at most N zc values to store. That is,
- u ⁇ ⁇ w ⁇ ( w + 1 ) ⁇ w + 1 , w ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ is ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ odd w + u ⁇ ⁇ w , w ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ is ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ ⁇ even
- index function is then given by:
- the functions may then be calculated as follows:
- the functions may be calculated as follows:
- I u (k+1) I u (k)+c u (k)+d 2
- a technique for detecting a physical random access channel (PRACH) signal includes demasking at least a portion of a received signal with a demasking signal.

Abstract
Description
In the case where a large prime number of 839 is selected, Nzc (i.e., the length of a Zadoff-Chu sequence) is set equal to 839. In the equations above, ‘u’ is the PRACH root index, ‘v’ is the preamble index, and Ncs is a cyclic shift that is determined by an associated cell radius. In general, a UE chooses a PRACH waveform for transmission based on the PRACH root index ‘u’ broadcast from a serving BS. For cells with a relatively large radius, multiple PRACH root indices may be employed.
where w satisfies uw=1 mod Nzc and ‘u’ is the PRACH root index.
First, for ‘u’ find ‘w’ such that uw=1 mod Nzc.
to provide a scaled version of
as follows:
is a complex exponential function with frequency
If multiple UEs have transmitted PRACH requests in a current subframe using different preamble indices ‘v’ (say v1, . . . , vB), then the masked signal includes multiple complex exponential functions.
In this case, fu(kw+vNcs) can be generated by a cyclical left shift of fu(k). In the generation of the PRACH signal, the constant scaling factor
can be ignored. Ignoring the scaling factor provides:
The PRACH waveform can then be generated at a UE as follows:
oversampling . . . by . . . 12 . . . times(IFFT512 ({fv(2n)}))+frequency . . . shift(oversampling . . . by . . . 12 . . . times(IFFT512 ({fv(2n+1)})).
y(k)={tilde over (x)} u,v(k+d mod N zc),
where the carrier offset is dΔfRA. The received waveform may then be simplified as follows:
As such, instead of a sinusoid at frequency
a sinusoid at frequency
is provided. In general, one can observe that frequency shift of the PRACH signal leads to a time shift of the detected peak in the cyclic correlation domain.
[vNcs−w,(v+1)Ncs−1−w],[vNcs(v+1)Ncs−1],[vNcs+w,(v+1)Ncs−1+w].
In general, to avoid possible ambiguity (whether the found peak is the un-shifted image or the time shifted image), the three images should not overlap with each other for all allowed preamble indices ‘v’. In general, it is beneficial to choose a cyclic shift range such that shifted images due to Doppler frequency/carrier offset do not overlap with each other. Assuming the largest frequency shift is limited to ±ΔRA, then it is usually adequate to require all possible images due to zero frequency offset, +ΔRA frequency offset, and −ΔRA frequency offset do not overlap among themselves. Let du=min(w,Nzc−w mod Nzc). If Ncs≦du≦Nzc/3, then:
P=└d u /N cs┘
S=2d u +P·N cs
R=max(└N zc−2d u −G·S)/N cs┘,0)
else if Nzc/3≦du≦(Nzc−Ncs)/2, then:
P=└(N zc−2d u)/N cs┘
S=N zc−2d u +P·N cs
G=└d u /S┘
R=min(max(└(d u −G·S)/N cs┘,0),P)
The above equations can be found in 3GPP 36.211 version 8.3.0 Physical Channels and Modulation.
Observing that
then Y(k) may be expressed as:
which may be rewritten as:
where Ld is a detection range. Based on the assumption that there is no PRACH request, ym,i, 1≦i≦Ld are contributed by noise. In this case, the power may be found as follows:
Assuming that
It can be seen that F follows a Chi-square distribution of 2M degrees of freedom. As there are sixty-four possibilities for the PRACH preamble, the threshold may be set as follows:
With a false alarm rate at 10−3, two receive antennas, and a search window Ld=13, the threshold for F may be given by:
T=24.0806σ2,
where σ2 is the noise variance per dimension (I or Q). The estimate of σ2 may be, for example, performed over PRACH regions of low detected power.
w=u N
However, to find w directly from the above formula is generally computationally intensive. To reduce the complexity u1, u2, u2
w=(P u,9 P u,8 P u,6 P u,2 P u,0 mod N zc)
Consequently, w can be found from u through (9−1)+(5−1) modulus multiplications for the prime number 839. It should be appreciated that the procedure can be trivially generalized for prime numbers other than 839. Alternatively a mapping table from u to w can be stored at a base station and/or UE.
the demasking sequence may be rewritten as:
In this case, a value of fu(k) is provided by the set
and k ranges from 0 to 838 for an 839-point FFT. As such,
can be precalculated and ukw(kw+1)mod 2Nzc can be utilized to find the value for fu(k). It should be noted that ukw(kw+1) is an even number and, as such, ukw(kw+1)mod 2Nzc is an even number, which means there are at most Nzc values to store. That is,
Let
In lieu of working with fu(k), the index function Iu(k)=ukw(kw+1)mod 2Nzc may be utilized. In this case the demasking sequence is given by fu(k)=S(Iu(k)), k=0, 1, . . . , Nzc−1.
uw(w+1)mod 2N zc=(1+N zc m′)(w+1)mod 2N zc =w+1 mod 2N zc.
If w is even, then:
uw(w+1)mod 2N zc=(1+N zc m′)w+uw mod 2N zc =w+uw mod 2N zc.
In this case,
The index function is then given by:
Assuming the following:
a number of different update rules may be implemented.
For k = 0, 1, ..., Nzc − 2, | ||
Iu(k + 1) = Iu(k) + cu(k) + d2,u mod 2Nzc | ||
cu(k + 1) = cu(k) + d1,u mod 2Nzc | ||
fu(k + 1) = S(Iu(k + 1)) (Read out the prestored value | ||
according to the index) | ||
Iu(k + 1)) | ||
End | ||
Updates can also be implemented as conditional logic. For example, to update Iu(k+1)=Iu(k)+cu(k)+d2,u mod 2Nzc, the following conditional logic may be employed:
If I u(k)+c u(k)≧2N zc, then t=I u(k)+cu(k)−2N zc else t=I u(k)+c u(k)
If t+d 2,u≧2N zc, then I u(k+1)=t+d 2,u−2N zc else I u(k+1)=t+d 2,u
where t is an intermediate variable. To update cu(k+1)=cu(k)+d1,u mod 2Nzc the following conditional logic may be employed:
If c u(k)+d1,u≧2N zc ,c u(k+1)=c u(k)+d 1,u−2N zc else c u(k+1)=cu(k)+d 1,u
It should be appreciated that the above steps can be executed off-line. For example, two tables of length 839 and one table of length 1678 can be readily stored in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In this manner, multiplication in the FPGA is avoided.
(I u(k+2)−I u(k+1))−(I u(k+1)−I u(k))=2w
for k=0, 1, . . . , Nzc−3. Alternatively, the idex function may be calculated as follows:
I u(k+2)=2I u(k+1)−I u(k)+2w,
for k=0, 1, . . . , Nzc−3. According to one aspect of the present disclosure d1,u and d2,u are precalculated and stored for u=1, . . . , Nzc−1, S(k) is precalculated and stored for k=0, 1, . . . , 2Nzc−1, and the following functions Iu(0)=0, Iu(1)=d2,u, fu(0)=1, and fu(1)=S(Iu(1)) are preset. The functions may be calculated as follows:
For k = 0, ..., Nzc − 3 | ||
Iu(k + 2) = 2Iu(k + 1) − Iu(k) + d1,u mod 2Nzc | ||
fu(k + 2) = S(Iu(k + 2)) | ||
End | ||
The update for Iu(k+1)=Iu(k)+cu(k)+d2,u mod 2Nzc can be implemented as conditional logic as follows:
t=I u(k+1)+I u(k+1)
If t≧2Nzc, then t=t−2N zc
If t≧I u(k), then t=t−I u(k) else t=t+(2N zc −I u(k))
t=t+d 1,u
If t≧2Nzc, then t=t−2N zc
I u(k+2)=t
where t is an intermediate variable.
