- OCR software may initiate a rescan or recapture of a document image when the OCR confidence is below a predetermined level.
- the rescan or recapture may be performed at an increased resolution.
- OCR confidence may be generated for each area identified in a template, with rescan or recapture only being performed when the OCR confidence for predetermined areas are below the predetermined level.
- OCR confidence thresholds for different areas of a document may be different, depending on a relative importance of the information contained therein. This eliminates unnecessary delays caused by rescanning or recapturing data from unimportant or less important areas, while maintaining highly accurate conversions for more important areas.
- document management software 330 may include software for enabling a manual review of a text version of a document(s) output by OCR software 320 .
- Document management software 330 may provide for the correction or editing of the text version, as well as the assignment of metadata elements to one or more portions of the text version. For example, continuing with the bank statement example described above, a statement date or date range and a bank or account name may be assigned to the document. Additionally, certain portions of the document may be assigned a “debit” metadata element, while additional portions of the document may be assigned a “credit” metadata element.
- Document management software 330 may provide for storage of the text version, its associated metadata elements, and/or its associated document image to document database server 140 for subsequent searching and retrieval.
- document management software 330 may include an image management application such as Google® LighthouseTM or Picasa®.
- Assignment of metadata elements to a searchable text version of a document may facilitate more efficient retrieval of information contained in the document, using a combination of document data as well as one or more metadata elements. For example, a document including a particular transaction may be more easily retrieved in response to a user search for a specific payee in the text version as well as a date within the document's date range and a transaction type.

- the processing of FIG. 5 may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within document capture system 110 or processing system 120 , or a combination thereof. In another implementation, the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or including document capture system 110 and/or processing system 120 .
- Processing may begin with the document capture system 110 capturing one or more images representing a document (act 510 ).
- document images may be retrieved or captured from an electronic source accessible either locally or from remote resources accessible via network 130 .
- document images may be automatically and/or periodically retrieved from a remote device, such as a web server.
- document capture system 110 may be configured to periodically and automatically retrieve electronic bank statements each month from a web site associated with a user's bank.

- a template may instruct OCR processing to performing recognition to a certain confidence level.
- a confidence level for the conversion may be determined (act 520 ). It may then be determined whether the confidence level meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold level indicative of an accurate conversion (act 525 ). If the predetermined threshold has not been met (act 525 —NO), the process may return to act 510 for recapture at a same or enhanced resolution. However, if the predetermined threshold has been met (act 525 —YES), the generated text version may be presented to a user for manual review and/or editing (act 530 ). Any modifications, additions, or deletions to the text version may be received (act 535 ). An OCR process, no matter how precise, may result in errors included in the resulting text version.
- Document capture system 110 and/or processing system 120 may provide an interface for manually inspecting and editing the generated text document, to correct noted errors or inconsistencies.
- users may efficiently correct OCR errors and may remove information from the text version that is considered sensitive or confidential.
- manually edited or corrected information may provide a feedback to document capture system 110 to facilitate subsequently enhanced OCR accuracy.
- Metadata elements may be associated with or assigned to the text version of the document to facilitate enhanced searching and/or retrieval of the text version (act 540 ).
- metadata elements may include information not explicitly present within the text of the document, but representative of the document content or selected portions of the document content.
- the metadata elements may be associated with either the entire text document, or to designated portions of the text document.
- Representative metadata elements may include content type designations, such as names, categories, date ranges, etc., customized “tags” created by a user, etc.
- the metadata elements may be “associated” with the text document by storing the metadata elements in document database 145 along with the text document and optionally the image document.
- the metadata elements may be embedded within or stored along with the text document and/or the image document to facilitate subsequent searching based on the associated metadata elements as well as the converted text.

- metadata elements such as “bank statement”, a document date or date range, account nickname, etc. may be assigned to the text version of the document.
- metadata elements may be assigned to selected portions of the text version of the document. For example, individual credit transactions or groups of credit transactions may be assigned a “credits” metadata element, while debit transactions in the bank statement may be assigned a “debits” metadata element. In this way, information relating to the OCR'd content may be associated with the text document and used to subsequently identify and retrieve the text document.
- association of metadata elements may be performed automatically upon application of a template to the image document.
- document capture system 110 may be configured to process a selected document image based on a selected template.
- the selected template may instruct document capture system 110 to OCR only selected portions of the image document to a desired confidence level and assign specific metadata elements to designated portions of the resulting text document.
- the metadata elements may be reviewed and changes to the metadata elements may be received (act 542 ).
- an interface may be provided for enabling users to view any metadata elements associated with the text document.
- the interface may further enable users to manually edit or remove previously associated metadata elements.
- One or more access conditions may be assigned to the document (act 545 ).
- captured documents may be assigned access conditions based on various criteria, such as document type, content, or an identity of a user initiating the capture. For example, receipts, letters, community newsletters, etc. may be assigned a first access level, while financial statements, legal correspondence, and other sensitive information may be assigned a secondary or more private access level.
- access conditions may be assigned to individual documents, upon user instruction. Searching and/or retrieval of documents assigned to the secondary access level may be available only upon receipt of authentication information indicating that the user is authorized to view content associated with the secondary access level. Suitable authentication information may include a username/password combination, a personal identification number (PIN) or code, or biometric information (e.g., voice print, finger print, retinal pattern, palm print, etc.)
- the access level assigned to the documents may be based on the manner in which the document was captured. For example, documents obtained from predetermined sources (such as particular web sites, remote locations, etc.) may be assigned to the secure secondary access level, while all other documents may be initially assigned to a general, or less secure access level.
- documents obtained from secure password protected resources may be assigned an access level requiring similar password entry as the source location. For example, searching, retrieval, or viewing of statements retrieved from a bank may require submission of authentication credentials similar to those required to retrieve the information directly from the bank.
- secure information may be searched prior to receipt of the authentication credentials; however, any identified information may not be displayed to the user prior to receipt of suitable credentials.
- the assigned access conditions may indicate one or more individuals with whom the document may be shared or made available.
- a first user may initiate document capture and may indicate that a second user (or group of users) may be provided access to the document text and/or document image.
- the first user may indicate that the content of the captured document may be integrated within an index associated with both the first user and the second user (or group of users). For example, a husband and wife may make certain documents available to each other for subsequent identification, searching, and/or retrieval. Identification of users may be made by indicating information associated with the users, such as email addresses, usernames, etc.
- the text version and its associated metadata elements may be stored in document database 145 on document database server 140 (act 550 ).
- the stored information may be made available in response to subsequently received search queries.
- stored documents may be retrieved based not only on information included within the document itself, but also based on metadata elements associated and stored with the document. For example, a store receipt may be captured and converted to text. Additionally, a metadata element, such as “John birthday gift 2006” may be associated with one or more items listed on the receipt.
- Subsequent searches that return this document may be based on any combination of textual information present on the receipt, such as the store name, the date, the item description, as well as any text including within a metadata element associated with the document, such as “birthday gift”, “john”, “gift”, etc.
- Document searches may be performed on all documents associated with a user or group of users; however, display of a document returned in the search may only be made upon verification of a user's access condition. Alternatively, searches may be performed only on documents to which the user has been provided access, with additional search results being available upon entry of suitable authentication information.
- document database server 140 may be a web server configured to maintain an online storage environment for the user's OCR's documents.
- users may also store the captured images in document database 145 , thereby enabling subsequent retrieval of the actual image document along with its text version.

Abstract
A system generates a text document from a received document image. Metadata elements may be assigned to all or part of the text document by a user or by a template used to generate the text document. The text document and the associated metadata elements may be stored to facilitate subsequent searching and retrieval of the text document or the document image based on contents of the text document and/or its associated metadata elements.
Description
- This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/617,537, filed Dec. 28, 2006, the entire content of which is incorporated by reference herein.
- 1. Field of the Invention
- Systems and methods described herein relate generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to the archiving user information for subsequent searching and retrieval.
- 2. Description of Related Art
- Modern computer networks, and in particular, the Internet, have made large bodies of information widely and easily available. Internet search engines, for instance, index many millions of web documents that are linked to the Internet. A user connected to the Internet can enter a simple search query to quickly locate web documents relevant to the search query.
- In addition to publicly available documents, such as websites and other online documents, recent endeavors have been made to facilitate the indexing and storing of user documents, such as word processing documents, emails, music, etc. Applications such as Google Desktop Search, Copernic Desktop Search, and Apple Computer, Inc.'s Safari typically crawl designated portions of a user's local storage and maintain an index of searchable documents identified therein. Unfortunately, conventional document indexing tools do not provide for storage or efficient indexing of non-text based documents.
- According to one aspect, a method may include receiving a document image. The document image may be converted into a text document.

FIG. 1 is a diagram of anexemplary system 100 in which systems and methods consistent with the aspects described herein may be implemented.System 100 may include adocument capture system 110, aprocessing system 120, anetwork 130, adocument database server 140, and atemplate database server 150. In one embodiment,document capture system 110 may include a scanner or similar image capturing device configured to scan a page(s) of a document. Scanner may use conventional techniques for scanning or capturing documents. In another embodiment,document capture system 110 may be configured to retrieve and/or import digital documents that may or may not include computer-readable textual information, such as web page hypertext markup language (html) documents, screen capture images (e.g., jpeg images, png images, bmp images, gif images, etc.), portable document format (pdf), or tag image file format (tiff) formatted documents, or the like. For example,document capture system 110 may be configured to retrieve an online bank statement from a bank web server (not shown) overnetwork 130. Such an online bank statement may be initially retrieved in an image or non-textually-recognized electronic document format (e.g., pdf, tiff, jpeg, etc.). - In one implementation,
document capture system 110 may be configured to automatically and/or periodically retrieve digital documents from a remote device, such as a web server. Using the above example,document capture system 110 may be configured to retrieve electronic bank statements each month. For example, a user may configuredocument capture system 110 to include additional information, such as a web site address, log in information, description of a document or document type, etc., to enabledocument capture system 110 to access a web site and retrieve the requested document. - A “document,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product, electronic media, print media, etc. A document may include, for example, information contained in print media (e.g., newspapers, magazines, books, encyclopedias, etc.), electronic newspapers, electronic books, electronic magazines, online encyclopedias, electronic media (e.g., image files, audio files, video files, web casts, podcasts, etc.), etc.
- As described in more detail below,
processing system 120 may be configured to perform OCR on documents captured or otherwise retrieved bydocument capture system 110 to recognize text associated with the document.Processing system 120 may include a client entity, where an entity may be defined as a device, such as a personal computer, a wireless telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a laptop, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and/or an object executable by one of these devices. In other aspects,processing system 120 may include a server entity that gathers, processes, searches, and/or maintains documents. In such an aspect, a “thin client” device may be configured to interact with sever-basedprocessing system 120, where processing of documents may be performed remotely to the client device. - In one implementation, OCR processing by
processing system 120 may be performed on an entirety of each captured document, with no preconfigured metadata associated therewith. In an alternative implementation, OCR processing may be based on a template or preliminary configuration that may be either automatically selected byprocessing system 120 or selected and/or configured by a user. Templates may assign searchable metadata elements to sections of documents or may instructprocessing system 120 to OCR only predetermined portions of documents. - Using the bank statement example from above, a bank provided OCR template may instruct
processing system 120 as to what portions of the statement relate to what kinds of information. For example, a first portion of statement documents may include account information, while a second portion may include transaction information. The template may further indicate that only the transaction information portion of the statement should be OCR'd. By providing information about a document in advance of OCR or other processing of the document, information capturing may be performed more efficiently. In one exemplary implementation, templates may be stored or otherwise maintained on atemplate database 155 oftemplate database server 150 and may be accessible vianetwork 130. In another embodiment (not shown),template database server 150 and/ortemplate database 155 may be local toprocessing system 120. Additional details relating to the above-described implementations are set forth in detail below. -
Document database server 140 may include adocument database 145 configured to store the OCR'd text associated with a document as well as any metadata assigned to or associated with the captured document. In one implementation, an electronic copy of the captured image document may be stored indocument database 145 as well. Alternatively,document database 145 may be configured to store the captured image document along with its associated metadata. In another implementation,document database 145 may store an index associated with the stored text and/or image documents to assist in searching and retrieving information fromdocument database 145. The index may include a reference to the stored text and/or image documents as well as the content of the document and any metadata elements associated therewith. - As shown, in one implementation,
document database server 140 may be connected toprocessing system 120 vianetwork 130. However, in alternative implementations,document database server 140 and/ordocument database 145 may be stored locally with respect toprocessing system 120. -
Document database server 140 may store a document's textual information and metadata information within a database record ofdocument database 145. In one implementation, the records ofdocument database 145 may be arranged to form a relational database, although any suitable database structure may be implemented in accordance with aspects described herein. -
Network 130 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a wireless cellular network, an intranet, the Internet, or a combination of networks.Processing system 120 anddatabase servers -
FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a client or server entity (hereinafter called “system 110/120”), which may correspond to one or more ofdocument capture system 110,processing system 120,document database server 140, and/ortemplate database server 150. In this implementation,system 110/120 may take the form of a computer. In another implementation,system 110/120 may include a set of cooperating computers.System 110/120 may include a bus 210, aprocessor 220, amain memory 230, a read only memory (ROM) 240, astorage device 250, aninput device 260, anoutput device 270, and acommunication interface 280. Bus 210 may include a path that permits communication among the elements ofsystem 110/120. -
Processor 220 may include a processor, microprocessor, or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions.Main memory 230 may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution byprocessor 220.ROM 240 may include a ROM device or another type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use byprocessor 220.Storage device 250 may include a magnetic and/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive. -
Input device 260 may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information tosystem 110/120, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc.Output device 270 may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc.Communication interface 280 may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enablessystem 110/120 to communicate with other devices and/or systems. For example,communication interface 280 may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such asnetwork 130. - As will be described in detail below,
system 110/120 may perform certain document processing-related operations.System 110/120 may perform these operations in response toprocessor 220 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such asmemory 230. A computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave. - The software instructions may be read into
memory 230 from another computer-readable medium, such asdata storage device 250, or from another device viacommunication interface 280. The software instructions contained inmemory 230 may causeprocessor 220 to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes in various aspects of the invention. Thus, implementations of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram of a portion of an exemplary computer-readable medium 300 that may be used by processingsystem 120. In one implementation, computer-readable medium 300 may correspond tomemory 230 of aprocessing system 120. The portion of computer-readable medium 300 illustrated inFIG. 3 may include anoperating system 310,OCR software 320, anddocument management software 330. - More specifically,
operating system 310 may include operating system software, such as the Microsoft Windows®, Unix, or Linux operating systems.OCR software 320 may include or use software (e.g., drivers) for interfacing withdocument capture system 110 to initiate capturing of document images bydocument capture system 110. Additionally,OCR software 320 may include software for converting an image of a captured document to a text version. As described briefly above,OCR software 320 may use a template retrieved fromtemplate database server 150 to facilitate efficient recognition of the document and assignment of metadata elements thereto. -
FIG. 4 an exemplary diagram of an exemplary graphical depiction of anOCR template 400 relating to the bank statement example described above. As shown,template 400 may identify severalnon-OCR sections processing system 120 to not perform OCR processing on portions of the captured document relating to the locations of these sections. Anaccount section 415 may instructprocessing system 120 to assign an “account information” metadata element to any text information identified in a portion of the captured document relating to the location ofsection 415. Similarly, atransaction section 420 may instructprocessing system 120 to assign a “transactions” metadata element to any text information identified in a portion of the captured document relating to the location ofsection 420. By designating OCR processing and metadata assignment for documents processed using the template, recognition and metadata assignment may be performed more efficiently than through manual implementations. - In one implementation consistent with aspects described herein,
OCR software 320 may determine an OCR confidence for a converted document that indicates or otherwise determines a likelihood that a document image has been accurately converted to a text version. - In one embodiment, OCR software may initiate a rescan or recapture of a document image when the OCR confidence is below a predetermined level. In one implementation, the rescan or recapture may be performed at an increased resolution. In still a further implementation, OCR confidence may be generated for each area identified in a template, with rescan or recapture only being performed when the OCR confidence for predetermined areas are below the predetermined level. Alternatively, OCR confidence thresholds for different areas of a document may be different, depending on a relative importance of the information contained therein. This eliminates unnecessary delays caused by rescanning or recapturing data from unimportant or less important areas, while maintaining highly accurate conversions for more important areas.
- Returning to
FIG. 3 ,document management software 330 may include software for enabling a manual review of a text version of a document(s) output byOCR software 320.Document management software 330 may provide for the correction or editing of the text version, as well as the assignment of metadata elements to one or more portions of the text version. For example, continuing with the bank statement example described above, a statement date or date range and a bank or account name may be assigned to the document. Additionally, certain portions of the document may be assigned a “debit” metadata element, while additional portions of the document may be assigned a “credit” metadata element.Document management software 330 may provide for storage of the text version, its associated metadata elements, and/or its associated document image to documentdatabase server 140 for subsequent searching and retrieval. In one implementation,document management software 330 may include an image management application such as Google® Lighthouse™ or Picasa®. - Assignment of metadata elements to a searchable text version of a document may facilitate more efficient retrieval of information contained in the document, using a combination of document data as well as one or more metadata elements. For example, a document including a particular transaction may be more easily retrieved in response to a user search for a specific payee in the text version as well as a date within the document's date range and a transaction type.

FIG. 5 is a flowchart of exemplary processing for capturing, processing and managing documents. The processing ofFIG. 5 may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components withindocument capture system 110 orprocessing system 120, or a combination thereof. In another implementation, the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or includingdocument capture system 110 and/orprocessing system 120. - Processing may begin with the
document capture system 110 capturing one or more images representing a document (act 510). As described above, one implementation may use conventional scanning techniques to capture images of the pages of the document. Alternatively, document images may be retrieved or captured from an electronic source accessible either locally or from remote resources accessible vianetwork 130. For example, document images may be automatically and/or periodically retrieved from a remote device, such as a web server. In one example,document capture system 110 may be configured to periodically and automatically retrieve electronic bank statements each month from a web site associated with a user's bank. To facilitate automatic retrieval of document images,document capture system 110 may receive document location and scheduling information indicating where a document image should be retrieved from and at what times/frequency. - Additionally,
document capture system 110 may be configured to receive authentication information associated with the retrieved document, such as a username/password combination necessary to retrieve the document. Entities such as banks, brokerage houses, financial planners, attorneys, doctors, etc. may require such authentication information prior to release of requested or retrieved documents. - Once captured, OCR processing may be performed on the document images to generate a textual or searchable version of the document (act 515). OCR processing may involve an analysis of an image for recognizable text and characteristics of the text (e.g., font, size, formatting, etc.) included therein as well as information regarding where the text is located on the pages based on the images of the pages of the document.
- In one implementation, OCR processing may be performed on an entirety of each document image. In another implementation, OCR processing may be performed on portions of the document images based on a template retrieved from
template database server 150 or, alternatively, from local storage (e.g., data storage device 250). For example, in one implementation, a bank may provide a template from a web site hosted onserver 150. In another example, a user may configure or save a template for subsequent use with similar types of documents. As described above, templates may indicate various areas in a type of document and may be used to establish or assign metadata elements to those areas or to the document as a whole. In another implementation consistent with aspects described herein, a template may instruct OCR processing to performing recognition to a certain confidence level. - Once a text version of a document has been generated, a confidence level for the conversion may be determined (act 520). It may then be determined whether the confidence level meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold level indicative of an accurate conversion (act 525). If the predetermined threshold has not been met (act 525—NO), the process may return to act 510 for recapture at a same or enhanced resolution. However, if the predetermined threshold has been met (act 525—YES), the generated text version may be presented to a user for manual review and/or editing (act 530). Any modifications, additions, or deletions to the text version may be received (act 535). An OCR process, no matter how precise, may result in errors included in the resulting text version. Such errors may be caused by a variety of reasons, such as poor quality image capturing of the image document, artifacts present in the image document (such as, staples, holes, handwritten annotations, dirt, etc.), improperly aligned image documents, word breaks, etc.
Document capture system 110 and/orprocessing system 120 may provide an interface for manually inspecting and editing the generated text document, to correct noted errors or inconsistencies. By providing for a manual review of the generated text version, users may efficiently correct OCR errors and may remove information from the text version that is considered sensitive or confidential. In one implementation, manually edited or corrected information may provide a feedback to documentcapture system 110 to facilitate subsequently enhanced OCR accuracy. - One or more metadata elements may be associated with or assigned to the text version of the document to facilitate enhanced searching and/or retrieval of the text version (act 540). As described above, metadata elements may include information not explicitly present within the text of the document, but representative of the document content or selected portions of the document content. The metadata elements may be associated with either the entire text document, or to designated portions of the text document. Representative metadata elements may include content type designations, such as names, categories, date ranges, etc., customized “tags” created by a user, etc. The metadata elements may be “associated” with the text document by storing the metadata elements in
document database 145 along with the text document and optionally the image document. In one implementation, the metadata elements may be embedded within or stored along with the text document and/or the image document to facilitate subsequent searching based on the associated metadata elements as well as the converted text. Alternatively, the metadata elements associated with the text document may be stored within an index indocument database 145 along with the stored text and/or image documents to assist in searching and retrieving information. - For example, using the bank statement example initially presented above, metadata elements such as “bank statement”, a document date or date range, account nickname, etc. may be assigned to the text version of the document. Additionally, metadata elements may be assigned to selected portions of the text version of the document. For example, individual credit transactions or groups of credit transactions may be assigned a “credits” metadata element, while debit transactions in the bank statement may be assigned a “debits” metadata element. In this way, information relating to the OCR'd content may be associated with the text document and used to subsequently identify and retrieve the text document.
- In one implementation consistent with aspects described herein, association of metadata elements may be performed automatically upon application of a template to the image document. For example,
document capture system 110 may be configured to process a selected document image based on a selected template. The selected template may instructdocument capture system 110 to OCR only selected portions of the image document to a desired confidence level and assign specific metadata elements to designated portions of the resulting text document. - Once desired metadata elements have been assigned or, if automatically assigned upon application of a template, the metadata elements may be reviewed and changes to the metadata elements may be received (act 542). For example, an interface may be provided for enabling users to view any metadata elements associated with the text document. The interface may further enable users to manually edit or remove previously associated metadata elements.
- One or more access conditions may be assigned to the document (act 545). In one exemplary implementation, captured documents may be assigned access conditions based on various criteria, such as document type, content, or an identity of a user initiating the capture. For example, receipts, letters, community newsletters, etc. may be assigned a first access level, while financial statements, legal correspondence, and other sensitive information may be assigned a secondary or more private access level. Alternatively, access conditions may be assigned to individual documents, upon user instruction. Searching and/or retrieval of documents assigned to the secondary access level may be available only upon receipt of authentication information indicating that the user is authorized to view content associated with the secondary access level. Suitable authentication information may include a username/password combination, a personal identification number (PIN) or code, or biometric information (e.g., voice print, finger print, retinal pattern, palm print, etc.)
- In one implementation, the access level assigned to the documents may be based on the manner in which the document was captured. For example, documents obtained from predetermined sources (such as particular web sites, remote locations, etc.) may be assigned to the secure secondary access level, while all other documents may be initially assigned to a general, or less secure access level. In yet another implementation, documents obtained from secure password protected resources may be assigned an access level requiring similar password entry as the source location. For example, searching, retrieval, or viewing of statements retrieved from a bank may require submission of authentication credentials similar to those required to retrieve the information directly from the bank. In another implementation, secure information may be searched prior to receipt of the authentication credentials; however, any identified information may not be displayed to the user prior to receipt of suitable credentials.
- In another implementation, the assigned access conditions may indicate one or more individuals with whom the document may be shared or made available. For example, a first user may initiate document capture and may indicate that a second user (or group of users) may be provided access to the document text and/or document image. Additionally, the first user may indicate that the content of the captured document may be integrated within an index associated with both the first user and the second user (or group of users). For example, a husband and wife may make certain documents available to each other for subsequent identification, searching, and/or retrieval. Identification of users may be made by indicating information associated with the users, such as email addresses, usernames, etc.
- Upon assignment of access conditions, the text version and its associated metadata elements may be stored in
document database 145 on document database server 140 (act 550). Depending on the access conditions assigned inact 545, the stored information may be made available in response to subsequently received search queries. By providing for optimized image conversion and metadata association, stored documents may be retrieved based not only on information included within the document itself, but also based on metadata elements associated and stored with the document. For example, a store receipt may be captured and converted to text. Additionally, a metadata element, such as “John birthday gift 2006” may be associated with one or more items listed on the receipt. Subsequent searches that return this document may be based on any combination of textual information present on the receipt, such as the store name, the date, the item description, as well as any text including within a metadata element associated with the document, such as “birthday gift”, “john”, “gift”, etc. - Document searches may be performed on all documents associated with a user or group of users; however, display of a document returned in the search may only be made upon verification of a user's access condition. Alternatively, searches may be performed only on documents to which the user has been provided access, with additional search results being available upon entry of suitable authentication information.
- In one exemplary implementation,
document database server 140 may be a web server configured to maintain an online storage environment for the user's OCR's documents. In other implementations, users may also store the captured images indocument database 145, thereby enabling subsequent retrieval of the actual image document along with its text version. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of exemplary processing for responding to a document search request. The processing ofFIG. 6 may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components withindocument database server 140. In another implementation, the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or includingdocument database server 140, such as a web server or search engine. - Processing may begin with the
document database server 140 receiving a document search request including one or more search terms (act 610). In one implementation, the document search request may be received via a search engine interface, although any suitable interface may be applicable, such as an operating system or local search interface.Document database server 140 may identify search results indocument database 145 that match the received search terms (act 615). As described above, the search may be performed based on any combination of text content and metadata elements associated with the text documents stored indatabase 145. Additionally, the search may be performed based on an index including the text document contents and the associated metadata elements. - A listing of search results may be provided (act 620). A document selection request may be received indicating that the user wishes to view or download a selected document from the search results listing (act 625). It may be determined whether access conditions associated with the selected document have been met (act 630). For example, certain documents maintained in
document database 145 may be restricted to authorized users. Upon selection of such a document, it may be determined whether the user requesting the document is an authorized user. - If the document is unprotected or if the user is an authorized user meeting the access condition associated with the selected document, the requested document may be provided to the user (act 630). The provided document may include either the text document, or the image document, depending on user preferences or whether image documents have been saved along with the text document. Otherwise,
server 140 may prompt the user to input authentication information sufficient to meet the access condition associated with the selected document (act 635). Authentication information may be received from the user (act 635) and the process may return to act 630 where it is again determined whether the access conditions associated with the selected document have been met. - In an additional implementation consistent with aspects described herein,
document database server 140 may receive access authentication information from the user prior to receiving a search request. In this implementation, access conditions meeting a subset of documents in the document database may already have been received. As described briefly above, document searches in this implementation (e.g., act 615) may be performed on a subset of documents corresponding to a user's current access privileges. In such an implementation, the provided listing of search results (e.g., act 620) may include only documents to which the user is currently authorized to view. In such an implementation, processing may proceed directly fromact 625 to act 635 for provision of the requested document. - Systems and methods described herein may automatically identify metadata associated with a document and may create an association between the metadata and the image and/or text version of the document, making both the document content and its associated metadata available for searching and/or other processing.
