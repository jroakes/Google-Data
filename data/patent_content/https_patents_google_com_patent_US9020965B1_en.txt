Definitions
- This specification generally relates to computer software systems and methods, in particular, systems and methods for relationship ranking and decay in a social networking service.
- Internet-based social networking services provide a digital medium for users to interact with one another and share information.
- users are able to distribute digital content (e.g., textual comments, digital images, digital videos, digital audio, hyperlinks to websites, etc.) to other users that they might be connected with in the social networking service.
- Digital content that is distributed to a user can be displayed to the user in a stream page.
- the number of contacts of the user can increase.
- the user can add contacts that the user rarely interacts with inside or outside of the social networking service. Consequently, the user's contacts within the social networking service can become cluttered with contacts that might be less relevant to the user in practical terms.
- connection score data for a user, the user being a user of a computer-implemented social networking service
- the connection score data including one or more connection scores, each connection score reflecting a degree of interaction between the user and a respective contact, determining that a first connection score is less than or equal to a minimum connection score, the first connection score being associated with a first contact of the user within the social networking service, and, in response to determining that the first connection score is less than or equal to the minimum connection score, removing the first contact as a contact of the user within the social networking service.
- connection score data for a user, the user being a user of a computer-implemented social networking service
- the connection score data including one or more connection scores, each connection score reflecting a degree of interaction between the user and a respective contact, and transmitting instructions to display contacts of the user in rank order based on respective connection scores.
- actions further include revising at least one connection score based on one or more decay values, the one or more decay values reducing a value of the at least one connection score; revising the at least one connection score includes applying the one or more decay values to the at least one connection score based on a frequency at which the user engages the social networking service; the frequency is based on the user logging into the social networking service; the frequency is provided based on one or more interactions over a period of time; actions further include revising at least one connection score based on one or more interaction values, the one or more interaction values increasing a value of the at least one connection score; revising at least one connection score includes: determining that the at least one connection score is to be increased from a first value to a second value, determining that the second value is greater than a maximum value, and, in response to determining that the second value is greater than the maximum value, setting the at least one connection score equal to the maximum value; actions further include: establishing
- Implementations of the present disclosure provide one or more of the following example advantages. Implementations provide a social networking experience that is closely aligned with real-life social networks. Implementations also enables unused social connections to be passively broken (i.e., by a third party). In this manner, users are not required to migrate to another social networking service. Implementations also increase user engagement, because the user is only connected to people they meaningfully communicate with. Implementations further reduce the hardware requirements (e.g., processors and memory), because unwanted social connections are automatically pruned updates from the pruned social connections no longer need to be shown to the user.
- hardware requirements e.g., processors and memory

- connection scores that each represents an interaction between a user and a respective contact within a computer-implemented social networking service.
- the connection scores reflect a degree of interaction between the user and each of the respective contacts.
- contacts of the user can be displayed in a rank order based on the respective connection scores.
- a graphical representation of a relationship between a user and a contact within the social networking service can be provided based on a respective connection score.
- a relationship between a user and a contact within the social networking service can decay based on a respective connection score. In some examples, the relationship can decay to the point that the user and the contact are no longer considered as being connected within the social networking service.
- connection score can be determined based on a social affinity between the user and a contact.
- a social affinity between a particular user of the social networking service and other users of the social networking service can be determined based on a social graph of the particular user.
- a social graph can refer to a single social graph or multiple interconnected social graphs. Distinct social graphs can be generated for different types of connections a user has. For example, a user can be connected with chat contacts in one social graph, email contacts in a second social graph, and connections (or contacts) from a particular social networking service in a third social graph. Each social graph can include edges to additional individuals or entities at higher degrees of separation from the user. These contacts can in turn have additional contacts at another degree of separation from the user. Similarly, a user's connection to someone in a particular social network can then be used to identify additional connections based on that person's connections.
- the distinct social graphs can include edges connecting one or more social graph to one or more other social graphs.
- a single social graph can be provided as a compilation of individual social graphs.
- the first, second, third and/or fourth social graphs discussed above can be combined for a particular user to provide a composite social graph that depicts the connection or potential connections of the particular user across multiple services (e.g., email, chat, social networking, matchmaking).
- Types of connections and social graphs can include, but are not limited to other users in which the user is in direct contact (e.g., user mail or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites), users in which the user is in indirect contact (e.g., friends of friends, connections of users that have a direct connection to the user), and/or users in which a connection with the user is suggested (e.g., social networking and/or matchmaking).
- the social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user.
- the social graph can include connections within a single network or across multiple networks (separable or integrated).
- Public social graph relationships can also be considered. In some examples, public relationships can be established through public profiles and/or public social networking services.
- a social affinity score can be determined for a connection between a user and another user.
- the social affinity score can reflect a strength of a relationship between the users.
- a first user can be connected to a second user and a third user.
- the first user can the second user can be in frequent contact with one another via the social networking service (e.g., often sharing items with one another), email and/or chat.
- a first social affinity score can be provided based on the interaction between the first user and the second user.
- the first user and the third user might be infrequently in contact with one another. For example, the first user might have received an email from the third user only once in the last several months.
- a second social affinity score can be provided based on the interaction between the first user and the third user. In this example, the first social affinity score is greater than the second social affinity score, reflecting a closer relationship between the first user and the second user than between the first user and the third user.
- connection scores between a user and contacts can be provided based on respective social affinity scores.
- a connection score is provided if the user and the contact are direct contacts within the context of the social networking service.
- a direct contact can include a contact that shares a symmetrical relationship with the user within the social networking service.
- a symmetrical relationship includes the user and the contact having two-way interaction with one another through the social networking service (e.g., the user has added the contact as a contact within the social networking service, and the contact has added the user as a contact within the social networking service).
- An asymmetrical relationship can include the contact and the user not interacting with one another or having one-way interaction within the social networking service (e.g., the user has added the contact as a contact within the social networking service, but the contact has not added the user as a contact within the social networking service).
- connection score between a user and a contact can fluctuate based on interactions between the user and the contact.
- one or more decay factors can be applied to the connection score. In this manner, if there is no interaction between the user and the contact, the connection score decays over time.
- the connection score is equal to or less than a threshold connection score, the relationship between the user and the contact within the social networking service can be deemed to be non-existent.
- the contact can be removed as a contact of the user within the social networking service.
- connection scores between a user and respective contacts can be used to arrange the contacts in rank order.
- the contacts can be displayed to the user in rank order with contacts associated with higher connections scores being displayed more prominently than contacts associated with lower connection scores.
- the example social networking service enables users to organize contacts into social circles. It is appreciated, however, that implementations of the present disclosure can be used in other types of social networking services and are not limited to social networking services that include social circles.
- social circles are categories to which a user can assign contacts and better control the distribution and visibility of social networking posts and/or other digital content distributed using the social networking service.
- a social circle can be provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that are associated with one another in a computer-implemented social networking service.
- a social circle can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people.
- a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries (e.g., members of the social circle might be familiar with one another) and permission may be required for a member to join a social circle.
- a user of the social networking service can define a social circle.
- the social circle may reflect real-life social connections and/or interactions of the user.
- a social circle can be defined by a user as a personal representation or grouping of a set of contacts, the contacts may be unaware of the social circle and/or unaware of other members of the social circle.
- the user can organize and categorize social networking contacts into various different groupings that can be used to control the visibility and access those contacts have to the user's postings, digital pictures, videos, audio files, hyperlinks (e.g., uniform resource indicators, URIs), and/or other content associated with the user's social networking profile.
- the user can post an update about a work-related nuance to only a “coworker” circle, and spare other contacts within the social networking service from seeing information that is irrelevant to them.
- Users can establish direct contacts and indirect contacts within the social networking service using social circles. For example, a first user can add a second user to a social circle. As a result, the first user and the second user are at least indirect contacts in the social networking service (i.e., an asymmetrical relationship exists). The second user can add the first user to a social circle. As a result, the first user and the second user are direct contacts in the social networking service (i.e., a symmetrical relationship exists).
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example network architecture 100 .
- the network architecture 100 includes a number of client devices 102 - 110 communicably connected to a server system 112 by a network 114 .
- the server system 112 includes a processing device 116 and a data store 118 .
- the processing device 116 executes computer instructions (e.g., social network computer program code, and/or IM computer program code) stored in the data store 118 to perform the functions of a social network server and/or IM server.
- computer instructions e.g., social network computer program code, and/or IM computer program code
- the client devices 102 - 110 access the server device 112 to participate in a social networking service.
- the client devices 102 - 110 can execute web browser applications that can be used to access the social networking service and/or an IM service.
- the client devices 102 - 110 can execute software applications that are specific to the social networking service and/or the IM service (e.g., social networking and/or IM “apps” running on smartphones).
- Users interacting with the client devices 102 - 110 can participate in the social networking service provided by the server system 112 by digital content, such as text comments (e.g., updates, announcements, replies), digital images, videos, audio files, and/or other appropriate digital content.
- digital content such as text comments (e.g., updates, announcements, replies), digital images, videos, audio files, and/or other appropriate digital content.
- information can be posted on a user's behalf by systems and/or services external to the social networking service or the server system 112 .
- the user may post a review of a movie to a movie review website, and with proper permissions that website may cross-post the review to the social networking service on the user's behalf.
- a software application executing on a mobile device may use global positioning system (GPS) capabilities to determine the user's location and automatically update the social network with his location (e.g., “At Home”, “At Work”, “In Brownsdale, Minn.”).
- GPS global positioning system
- users interacting with the client device 102 - 110 can also use the social networking service provided by the server system 112 to define social circles to organize and categorize the user's relationships to other users of the social networking service. Examples of the creation and use of social circles are provided in the description of FIG. 2 .
- the client devices 102 - 110 can be provided as computing devices such as laptop or desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, portable media players, tablet computers, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used to communicate with an electronic social network.
- the server system 112 can be a single computing device such as a computer server. In some implementations, the server system 112 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer (e.g., cloud computing).
- the network 114 can be a public communication network (e.g., the Internet, cellular data network, dialup modems over a telephone network) or a private communications network (e.g., private LAN, leased lines).
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example social network 200 including social circles.
- a user 202 is a member of a social network that supports the creation and use of social circles (e.g., the social network provided by the server device 112 of FIG. 1 ).
- the user 202 has a number of contacts 204 a - 204 i with which the user 202 can have some form of relationship (e.g., friends, coworkers, customers, teammates, clients, relatives, club members, classmates).
- the user 202 categorizes the contacts 204 a - 204 i by assigning them to one or more social circles, such as a social circle 210 , a social circle 220 , and a social circle 230 .
- the social circle 210 is a personal circle.
- personal circles are groupings created by and may be known only to the user 202 (e.g., the contacts 204 a , 204 b may receive no indication that they are in the user's 202 personal social circle 210 ).
- personal social circles are groupings created by the user 202 and may be known to the user 202 as well as the contacts (e.g., contacts 204 a , 204 b ) that are members of the social circle (e.g., the contacts 204 a , 204 b receive an indication that they have been added to the personal social circle 210 ).
- personal circles may be used to organize and categorize the contacts 204 a - 204 i in ways that are relevant to the user 202 .
- the user 202 may use personal social circles to organize contacts in order to discretely target which of his contacts 204 a - 204 i will see certain postings or have access to particular information.
- the user 202 may be planning a surprise party for a small group of friends. As such, the user can organize contacts into “Surprise Party Attendees” and “Surprise Party Honorees” personal circles.
- the user 202 may better target selected postings to the friends attending and/or helping to plan the surprise party (i.e., Surprise Party Attendees), while targeting selected postings to friends that are to be honored at the surprise party (i.e., Surprise Party Honorees) to maintain the integrity of the surprise.
- Surprise Party Attendees i.e., Surprise Party Attendees
- Surprise Party Honorees selected postings to friends that are to be honored at the surprise party
- the social circle 220 is a shared private circle, which may also be referred to simply as a shared circle.
- shared private circles are social circles that the user 202 creates and invites contacts to voluntarily join. Contacts that accept the invitation become members of the shared private circle. Members of a shared private circle can see information posted to that circle by the user 202 and can post information to be shared with other members of the shared private circle. For example, the user 202 may tend to post a large number of jokes to the social network. However, while some of the contacts 204 a - 204 i may find the jokes to be entertaining, others may find them to be simply annoying.
- the user 202 may create a “jokes” shared private circle and invite some or all of the contacts 204 a - 204 i to join. With the “jokes” social circle in place, the user 202 may post witticisms to the “jokes” circle, and only those contacts who have accepted the invitation are able to see the comicality of the user 202 . Similarly, members of the shared private circle are able to post messages to the circle, and those posts are visible to other members of that circle.
- the social circle 230 is a shared public circle.
- shared public circles are social circles that the user 202 creates, and invites contacts to voluntarily join. Further, the existence of a shared public circle is publicly available such that other users of the social networking service (e.g., not necessarily just the user's 202 contacts 204 a - 204 i ) may request to join the public social circle.
- Members of shared public circles may post information to, and see updates posted by, other members of the same public shared circle.
- public shares circles may be “fan” or “group” circles (e.g., circles dedicated to a particular place, event, product, movie, celebrity, sports team, company, concept, philosophy, organization, support network).
- the user 202 may create a shared public circle for his band, and fans of his act may join the circle to discuss upcoming shows, download MP3s of the band's music, or post videos from recent concerts.
- the user 202 may create a shared public circle for alumni of his high school graduating class, which his former classmates may find and join in order to stay in touch with one another and post pictures from their school days.
- the user 202 can invite people to join the circle.
- nonmembers of the circle can request membership in the shared public circle, and membership in a shared public circle may be automatic upon request, or may require the user's 202 approval to become members of the shared public circle.
- one or more default social circles can be provided or suggested to a user when the user subscribes to a social networking service. For example, “Friends,” “Family,” and “Coworkers” social circles can automatically be provided in a user's profile upon the user subscribing to the particular social networking service. Other social circles can automatically be provided including, for example, an “Acquaintances” social circle and/or a “Just Following” social circle.
- the automatically created or suggested social circles can include personal social circles.
- default social circles can be automatically provided, it may be left to the user to actually populate the default social circles with contacts. For example, each of the default social circles may initially be empty of contacts, and the user populates each of the default social circles as discussed in further detail herein.
- digital content can be distributed to contacts within the social networking service including one or more social circles, such that they are exclusively viewable by the indicated contacts and/or contacts within one or more indicated social circles.
- a user of the social networking service can generate a post and indicate one or more social circles for distribution of the post.
- an auto-complete component enables the user to type in part of the name of a social circle and/or individual contact to specify which social circles and/or individual contacts require delivery of the post content.
- a post data set is transmitted from the user's client computing device (e.g., client device 102 of FIG. 1 ) to a distribution hub, which can be provided at a server (e.g., server system 112 of FIG.
- the post data set includes a plurality of data.
- the post data set includes post content data (e.g., text, uniform resource indicator (URI)), timestamp data (e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the post was generated), distribution data (e.g., contacts and/or one or more social circles), and identification (ID) data (e.g., an ID assigned to the post data set upon generation of the post).
- post content data e.g., text, uniform resource indicator (URI)
- timestamp data e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the post was generated
- distribution data e.g., contacts and/or one or more social circles
- ID identification
- the distribution data is processed to provide an access control list (ACL) that specifies which contacts within the social networking system are granted access to the post content.
- ACL access control list
- social affinity scores can also be processed to provide the ACL.
- the distribution data can indicate that the post content is to be accessible by and/or distributed to a particular user.
- a social affinity score can be determined for the post and can be specific to a relationship between the particular user and the author of the post. In some examples, if the social affinity score is below a threshold score, it is determined that the post content will not be accessible by and/or distributed to the particular user. Consequently, although the particular user had been explicitly targeted for distribution of the post by the author, the particular user is not provided in the ACL for the post.
- the social affinity score is at or above the threshold score, it is determined that the post content will be accessible by and/or distributed to the particular user. Consequently, the particular user had been explicitly targeted for distribution of the post by the author and the particular user is provided in the ACL for the post.
- the distribution hub determines end points the post data set is to be distributed to based on the ACL. More specifically, the set of contacts that may care about the post and/or that are allowed access to the post is determined based on the ACL, and the ID of the post is written to a per user/view index at the distribution hub. When fetching posts to distribute to a user, the user/view index is accessed and the IDs of the various posts that the user is allowed to view are determined. The post data sets are retrieved from a data store (e.g., data store 118 of FIG. 1 ) and are transmitted to a client device associated with the requesting user.
- a data store e.g., data store 118 of FIG. 1
- interaction can include original distribution of an item (i.e., when the item was posted to the social networking service), a comment appended to the item (e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) posts a comment to the item), an endorsement of the item (e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) indicates that they endorse the item), sharing of the item (e.g., when a non-author user re-posts, or otherwise redistributes the item within the social networking service).
- a comment appended to the item e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) posts a comment to the item
- an endorsement of the item e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) indicates that they endorse the item
- sharing of the item e.g., when a non-author user re-posts, or otherwise redistribu
- FIG. 3 depicts a screen-shot 300 of an example graphical user interface for creating and maintaining social circles.
- a social graph editor user interface (UI) 301 is shown.
- the UI 301 can be the interface presented by a purpose made social networking application, while in some implementations the UI 301 can be one or more web pages of a social networking website displayed in a general purpose web browser.
- the UI 301 includes a number of choices presented in a menu bar 305 .
- the “Social Network” choice has been selected by a user. This selection causes a web-based social networking application to be executed and a social network menu 310 to be displayed.
- the social network menu 310 includes a profile indicator 312 in which information such as a user name 314 and a user image 316 associated with the currently logged in user are displayed.
- the social network menu 310 also displays, among other items, a social circles sub-menu 318 .
- the social circles sub-menu 318 when selected (e.g., as represented by the highlighting of the submenu's title), causes a social circle display 320 to be presented.
- the social circle display 320 includes a number of circles 322 a - 322 e that are visual representations of various social circles that the user has created or has permission to edit. Each of the circles 322 a - 322 e displays information about the social circle it represents.
- the circle 322 c displays a name 324 a , a count 324 b of the number of contacts associated with the social circle, and an indication 324 c of what kind of circle (e.g., personal, private shared, public shared) that the circle 322 c is.
- the social circle display 320 also includes a contact display 326 .
- the contact display 326 provides a graphical interface for viewing, selecting, and organizing items in the user's contact lists.
- a collection of contact icons 328 a - 328 i represents the contacts or other entities (e.g., organizations, places, or other items) socially networked with the particular user.
- the icons can be digital photos of the contacts they represent (e.g., the icons 328 a , 328 d ), arbitrary images (e.g., the icons 328 b , 328 g ), or placeholders (e.g., when the contact has no image associated with their account, such as the icon 328 c ).
- the icons can include additional information, such as the names of each contact.
- a scroll bar 329 is provided for the user to view additional contact icons that may not fit into the initial view.
- FIG. 4 depicts a screen-shot of an example stream page 400 for a user of a social networking service.
- the stream page 400 can be provided as a web page within a website of a social networking service, and can display digital content that has been shared with a user associated with the stream page 400 .
- the example user includes “Rob McDavies” and the stream page 400 displays items (i.e., digital content) that other users have shared with the user and/or items that the user has shared with other users.
- the stream page 400 includes a social network menu 402 and an item region 404 .
- Example items 406 , 408 that have been distributed to the user are displayed in the item region 404 .
- the items 406 , 408 displayed in the item region 404 include digital content that is distributed to the user from contacts established within the social networking service.
- a content sharing interface 410 can also be provided in the item region 404 . The user can activate (e.g., click on) the content sharing interface 410 to share digital content.
- two items 406 , 408 are depicted in FIG. 4 , it is appreciated that the stream page 400 can display any number of items to the user.
- connection scores that each represents an interaction between a user and a respective contact within a computer-implemented social networking service.
- the connection scores reflect a degree of interaction between the user and each of the respective contacts.
- contacts of the user can be displayed in a rank order based on the respective connection scores.
- a graphical representation of a relationship between a user and a contact within the social networking service can be provided based on a respective connection score.
- a relationship between a user and a contact within the social networking service can decay based on a respective connection score. In some examples, the relationship can decay to the point that the user and the contact are no longer considered as being connected within the social networking service.
- a connection score (CS) between a user and a contact is user- and contact-specific and is determined based on the social affinity between the user and the contact. In some examples, the connection score is determined based on interactions between the user and the contact within the social networking service.
- Example interactions can include original distribution of an item (i.e., when the item was posted to the social networking service), a comment appended to the item (e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) posts a comment to the item), an endorsement of the item (e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) indicates that they endorse the item), sharing of the item (e.g., when a non-author user re-posts, or otherwise redistributes the item within the social networking service).
- a comment appended to the item e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) posts a comment to the item
- an endorsement of the item e.g., when a user (either the author of the item or non-author of the item) indicates that they endorse the item
- sharing of the item e.g., when a non-author user re-posts, or otherwise redis
- interactions can be considered equal.
- any interaction between the user and the contact can equally contribute to an increase in the connection score. For example, if the user distributes an item using the social networking service and the contact is included in the associated distribution, the connection score is increased by a value. If the user comments on an item that the contact has distributed, the connection score can be increased by the value. If the user endorses an item that the contact has distributed, the connection score can be increased by the value. If the user re-shares an item that the contact has distributed, the connection score can be increased by the value.
- a weight can be determined based on interaction type and the weight can be applied to such that the interaction contributes to an increase in the connection score by a different value than other interactions.
- the user can distribute an item using the social networking service and the contact can be included in the distribution. Consequently, a “distribution to” interaction is provided and a first weight can be associated therewith.
- the connection score can be increased by a product of the first weight and a value.
- the contact can distribute an item using the social networking service and the user can be included in the distribution. Consequently, a “distribution from” interaction is provided and a second weight can be associated therewith.
- connection score can be increased by a product of the second weight and the value.
- the user can comment on an item distributed by the contact using the social networking service. Consequently, a “comment to” interaction is provided and a third weight can be associated therewith.
- the connection score can be increased by a product of the third weight and the value.
- the contact can comment on an item distributed by the user using the social networking service. Consequently, a “comment from” interaction is provided and a fourth weight can be associated therewith. In response to the interaction, the connection score can be increased by a product of the fourth weight and the value.
- the user can share an item distributed by the contact using the social networking service. Consequently, a “re-share to” interaction is provided and a fifth weight can be associated therewith. In response to the interaction, the connection score can be increased by a product of the fifth weight and the value.
- the contact can share an item distributed by the user using the social networking service. Consequently, a “re-share from” interaction is provided and a sixth weight can be associated therewith.
- connection score can be increased by a product of the sixth weight and the value.
- the user can endorse on an item distributed by the contact using the social networking service. Consequently, an “endorse to” interaction is provided and a seventh weight can be associated therewith.
- the connection score can be increased by a product of the seventh weight and the value.
- the contact can endorse on an item distributed by the user using the social networking service. Consequently, an “endorse from” interaction is provided and an eighth weight can be associated therewith.
- the connection score can be increased by a product of the eighth weight and the value.
- connection score is determined based on interactions between the user and the contact within the social networking service and within one or more other services.
- Example other services can include an email service, a chat service and/or a blogging service.
- the connection score can be provide as a function of a plurality of connection scores, one connection score being based on interactions in the context of the social networking service and one or more other connection scores being based on interactions in the context of each of the other services.
- the user and the contact can interact using the social networking service and can interact through an email service.
- a social networking service connection score can be provided and can be based on interactions between the user and the contact within the social networking service, as discussed above.
- An email connection score can be provided (e.g., from a scoring service) and can be based on interactions between the user and the contact within the email service.
- An overall connection score can be determined based on the social networking service connection score and the email service connection score. In some examples, the overall connection score can be provided as a sum of the connections scores. In some examples, respective weights can be applied to the social networking service connection score and the email service connection score. In some examples, the email service connection score can be weighted to have less of an influence on the overall connection score than the email service connection score. In this manner, the email service can be reflected as a more intimate interaction than social networking service interactions.
- the overall connection score can be based on a chat service connection score.
- the chat service connection score can be provided (e.g., from a scoring service) and can be based on interactions between the user and the contact within the chat service (i.e., instant messages sent between the user and the contact).
- a weight can be applied to the chat connection score to have more of an influence on the overall connection score than the email service connection score and/or the social networking service connection score. In this manner, the chat service can be reflected as a more intimate interaction than social networking service and/or the email service interactions.
- An index of connection scores can be provided for each user of the social networking service.
- the index of connection scores includes a list of contacts that are direct contacts of the user within the social networking service and a respective connection score associated therewith.
- the connection scores can be retrieved from a scoring system, as discussed herein. With reference to the example of FIG. 3 , an example index of connection scores for the user Rob McDavies can be provided as:
- ID indicates a unique identifier associated with a respective contact.
- a unique identifier can include an email address of the contact.
- the respective connection scores can be determined as discussed herein.
- a connection score can be set at a maximum value (e.g., 1) when the direct relationship (e.g., a symmetrical relationship) is established between the user and the contact within the social networking service. For example, a first user adds a second user as a contact within the social networking service. The second user subsequently adds the first user as a contact within the social networking service, establishing a symmetrical relationship between the first user and the second user. In response to establishment of the symmetrical relationship, a connection score between the first user and the second user can be set to the maximum value.
- a maximum value e.g. 1, 1
- connection score does not exceed the maximum value.
- a connection score between the first user and the second user can be at a first value that is less than the maximum value. Interactions can occur between the first user and the second user, such that the connection score is to be increased to a second value that is greater than the maximum value. Consequently, the connection score is set equal to the maximum value.
- a connection score can be protected from decay for one or more contacts.
- the relationship between the user and the contact can be more significant than what is reflected within the computer-implemented social networking service.
- a husband-wife pair can be considered such that the user can include the husband and the contact can include the wife.
- the user and the contact, being husband and wife, might have significant real-world interaction on a daily basis. Consequently, interactions between the user and the contact might occur less frequently within the social networking service.
- the connection score between the user and the contact from decay, the online relationship between the user and the contact within the social networking service can be maintained although there might be minimal interaction between the user and the contact within the social networking service.
- a user interface can be provided that can receive user input indicating whether a connection score between the user and a particular contact is to be protected from decay.
- the user interface can include a checkbox interface such that, when the user checks a checkbox associated with the contact, the connection score between the user and the contact is protected from decay.
- the user and the contact could have been close friends in high school and are connected via the social networking service.
- the user and the contact might not interact frequently, the user might want to maintain the relationship within the social networking service (e.g., to not lose contact with a previously long lost friend).
- protection of connection scores can be provided based on social circles.
- the user can assign one or more contacts to a social circle. Because the contacts are members of the social circle, the connection scores between the users and the respective contacts can be protected from decay.
- contacts of the user can include parents, siblings, children, spouse and/or extended family of the user. Consequently, the user can assign each of the contacts to a family social circle. Because the contacts are members of the family social circle, the connection scores between the users and the respective contacts can be protected from decay.
- the user and the family contacts might not interact frequently, the user might want to maintain the relationships within the social networking service (e.g., to not lose online contact with family).
- connection score between a user and a contact can decay based on a lack of online interaction between the user and the contact.
- a decay value can be applied to the connection score.
- the decay value can be periodically subtracted from the connection score.
- the connection score can be periodically multiplied by the decay value.
- the decay value can be applied to the connection score based on a frequency at which the user engages the social networking service. In some examples, the frequency can be provided based on the user logging onto the social networking service. In some examples, whether the decay value is to be applied to the connection score can be determined for each log in. By way of non-limiting example, if the user logs into the social networking service, but does not interact with the contact during the session, the decay value is applied to the connection score. In some examples, whether the decay value is to be applied to the connection score can be determined based on a plurality of log ins. By way of non-limiting example, if the user logs into the social networking service X times, but does not interact with the contact during any of the respective sessions, the decay value is applied to the connection score.
- the frequency can be provided based on interaction(s) over a period of time.
- whether the decay value is to be applied to the connection score can be determined based on a number of interactions over the period of time. By way of non-limiting example, if the user interacts with the contact equal to or less than a threshold number of times over the period of time, the decay value is applied to the connection score (e.g., the user interacts with the contact X number of times over the last month).
- a strength and/or the existence of a relationship between the user and the contact can be determined based on the connection score. In some examples, if the connection score is less than or equal to a threshold connection score, the contact is removed from the user's social network within the social networking service. In some examples, the strength of relationship can be graphically displayed based on the connection score. In some examples, an image of the contact that is displayed to the user can fade as the connection score decreases. In some examples, a graphically depicted relationship gauge can be set based on the connection score.
- contacts can be displayed to the user in rank order based on connection score. In some examples, contacts having a higher connection score are displayed more prominently than contacts having a lower connection score relative to one another. With reference to the example of FIG. 3 , and the example index of connection scores above, the contact David can have the highest connection score and the contact Davis can have the lowest connections score. Consequently, the contacts are displayed in descending order based on connection score from David to Davis. In some examples, if the connection scores of two or more contacts are equal, the contacts can be displayed adjacent to one another in alphabetical order. In the example of FIG. 3 , CS DAVID and CS DEBRA can be equal and, consequently, David is displayed ahead of Debra based on alphabetical order.
- FIG. 5 depicts an example system 500 for social networking relationship ranking and decay.
- the example system 500 includes a first user 502 interacting with a first computing device 504 , a second user 506 interacting with a second computing device 508 , a first server system 510 , a second server system 512 and a network 514 .
- the first computing device 504 , the second computing device 508 , the first server system 510 and the second server system 512 can communicate with one another over the network 514 .
- a social networking service is provided and can be executed using the first and second server systems 510 , 512 .
- the first server system 510 can receive, store and distribute items posted to the social networking service by users of the social networking service (e.g., the first user 502 and the second user 506 ).
- the first server system 510 can monitor occurrences of events (e.g., item generation/distribution, comments, endorsements, sharing) and can determine which users are to receive the event (e.g., which users to deliver an item to).
- the first server system 510 can provide event data to the second server system.
- the second server system 512 provides a scoring service. The scoring service can determine the connection scores discussed herein and can provide the connection scores to the first server system 510 for social network relationship ranking and decay.
- FIGS. 6A-6C depict example graphical visualizations of relationship decay in a social networking service.
- an image 600 of a contact can be displayed to a user.
- the image 600 can be an un-faded image that reflects a connection score that is greater than a first threshold connection score.
- An image 602 of the contact can be displayed to the user.
- the image 602 can be a faded image that reflects a connection score that is less than or equal to the first threshold connection score and that is greater than a second threshold connection score.
- An image 604 of the contact can be displayed to the user.
- the image 604 can be a more severely faded image that reflects a connection score that is less than or equal to the second threshold connection score and that is greater than a third threshold connection score.
- the connection score is less than or equal to the third threshold connection score
- the image of the contact can disappear.
- a transparency of the image can be adjusted based on the connection score.
- an image 620 of a contact can be displayed to a user and can include an associated gauge 622 .
- the gauge 622 can graphically depict the connection score and can increase or decrease based on changes in the connection score.
- an image 630 of a contact can be displayed to a user and can include an associated indicator 632 .
- a characteristic (e.g., size, shape, color and/or pattern) of the indicator 632 can change based on the connection score.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of an example process 700 that can be executed in implementations of the present disclosure.
- the example process 700 can include operations that are performed using one or more computer programs executed using one or more data processing apparatus (e.g., one or more client-side computing devices and/or one or more server-side computing devices).
- the example process 700 can be used for social networking relationship ranking and decay, as discussed herein.
- Connection score data is retrieved for a particular user ( 702 ).
- the connection score data is provided as a connection score index that includes a respective connection score for each of one or more contacts of the particular user within a social networking service (e.g., the example connection score index described above).
- the connection scores are revised based on one or more decay values ( 704 ).
- the decay value can be applied to the connection scores based on a frequency at which the user engages the social networking service.
- the frequency can be provided based on the user logging onto the social networking service.
- whether the decay value is to be applied to the connection score can be determined for each log in.
- the frequency can be provided based on interaction(s) over a period of time.
- whether the decay value is to be applied to the connection score can be determined based on a number of interactions over the period of time.
- a counter n is set equal to one ( 706 ). It is determined whether a connection score (CS n ) is less than or equal to a minimum connection score (CS MIN ) ( 708 ). In some examples, CS n corresponds to a particular contact (Contact n ) of the user within the social networking service. If CS n , is less than or equal to CS MIN , Contact n is removed as a contact of the user within the social networking service ( 710 ). In some examples, Contact n is removed as a symmetric contact, but remains an asymmetric contact of the user within the social networking service. In some examples, Contact n is completely removed as a contact of the user within the social networking service. If CS n , is not less than or equal to CS MIN , it is determined whether n equal to n TOTAL ( 712 ).
- n TOTAL If n is not equal to n TOTAL , not all of the contacts of the user have been considered. Consequently, n is incremented ( 714 ) and the example process 700 loops back. If n is equal to n TOTAL , all of the contacts of the user have been considered. Contacts are ordered based on connection score ( 716 ). In some examples, contacts are ordered in descending order of connection score. Instructions are transmitted to display the contacts in order ( 718 ). In some examples, the contacts are displayed in a contact display of a web page of the social networking service (e.g., the contact display 326 of FIG. 3 ). In some examples, the contacts are displayed with graphical visualizations of relationship decay (e.g., the example graphical visualizations of FIGS. 6A-6C ).
- revision of the connection scores and/or determining whether to remove a particular contact as a contact of the user within the social networking service can occur in response to the user logging into the social networking service. In some examples, revision of the connection scores and/or determining whether to remove a particular contact as a contact of the user within the social networking service can occur in response to the user logging out of the social networking service. In such examples, the instructions to display contacts in order can be transmitted in response to the user logging back into the social networking service. In some examples, revision of the connection scores and/or determining whether to remove a particular contact as a contact of the user within the social networking service can occur on a pre-determined, periodic basis.
