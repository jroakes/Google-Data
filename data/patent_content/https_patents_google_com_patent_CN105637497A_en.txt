These data can periodically be sent in batches, or can send in real time when being collected.
Fig. 5 illustrates catching of the waiting time that user according to an embodiment of the invention experiences. Once performance library is installed on mobile equipment 450, its acquisition performance information, this information can comprise the waiting time that user organizes the member of 410 and experiences. In step 5401, whether user's gesture that performance library verifies such as button press or slip occurs. If not having user's gesture to occur, then repeating step 5401, otherwise in step 5402, whether performance library verification progress indicator illustrates in visible screen, it is preferable that in scheduled time threshold value. Such as, performance library can determine whether user's gesture occurs and whether progress indicator illustrated in 2 seconds of user's gesture afterwards. If not, then repeating step 5401, otherwise it is mobile to the time span illustrating progress indicator on the display screen of equipment 450 to be determined to start timing register in step 5403. Except measuring the time of progress indicator, performance library can also monitor use to such as storer, network is delayed, dish is delayed, battery consumption and the function working time during this period the relevant performance data added. In step 5404, whether performance library verification progress indicator completes on visible display screen. If not, then repeating step 5401, otherwise, in step 5405, timing register is stopped, and the total time being illustrated by progress indicator in step 5406 to collect during this period delayed with use, the network of storer, dish is delayed, reported back performance monitoring server 260 together with battery consumption and any other performance data that slowly function working time is relevant.
Therefore, according to Fig. 5, timing register can be started when user's gesture occurs and progress indicator shows. When progress indicator is no longer shown, it is possible to stop timing register. In an embodiment, except progress indicator, being different from and need user's gesture to start timing register, this timing register can be activated when progress indicator shows, and no matter whether it is associated with user's gesture. In another embodiment, it not start this timing register when progress indicator shows, but this time cycle can start immediately when receiving user's gesture, it is assumed that the display of the progress indicator that this gesture occurs after being also received with in user's gesture is associated. In an embodiment, it not terminate this time cycle immediately when removing progress indicator from indicating meter, but this time cycle can event afterwards terminate when occurring, such as replace progress indicator by other images of some on the display screen of mobile equipment or information. Under any circumstance, beginning and the end of the time cycle being associated with the display of progress indicator are preferably determined automatically.
In an embodiment, progress indicator can only in the visible part of mobile equipment 450 display screen its be shown beginning and end be detected. In another embodiment, performance library continuously or cycle ground carry out verifying determining progress indicator whether in the visible part of mobile equipment 450 screen. Such as, if when its start and at the end of progress indicator be visible, and if progress indicator is in the prescribed percentage reaching the total time that this progress indicator is illustrated in screen visible part, such as 75%, then in step 5406, it is possible to total time progress indicator being illustrated is reported to performance monitoring server 220. Otherwise, it is possible to report the shorter time length, such as, it is possible to the real time that report progress indicator is illustrated. Progress indicator may not occur within display screen, even if Mobile solution is just in response request, such as, makes progress indicator invisible if user scrolls screen, if or user wait response be switched to different application simultaneously. In this case, this application can respond and before user returns progress indicator, this progress indicator is disabled.
In an embodiment again, if the visible part that progress indicator is in mobile equipment 450 screen exceedes predetermined threshold value, then, in the step 5406 of Fig. 5, it is reported to performance monitoring server 260. Otherwise, the appearance of progress indicator may do not reported completely. In the step 4402 of Fig. 4, this threshold value can be preset by developer 100 or do as one likes energy monitoring server 260. In this way, the progress indicator not interfering the time length of Consumer's Experience short can not by report for data gathering object.
In an embodiment, multiple progress indicator can be timed for single user's gesture. These progress indicator may appear in certain the time window started from when user's gesture occurs, or can be the progress indicator occurred before user's gesture subsequently. Such as, this may occur in multiple image when being loaded for showing to user. In this case, the whole time (it is by representing the whole time required for loading multiple image) that any one in period progress indicator is shown can be reported. As an alternative, the time being associated with each progress indicator can be reported (it will provide the data about each image being loaded).
In additional embodiment, based on developer 100 in its Mobile solution code manually indicating user action where start and terminate, and catch the user action waiting time. Such as, as described in conjunction with Figure 7 herein, then these data can be used to the user action compared to the identical type in (against) other application, it is determined that the benchmark of this kind of user action waiting time in this application. Such as, if developer 100 starts for its instruction in its code and the user action of arrests is that the page slides, then compared with this page slip waiting time can being slided with the page in other application. This user action type manually can be specified by developer 100, or do as one likes energy monitoring server 260 detects.
In another embodiment, what performance library monitoring occurred on mobile equipment 450 freezes or low frame rate. In this case, this performance library can monitor this frame rate, and during can being captured in it, frame rate is indicated as the time length slowly, such as, by dropping to the frame rate under the threshold value of such as every second 5 frames. The data that the time cycle of collected frame rate low with this kind combines can be sent to performance monitoring server 260, to be stored in performance data storehouse 303. During the cycle when progress indicator is illustrated in the Mobile solution on mobile equipment 450, or during any part of user's session in Mobile solution, the cycle of low frame rate can be detected and store. A kind of catch number of pictures per second order and when frame rate is lower than the frequency that the method for time length during threshold value is the write operation monitoring the display interface to mobile equipment. Attempting cycle when writing (during not being in sleep cycle) and can be used to subsequently indicate low frame rate lower than cycle during some threshold value when writing, and the time length that this kind is write can be timed to determine how long the time cycle that low frame rate continues has. In an embodiment, collecting additional information during this kind of time cycle of low frame rate, such as, a part for the Mobile solution now performed can be identified, or, the end user's input before low frame rate event can be identified. By this way, the border, field that low frame rate occurs wherein can also be reported, so that developer aids developers can determine the reason of low frame rate.
In an embodiment, performance monitoring storehouse 301 can the person of being developed 100 be used in production environment, such as, after the version of Mobile solution is done and is distributed to final user. In addition, or as an alternative, such as, test and exploitation is being experienced when Mobile solution, and before this Mobile solution is distributed to terminal user, performance monitoring storehouse 301 can the person of being developed 100 be used in exploitation and test environment.
In another environment again, detection progress indicator and use, the network of such as storer is delayed, dish is delayed, the instrument of battery consumption and the performance metric being associated of slow function working time is inserted in this Mobile solution during the compiling of Mobile solution, such as, with the use of the plug-in unit that this instrument is added to compiler. As an alternative, performance monitoring storehouse 301 can be used the performance data during the working time detected progress indicator and be collected in Mobile solution.
One of the present invention can the embodiment of alternative in the step 5402 of Fig. 5, replacement determines whether performance indicator is loaded in certain time threshold after user's gesture, in step 5402, performance library monitors the function call tree initiated by user's gesture, and in step 5403, start timing register when then only the function in this function call tree initiates performance indicator, otherwise, repeat Fig. 5.
Fig. 6 illustrates the acquirement of performance data according to an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 6 shows how Mobile solution developer 100 can assess the performance reported by performance library. In step 6401, it may also be useful to the developer of developer's computer 100 is signed in in performance monitoring server 260 by network 500. Login certificate can be initialised in the step 4402 of Fig. 4 and be stored in the database on performance monitoring server 260.
