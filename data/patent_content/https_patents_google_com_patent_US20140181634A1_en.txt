Definitions
- This specification relates to providing digital content items (e.g., advertisements and/or other types of content) to users in a display environment.
- display environments include electronic publications such as webpages accessible via a web browser application executing on a computer system that has connectivity with the Internet, on a point-of-sale kiosk or, more generally, on any appropriate display in essentially any suitable context or environment.
- Publishers may include content such as content sponsoring in their respective publications to help financially support their operations. Some publishers do not maintain a content sponsoring (e.g., advertising) infrastructure, and thus depend on third party content sponsor serving companies to recruit content sponsors and to serve content items to the publishers' sites. Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances. For example, a content sponsor serving company can provide directed content items, such as advertisements, to certain groups of users.
- content sponsoring e.g., advertising
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and non-transitory computer storage media encoded with computer programs that include the actions of receiving feedback from a client device at which a presentation page of content items is displayed, the received feedback relating to an affirmative act performed by the user, determining, based at least in part on the received feedback, whether the user is likely to perform a predetermined action relative to one or more of the content items, based on a result of the determining, selectively identifying one or more replacement content items and transmitting the one or more identified replacement content items to the client device for display in the presentation page in place of one or more of the plurality of content items.
- the presentation page may be a dynamic webpage and at least one of the content items may be an independently replaceable advertisement.
- Determining whether the user is likely to perform the predetermined action may be performed by a logic engine applying pre-defined rules.
- One or more of the rules may be based on factors including one or more a nature of the affirmative act performed by the user, a duration of time spent on the presentation page by the user, demographics of the user, browsing history of the user, a type of the client device, a geographic location of the client device, and one or more other external factors.
- the pre-defined rules may be defined by one or more of a publisher of the presentation page, a content sponsor of at least one content item, and the user. Selectively identifying one or more replacement content items may involve applying one or more of the pre-defined rules.
- Receiving feedback from the client device may be performed in real time relative to the user's affirmative act.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and non-transitory computer storage media encoded with computer programs that include the actions of displaying to a user a presentation page of content items, detecting an affirmative act performed by the user from which an inference can be made relating to one or more of the displayed content items, transmitting feedback corresponding to the detected affirmative user action to a server system, receiving from the server system one or more replacement content items that were selected based at least in part on the transmitted feedback, and updating the displayed presentation page to replace one or more of the displayed content items with the received one or more replacement content items.
- the affirmative act performed by the user may involve causing a focus point on a client device displaying the presentation page to pass over a content item without also performing an action indicating interest in the content item.
- the focus point may be a cursor displayed on the client device, the content item may be a clickable link, and the action indicating interest may involve clicking on the clickable link.
- the focus point may be a detected eye-point of the user on the client device display.
- the affirmative act performed by the user may involve changing a display configuration of the presentation page to cause one or more content items to be relocated to a position of lesser prominence in the presentation page.
- the affirmative act performed by the user may involve changing a display configuration of the presentation page to cause one or more content items to be obscured in whole or in part. Changing the display configuration may involve one or both of resizing the presentation page and scrolling the presentation page.
- Transmitting feedback may be facilitated in real time via a cookie residing at the client device. Updating the displayed presentation page may be performed without refreshing portions of presentation page that remain unchanged. Updating the displayed presentation page may involve independently replacing the one or more displayed content items without affecting other portions of the presentation page.
- the affirmative act performed by the user may involve one or more of performing a search, interacting with a content item on the presentation page, and providing alphanumeric input.

- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- the subject matter of this specification relates to selectively replacing displayed content items (e.g., advertisements displayed in a webpage) based on user interaction or behavior (e.g., a user action detected—with the user's knowledge and consent—relative to one or more of the displayed content items).
- Online advertisers and advertising platforms e.g., Google's AdWords
- a measurement of ad success is “click-through rate,” which corresponds to the percentage of users who click on a particular ad upon having it presented to them.
- click-through rate corresponds to the percentage of users who click on a particular ad upon having it presented to them.
- the present inventors recognized that increasing the opportunity to show more relevant advertisements to users (e.g., by presenting a greater quantity of advertisements on a presentation page within the duration of the user's visit)—ideally without having to refresh the page's other content and without increasing the amount of space on the page that the inventory occupies—would increase the likelihood that the user would respond to one or more of the ads.
- an advertisement presented to a user viewing a webpage can be refreshed with a new, replacement advertisement when it is determined (e.g., based on user acts or other behavior) that the user has not, and likely will not, respond to the advertisement currently presented to the user.
- advertisement inventory i.e., the space available on a page for presentation of advertisements
- advertisement inventory tends to be better utilized thereby benefitting users, publishers, advertisers and/or content servers.
- the subject matter described here operates in a context in which the user is aware of, and has consented to, the use of user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items.
- user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example operating environment 100 in which various aspects of the subject matter described here may be implemented.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects publisher web sites 104 , user devices 106 , and the search engine 110 , and an content item management system 120 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of publisher web sites 104 and user devices 106 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource is any data that can be provided by the publisher 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling the publisher web sites 104 and indexing the resources provided by the publisher web sites 104 .
- the resources are and the index data are stored in an index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries to the search engine 110 .
- the search queries are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies the user device 106 that submits the request.
- the unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with the search engine 110 , or some other identifier that identifies the user device 106 or the user using the user device.
- the search engine 110 uses the index 112 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results page resource.
- a search result is data generated by the search engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources resulting from the search, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score).
- IR information retrieval
- the search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- the user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users. In response to the user selecting a search result at a user device 106 , the user device 106 requests the resource corresponding to the resource locator included in the selected search result.
- the publisher of the web site 104 hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from the user device 106 and provides the resource to the requesting user device 106 .
- the queries submitted from user devices 106 are stored in query logs 114 .
- Click data for the queries and the web pages referenced by the search results are stored in click logs 116 .
- the query logs 114 and the click logs 116 define search history data 117 that include data from and related to previous search requests associated with unique identifiers.
- the click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by the search engine 110 .
- the query logs 114 and click logs 116 can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to web pages that were in the search results and the actions taken by users (i.e., that data are associated with the identifiers from the search requests so that a search history for each identifier can be accessed).
- the click logs 116 and query logs 114 can thus be used by the search engine to determine the sequence of queries submitted by the user devices, the actions taken in response to the queries, and how often the queries are submitted.
- the content item management system 120 facilitates the provisioning of content items with the resources 105 .
- a variety of appropriate content items can be provided, and one example content item is an advertisement.
- content item management system 120 allows advertiser to define selection rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide relevant advertisements for the users.
- Example selection rules include keyword selection, in which advertisers provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Advertisements that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots.
- the user device 106 When a user of a user device 106 selects an advertisement, the user device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage of the advertiser.
- the publishers 104 may include advertisers, each having hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the advertisements of the advertisers.
- a resource 105 from a publisher 104 includes instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from the content item management system 120 .
- the request includes a publisher identifier and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource 105 .
- the content item management system 120 provides advertisements to the particular user device.
- the user device With respect to a search results page, the user device renders the search results page and sends a request to the content item management system 120 , along with one or more keywords related to the query that the user provide to the search engine 110 .
- the content item management system 120 provides directed content items to the particular user device.
- the content item management system 120 includes a data storage system that stores campaign data 122 and performance data 124 .
- the campaign data 122 stores advertisements, selection information, and budgeting information for advertisers.
- the performance data 124 stores data indicating the performance of the advertisements that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for advertisements, the number of impressions for advertisements, and the number of conversions for advertisements. Other performance data can also be stored.
- the campaign data 122 and the performance data 124 are used as input parameters to an advertisement auction.
- the content item management system 120 in response to each request for advertisements, conducts an auction to select advertisements that are provided in response to the request.
- the advertisements are ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in the performance data 124 .
- the highest ranked advertisements resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example environment 200 for selectively replacing content items in a presentation page 205 displayed at a client device 210 , such as a personal computer, a tablet computer, or a smart phone or other mobile device.
- the presentation page 205 e.g., a webpage rendered by a browser application executing on the client device 210 , includes not only content provided by the presentation page's publisher 220 , but also includes an inventory of content spaces (labeled A, B, C, D, E in FIG. 2 ) in which ads or other content items can be displayed.
- the ads to be displayed in the spaces A-E are received from a content server 225 (e.g., an advertising server) and are rendered by the browser application in the respective spaces A-E.
- a content server 225 e.g., an advertising server
- the content spaces A-E are individually and selectively replaceable, e.g., in response to detected user interactions with the presentation page, and without the need to refresh or change the presentation page's other content.
- the presentation page Publisher 220 analyzes actions performed at the client device 210 (e.g., by placing a cookie with the browser executing on the client device 210 ) relative to the presentation page 205 , and relays information about the performed actions to the Analytics Engine 225 for storage and/or processing.
- the content replacement logic engine 230 analyzes the stored information, and applies a set of predetermined rules, to determine whether one or more items among the information supports a conclusion, or at least a reasonable inference, that the user viewing presentation page 205 likely is not interested in one or more of the content items displayed in spaces A-E.
- a suitable replacement content item is determined, which replacement in turn will be transmitted to the browser application communicating on the client device 210 and be used to replace an appropriate one of the content items currently presented in Spaces A-E.
- this replacement operation is facilitated using a dynamic webpage technology such as Ajax or iFrames so that replacement of the content item in question may be performed independently and separately from (e.g., without having to refresh or change) the other content on the presentation page 205 .
- the analytics engine 225 , content replacement logic engine 230 and content server 235 are shown as being under the control of a single entity at a central location 240 , although other configurations are possible.
- one or more of the analytics engine 225 , content replacement logic engine 230 and content server 235 may be distributed among different locations and/or may be under the control of different but cooperating entities.
- a conclusion or inference by the Logic Engine 230 that the user viewing presentation page 205 is not interested in any given content item in spaces A-E also may support a conclusion that the user will not undertake a predetermined action relative to the content item under consideration (e.g., click on a link associated with the content item, thereby redirecting the user's browser to a presentation page corresponding to subject matter of the content item—for example, an advertiser's webpage at which the user can purchase and/or learn about a product or service advertised by the content item).
- a predetermined action relative to the content item under consideration e.g., click on a link associated with the content item, thereby redirecting the user's browser to a presentation page corresponding to subject matter of the content item—for example, an advertiser's webpage at which the user can purchase and/or learn about a product or service advertised by the content item.
- FIG. 3 is a representation of a browser window 300 displaying a dynamic presentation page 305 , such as a webpage, having independently and selectively changeable content item spaces (labeled A, B, C, and D)—for example, advertisements that may be individually replaced upon detecting user disinterest.
- the webpage 305 to be displayed has a height H and a width W, which is larger than the current dimensions of browser window 300 , resulting in a hidden portion 325 of the webpage 305 that is not currently visible to the user.
- any ad or other content item designated for display in space D is not visible to the user, although the content item displayed in space D could be brought into the visible portion of the browser window 300 if, for example, the user changed a configuration of by displayed presentation page, e.g., either by resizing the browser window and/or using the scrolling controls 330 to scroll currently invisible portions of the webpage 305 into view.
- the webpage 305 also includes content items specified by the webpage's publisher, for example, the three topics 310 and image 315 .
- the publisher specified content 310 and/or 315 may also be dynamic, meaning that they can change appearance and/or size without changing or having to refresh other content on the webpage 305 .
- each of the three topics 310 may be expandable to increase in visual size and thereby display additional information, which typically results in changing the relative arrangement and organization of content elements that are displayed on the webpage 305 .
- image 315 may be clickable by the user to alternately increase or decrease in size, thereby taking up more or less of the visible portion of the webpage 305 and potentially causing rearrangement, and/or obscuration, of other content elements on the page.
- affirmative acts by the user may be used to determine or infer that the user is disinterested in a particular content item, in which case the content item of disinterest will be replaced with a new content item.
- any appropriate affirmative act by the user can be analyzed and used, at least in part, in making the determination or inference that the user is disinterested in a particular content item.
- an advertisement for stainless steel widgets is currently being displayed in space B of webpage 305 .
- the user does not click on the widget ad in Space B but rather manipulates a pointing device (e.g., mouse, stylus, finger) to cause a focus point such as a cursor (or, in cursorless devices, an indicated position on the display) to move from a first position 305 , along path 307 , to a second position 308 and does so without clicking on the widget ad displayed in space B (and/or performing any other detectable act indicating interest in the widget ad).
- a pointing device e.g., mouse, stylus, finger
- That affirmative act namely, that the user has “moused over” the widget ad in space B—may be used by the logic engine 230 (potentially along with other information) to determine or infer that the user is disinterested in the stainless steel widget ad displayed in space B, the logic being that likely the user's gaze followed movement of the cursor along path 307 , and thus necessarily saw the widget ad in space B, but because the user did not click on the widget ad, the user may be deemed to be disinterested in that ad in particular and/or in the category of the ad (e.g., widgets) in general.
- the logic engine 230 may be used by the logic engine 230 (potentially along with other information) to determine or infer that the user is disinterested in the stainless steel widget ad displayed in space B, the logic being that likely the user's gaze followed movement of the cursor along path 307 , and thus necessarily saw the widget ad in space B, but because the user did not click
- an affirmative act by a user of “mousing over” a content item without clicking on it (or taking other predetermined action) may indicate a level of interest in the content item.
- a determination may be made either not to replace the content item in question or replace it with a complementary content item, e.g., one related to the same general subject matter or topic.
- an affirmative user act from which disinterest may be inferred may include a determination that a focus point corresponding to the user's eye-point and/or gaze moved across, and/or potentially temporarily lingered on for a predetermined duration, a particular content item but did so without taking any action indicating interest in that item (e.g., clicking on it).
- the user may change a configuration of the displayed presentation page, e.g., by resizing and/or scrolling the browser window 300 such that content items in one or more of the spaces A-D are obscured in whole or part, and/or caused to be relocated in the browser window to a position of lesser prominence (e.g., positions nearer the periphery of the browser window may be considered lesser prominent that positions nearer the center of the display) thereby supporting a reasonable inference that the user is disinterested in the content item or items that have been partially or wholly obscured.
- user interaction with the publisher specified content 310 and/or 315 may serve as affirmative acts by the user from which disinterest in a particular content item may be determined or inferred.
- Topic 3 the bottommost topic at 310
- the displayed information associate with Topic 3 may increase in size thereby effectively moving space C downward on the webpage 305 and/or causing space C to be partially obscured, thereby providing support for an inference that the user is disinterested in the ad currently displayed in space C.
- an affirmative act by a user of performing a search may be used by the logic engine as feedback in deciding whether and/or how to replace a currently displayed content item.
- a user of a browser application could perform a search (e.g., using an embedded search box to search within that page or by using control-F functionality, such as provided by many applications, or potentially by opening up another browser tab and searching on a search engine in another window), and the resulting search terms (and/or the search results) could be used by the logic engine in making decisions about replacing one or more content items displayed on the presentation page.
- any or all of the following may be used by the logic engine as feedback signals—but only with the user's knowledge and express permission—in making decisions about replacing one or more content items displayed on the presentation page:
- affirmative user acts may additionally, or alternatively, serve as a basis of inference about the type of content item with which the current item should be replaced. For example, in the example of FIG. 3 , assume that the user affirmatively clicks on image 315 , thereby causing it to enlarge per the webpage publisher's specifications. From that affirmative act—specifically, enlarging the image 315 thereby expressing interest in the image—a reasonable inference may be made that the user is inclined towards visual or graphic (as opposed to textual) content.
- this inference may be used subsequently by the logic engine as a weighting factor in deciding what type of replacement content items to cause to be served to the client device 210 .
- the logic engine may be used subsequently by the logic engine as a weighting factor in deciding what type of replacement content items to cause to be served to the client device 210 .
- a reasonable inference can be made that a subsequent replacement content item should be complementary to the selected topic because such as complementary content item is likely to be of interest to the user.
- FIG. 4A is a flowchart of an example process 400 performed by a server system to facilitate selectively replacing—in response to inferring likely disinterest—content items in a presentation page displayed at a client device (e.g., a webpage displayed in a browser window executing on the client device).
- the process 400 operates in a context in which the user is aware of, and has consented to, the use of user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items.
- the process 400 receives feedback from a client device that displays a presentation page composed of multiple content items (e.g., clickable advertisements), one or more of which are selectively and independently replaceable.
- the received feedback relates, e.g., to an affirmative act performed by the user such as moving a cursor past a displayed content item without also performing a predetermined action such as clicking on the displayed content item, changing a configuration of the display (e.g., resizing or scrolling a display window) in a manner that expresses disinterest in one or more of the content items, or the like.
- the feedback from the client device is collected by a system controlled by a publisher of the presentation page and relayed to an analytics engine for analysis and storage.
- the process 400 determines, based at least in part on the received feedback but potentially also on other information, whether the user is likely to perform a predetermined action relative to one or more of the content items displayed in the presentation page. For example, assuming that the content item is a clickable ad and the predetermined action is clicking on the ad (thereby expressing interest in the ad), the process 400 may infer from the received feedback relating to affirmative user acts that the user is unlikely to click on the displayed ad. In an implementation, this determination may be made by the content replacement logic engine, which communicates with the analytics engine storing the received feedback relating to the affirmative user acts.
- the logic engine may use a set of predetermine rules to decide when a content item is to be replaced and potentially also the nature or type of content item that should serve as the replacement.
- the logic engine's rules may be based on any or all of several different factors such as the quantity and/or nature of the affirmative acts (e.g., the affirmative act of scrolling the browser window to obscure the content item may be accorded a higher weight than, e.g., the affirmative act of mousing over the content window without clicking on it), the duration of time spent on the presentation page, the user's demographics, the user's browsing history, the type of client device (e.g., desktop, table or smartphone), the type of browser application, the device's geographic location, other external factors (e.g., time of day) or the like.
- the affirmative acts e.g., the affirmative act of scrolling the browser window to obscure the content item may be accorded a higher weight than, e.g., the affirmative act of mousing over the content window
- the process selectively identifies one or more replacement content items. For example, if the process 400 determines at 410 that replacement of a content item in the presentation page is appropriate or otherwise warranted, then the process 400 identifies a specific available content item to serve as the replacement.
- the logic engine in cooperation with the content item server, applies one or more rules relating to the replacement selection and suitability to identify a specific replacement content item.
- the rules applied by the logic engine potentially may be specified and/or modified by one or more various entities including the presentation page publisher, the advertiser, and/or the user.
- the rules applied by the logic engine may arbitrarily complex, taking into multiple different factors.
- an advertiser may specify a replacement rule to the effect of “if the user performs an affirmative act such that ad X is caused to obscured from view in whole or part (e.g., either through resizing or scrolling of the browser window) within 4 seconds of initial display within the webpage, and the user in in the Southern United States, then display ad Y.”
- a logic engine rule may specify that “if a displayed content item relates to category Z (e.g., finance, sports, travel, etc.), and if the user performs the affirmative act of moving the cursor over the content item without also performing a predetermined action indicating interest in the content item (e.g., clicking on it), then replace the content item with another content item take from a category other than Z.”
- the latter example rule optionally may also specify that no replacement ads in category Z are to be served for a specified duration of time (e.g., the
- the process 400 transmits the one or more identified replacement content items to the client device for display in the presentation page in place of one or more of the presently displayed content items.
- the presentation page is dynamic (e.g., a dynamic webpage)
- technologies such as Ajax or iFrames can be used to replace each content item independently and selectively, and without refreshing, changing or otherwise disrupting other content on the presentation page.
- CTRs Click-Through-Rates
- CPM cost per thousand impressions
- conversion rates can be charged for replacement advertisements (or, more generally, replacement content items) from the rates charged for ads displayed in a webpage in the first instance. For example, depending on the circumstances, a replacement ad rate may be either lesser or greater than the rate charged for an ad displayed along with the original rendering of the webpage.
- FIG. 4B is a flowchart of an example process 430 performed by a client device to facilitate selectively replacing content items in a presentation page displayed at a client device.
- the process 430 operates in a context in which the user is aware of, and has consented to, the use of user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items.
- a presentation page comprising a plurality of content items (e.g., a dynamic webpage composed of content including one or more ads that are individually and independently replaceable) is displayed to a user.
- the process 430 detects an affirmative act performed by the user from which an inference can be made relating to one or more of the displayed content items. For example, the process 430 may detect that the user has moused over an ad without clicking on it, or has resized or scrolled a browser to obscure partially or wholly one or more ads, in which case a reasonable inference can be made that the user is disinterested in the ad.
- the process 430 transmits feedback corresponding to the detected affirmative user action to a server system (comprised, e.g., of an analytics engine, a replacement logic engine and a content item server) at which, for example, content replacement decisions (e.g., whether to replace and, if so, with what it should be replace) may be made.
- a server system comprised, e.g., of an analytics engine, a replacement logic engine and a content item server
- content replacement decisions e.g., whether to replace and, if so, with what it should be replace
- the process 430 receives from the server system one or more replacement content items that were selected based at least in part on the transmitted feedback.
- the process 430 updates the displayed presentation page (e.g., without affecting other content on the page) to replace one or more of the displayed content items with the received one or more replacement content items.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

Abstract
Description
- This specification relates to providing digital content items (e.g., advertisements and/or other types of content) to users in a display environment. Examples of display environments include electronic publications such as webpages accessible via a web browser application executing on a computer system that has connectivity with the Internet, on a point-of-sale kiosk or, more generally, on any appropriate display in essentially any suitable context or environment.
- Publishers (e.g., web site publishers) may include content such as content sponsoring in their respective publications to help financially support their operations. Some publishers do not maintain a content sponsoring (e.g., advertising) infrastructure, and thus depend on third party content sponsor serving companies to recruit content sponsors and to serve content items to the publishers' sites. Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances. For example, a content sponsor serving company can provide directed content items, such as advertisements, to certain groups of users.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and non-transitory computer storage media encoded with computer programs that include the actions of receiving feedback from a client device at which a presentation page of content items is displayed, the received feedback relating to an affirmative act performed by the user, determining, based at least in part on the received feedback, whether the user is likely to perform a predetermined action relative to one or more of the content items, based on a result of the determining, selectively identifying one or more replacement content items and transmitting the one or more identified replacement content items to the client device for display in the presentation page in place of one or more of the plurality of content items.
- The presentation page may be a dynamic webpage and at least one of the content items may be an independently replaceable advertisement. The affirmative act performed by the user may involve an action from which disinterest in one or more content items can reasonably be inferred. Determining whether the user is likely to perform the predetermined action may involve inferring whether the user is likely to perform an action indicating interest in one or more content items. Inferring whether the user is likely to perform an action indicating interest in one or more content items may involve deciding whether the user is likely to click on a link associated with a content item.
- Determining whether the user is likely to perform the predetermined action may be performed by a logic engine applying pre-defined rules. One or more of the rules may be based on factors including one or more a nature of the affirmative act performed by the user, a duration of time spent on the presentation page by the user, demographics of the user, browsing history of the user, a type of the client device, a geographic location of the client device, and one or more other external factors. The pre-defined rules may be defined by one or more of a publisher of the presentation page, a content sponsor of at least one content item, and the user. Selectively identifying one or more replacement content items may involve applying one or more of the pre-defined rules.
- Receiving feedback from the client device may be performed in real time relative to the user's affirmative act.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in systems, methods performed by data processing apparatus and non-transitory computer storage media encoded with computer programs that include the actions of displaying to a user a presentation page of content items, detecting an affirmative act performed by the user from which an inference can be made relating to one or more of the displayed content items, transmitting feedback corresponding to the detected affirmative user action to a server system, receiving from the server system one or more replacement content items that were selected based at least in part on the transmitted feedback, and updating the displayed presentation page to replace one or more of the displayed content items with the received one or more replacement content items.
- The affirmative act performed by the user may involve causing a focus point on a client device displaying the presentation page to pass over a content item without also performing an action indicating interest in the content item. The focus point may be a cursor displayed on the client device, the content item may be a clickable link, and the action indicating interest may involve clicking on the clickable link. The focus point may be a detected eye-point of the user on the client device display.
- The affirmative act performed by the user may involve changing a display configuration of the presentation page to cause one or more content items to be relocated to a position of lesser prominence in the presentation page. The affirmative act performed by the user may involve changing a display configuration of the presentation page to cause one or more content items to be obscured in whole or in part. Changing the display configuration may involve one or both of resizing the presentation page and scrolling the presentation page.
- Transmitting feedback may be facilitated in real time via a cookie residing at the client device. Updating the displayed presentation page may be performed without refreshing portions of presentation page that remain unchanged. Updating the displayed presentation page may involve independently replacing the one or more displayed content items without affecting other portions of the presentation page.
- The affirmative act performed by the user may involve one or more of performing a search, interacting with a content item on the presentation page, and providing alphanumeric input.
- Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- In general, the subject matter of this specification relates to selectively replacing displayed content items (e.g., advertisements displayed in a webpage) based on user interaction or behavior (e.g., a user action detected—with the user's knowledge and consent—relative to one or more of the displayed content items). Online advertisers and advertising platforms (e.g., Google's AdWords) seek to show a user a successful advertisement (or “ad”) at the right time, where success typically is regarded as occurring when the user responds to the ad (e.g., clicks on it when the ad is displayed as a link in a webpage). For online advertising, a measurement of ad success is “click-through rate,” which corresponds to the percentage of users who click on a particular ad upon having it presented to them. Because webpages and other presentation displays are finite in extent, however, only a limited quantity of ads can be presented at one time on any given presentation page. As a result, a user visiting a webpage for a certain amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) will be exposed to only a handful of ads (e.g., 5-7) during that webpage visit, and not infrequently, the displayed ads are not relevant or otherwise of interest to the user and thus are not clicked on or otherwise responded to by the user.
- The present inventors recognized that increasing the opportunity to show more relevant advertisements to users (e.g., by presenting a greater quantity of advertisements on a presentation page within the duration of the user's visit)—ideally without having to refresh the page's other content and without increasing the amount of space on the page that the inventory occupies—would increase the likelihood that the user would respond to one or more of the ads. To accomplish this, for example, an advertisement presented to a user viewing a webpage can be refreshed with a new, replacement advertisement when it is determined (e.g., based on user acts or other behavior) that the user has not, and likely will not, respond to the advertisement currently presented to the user. Consequently, advertisement inventory (i.e., the space available on a page for presentation of advertisements) tends to be better utilized thereby benefitting users, publishers, advertisers and/or content servers. The subject matter described here operates in a context in which the user is aware of, and has consented to, the use of user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items. Various alternatives, options and implementations are possible as described herein.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample operating environment 100 in which various aspects of the subject matter described here may be implemented. Acomputer network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectspublisher web sites 104,user devices 106, and thesearch engine 110, and an contentitem management system 120. Theonline environment 100 may include many thousands ofpublisher web sites 104 anduser devices 106. - A
website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 is maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A resource is any data that can be provided by the
publisher 104 over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network. - To facilitate searching of these resources 105, the
search engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling thepublisher web sites 104 and indexing the resources provided by thepublisher web sites 104. The resources are and the index data are stored in anindex 112. - The
user devices 106 submit search queries to thesearch engine 110. The search queries are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies theuser device 106 that submits the request. The unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with thesearch engine 110, or some other identifier that identifies theuser device 106 or the user using the user device. - In response to the search request, the
search engine 110 uses theindex 112 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries. Thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to theuser devices 106 in search results page resource. A search result is data generated by thesearch engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. - The search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources resulting from the search, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score). The search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- The
user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users. In response to the user selecting a search result at auser device 106, theuser device 106 requests the resource corresponding to the resource locator included in the selected search result. The publisher of theweb site 104 hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from theuser device 106 and provides the resource to the requestinguser device 106. - In some implementations, the queries submitted from
user devices 106 are stored in query logs 114. Click data for the queries and the web pages referenced by the search results are stored in click logs 116. The query logs 114 and the click logs 116 define search history data 117 that include data from and related to previous search requests associated with unique identifiers. The click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by thesearch engine 110. The query logs 114 and clicklogs 116 can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to web pages that were in the search results and the actions taken by users (i.e., that data are associated with the identifiers from the search requests so that a search history for each identifier can be accessed). The click logs 116 and querylogs 114 can thus be used by the search engine to determine the sequence of queries submitted by the user devices, the actions taken in response to the queries, and how often the queries are submitted. - The content
item management system 120 facilitates the provisioning of content items with the resources 105. A variety of appropriate content items can be provided, and one example content item is an advertisement. In the case of advertisements, contentitem management system 120 allows advertiser to define selection rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide relevant advertisements for the users. Example selection rules include keyword selection, in which advertisers provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Advertisements that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots. - When a user of a
user device 106 selects an advertisement, theuser device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage of the advertiser. For example, thepublishers 104 may include advertisers, each having hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the advertisements of the advertisers. - These directed content items can be provided for many different resources, such as the resources 105 of the
publishers 104, and on a search results page resource. For example, a resource 105 from apublisher 104 includes instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from the contentitem management system 120. The request includes a publisher identifier and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource 105. The contentitem management system 120, in turn, provides advertisements to the particular user device. - With respect to a search results page, the user device renders the search results page and sends a request to the content
item management system 120, along with one or more keywords related to the query that the user provide to thesearch engine 110. The contentitem management system 120, in turn, provides directed content items to the particular user device. - In the case of advertisements, the content
item management system 120 includes a data storage system that storescampaign data 122 andperformance data 124. Thecampaign data 122 stores advertisements, selection information, and budgeting information for advertisers. Theperformance data 124 stores data indicating the performance of the advertisements that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for advertisements, the number of impressions for advertisements, and the number of conversions for advertisements. Other performance data can also be stored. - The
campaign data 122 and theperformance data 124 are used as input parameters to an advertisement auction. In particular, the contentitem management system 120, in response to each request for advertisements, conducts an auction to select advertisements that are provided in response to the request. The advertisements are ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in theperformance data 124. The highest ranked advertisements resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of anexample environment 200 for selectively replacing content items in apresentation page 205 displayed at aclient device 210, such as a personal computer, a tablet computer, or a smart phone or other mobile device. As shown therein, thepresentation page 205, e.g., a webpage rendered by a browser application executing on theclient device 210, includes not only content provided by the presentation page'spublisher 220, but also includes an inventory of content spaces (labeled A, B, C, D, E inFIG. 2 ) in which ads or other content items can be displayed. Typically, the ads to be displayed in the spaces A-E are received from a content server 225 (e.g., an advertising server) and are rendered by the browser application in the respective spaces A-E. - In the example of
FIG. 2 , the content spaces A-E are individually and selectively replaceable, e.g., in response to detected user interactions with the presentation page, and without the need to refresh or change the presentation page's other content. As a result, a greater quantity and/or variety of ads or other content items can be displayed to the user while the user is viewing the presentation page. To facilitate this functionality, thepresentation page Publisher 220 analyzes actions performed at the client device 210 (e.g., by placing a cookie with the browser executing on the client device 210) relative to thepresentation page 205, and relays information about the performed actions to theAnalytics Engine 225 for storage and/or processing. Using the information stored in the analytics engine 223, the content replacement logic engine 230 (or “logic engine” for short) analyzes the stored information, and applies a set of predetermined rules, to determine whether one or more items among the information supports a conclusion, or at least a reasonable inference, that the userviewing presentation page 205 likely is not interested in one or more of the content items displayed in spaces A-E. - Upon determining that the user likely is disinterested in an advertisement or other content item displayed in a space A-E, using the
logic engine 230 inconjunction content server 235, a suitable replacement content item is determined, which replacement in turn will be transmitted to the browser application communicating on theclient device 210 and be used to replace an appropriate one of the content items currently presented in Spaces A-E. Ideally, this replacement operation is facilitated using a dynamic webpage technology such as Ajax or iFrames so that replacement of the content item in question may be performed independently and separately from (e.g., without having to refresh or change) the other content on thepresentation page 205. - In the example environment of
FIG. 2 theanalytics engine 225, contentreplacement logic engine 230 andcontent server 235 are shown as being under the control of a single entity at acentral location 240, although other configurations are possible. For example, one or more of theanalytics engine 225, contentreplacement logic engine 230 andcontent server 235 may be distributed among different locations and/or may be under the control of different but cooperating entities. - A conclusion or inference by the
Logic Engine 230 that the userviewing presentation page 205 is not interested in any given content item in spaces A-E also may support a conclusion that the user will not undertake a predetermined action relative to the content item under consideration (e.g., click on a link associated with the content item, thereby redirecting the user's browser to a presentation page corresponding to subject matter of the content item—for example, an advertiser's webpage at which the user can purchase and/or learn about a product or service advertised by the content item). -
FIG. 3 is a representation of abrowser window 300 displaying adynamic presentation page 305, such as a webpage, having independently and selectively changeable content item spaces (labeled A, B, C, and D)—for example, advertisements that may be individually replaced upon detecting user disinterest. As shown, thewebpage 305 to be displayed has a height H and a width W, which is larger than the current dimensions ofbrowser window 300, resulting in ahidden portion 325 of thewebpage 305 that is not currently visible to the user. As a result, in the state shown, any ad or other content item designated for display in space D is not visible to the user, although the content item displayed in space D could be brought into the visible portion of thebrowser window 300 if, for example, the user changed a configuration of by displayed presentation page, e.g., either by resizing the browser window and/or using the scrolling controls 330 to scroll currently invisible portions of thewebpage 305 into view. - The
webpage 305 also includes content items specified by the webpage's publisher, for example, the threetopics 310 andimage 315. Because thewebpage 305 is dynamic, the publisher specifiedcontent 310 and/or 315 may also be dynamic, meaning that they can change appearance and/or size without changing or having to refresh other content on thewebpage 305. For example, each of the threetopics 310 may be expandable to increase in visual size and thereby display additional information, which typically results in changing the relative arrangement and organization of content elements that are displayed on thewebpage 305. Similarly,image 315 may be clickable by the user to alternately increase or decrease in size, thereby taking up more or less of the visible portion of thewebpage 305 and potentially causing rearrangement, and/or obscuration, of other content elements on the page. - As noted above, affirmative acts by the user (including, e.g., proactive actions undertaken by the user and not merely inaction) relative to the
webpage 305 may be used to determine or infer that the user is disinterested in a particular content item, in which case the content item of disinterest will be replaced with a new content item. In general, essentially any appropriate affirmative act by the user can be analyzed and used, at least in part, in making the determination or inference that the user is disinterested in a particular content item. - For example, assume that an advertisement for stainless steel widgets is currently being displayed in space B of
webpage 305. Assume further that the user does not click on the widget ad in Space B but rather manipulates a pointing device (e.g., mouse, stylus, finger) to cause a focus point such as a cursor (or, in cursorless devices, an indicated position on the display) to move from afirst position 305, alongpath 307, to asecond position 308 and does so without clicking on the widget ad displayed in space B (and/or performing any other detectable act indicating interest in the widget ad). That affirmative act—namely, that the user has “moused over” the widget ad in space B—may be used by the logic engine 230 (potentially along with other information) to determine or infer that the user is disinterested in the stainless steel widget ad displayed in space B, the logic being that likely the user's gaze followed movement of the cursor alongpath 307, and thus necessarily saw the widget ad in space B, but because the user did not click on the widget ad, the user may be deemed to be disinterested in that ad in particular and/or in the category of the ad (e.g., widgets) in general. Consequently, not only could a determination be made, using thelogic engine 230, that the ad currently displayed in space B should be replaced with a new ad—one in which hopefully the user may be interested—but also that the replacement ad (and potentially no other replacement ads to be served in the future) should relate to subject matter other than widgets. - Alternatively, depending on context and circumstances, an affirmative act by a user of “mousing over” a content item without clicking on it (or taking other predetermined action) may indicate a level of interest in the content item. In that case, a determination may be made either not to replace the content item in question or replace it with a complementary content item, e.g., one related to the same general subject matter or topic.
- Other and/or additional affirmative acts by the user from which disinterest in a particular content item may be inferred are possible. For example, if the
client device 210 employs technology that permits eye following and/or gaze following, and assuming that the user is aware that such technology is in use and has affirmatively consented to its use, an affirmative user act from which disinterest may be inferred may include a determination that a focus point corresponding to the user's eye-point and/or gaze moved across, and/or potentially temporarily lingered on for a predetermined duration, a particular content item but did so without taking any action indicating interest in that item (e.g., clicking on it). - As a further example, the user may change a configuration of the displayed presentation page, e.g., by resizing and/or scrolling the
browser window 300 such that content items in one or more of the spaces A-D are obscured in whole or part, and/or caused to be relocated in the browser window to a position of lesser prominence (e.g., positions nearer the periphery of the browser window may be considered lesser prominent that positions nearer the center of the display) thereby supporting a reasonable inference that the user is disinterested in the content item or items that have been partially or wholly obscured. Similarly, user interaction with the publisher specifiedcontent 310 and/or 315 may serve as affirmative acts by the user from which disinterest in a particular content item may be determined or inferred. For example, if in the example ofFIG. 3 , the user expands Topic 3 (the bottommost topic at 310), the displayed information associate withTopic 3 may increase in size thereby effectively moving space C downward on thewebpage 305 and/or causing space C to be partially obscured, thereby providing support for an inference that the user is disinterested in the ad currently displayed in space C. - As an additional example, an affirmative act by a user of performing a search may be used by the logic engine as feedback in deciding whether and/or how to replace a currently displayed content item. For example, while remaining on a publisher's presentation page, a user of a browser application could perform a search (e.g., using an embedded search box to search within that page or by using control-F functionality, such as provided by many applications, or potentially by opening up another browser tab and searching on a search engine in another window), and the resulting search terms (and/or the search results) could be used by the logic engine in making decisions about replacing one or more content items displayed on the presentation page.
- More generally, any or all of the following may be used by the logic engine as feedback signals—but only with the user's knowledge and express permission—in making decisions about replacing one or more content items displayed on the presentation page:
-
- adjusting the presentation page (e.g., scroll or resize window) so that content is in or out of view
- adjusting the presentation page (e.g., scroll or resize window) so that content has changed position on the page (e.g., the user scrolled up/down on the and the content item in question is still visible on the page but at a higher/lower position)
- passage of time (e.g. the content item in question has been visible for a predetermined duration of time (e.g., 30 seconds) without any action indicating interest in the content item
- cursor interaction or inaction (mouse-over) on the specific content that is under consideration for replacement
- cursor or other activity (e.g., watching a video) on other parts of the page—that is, not focusing on the content item in question but rather on other content on the page
- additional navigation within the browser (even in other tabs, which is traceable by cookie)
- Search behavior (e.g., intra-page or outside the page)
- user-added content, such as alphanumeric input (e.g., writing a review or comment on an article), the context of which could influence what content items are replaced and/or displayed
- orientation of the user device on which the page is being presented (e.g., screen orientation such as determined by an accelerometer)
- a user's exterior factors such as music playing in the background
- geolocation (e.g., either stationary or dynamic if the user is in transit)
- In addition to acting as cues that one or more content items in a dynamic presentation page are to be replaced due to inferred user disinterest, affirmative user acts may additionally, or alternatively, serve as a basis of inference about the type of content item with which the current item should be replaced. For example, in the example of
FIG. 3 , assume that the user affirmatively clicks onimage 315, thereby causing it to enlarge per the webpage publisher's specifications. From that affirmative act—specifically, enlarging theimage 315 thereby expressing interest in the image—a reasonable inference may be made that the user is inclined towards visual or graphic (as opposed to textual) content. Consequently, this inference may be used subsequently by the logic engine as a weighting factor in deciding what type of replacement content items to cause to be served to theclient device 210. Similarly, if for example the user interacts with one of the threetopics 310, a reasonable inference can be made that a subsequent replacement content item should be complementary to the selected topic because such as complementary content item is likely to be of interest to the user. -
FIG. 4A is a flowchart of anexample process 400 performed by a server system to facilitate selectively replacing—in response to inferring likely disinterest—content items in a presentation page displayed at a client device (e.g., a webpage displayed in a browser window executing on the client device). Theprocess 400 operates in a context in which the user is aware of, and has consented to, the use of user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items. At 405, theprocess 400 receives feedback from a client device that displays a presentation page composed of multiple content items (e.g., clickable advertisements), one or more of which are selectively and independently replaceable. The received feedback relates, e.g., to an affirmative act performed by the user such as moving a cursor past a displayed content item without also performing a predetermined action such as clicking on the displayed content item, changing a configuration of the display (e.g., resizing or scrolling a display window) in a manner that expresses disinterest in one or more of the content items, or the like. In an implementation, the feedback from the client device is collected by a system controlled by a publisher of the presentation page and relayed to an analytics engine for analysis and storage. - At 410, the
process 400 determines, based at least in part on the received feedback but potentially also on other information, whether the user is likely to perform a predetermined action relative to one or more of the content items displayed in the presentation page. For example, assuming that the content item is a clickable ad and the predetermined action is clicking on the ad (thereby expressing interest in the ad), theprocess 400 may infer from the received feedback relating to affirmative user acts that the user is unlikely to click on the displayed ad. In an implementation, this determination may be made by the content replacement logic engine, which communicates with the analytics engine storing the received feedback relating to the affirmative user acts. The logic engine may use a set of predetermine rules to decide when a content item is to be replaced and potentially also the nature or type of content item that should serve as the replacement. The logic engine's rules may be based on any or all of several different factors such as the quantity and/or nature of the affirmative acts (e.g., the affirmative act of scrolling the browser window to obscure the content item may be accorded a higher weight than, e.g., the affirmative act of mousing over the content window without clicking on it), the duration of time spent on the presentation page, the user's demographics, the user's browsing history, the type of client device (e.g., desktop, table or smartphone), the type of browser application, the device's geographic location, other external factors (e.g., time of day) or the like. - At 415, based on a result of the determination in 410, the process selectively identifies one or more replacement content items. For example, if the
process 400 determines at 410 that replacement of a content item in the presentation page is appropriate or otherwise warranted, then theprocess 400 identifies a specific available content item to serve as the replacement. In an implementation, in cooperation with the content item server, the logic engine applies one or more rules relating to the replacement selection and suitability to identify a specific replacement content item. The rules applied by the logic engine potentially may be specified and/or modified by one or more various entities including the presentation page publisher, the advertiser, and/or the user. - Additionally, or alternatively, the rules applied by the logic engine may arbitrarily complex, taking into multiple different factors. For example, an advertiser may specify a replacement rule to the effect of “if the user performs an affirmative act such that ad X is caused to obscured from view in whole or part (e.g., either through resizing or scrolling of the browser window) within 4 seconds of initial display within the webpage, and the user in in the Southern United States, then display ad Y.” As another example, a logic engine rule may specify that “if a displayed content item relates to category Z (e.g., finance, sports, travel, etc.), and if the user performs the affirmative act of moving the cursor over the content item without also performing a predetermined action indicating interest in the content item (e.g., clicking on it), then replace the content item with another content item take from a category other than Z.” Additionally, the latter example rule optionally may also specify that no replacement ads in category Z are to be served for a specified duration of time (e.g., the next 5 minutes).
- Next, after one or more replacement content items have been identified in 415, at 420 the
process 400 transmits the one or more identified replacement content items to the client device for display in the presentation page in place of one or more of the presently displayed content items. Where the presentation page is dynamic (e.g., a dynamic webpage), technologies such as Ajax or iFrames can be used to replace each content item independently and selectively, and without refreshing, changing or otherwise disrupting other content on the presentation page. - Typically, advertisers are charged certain rates for presentation of their ads on webpages based on factors such as Click-Through-Rates (“CTRs”), cost per thousand impressions (“CPM”), and/or conversion rates. The advertising rates to be charged for replacement advertisements (or, more generally, replacement content items) can differ from the rates charged for ads displayed in a webpage in the first instance. For example, depending on the circumstances, a replacement ad rate may be either lesser or greater than the rate charged for an ad displayed along with the original rendering of the webpage.
-
FIG. 4B is a flowchart of anexample process 430 performed by a client device to facilitate selectively replacing content items in a presentation page displayed at a client device. Theprocess 430 operates in a context in which the user is aware of, and has consented to, the use of user interaction feedback to facilitate selective replacement of content items. At 435, a presentation page comprising a plurality of content items (e.g., a dynamic webpage composed of content including one or more ads that are individually and independently replaceable) is displayed to a user. - At 440, the
process 430 detects an affirmative act performed by the user from which an inference can be made relating to one or more of the displayed content items. For example, theprocess 430 may detect that the user has moused over an ad without clicking on it, or has resized or scrolled a browser to obscure partially or wholly one or more ads, in which case a reasonable inference can be made that the user is disinterested in the ad. - At 445, the
process 430 transmits feedback corresponding to the detected affirmative user action to a server system (comprised, e.g., of an analytics engine, a replacement logic engine and a content item server) at which, for example, content replacement decisions (e.g., whether to replace and, if so, with what it should be replace) may be made. At 450, theprocess 430 receives from the server system one or more replacement content items that were selected based at least in part on the transmitted feedback. Lastly, at 455 theprocess 430 updates the displayed presentation page (e.g., without affecting other content on the page) to replace one or more of the displayed content items with the received one or more replacement content items. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.

Additionally computingdevice -
Computing device 500 includes a processor 502,memory 504, astorage device 506, a high-speed interface 508 connecting tomemory 504 and high-speed expansion ports 510, and alow speed interface 512 connecting tolow speed bus 514 andstorage device 506. Each of thecomponents computing device 500, including instructions stored in thememory 504 or on thestorage device 506 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 516 coupled tohigh speed interface 508. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 500 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 504 stores information within thecomputing device 500. In one implementation, thememory 504 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 504 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 504 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk. - The
storage device 506 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 500. In one implementation, thestorage device 506 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 504, thestorage device 506, or memory on processor 502. - The
high speed controller 508 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 500, while thelow speed controller 512 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 508 is coupled tomemory 504, display 516 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 510, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 512 is coupled tostorage device 506 and low-speed expansion port 514. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The
computing device 500 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as astandard server 520, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a rack server system 524. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 522. Alternatively, components fromcomputing device 500 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such asdevice 550. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device multiple computing devices -
Computing device 550 includes aprocessor 552,memory 564, an input/output device such as adisplay 554, acommunication interface 566, and atransceiver 568, among other components. Thedevice 550 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 552 can execute instructions within thecomputing device 550, including instructions stored in thememory 564. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. Additionally, the processor may be implemented using any of a number of architectures. For example, theprocessor 410 may be a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computers) processor, a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor, or a MISC (Minimal Instruction Set Computer) processor. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 550, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 550, and wireless communication bydevice 550. -
Processor 552 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 558 anddisplay interface 556 coupled to adisplay 554. Thedisplay 554 may be, for example, a TFT (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) display or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 556 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 554 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 558 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 552. In addition, anexternal interface 562 may be provide in communication withprocessor 552, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 550 with other devices.External interface 562 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used. - The
memory 564 stores information within thecomputing device 550. Thememory 564 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 574 may also be provided and connected todevice 550 throughexpansion interface 572, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 574 may provide extra storage space fordevice 550, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 550. Specifically,expansion memory 574 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 574 may be provide as a security module fordevice 550, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofdevice 550. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 564,expansion memory 574, or memory onprocessor 552 that may be received, for example, overtransceiver 568 orexternal interface 562. -
Device 550 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 566, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 566 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 568. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 570 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data todevice 550, which may be used as appropriate by applications running ondevice 550. -
Device 550 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 560, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 560 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofdevice 550. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating ondevice 550. - The
computing device 550 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 580. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 582, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), peer-to-peer networks (having ad-hoc or static members), grid computing infrastructures, and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- Although a few implementations have been described in detail above, other modifications are possible. Moreover, other mechanisms for detecting impersonation on a social network may be used.
