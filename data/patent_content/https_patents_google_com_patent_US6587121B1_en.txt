Definitions
- This invention relates to data processing systems, and more particularly to data processing systems having user assistance resources.
- the electronic user manuals provide some advantages over the hard copy manuals, a number of problems remain.
- the electronic user manuals typically only included an index and a table of contents.
- Some limitations of the table of contents/index approach include: the user seeking help must know exactly what words or phrases to use when seeking help, and the list of available topics in the table of contents/index still may be very large, thus limiting the speed and precision with which a user is able to obtain the assistance the user seeks.
- Some electronic manuals include a keyword search capability, and more sophisticated electronic manuals include hyperlinks between related sectors.
- the present invention overcomes many of the disadvantages associated with the prior art by providing a user customizable help system for a data processing environment which utilizes a graphical interface to identify solutions and/or topics of interest.
- This graphical help system displays partitioned groupings of help topics organized in a intuitively functional, positional manner such that a user will instinctively know where to find the desired help topic.
- partitioned groupings of help topics may represent hardware platforms, operating environments, application groupings, or groupings of functions within an application.
- the invention contemplates providing multiple “view types” of help topics.
- view types correspond to different types of users of the data processing system. It is contemplated that other embodiments of the “view type” concept might include view type groupings for data manipulation (printing, storage, and removal) or applications (middleware, tools and utilities).
- view type groupings for data manipulation (printing, storage, and removal) or applications (middleware, tools and utilities).
- two “view” selections are provided.
- the first selection corresponds to a “system view” and the second selection corresponds to a “user view”.
- the “system view” might be used by a computer system administrator or application developer, while the “user view” might be activated by a general user of the data processing system.
- the “system view” of the illustrative embodiment preferably contains help topic pushbuttons that are graphically partitioned by groupings (such as computer hardware platforms, computer operating environments, sets of applications, or functions within a particular application) which will provide help on topics of specific interest to system administrators such as setting file access permissions, user passwords, or diagnostic utilities.
- groupings such as computer hardware platforms, computer operating environments, sets of applications, or functions within a particular application
- the “user view” preferably contains help topic pushbuttons that are graphically partitioned by groupings (such as computer hardware platforms, computer operating environments, sets of applications, or functions within a particular application) which will provide help on topics of specific interest to general system users such as using electronic mail, a database management system, a spreadsheet, or file transfer utilities.
- groupings such as computer hardware platforms, computer operating environments, sets of applications, or functions within a particular application
- the present invention can be a carefully tailored, graphical alternative to a standard table of contents, allowing for a more intuitive approach to finding topics of interest for distinct classes of users.
- a system and methodology for implementing user assistance functions for users of data processing systems having multiple computer operating environments is contemplated.
- a user is presented with a one screen graphical overview of the entire data processing environment, logically partitioned into functional units.
- the help topics most relevant to the type of user requesting the help information are presented.
- the screen of help topics might be graphically partitioned into groups representing a OS 2200 environment, a UnixWare environment, a Windows NT environment, and a Personal Computer Workstation Windows 95 operating environment.
- This graphically tailored, partitioned approach to presentation of help topics is more intuitive than a text based table of contents approach.
- the system may also provide user assistance functions concerning interoperability of diverse applications, whether hosted on the same computer platform or hosted on different computer platforms.
- the help system has one or more screens of user selectable help topics. These help topics are graphically partitioned into two or more groups of topics corresponding to hardware platforms within the data processing system.
- the screen of help topics might be graphically partitioned into groups representing a UNISYS 2200 mainframe computer, a local file server computer, a desktop personal computer, and a laptop computer.
- the present invention graphically partitions one or more screens of user selectable help topics into groups of topics corresponding to sets of applications within the data processing system.
- the screen of help topics might be graphically partitioned into groups representing an office suite of applications such as Microsoft Office 97, or an internet toolkit containing applications such as a web browser, HTML toolkit, JAVA toolkit, and an E-mail application.
- the present invention groups one or more screens of user selectable help topics by functional blocks of a selected computer application.
- the functional blocks are interrelated via a functional diagram.
- This functional diagram may include interconnections between the functional blocks which indicate topographical relationships between the functional blocks in the application. These topographical relationships may identify an ordered, positionally relevant set of functional topics, graphically displayed in such a manner that an application user may know intuitively where to seek help for an application subtask.
- An example of such a functional diagram might be Microsoft Excel, with functional blocks corresponding to importing/exporting files, worksheets, charts, file management, printing, and using macros.
- the help topic pushbuttons within the groupings provide access points to corresponding help information.
- the help information may reside in a dedicated help database, a universal help database, etc.
