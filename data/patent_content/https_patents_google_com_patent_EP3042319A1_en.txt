- the web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104.
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106.
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 1 12 over the network 102.
- the search system 1 12 can, for example, access an indexed cache 1 14 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116.
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 1 18 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116, and includes a link to the resource 105.
- An example search result 1 18 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Locator) of the web page.
- the data representing the resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page

- content sponsors 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items.
- an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated to content sponsors 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item.
- the slot can be allocated to the content sponsor 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure).
- the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores.
- some content sponsors 108 prefer that the number of impressions allocated to their content and the price paid for the number of impressions be more predictable than the predictability provided by an auction.
- a content sponsor 108 can increase the likelihood that its content receives a desired or specified number of impressions, for example, by entering into an agreement with a publisher 109, where the agreement requires the publisher 109 to provide at least a threshold number of impressions (e.g., 1,000 impressions) for a particular content item provided by the content sponsor 108 over a specified period (e.g., one week).

- the publisher 109 can provide the content management system 1 10 with data representing the specified time period as well as the threshold number of impressions that the publisher 109 has agreed to allocate to the content item over the specified time period.
- the content management system 1 10 can select content items based at least in part on a goal of allocating at least a minimum number of impressions to a content item in order to satisfy a delivery goal for the content item during a specified period of time.
- a content sponsor 108 can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system 1 10.
- the content management system 1 10 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content sponsor 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content sponsor's client device.
- a content sponsor 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 120 which define a content campaign.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content sponsor 108 according to the parameters 120 specified by the content sponsor 108.
- the campaign parameters 120 can be stored in a content sponsor parameters datastore 122.
- Campaign parameters 120 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria.
- Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms.
- a user of a user device 106 may, for example, submit a search query 1 16 that is a query to fulfill an informational need of a user regarding a product or service.
- the user may be looking for information about how to use a product, how to buy a particular kind of product, a comparison between similar products, or reviews of a product.
- the content management system 110 can annotate a content item of a content sponsor 108 and provide the annotated content item to the user device 106 to fulfill an informational need represented by such a search query 116 while also moving the user along a conversion funnel to increase ROI (Return On Investment) for the content sponsor 108.
- An annotated content item for example, with links to informational content such as a buying guide or reviews, may be more useful for a user than a content item that includes products available for purchase but not other informational content about the products.
- a link identification system 124 can, for each content item in an inventory 126 of content items, identify a content sponsor 108 associated with the content item and a set of page types for a vertical associated with a product or service described in the content item.
- the link identification system 124 can identify the set of page types for the vertical, for example, by querying a page types data store 128.
- the pages types data store 128 may include a set of predefined page types including how-to guides, buying guides, and/or other page types.
- the page types data store 128 may include pre-defined page types of transportation, lodging, nearby-destinations, travel guide, and/or other page types.
- a set of page types can be programmatically generated.
- the link identification system 124 can locate a set of informational pages associated with the content sponsor 108, such as by using the search system 1 12. Other approaches for locating informational pages are discussed in more detail below.
- the link identification system 124 can classify each informational page based on the page types. For example, a particular informational page can be classified as having a page type of buying guide.
- a link title synthesis system 130 can associate one or more titles with each informational page identified by the link identification system 124. Identification and generation of link titles is described in more detail below.
- a criteria identification system 132 can identify selection criteria for the informational pages identified by the link identification system 124. For example, the criteria identification system 132 can identify queries associated with a content sponsor 108 in the content sponsor parameters datastore 122, such as queries that are used as selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with the content sponsor 108. The criteria identification system 132 can determine relevant queries from the identified queries for each informational page associated with the content sponsor 108. For example, the criteria identification system 132 can determine one or more keywords for a given informational page and identify relevant queries by finding one or more queries that include the determined one or more keywords. The criteria identification system 132 (or the link identification system 124) can store, in an associations datastore 134, for each content item associated with a content sponsor 108, an association between the content item, data associated with the relevant queries, and informational pages associated with the content item.
- the content selector 1 11 can identify a content item responsive to the request, as described above.
- An annotation serving system 136 can identify one or more informational pages associated with the content item, for example, by querying the associations datastore 134 using an identifier of the content sponsor 108 associated with the content item and terms included in the request for content.
- the annotation serving system 136 can rank and/or filter the identified informational pages, as described in more detail below, to determine a set of ranked and selected informational pages.
- the annotation serving system 136 can generate a link for each selected informational page and annotate (e.g., augment) the content item with the generated links, for example, using link titles determined by the link title synthesis system 130.
- the annotated content item can be provided to the requesting user device 106, as illustrated by an annotated content item 140.
- a user device can include tools for rendering content delivered by the content management system.
- an annotation rendering system 142 is used to display the annotated content item 140, including generated links and, for example, a header associated with the generated links, to the user of the user device 106.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing an annotated content item to a user.
- a content server 202 can provide content in response to requests for content.
- the content server 202 can augment (e.g., annotate) a content item with one or more links to informational pages that are associated with an entity (e.g., a content sponsor) that is associated with the content item.
- the informational pages are identified after a request for content is received. In some implementations, the informational pages are identified before the request is received.
- a link identification system 204 can identify, for a given content sponsor, a set of informational links (e.g., URLs) for various page types.
- the link identification system 204 can identify page types based on a determined vertical.
- a vertical can be determined, for example, for each content sponsor, based on information stored or known about the content sponsor.
- a vertical can be determined for a content item based on information included in or associated with the content item.
- the link identification system 204 can query a page types datastore 206 to determine a set of page types associated with a vertical. For instance, as illustrated by example data 208, the link identification system 204 can determine page types of "how-to", buying guide, reviews, product walkthrough, product gallery, and top lists for a retail vertical.
- n-grams are associated with each page type. For example, n-grams of "buying guide”, “purchase guide”, and “how to choose” can be associated with the page type "buying guide”. Associations of n-grams to page types can be stored in the page types data store 206.
- the page types data store 206 can include a version of a page type definition, including mappings of verticals to page types and page types to associated n-grams, for each of multiple languages (e.g., English, German,
- the link identification system 204 programmatically determines a set of page types, such as for a particular content sponsor or for a group of content sponsors. For example, the link identification system 204 can identify a set of product-related pages that include product names or keywords, for the content sponsor or for the group of content sponsors. For example, the set of product-related pages can be identified using a search system 210, such as by querying for product names and keywords and using a domain restricted search using the domain of a given content sponsor. As another example, a set of product-related pages can be received by a content sponsor.
- a content sponsor 21 1 can use a campaign management user interface 212 presented on a content sponsor client device 214 to provide a set of links to product-related pages, as illustrated by a product-pages input included in example content sponsor inputs 216.
- the link identification system 204 can process each identified product-related page. For each product-related page, the link identification system 204 can identify a title for the product-related page, create a copy of the title, remove product names and keywords from the copy of the title, optionally remove stop words from the copy of the title, optionally remove n-grams that match a content sponsor name or a site name, and optionally perform stemming on remaining n-grams included in the copy of the title.
- the link identification system 204 can identify the remaining n-grams included in the copy of the title as candidate page types. For instance, an example title of a product-related page may be "Example.com - Product Reviews for Camera Y". The site-name n-gram of "Example.com”, the stop word “for”, and the product-name n-gram of "Camera Y” can be removed from a copy of the example title, leaving the text "Product Reviews" in the copy of the example title. The n- grams "Reviews” and "Product Reviews” can be identified as candidate page types, for example. In some implementations, candidate page-types are identified by processing one or more page heading elements in a manner similar to the processing of page titles described above.
- some candidate page types are weighted as being more or less relevant than other candidate page types. For example, candidate page types that are adjacent to a product name or keyword in a product-related page title can be weighted higher than candidate page types that are not adjacent to a product name or keyword.
- the link identification system 204 can determine a frequency of occurrence for each candidate page type across all of the processed product-related pages. The link identification system 204 can select a set of page types from the candidate page types, such as by selecting page types associated with the top N (e.g., ten) highest frequencies of occurrence across product-related pages, or selecting page types having a frequency of occurrence across product-related pages that is higher than a threshold frequency.
- the link identification system 204 can identify, for a given content sponsor, a set of informational links (e.g., URLs) associated with the selected page types.
- a set of informational links e.g., URLs
- informational links can be identified, for example, from a set of total URLs that are associated with (e.g., owned) by the content sponsor.
- the set of total URLs for the content sponsor can be identified, for example, by the search system 210.
- the search system 210 can, for example, identify (e.g., "crawl") the URLs that are associated with one or more domains associated with the content sponsor and can store information on the identified URLs in an indexed cache 218.
- the link identification system 204 can query the search system 210 to determine the total set URLs for the content sponsor.
- the link identification system 204 can identify the total set of URLs for the content sponsor by identifying a set of pre-defined landing page URLs that are associated with the content sponsor, such as by querying a content sponsor parameters datastore 220.
- the content sponsor can provide the total set of URLs for the content sponsor, such as by providing landing page and/or other URLs.
- the content sponsor 21 1 can use the campaign management user interface 212 to provide the total set of URLs for the content sponsor, as illustrated by a URLs input included in the example content sponsor inputs 216.
- the link identification system 204 identifies informational links from the total set of URLs for a content sponsor by analyzing the title of each page corresponding to a URL in the total set of URLs. For example, the link identification system 204 can determine if a title includes an n-gram that is associated with a particular page type. In some implementations, the link identification system 204 determines whether the title includes a page-type related n-gram after stemming and stop-word removal processing. If a title includes a page-type related n-gram, the page that includes the title can be identified as an informational page of the particular page type and the address associated with the page can be identified as an informational link associated with the particular page type.
- the link identification system 204 uses the search system 210 to identify informational pages associated with a particular content sponsor.
- the link identification system 204 can request the search system 210 to perform searches that include page-type related n-grams and a site restriction on a domain associated with the content sponsor.
- the search system 210 can perform a search of '"buying guide' site:example.com” to determine buying-guide pages associated with the content sponsor having a domain of "example.com”.
- the search system 210 can perform a search of '"buying guide' site:example.com 'Camera Y'" to find buying guides for a "Camera Y" product sold by a content sponsor having a domain of
- the link identification system 204 identifies
- the link identification system can search for and identify patterns in URLs provided by the content sponsor, identify informational links based on analyzing page titles, and identify informational links using the search system 210, and/or other sets of URLs. For example, each URL in a set of URLs associated with a content sponsor of "example" may have a pattern of
- the URL can be automatically identified as a product comparison page.
- content of landing pages associated with a content sponsor can be evaluated, such as to determine whether a link included in a landing page is an informational link (e.g., such as by identifying page-type related n-grams in link title text).
- a content sponsor can include metadata in pages associated with the content sponsor (e.g., HTML metadata), and the link identification system 204 can identify informational pages by determining which pages have metadata indicating a page is an informational page.
- the link identification system 204 can query a page classification system (not shown), where the page classification system includes a datastore of page classifications. The page classification system may, for example, classify pages using a machine learning model.
- Information can be associated with each identified informational link.
- a link title synthesis system 221 can associate one or more titles with each informational page identified by the link identification system 204.
- a title can be, for example, used as a link title in an annotation used for a content item.
- the link title synthesis system 221 can determine a title for an informational page, for example, by identifying a title element associated with the informational page or by using a page-type n-gram as a link title (e.g., all buying guide pages may get a link title of "buying guide").
- the link title synthesis system 221 can receive a title for an informational page from a content sponsor, such as illustrated by a "titles" input included in the example content sponsor inputs 216.
- the link title synthesis system 221 can programmatically generate a title, such as by using one or more of a content sponsor name, a page type, frequent queries associated with the informational page, and/or content from the
- a generated link title can be "56 Product Reviews from example.com”. Frequent queries are discussed in more detail below.
- a snippet of text is associated with an informational page, in addition to a title that is associated with the informational page.
- the snippet and the title can each be included, for example, in an annotation associated with the informational page.
- a snippet can be received, for example, from a snippet generator (not shown) or from the search system 210.
- a snippet can be generated from the content of the informational page, such as by identifying a non-boilerplate portion of text included in the informational page, such as the first N words or sentences of non-boilerplate text. Other approaches for generating a snippet can be used.
- a snippet can be included in an annotation, for example, before or after a link associated with the informational page.
- an annotation can include a link for a tennis racquet buying guide informational page and can include a snippet associated with the informational page.
- the annotation can appear, for example, as "Tennis Racquet Buying Guide - The best racquet on the market is" or "The best racquet on the market is... Tennis Racquet Buying Guide"
- a criteria identification system 224 can identify selection criteria for the informational pages identified by the link identification system 204.
- the criteria identification system 224 can identify queries associated with one or more content sponsors in the content sponsor parameters datastore 220, such as queries that are used as selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with a given content sponsor.
- the criteria identification system 224 can determine relevant queries from the identified queries for each informational page.
- the criteria identification system 224 can determine one or more keywords for a given informational page and identify relevant queries by finding one or more queries that include the determined one or more keywords.
- the criteria identification system 224 receives selection criteria from a content sponsor, such as illustrated by a selection criteria input included in the example content sponsor inputs 216.
- the criteria identification system 224 identifies criteria for an informational page by analyzing the title of the informational page. For example, for each informational page, the criteria identification system 224 can create a copy of the title, remove page-type n-grams from the title, optionally perform stemming and stop-word removal on the copy of the title, optionally remove site names from the copy of the title, and identify remaining n-grams in the copy of the title. The remaining n-grams can be identified as candidate criteria for the informational page. For example, suppose a title of an informational page is "example.com - Product Reviews for Camera Y".
- a "Product Reviews" page-type n-gram, a stop-word “for”, and a site name “example.com” can be removed from a copy of the title, leaving the copy of the title as "Camera Y".
- N-grams of "Y” and "Camera Y” can be identified as candidate criteria.
- candidate criteria that are adjacent to a page-type n-gram in the original title can be weighted higher than candidate criteria that are not adjacent to a page-type n-gram.
- candidate criteria are identified by processing one or more page heading elements in a manner similar to the processing of page titles described above.
- candidate criteria are identified by analyzing URLs of informational pages, such as by identifying a particular URL pattern that is shared across a set of URLs for the content sponsor, identifying one or more portions of the pattern as corresponding to a candidate keyword, and identifying particular candidate keywords by identifying portions of respective URLs that correspond to the identified URL-pattern portions.
- the criteria identification system 224 can process each informational page for a content sponsor to determine candidate criteria for the content sponsor. In some
- the criteria identification system 224 identifies a frequency of occurrence of each candidate criteria across all of the informational pages.
- the criteria identification system 224 can, for example, select as criteria candidate criteria that have a frequency of occurrence across the informational pages that is greater than a threshold frequency.
- the criteria identification system 224 can select as criteria the candidate criteria that have the N (e.g., ten) highest frequencies.
- the criteria identification system 224 can select criteria using a formula that takes into account frequency of candidate criteria across informational pages and whether a respective candidate criterion is used as a selection criterion by the content sponsor for a content item associated with the content sponsor.
- a keyword hierarchy 226 data structure is accessed to identify keywords to associate with informational pages.
- the keyword hierarchy 226 can include multiple sets of related keywords, where each set of related keywords is associated with a concept, with keywords in the set ordered from general to specific.
- a set of keywords related to a camera of a model XYZ9 from a camera maker named Camera-Maker-A can include the keywords "camera”, “digital camera”, “Camera-Maker-A camera”, “XYZ9”, and "Camera-Maker-A XYZ9", with the keywords being ordered from more general to more specific.
- the criteria identification system 224 can determine that a selected criterion for an informational page is included in a set of related keywords in the keyword hierarchy 226 and can identify one or more other keywords in the set to use as other selected criteria for the informational page. For example, the criteria identification system 224 can identify "Camera-Maker-A camera buying guide” and "XYZ buying guide” as additional selected criteria for the informational page based on criteria "Camera-Maker-A XYZ9" being an existing criteria for the informational page.
- the criteria identification system 224 can identify a set of frequent queries most often associated with a particular candidate informational page. For example, the criteria identification system 224 can, for a given candidate informational page, identify queries which result in the candidate informational page being displayed in a search result or that result in a content item associated with the candidate informational page being selected for a content request that is associated with one or more identified queries.
- the content item can be configured to have the candidate informational page as a landing page.
- other factors such as a click through rate of a search result or content item can be used to identify and rank the frequent queries.
- a particular number of queries can be identified as frequent queries for the candidate informational page.
- a relevance score can be determined for each query associated with the candidate informational page (e.g., based on impressions, click-through rate) and queries having relevance scores above a threshold can be identified or queries having a top N (e.g., five) relevance scores can be identified.
- the link identification system 204 can use the query to determine whether the associated candidate informational page is identified as an informational page for the content sponsor and a page type for the informational page.
- the queries can be evaluated in a manner similar to the evaluation of titles and URLs described above.
- the content system 202 can use one or more approaches of evaluating titles, URLs, page headings, and queries to identify informational pages and page types of identified informational pages.
- a query of "dslr camera buying guide" can be identified as a frequent query for a candidate informational page having a URL of
- a page type n-gram of "buying guide” can be identified in the query of "dslr camera buying guide", and the candidate informational page can be identified as an informational page having a page type of "buying guide”.
- Frequent queries can be provided to the link title synthesis system 221 and the link title synthesis system 221 can use a frequent query to generate a title to be associated with an informational page. For example, if a query of "dslr cameras buying guide" is provided to the link title synthesis system 221 for an informational page having a URL of
- the link title synthesis system 221 can generate a link title to be associated with the informational page that is or that includes "DSLR Camera Buying Guide”.
- the criteria identification system 224 (or the link identification system 204) can store, in an associations datastore 228, for each content item for which selection criteria and informational pages have been identified, an association between the content item, data associated with the selection criteria determined to be relevant to the content item, and informational pages associated with the content item.
- the data in the associations datastore 228 can be keyed, for example, by a content sponsor identifier and by selection criteria. For example, for each content sponsor identifier and selection criteria combination, one or more tuples can be stored that include a page type, an informational page URL, and a link title.
- example associations data 232 keyed by multi-valued key 234 of a content sponsor id of "sponsor 123" (which can be, for example, an identifier associated with the content sponsor 21 1) and selection criteria of "DSLR Camera” includes tuples 235, 236, and 237 for page types of buying guide, reviews, and product comparison, respectively.
- a content selector 240 can select a content item to serve in response to the request, such as identifying a content item in a content items data store 242.
- a request for content can be received from a user device 244 of a user 246, for a content slot 248 included in a web page 250 displayed on the user device 244.
- the web page 250 is a search results page presented to the user 246 in response to the user 246 entering a search query 251 of "DSLR camera buying guide".
- the content selector 240 can select, for example, a content item 252.
- the content item 252 can be associated, for example, with the content sponsor 21 1.
- An annotation serving system 254 can select one or more informational pages associated with the content item 252, for example, by querying the associations datastore 228 using an identifier of the content sponsor 21 1 and the search query 251.
- the annotation serving system 254 can generate a link for each selected informational page and annotate (e.g., augment) the content item 252 with the generated links.
- the content item 252 includes an annotation 256 which includes links 257, 258, and 259.
- the links 257, 258, and 259 are associated with the tuples 235, 236, and 237, respectively.
- annotation 256 can be displayed to the user using an annotation rendering system 262.
- annotation 256 includes a header (e.g., "Info:").
- Other headers can be used, such as "Learn More". Headers can be descriptive of the informational content that is associated with the one or more of the informational links provided or of the form of a call to action that moves the user farther along the conversion funnel.
- the annotation rendering system 256 selects a header based on an amount of available screen space. For example, the annotation rendering system 256 can select a header so that the annotation 256 occupies one line of the content item 252.
- the annotation rendering system 256 (or the annotating serving system 254) can also select titles for the links 257, 258, and 259 based on available screen space.
- a generated header may include information identifying the content sponsor and information about selection criteria. For example, suppose selection criteria associated with the content item 252 is "CameraBrand DSLR ZY200" from example.com and that informational pages identified by the link identification system 204 are associated with criteria of "DSLR Cameras". In such an instance, a header can be "About DSLR cameras", “From example.com”, or “More about DSLR cameras from example.com", to name a few examples.
- the annotation rendering system 256 can select titles based on how many items (e.g., links) are shown in an annotation. For example, if a larger number of items are to be shown, shorter titles can be used, and if a smaller number of items are to be shown, longer titles can be used.
- an annotation 264 can be included in a content item 266.
- the content item 266 can be provided to the user device 244 in response to a request for content for a content slot 270 included in a search results page 272.
- the annotation 264 includes items 274, 275, 276, and 277. Since the annotation 264 includes more items than the annotation 256, shorter titles may be used for the items included in the annotation 264 as compared to items included in the annotation 256.
- the item 274, which is a link to a buying guide has a title of "Buy. Guide", while a corresponding link 257 has a longer title of "Buying Guide”.
- some items in an annotation can be "badges", or words to flag or mark the annotation 264 and/or the content item 266.
- a badge can inform the user about informational content that is available from the content sponsor associated with the content item 266 (e.g., the content sponsor 211), such as information available from a landing page associated with the content item 266 (e.g., reviews, product comparison, or a product gallery).
- a badge for example, may not be a link, meaning the badge may not respond specifically to user interaction.
- the selection action may be interpreted as a selection of the content item 266, which can result in a display of a landing page associated with the content item 266.
- the link 274 may, for example, be a link to the landing page associated with the content item 266, a link to a particular section of the landing page, or a link to a different web page associated with the content sponsor 21 1.
- Badges to include in an annotation can be determined, for example, by analyzing page heading elements of the landing page in a manner similar to the determination of candidate page-types based on page heading elements, as described above.
- the annotation serving system 254 may use various approaches to rank and/or filter the items included in an annotation. For example, the annotation serving system may select zero or one item (e.g., link, badge) for every page type, up to a threshold number of items (e.g., seven), so that a diversity and balance of page types are included in the annotation.
- the threshold number of items can be predefined (e.g., seven), or can be dynamically determined based on the length of potential title text for candidate items that may be included in the annotation.
- candidate items for an annotation may be ranked based on relevance to a query associated with the request for content for which the content item is selected.
- the associated content item 252 may have been selected based on the search query 251 of "DSLR camera buying guide".
- Informational links associated with the page type of buying guide may be ranked higher by the annotation serving system 254 than informational pages of other page types for the given vertical.
- one informational page associated with the content sponsor 21 1 has a page type of buying guide, but in other examples, multiple informational pages having a page type of buying guide can be selected and included in the annotation 256, based on the buying guide page type having a higher weight than other page types.
- a page type can be ranked higher than other page types if the page type corresponds to selection criteria associated with the content item that includes the annotation, or with other criteria, such as being associated with a user task that is inferred or a user's determined current activity or location in a conversion funnel.
- the annotation serving system 254 can use other approaches for filtering or ranking candidate items considered for inclusion in an annotation. For example, the annotation serving system can select items so that each item is at a same or similar level of granularity, such as is maintained in the keyword hierarchy datastore 226. For example, if the annotation serving system 254 includes in an annotation a link to a buying guide for a particular DSLR camera, the annotation serving system 254 may also select a link to a reviews page for the same DSLR camera rather than selecting a link to a reviews page for DSLR cameras in general or for some other camera model.
- a content sponsor (e.g., the content sponsor 21 1) can receive reports 280 which can include information related to user interaction with the content items that include annotations, including interactions with items included in annotations.
- the reports 280 can include information about interactions with annotations that can be associated with various other user interactions, such as conversion actions.
- the content sponsor 21 1 can use the campaign management user interface 212 to register for or to opt out of inclusion of annotations in content items associated with the content sponsor 21 1.
- the content sponsor 21 1 can register for or opt out of automatic creation and/or serving of content items whose content includes information about and/or links to informational pages that have been determined for the content sponsor by the link identification system 204.
- a content creator 282 can automatically create a content item 284 based on informational content identified by the link identification system 204.
- the content item 284 includes a title 285 and a link 286, based on the link identification system 204 identifying the link 284 as a link to an informational page.
- the content item 284 includes an annotation 287 that includes links for reviews, product comparison, and a product gallery, respectively.
- the content creator 282 automatically creates the content item 284 and presents the content item 284 to the content sponsor 211 (e.g., on the campaign management user interface 212) as a suggestion for a new content item for the content sponsor 211 to include in a content campaign.
- the content sponsor 21 1 approves the suggestion
- the campaign can be activated and the content item 284 can be served in response to requests for content that are received.
- the content item 284 is automatically created and served in response to requests for content without specific approval from the content sponsor 211. That is, the content sponsor 211 may have registered to have content items automatically created and served without requiring specific approval of each created content item.
- the content item 284 can be provided, for example, to a user device 288 of a user 289, for presentation in a content slot 290 included in a web page 291.
- the content item 284 can be selected, for example, based at least in part on the content item 284 having associated keywords that match, for example, the content of the web page 291.
- the annotation serving system 254 creates annotations that can be included in other types of content items.
- the annotation system 254 can create an annotation that can be used to augment a search result generated by the search system 210.
- a search results web page 293 is displayed on a user device 294 of a user 295.
- the search results web page 293 includes a search result 296.
- the search result 296 includes an annotation 297 created by the annotation serving system 254 and displayed by, for example, the annotation rendering system 262.
- the link identification system 204 can, for example, determine informational pages associated with an entity (e.g., a publisher, a content sponsor) associated with the search result 296 and the annotation serving system 254 can create the annotation 297 which includes links to the identified informational pages, such as links to a buying guide, reviews, a product comparison, and/or a product gallery, as shown in the annotation 297.
- links identified by the link identification system 204 can be merged or combined in the annotation 297 with other links (e.g., other site links) identified, for example, by the search system 210 or some other system.
- the link title synthesis system 221 and the criteria identification system 224 can be combined.
- the criteria identification system 224 can identify a set of keywords for a content sponsor before the link identification system 204 identifies informational pages, and the link identification system 204 can use the identified keywords for locating informational pages.

- a corpus of documents associated with a document sponsor is evaluated to determine the page types. For example, a corpus of documents associated with a particular content sponsor or with a set of content sponsors can be evaluated. In some implementations, when evaluating the corpus of documents, titles of documents in the corpus can be evaluated including the extraction of n-grams from the titles that do not include a product, service or brand name associated with the content sponsor. The extracted n-grams can be used to identify the page types.
- a plurality of informational pages associated with the entity are located (304).
- a list of informational pages associated with the content sponsor is received, such as from the content sponsor.
- a corpus of documents associated with the content sponsor is evaluated to identify the plurality of informational pages. For example, a set of URLs that constitute informational links for the page types can be chosen from a total set of URLs associated with the content sponsor.
- Each informational page is classified based on the page types (306).
- determining which of the identified page types to assign to a content item includes evaluating URL patterns. For example, a URL pattern can be identified that is associated with a particular page type and if the informational page matches the URL pattern, the informational page can be determined to be of the particular page type.
- determining which of the identified page types to assign to a content item includes evaluating title n-grams. For example, an informational page can be classified as a particular page type if the title of the informational page includes a page type n-gram (e.g., after optional stemming and stopword removal). Other approaches can be used to classify the informational page based on page type.
- Queries associated with the entity are identified (308), wherein a query is used as selection criteria for delivering one or more content items associated with the entity.

- An association between the content item, data associated with the relevant queries, and associated informational pages is stored in a data structure (312).
- the association can be keyed, for example, by an identifier of the content sponsor associated with the content item and data associated with the relevant queries.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for providing an augmented content item to a user.
- the process 400 can be performed, for example, by the content management system 1 10 described above with respect to FIG. 1, or the content server 202 described above with respect to FIG. 2.
- a request for content is received (402).
- the request can be received from a user device for a content item to be presented in a content slot.
- a content item responsive to the request is identified (404). For example, an auction can be performed and a content item with a highest associated bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure) can be identified.
