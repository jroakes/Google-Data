Parameter needed for sufficient user's request.Such code can for example search additional information, such as family in data repository 145
The title of automation services or its be capable of providing the audio output for being presented at client computing device 150, with to end
End subscriber inquires problem, the intended destination of such as requested taxi, the subject matter of the film to be watched or to go to eat late
The type in the restaurant of meal.Direct action API 135 can determine necessary parameter and can be by information package at action data
Structure, action data structure can be then sent to another component of such as content selection device assembly 125 or to be realized
ISP's computing device 160 (or content provider's computing device 155).
The direct action API 135 of data processing system 105 can generate thread based on asking or triggering keyword
Action data structure.Action data structure can be generated in response to request.Action data structure can be included in
It is sent in ISP's computing device 160 or the message being received by it.Based on the request parsed by NLP components 110, directly
It meets action API 135 and can determine and should send message to which of multiple ISP's computing devices 160.
Direct action API 135 can generate the first action based on the first triggering keyword and in response to the first request
Data structure, and the second action data structure can be generated based on the second triggering keyword and in response to the second request.
For example, if the first input audio signal includes " go to dinner tonight (tonight goes to have supper) ", NLP components
110 can identify trigger word " tonight (tonight) " and the request to dinner suggestion or reservation.135 energy of direct action API
It is enough that request is packaged into the first action data structure, to be sent to ISP's computing device 160 in restaurant as message
(or content provider's computing device 155).First input audio signal can be attached to other of dinner action including instruction
Other requests of action or triggering keyword.These actions can be included in the first action data structure.For example, NLP
Component 110 can from the first input audio signal " OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight (it is good,
I, which wants to go to tonight, has supper) " in identification about the first request or for going to the traffic (additional move) for either leaving dinner
One triggering keyword.
For example, if the second input audio signal includes " catch a movie later (going to the cinema later) ",
NLP components 110 can utilize triggering keyword " catch " or " later " to identify the request to watching movie.Direct action API
135 can be packaged into request the second action data structure, to be sent to the clothes of film company or cinema as message
Business supplier's computing device 160 (or content provider's computing device 155).Second input audio signal can include that instruction is attached
Belong to other second requests or the second triggering keyword of other actions of movie action.These actions can be included in the
In two action data structures.For example, NLP components 110 can be from the second input audio signal " OK, I would like to
Identification is about the traffic for going to or leaving cinema in catch a movie later (good, I wants to go to later watches movie) "
First request of (additional move) or the first triggering keyword.
First and second or any other action data structure can also be passed to content selection device assembly 125.It is dynamic
It can includes about the information for completing one or more actions associated with request to make data structure.In this example, the letter
Breath can include restaurant either film non-interest indicator, location information, the mark in restaurant or the type in position or restaurant, restaurant
Reservation information, the Movie show times of movie theatre, theater location information connect people position and destination locations.Direct action
API 135 can retrieve template 149 from repository 145, include in action data structure to determine which field.Directly
Action API 135 can retrieve content from repository 145, to obtain the information of the field about data structure.Direct action
API 135 can be with the information come the field in filling template, to generate data structure.Direct action API 135 can also be enough
Data from input audio signal or third party source fill field.Template 149 can be directed to the classification of ISP
And be standardized, or can be standardized for special services supplier.For example, shared service supplier can make by bus
Data structure is created with following normalized template 149：{client_device_identifier；authentication_
credentials；pick_up_location；destination_location；no_passengers；service_
level}.Data structure can include variable field.Variable field can for example indicate at least one action by data structure
Indicate the sequence or operation order of either relative multiple actions.Direct action API 135 can fill data structure
Field, including variable field.Based on the serial correlation between action, the such as second action is opened after the first action terminates
Begin, data can be filled or are input in one or more variable fields of data structure by direct action API 135.
Direct action API 135 can build the data transmission for including the packet corresponding to action data structure.Example
Such as, data transmission can include the packetizing version of action data structure, for example, the information indicated by data structure with instruction
Header and payload region packet.Data transmission can be used to establish (example via data processing system 105
Such as, participate in) at least one communication session between ISP's computing device 160 and client computing device 150.At session
Communication session can be established or identify via interface 115 by managing program assembly 140.For example, being acted and the second data by first
After structure (either their corresponding transmission of packetized data) merges or is associated in single thread, data processing system 105
Data transmission can be supplied to ISP's computing device 160.A part for communication as communication session, service provide
Person's computing device 160 can also via data processing system 105 from client computing device 105 receive packet (or its
His data-message).For example, the part as communication session, data processing system 105 can reception of inbound data message and
It can be routed to ISP's computing device 160 from client computing device 150.
Thread optimized component 120 can obtain or access the data of first and second (and any other) data transmissions
Grouping.For example, direct action API 135 transmission (for example, corresponding packet) can be supplied to data repository 145 with
Just it stores, wherein they can be retrieved for thread optimized component 120.Thread optimized component 120 can also bypass data repository
145 from direct action API 135 (either other 105 components of data processing system) receive data transmission packet (or
Structure based on other agreements).
Thread optimized component 120, which can be parsed or otherwise be extracted, corresponds respectively to the more of multiple action data structures
Information in the packet of a data transmission.For example, thread optimized component 120 can be to the packet of first data transmission
The packet (or corresponding second data structure) of (either corresponding first data structure) and the second data transmission is answered
With heuristic technique, at least one serial correlation parameter of determination.Heuristic technique or other statistical techniques can be with thresholds
First and second data transmissions of the serial correlation that extent value is determining or identification is in the action for indicating to be indicated by data transmission
Determinate pattern (certainty patterns) between (or corresponding data structure).
Serial correlation parameter can be indicated by the data transmission with operation order, time or sequence from one another correlation
(either corresponding action data structure) indicate action there is a possibility that or (for example, relative to threshold level or its
His benchmark).The sequence relevant operation that is indicated by serial correlation parameter or action can include by it is known, suggesting, want
Several actions that sequence ask or specific occurs.For example, from family to cinema and then going home include three sequences
Relevant operation or action.In this example, the first action includes from the home to cinema.Second action, which is included in movie theatre, sees electricity
Shadow.Third action includes going home from movie theatre.
These three (and may be other) actions can be by direct action API 135 from corresponding to input audio signal
The request or triggering of " OK, I would like to catch a movie later (good, I wants to go to later watches movie) " are closed
It is determined in keyword.In this example, in sequence second action (watching movie) be first action (be away from home and go to the cinema) it
Afterwards and depending on first action, and third action (going home) is after the first action and the second action and to depend on
The two actions.Third action can be considered as after the second action and depending on second action, because of table
It reaches and do so intentionally, data processing system 105 determines or prediction terminal user can also see electricity in movie theatre before going home
Shadow.
Based on serial correlation parameter, thread optimized component 120 can by two or more transmission of packetized data (or
Person their respective action data structure) it is merged into single thread.Single thread can include knowing from multiple data action structures
It does not move the data and other data (for example, metadata or third party's data) of work.Single thread can be in packetizing (or base
In other agreements) form, for example, being in format identical with the first and second data transmissions.Single thread also can be for example by
The data structure format that direct action API 135 is generated either follows at least one template 149, strategy 147 or parameter 146
Format.Single thread can include either indicating from one or more data transmissions or from one or more action datas
The association or link of the action of structure.
Data transmission either action data structure can by thread optimized component 120 merge or be associated with each other, with
Single line will be generated before the data transmission indicated by action data structure to ISP's computing device 160 via communication session
Journey.In this example, direct action API 135 or other 105 components of data processing system (for example, interface 115) can be
Merge or create single thread and at least part of the data indicated by single thread is sent to ISP's meter for the first time later
Calculate equipment 160.For example, before creating single thread, data processing system 105 may have (or any with the first or second
Other) the associated delay of data structure, prevent, the retention or data that do not send.In some instances, by each
At least some of the data of data structure instruction can be supplied to before creating single thread by/from data processing system 105
ISP's computing device 160.
Based on serial correlation parameter, thread optimized component 120 can be by data transmission (or corresponding action data knot
Structure) merge or otherwise integrates or be associated in single thread.For example, first data transmission (and first data structure) energy
It is enough to indicate and the first input audio signal " OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight (good, my tonight
Want to go to and have supper) " associated action, the second data transmission (and second data structure) can indicate and the second input audio
Signal " OK, I would like to catch a movie later (good, I wants to go to later watches movie) " is associated dynamic
Make.First and second (or any other) input audio signals can (be followed one another in order less than one minute), on time
Between be separated from each other (for example, be more than one minute), and identical or different client computing device 150 can be originated from.Thread is excellent
The packet (or other data) for indicating the information can be obtained by changing component 120, and can determine at least one sequence
Relevance parameter.For example, serial correlation parameter can indicate that the action gone home from cinema is happened at the action of viewing film
Later, either the action of viewing film occurs or is expected to occur in after the action having supper.
Single thread can indicate to correspond to (with any data structure or format) one or more input audio signals (or
The corresponding data structure of person or data transmission) one group of sequence relevant operation, such as a series of actions.Thread can include appointing
What two or more action, the such as first action, the second action and third action.For example, the first input audio signal
" OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight (good, I, which wants to go to tonight, has supper) " and the second input sound
The merging of frequency signal " OK, I would like to catch a movie later (good, I wants to go to later watches movie) " can
It is interested in dinner and at least one request of film including instruction and instruction needs at least one triggering of the vehicles
Keyword, such as " go (going) ".Thread optimized component 120 can identify at least one of the operation correlation between instruction action
At least one serial correlation parameter of sequence, time or sequence, and single thread can be generated to combine multiple input sound
Frequency signal (the either corresponding data structure based on template or the data transmission based on grouping/agreement).Thread optimized component
120 can create single thread, and at least three action of instruction, such as dinner action (the first action), (second is dynamic for movie action
Make) and the vehicles go home act (third action).In this example, according to ask or triggering keyword, thread optimized group
Part 120 generates single thread from multiple individual inputs of three actions of instruction.Single thread can include other actions, such as most
First traffic goes dinner to act.
Data processing system 105 or its component (such as thread optimized component 120) can determine that the action of thread is sequence
Relevant operation.For example, thread optimized component can determine watch movie second action be have supper first action after, and
And the third action gone home from cinema is after the second action watched movie.Thread optimized component 120 is able to access that data
Parameter 146 in repository 145 or strategy 147, to determine or the otherwise sequence of estimated sequence relevant action.Example
Such as, parameter 146 or strategy 147 can indicate that traffic action (going home for example, going by taxi) can be happened at event-action (example
Such as, watch movie) after.
Content selection device assembly 125 can obtain the instruction of any one of action of single thread.For example, thread optimized
Component 120 directly or indirectly (for example, via data repository 145) can provide instruction the to content selector assembly 125
At least part of the single thread of three (or any other) action.Content selection device assembly 125 can be from data repository 145
The information is obtained, the wherein information can be stored as a part for content-data 148.The instruction of third action can be to content
The notice of selector assembly 125 needs the vehicles to determine or indicate from the position of cinema to by client computing device 150
Position, such as by bus arrive final destination.
Content selection device assembly 125 can obtain the finger acted later in thread before at least one generation of action a little earlier
Show.For example, before content selection device assembly 125 can play film (the second action) in movie theatre or audio letter will be being inputted
The people of number input client computing device 150 have supper at the restaurant receive before (first action) third action instruction (for example,
It needs to ride from cinema).Content selection device assembly 125 can obtain thread before at least one action of thread completion
The instruction of at least one action.
From the information received by content selection device assembly 125, for example, at least one of sequence related linear program preceding
The instruction of third action before action generation, content selection device assembly 125 can identify at least one content item.Content item
Mesh can be in response to being either relevant to third (or any other) action.For example, needed in response to the instruction vehicles the
Three actions, content item can include the audio message for the service for providing Car sharing company.Content selection device assembly 125 can
Such as data repository 145 is inquired from content-data 148 to select or otherwise identify content item.Content selector
Component 125 can also select content item from content provider's computing device 155.For example, in response to from data processing system 105
The inquiry of reception, content provider's computing device 155 can provide content item to data processing system 105 (or its component),
For 150 final output of client computing device.
Audio signal generator component 130 can be generated or otherwise be obtained including (or any in response to third
Other) action content item output signal.For example, data processing system 105 is able to carry out audio signal generator component
To generate or create the output signal corresponding to content item.For example, the part as communication session, data processing system
It includes output signal that 105 interface 115, which can be provided or be sent to client computing device 150 via computer network 165,
One or more packets.Interface 115 can be designed, configure, build or operate at for example using packet
Send and receive information.Interface 115 can send and receive information using one or more agreements of such as procotol.It connects
Mouth 115 can include hardware interface, software interface, wireline interface or wireless interface.Interface 115 can aid in by data from
A kind of format conversion is formatted into another format.For example, interface 115 can include Application Programming Interface comprising use
The definition communicated between such as various assemblies of the component software of system 100.
For example, data processing system 105 can from data storage bank 145 or from audio signal generator component 130 to
Client computing device 150 provides output signal.Data processing system 105 can also be carried via data packet transfer command content
Donor computing device 155 or ISP's computing device 160 provide output signal to client computing device 150.As
From data processing system 105 (or other computing devices) to client computing device 150 one or more packets (or
Person other communication protocols), output signal can be obtained, be generated, being converted or being sent.
Content selection device assembly 125 can jump to the action later in the one group of sequence relevant operation indicated by single thread,
With the content item that (and before instant need) selection acts later before occurring corresponding to the activity acted later.It is logical
The action jumped to and sorted later is crossed, for example, selecting the second subsequent action before the content item that selection first formerly acts
Content item, data processing system 105 need not be handled first selects the interior of subsequent operation with relevant information is formerly acted
Appearance project.(the first action) content item is also selected before the content item of the second action of selection if can thus reduce
Processor utilization, power consumption and bandwidth needed for associated data transmission.
As a part for real time content selection course, content selection device assembly 125 can select (then or later) to move
The content item of work.For example, content item can be supplied to client computing device, to correspond directly to input audio letter
It transmits number using conversational mode as audio output.For identification content item and by content item be supplied to client calculating set
Standby 150 real time content selection course can occur in one minute of the input audio signal time or shorter time, and by
It is considered real-time.
Corresponding to for example by being sent to client computing device 150, by audio via interface 115 and computer network 165
Signal generator component 130 obtain either generate corresponding to content provider's computing device 155 content item (or correspondence
In the data of ISP's computing device 160) output signal enable to client computing device 150 execute audio driven
Device 153 generates the sound wave corresponding to output signal with drive the speaker 154.Sound wave can include later (for example, second or the
Three) content item acted the either word of other data or word corresponding thereto.Corresponding to the output of content item
Signal can also be included in client computing device 150 or different client computing devices as input audio signal source
As the text or figure that can be presented in the case of no audio element on 150 (for example, computing devices of wearable device)
The non-audio content project presented as message.
Data processing system 105 is capable of providing output signal, which includes in response to being done to input audio signal
Go out the direct either content item of the action of real-time response or other data, so as to as data processing system 105 and client
The packet-based data transmission via computer network 165 of a part for the communication session between computing device 150 is held to have
There are the smoothness and feeling of real-time person to person's dialogue.The packet-based data transfer communications session can also include content provider
Computing device 155 or ISP's computing device 160.
Content selection device assembly 125 can before any any content item formerly acted in selecting sequence,
Sequence relevant action concentrate Response to selection in second (or any non-first) action and the content item that provides.This avoids need
Handle corresponding at least some of the data that formerly act, if this with match according to the sequence with action sequence it is suitable
Sequence selects content item to compare so that selects second content item to reduce processing operation number.For example, dynamic in selection second
After the content item of work, the content item of first (for example, first and second) action may or may not be selected.
Content selection device assembly 125 can be based on the instruction master different from one or more themes of request of identical thread
At least one triggering keyword of the thread of topic selects (for example, second action) content item.For example, the request of single thread
It can indicate the theme of dinner request (the first action) and the theme of movie request (the second action).The theme does not indicate any
Vehicles requirement.However, either thread optimized component 120 (or one as direct action API 135 of NLP components 110
Point execute other data processing systems 105 component) can identify triggering keyword " go (going) ", " go to (going to) " or
Person " to go to (going) ", and triggering keyword can be based at least partially on and determine that the vehicles are asked.Therefore, data
Processing system 105 can from as non-master request the input audio signal of secondary request or the theme of input audio signal in push away
Disconnected action.
Data processing system 105 can prevent or postpone the output signal that transmission includes content item.For example, interface
115 either can prevent transmission including corresponding to content item or single thread via 135 execution scripts of direct action API
Action output signal packet, until trigger event.Trigger event can include expiring for predetermined amount of time,
Such as two hours, or with the time being consistent, the scheduled closing time of such as film are acted in thread a little earlier.Triggering
Event can also include the mandate instruction received from client computing device 150 by data processing system 105.Authorize instruction can
Originating from it is associated with thread but by data processing system 105 input audio signal, text based signal or other not
The follow audio input received after earcon, or can include the client computing device authorized through content item
The instruction of the setting of the client computing device 150 of 150 reception.
Data processing system 105 can also postpone transmission it is associated with the second action of thread or second act after
Content item, with optimization processing utilization rate.For example, data processing system 105 can postpone content item transmission, until in data
The off-peak hours that the heart uses either off-peak period to by reduce peak bandwidth utilization rate, thermal output or cooling want
It asks and more effectively utilizes data center.Based on data center's utilization rate or network 165 or including data processing system 105
The bandwidth metric or demand of data center, data processing system 105 can also start it is associated with content item conversion or
Other activities, such as subscribe automobile services.
Content item can correspond to the action of thread, and content selection device assembly 125 can select one of thread,
More than one or the content item all acted.Thread optimized component 120 can identify such as " dinner " (first action),
The sequence related linear program of the action of " film " (the second action) and " traffic since filming location " (third action).
For example, being based on single thread, it is capable of providing the content item of third action, so as at client computing device 150
The acoustic frequency response in response to audio input signal is presented, states " Would you like a ride home from the
movie theater(you want to go home by bus from cinema)”.After or before the presentation, 105 energy of data processing system
Enough selections provide content item, for example, " the Italian restaurant for the first action (dinner)
downtown has an opening for 7pm tonight-are you interested(intown Italy's meal
Shop 7 points of enablings at night, you are interested) ", and another content item can be selected or provide, for example, being used for second
Act " the would you like tickets to the 9pm movie at the downtown theater of (film)
(you want downtown movie theatre 9 points of film ticket of evening)”.Data processing system 105 can in response to input audio signal and
(it includes that command content supplier computing device 155 provides) these contents are provided, to be presented by client computing device 150
For audio output content item.Data processing system 105 via interface 115 can select in any order these content items or
Person is supplied to client computing device 150.For example, other content items acted a little earlier corresponding to thread it
Before, it can select or provide first the content item of third (for example, last) action.
Data processing system 105 can be received to content item " Would you like a ride home from the
movie theater(you want to go home by bus from cinema) " response.The response can include input audio signal, example
Such as, " yes please (yes) " is input to client computing device 150 and by data processing system by terminal user
105 receive.Data processing system 105 or its component (for example, thread optimized component) can include the part as single thread
Response.Based on the response, direct action API 135 can (it can be with content item with ISP's computing device 160
Associated, such as Car sharing company) communicated, be directed at the end of film cinema position taxi booking or
Vehicle is shared by bus.Data processing system 105 can be from data repository 145 or such as ISP's computing device 160
Or other sources of content provider's computing device 155 obtain the position or temporal information, as with client computing device
A part for 150 data message communications based on packet (or other agreements).Can by the confirmation of the reservation (or its
He converts) it is provided as voice communication from data processing system 105 in the form of the output signal from data processing system 105
To client computing device 150, which drives client computing device 150 that audio output is presented, such as " great,
You will have a car waiting for you at11pm outside the theater (it is good, 11 points at night
Have automobile and wait you outside movie theatre) ".Data processing system 105 can be calculated via direct action API 135 with ISP
Equipment 160 is communicated, to confirm the reservation of automobile.
Data processing system 105 can be obtained to content item (" Would you like a ride home from
the movie theater(you want to go home by bus from cinema) ") response (for example, " yes please (yes) "),
And packet-based data-message can be routed to (or the ISP's computing device of ISP NPL components 161
Other assemblies).The packet-based data-message enables to ISP's computing device 160 to generate conversion, for example, doing
Go out automobile in the external people's reservation of cinema.It is this conversion either confirm sequence (or thread any other action it is any
Other conversions) it can be happened at before the one or more actions for completing thread, such as before film terminates, and it is happened at
After one or more actions of thread are completed, such as after dinner.
Based on the response of the content item to the subsequent action in thread, such as to the last third in sequence related linear program
Content item " the Would you like a ride home from the movie theater of action(you want from film
Institute goes home by bus) " response " yes please (yes) ", data processing system 105 can start conversion or action.
This can be happened at terminal user start it is associated with thread it is any activity before, for example, before dinner or in film
Before end.The processor of data processing system 105 can call direct action API 135 and be taken to execute to generate from Car sharing
The script of automobile is subscribed in business.Direct action API 135 can obtain (or the parameter of content-data 148 from data repository 145
146 or strategy 147) and from client computing device 150 obtain terminal user agree to receive data, with determine position, when

Data processing system 105 can also be communicated with ISP's computing device 160, to complete to convert, be in this example
It carries out Car sharing and connects people's reservation.
Direct action API 135 can receive the first input sound associated with thread by data processing system 105
Frequency signal (for example, " OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight (it is good,
I, which wants to go to tonight, has supper, then watch movie) ") period in any time start dialogue or thread is completed in activity
Action, (for example, second until viewing film is dynamic until threshold time period after completing one of action in thread
Until making 15 minutes after terminating).Data processing system 110 can also determine the knot of the period based on other factors
Beam, such as terminal user have completed the instruction of the action of thread, for example, terminal user has gone home or be no longer at film
Institute.Data processing system 105 can also be obtained from client computing device 150 thread be cancelled or suspend mode or terminal user
Through the instruction (data-message sent via network 165) for cancelling or completing the action of thread.
Based on thread other action completions either deadline direct action API 135 can start conversion or
The action of thread is completed in activity.For example, data processing system 105 can be in thread first action ending threshold time
Directly or through communicate to order goods or service that (Car sharing connects in advance with ISP's computing device 160 in section
People).In 5 minutes (or other times sections) before or after the predetermined either practical ending of film (the second action),
Data processing system 105 is able to confirm that or subscribes car sharing and meets terminal user (subsequent in cinema to send a car
Three actions).Not from the case of the input that terminal user's computing device 150 receives during the period, or in response to
The prompt received from terminal user's computing device 150 during the period, it may occur that this process.
Direct action API 135 can start in any order it is associated with the sequence relevant operation of thread conversion or
Other activities.For example, direct action API 135 (or component of other data processing systems 105) can correspond in startup
Before the activity acted a little earlier in sequence (for example, before carrying out dinner reservation or before subscribing film ticket), start
Corresponding to the activity (for example, the third action in three action threads, such as taxi booking) finally acted.In this example
In, data processing system 105 starts after starting the activity of (for example, third) action later to be acted a little earlier (for example, second)
Activity.
Content selection device assembly 125 can identify, select or obtain by multiple content selection process generate it is multiple in
Appearance project.Content selection process can be real-time, for example, as the data processing system 105 and client meter that are related to thread
Calculate same dialog, a series of part for communication session or communication sessions between equipment 150.Dialogue can include to each other
Every the asynchronous communication of such as a few houres or several days periods.Dialogue or communication session can be believed from the first input audio is received
It number rises and to continue for some time, until the estimated or known ending of thread finally acted, received by data processing system 105
The instruction of Thread Termination.This can be referred to as the active time section of thread.For example, for tool there are three action (for example, dinner,
Film and traffic are gone home) thread, content selection device assembly 125 can be directed to each action and select at least one content item.
Content item selector component 125 can be directed to each action operation or obtain the result from different content selection course.
In content selection process, the content item selected for content selector component 125 can be arranged in content provider's computing device 150
Mesh.For the thread at least three actions, Content item selector component can be selected via first content selection course
It selects or otherwise identifies first content project, selected via the second content selection process or otherwise identify second
Second content item of action, and select via third content selection process or otherwise identify the of third action
Three content items.These content items are provided so as to the data that are presented during active time section by client computing device 150
Processing system 105 can be considered as real-time operation.In this example, content selection process is sent out in real time with presentation content project
It is raw.
Data processing system 105 can cancel action associated with content item.For example, subscribe automobile services it
Afterwards, terminal user can watch film, but then determine to walk home, or go after film to eat sweets, rather than by bus
It goes home.As a part for data processing system 105, the app or other program energy that are executed at client computing device 150
Enough input audio signals for receiving " cancel my ride home (cancelling my go home by bus) ".NLP components 110 can connect
The input audio signal is received, for example, as one or more packet-based data-messages, and can determine the input audio
Signal and pre-existing thread (for example, dinner, film, traffic are gone home) are one related and being same dialog or communication
Point.For example, NLP components 110 (or component of other data processing systems 105) can be from the content number of data repository 145
According to 148 assessment time datas, position data and pre-existing thread-data, past of such as thread, now or scheduling
Action, to determine that input audio signal is related to pre-existing thread.For example, based on request " riding " or triggering keyword
" cancellation ", NLP components 110 can determine input audio signal " cancel my ride home (cancelling my go home by bus) "
With content item " the Would you like a ride home from of the third action corresponding to pre-existing thread
the movie theater(you want to go home by bus from cinema) " related.Direct action API 135 (or other groups
Part) enable to data processing system 105 to be communicated with ISP's computing device 160 via interface 115, with cancelling
It hires a car or car sharing sends a car to wait for the reservation of terminal user outside cinema after film.
NLP components 135 can receive the message based on packet or other agreements, complete with any action in thread
Cancel the action of thread before or after.NLP components 135 can be received from client computing device 150 (or to be deposited from data
Storage cavern 145 obtains) data-message (inbound audio signal), to cancel line in the time interval of the action triggers a little earlier by thread
The action of journey.For example, in three dinner, film, traffic sequence related linear programs acted, 105 energy of data processing system
It is enough that traffic cancellation data-message is received in 5 minutes (or other times sections) that film terminates.Data processing system 105 can
Prompt confirms product related with the action of thread or service.For example, the period between the first action and the second action
(for example, after dinner and before film), data processing system 105 can disappear to 150 transmission data of client computing device
Breath, the data-message output audio or short message when being presented at client computing device 150, states " just
Confirming that you still want a car waiting for you after the movie (PLSCONFM,
You still want automobile and wait you after film) ".Data processing system 105 can receive response, for example, " yes, confirmed
(being to confirm) " or " no, cancel the car (no, to cancel automobile) ".The response can be included as one of thread
Point.Direct action API 135 is able to carry out script to handle the information, and can with ISP's computing device 160 into
Row communication is to indicate to confirm or cancel.

Into a single thread data structure 200.Single thread data structure 200 can include the multiple groupings for separating but being associated with each other
Or multiple and different structures.
Thread optimized component 120 can make one of single thread data structure 200 to act prior to another action.Preferentially
Grade can indicate or be otherwise provided to direct action API 135 or content selector by serial correlation parameter 210
Component 125.It first is acted on time for example, thread optimized component 120 can be prioritized by single thread data structure 200 indicates.
In response to priority, the other assemblies of direct action API 135 or such as content selection device assembly 125 can be provided to content
Either ISP's computing device 160 provides data transmission (for example, first data transmission 215 or the to person's computing device 155
At least part of two data transmissions 220), relevant conversion is acted on time with first to realize.
With reference to Fig. 3, wherein data processing system 105 can receive the first input sound from the first client computing device 150
Frequency signal 305 (for example, " OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight (and it is good, I want to go to tonight eat it is late
Meal) ").Data processing system 105 can also receive the second input audio letter from identical or different client computing device 150
Number 310 (for example, " OK, I would like to catch a movie later (good, I wants to go to later watches movie) ").Number
The corresponding actions data knot of the first audio input signal 305 and the second audio input signal 310 can be generated according to processing system 105
Structure and corresponding data transmission.Such as 105 component of data processing system of thread optimized component 120 can be to the first input audio letter
Numbers 305 and 310 applied statistics technology of the second input audio signal or heuristic technique, with from the first input audio signal 305
At least one serial correlation parameter of indicator sequence relevant action is generated in action with the second input audio signal 310.
Data processing system 105 can in batches or be collected corresponding to the first input audio signal 305 and the second input audio signal 310
Data transmission (for example, grouping) either action data structure to create the single thread data structure 200 or collected in batches.
In response to the first input audio signal 305 and the second input audio signal 310, data processing system 105 can be by single line number of passes
It is sent according to structure 200 or is otherwise provided to ISP's computing device 160, for ISP's computing device
160 processing, for example, to preengage an at least automobile, purchase film ticket or carry out dinner reservation.
The different instances of the part of identical single thread data structure can be provided to different computing devices.For example, can
All or some of single thread 200 is provided to realize conversion to ISP's computing device 160, for example, being taken from Car sharing
Automobile is subscribed in business, and the phase of single thread 200 can be provided to content provider's computing device 155 (simultaneously or successively)
Same or different piece is to realize another conversion, for example, obtaining the content item in restaurant.
In response to receiving single thread data structure 200, content provider's computing device 155 or ISP calculate
Equipment 160 is able to carry out at least one operation for being defined by single thread data structure 200 or being indicated.Operation can correspond to the
One input audio signal 305 either move by the corresponding of the action data structure (or data transmission) of the second input audio signal 310
One or more of make.For example, these operations can include the car sharing from ISP's computing device 160
Middle reservation automobile, or the content item of film is provided.For example, content provider's computing device 155 can be calculated to client
Equipment 150 provides first 315 (for example, content items of film) of response, and ISP's computing device 160 can be to phase
Same or different client computing device 150 provides the second response 320 (for example, reservation automobiles).It is calculated from content provider
Equipment 155 or ISP's computing device 160 to client computing device 150 transmission during, the first response 315 and the
Two responses 320 can bypass data processing system 105.Response 315,320 can include confirm the text of switching motion, image or
Other data-messages (including audio) of person preengage automobile or presentation content project such as from automobile services.Data processing system
System 105 can via computer network 165 from ISP's computing device 160, content provider's computing device 155 or from
Client computing device 150 receives the instruction of conversion (or response 315,320).
The list created by data processing system 105 (for example, by thread optimized component 120 or direct action API 135)
Thread 200 can indicate actual, known, scheduling or estimation the time of the action corresponding to thread.These times
People's time, dinner subscription time or event time etc. can be connect including movie start time, traffic.When time can be discrete
Between, for example, evening 8:00 dinner is preengage, or relative to the relative time of other actions, for example, action " B " is scheduled to
Start behind 15 minutes of known or estimation the end time of action " A ".For example, thread 200 can indicate the first action (example
Such as, have supper) it is scheduled to be happened at before the second action (for example, viewing film).These actions can correspond to from input
Data structure (or data transmission) action identified in audio signal.Direct action API can detect the first action completion.Example
Such as, computing device 150 is able to carry out script can estimate that dinner will with payment bill at the restaurant or direct action API 135
Either terminal user for 90 minutes is capable of providing audio input signal or other data-messages to indicate that the first action is completed
It is either scheduled to complete sometime or in a time window.In response to detecting that the first action is completed (for example,
The end time known or estimated), direct action API 135, which can continue to the packet of single thread being sent to service, to be provided
Person's computing device 160 or content provider's computing device 155.The transmission can be completed in known or estimation the first action
Either occur later (for example, in one hour) during the time window that known or estimation the first action is completed.For example, in evening
After the completion of meal, at least part of single thread 200 can be supplied to ISP's computing device by direct action API 135
160 to buy film ticket, or is supplied to content provider's computing device 155 to obtain the content item of film.It can be from visitor
Family end computing device 150, content provider's computing device 155 or ISP's computing device 160 are to data processing system
105 provide the instruction of conversion (for example, booking or presentation content project at client computing device 150).Serial correlation
Parameter 210 can indicate the scheduled sequence occurred of the action of single thread 200, for example, can indicate that the first action is scheduled to
It is happened at before the second action.
Direct action API 135 can identify at least one deadlock situation of at least one action of single thread 200.Deadlock
Situation can indicate that the second action cannot continue, until first formerly action is completed.For example, when the first action is that film is dynamic
It is when being gone home after a movie ends by car sharing traffic, directly to make (film is watched in movie theatre) and the second action
Deadlock situation can be identified by meeting action API 135.Direct action API 135 can determine the second action (for example, going home by bus)
Deadlock situation, continue until that time associated with the first action, such as film are ranked the end time.In response to deadlock
The other assemblies of situation, direct action API 135 or such as interface 115 can prevent data transmission from being calculated to ISP
Equipment (for example, car sharing).For example, during the period of deadlock situation, data processing system 105 or its component energy
Enough prevent the data packet transfer of the data transmission (or data structure) for acting (for example, reservation automobile) from being provided to service
Person's computing device 160 (for example, car sharing).This just prevents ISP's computing device 160 from receiving pair too early
The request of automobile (or other services).
Direct action API 135 can be indicated or otherwise be determined that deadlock situation has been terminated or no longer deposited
.For example, direct action API 135 can inquire ISP's computing device 160 or other third party's computing devices with
Determine film or other action be ranked the end time.After reaching the time, or the threshold time before the time
Direct action API can interrupt, release or terminate deadlock situation in section (for example, either 5 minutes 30 minutes).In deadlock shape
After condition is expired, data processing system 105 can send (for example, via interface 105) number to ISP's computing device 160
According to transmission or the data of data structure, corresponds to subsequent action, go home by bus after such as film.
Direct action API 135 can be received from client computing device 150 and be indicated, to terminate deadlock situation.For example, eventually
End subscriber can determine to leave the theatre in advance before film terminates, and input audio signal can be input to client calculating and set
In standby, for example, " (well, this film is too poor by OK, this movie stinks, I ' d like a ride home please
Cake, I thinks to go home by bus) ".Data processing system 105 (for example, NLP components 110 or direct action API 135) can be from this
It determines that deadlock situation has expired in input audio signal, and the data of subsequent action can be sent to ISP's calculating
Equipment 160.After Dead lock situation, direct action API 135 can also provide dynamic to content provider's computing device 155
The data (for example, data of the data transmission of single thread 200 or action data structure) of work, to obtain and act phase after deadlock
The content item of pass.Content item can be supplied to visitor by data processing system 105 or by content provider's computing device 155
Family end computing device 150 is presented.Content item can for example indicate " Sorry to hear about the movie,
would you like to order a car from a car share company(the problem of about film unfortunately,
You want to subscribe automobile from Car sharing company)”.In response to deadlock situation or until Dead lock situation, content selector
Component 125 (the either such as other assemblies of interface 115 or direct action API 135) can prevent content item selection or
Transmission of the selected content item of person to client computing device 150.
Direct action API 135 can change the sequential order of the action indicated by single thread 200.For example, direct action
API can determine the instruction of the first sequential order, for example, the second action and second after the first action, the first action are dynamic
Third action after work (dinner, then film, then goes home by bus).Direct action API 135 and such as NLP components 110
The request of modification sequential order can be received with the other assemblies of interface 115.For example, data processing system 105 can be from client
Holding computing device to receive input audio signal, " (good, I thinks OK I ' d like to eat dinner after the movie
Have supper after film) ".Direct action API 135 (or NLP components 110) can be obtained from the audio input signal
The request that the sequential order of action is modified as such as film and then dinner and then is gone home by bus.It is directly dynamic from the information
The sequential order of modification can be generated by making API 135, so that the second action (viewing film) is scheduled to be happened at first now
Before action (having supper).Either content selection device assembly 125 (or other assemblies) can be correspondingly by direct action API 135
Proceed to and the data transmission of movie action is sent to content provider's computing device 155 before the data transmission that dinner acts
Or ISP's computing device 160.Based on the end time of the first movie action, direct action API 135 can also know
Not or deadlock situation is changed, relevant operation is acted with delay and dinner.Example is only made in the action of dinner, film and traffic,
And any number of end user activity or request can constitute action.In addition to input audio signal, modification can
Occur in response to input.For example, if the film ticket of 9pm films (after dinner) is sold out, data processing system 105 can carry
For the audio output for being presented at client computing device 150, it is proposed that watch film before dinner (for example, 5 field of points in afternoon
It is secondary).
Data processing system 105 is able to carry out offline play.This can save processing and electrical power demand, and reduce network industry
It is engaged in or is transferred into the off-peak hours.For example, single thread 200 can indicate the first action and the solution depending on the first action
The second subsequent action certainly.These action can either several weeks (or more long), such as purchase be six following in several days apart
The air ticket (the first action, today) that the three weeks tropical seabeaches that can occur the moon are spent a holiday, and subscribe the diving class for last day of spending a holiday
Journey (the second action, after six wheat harvesting periods).Direct action API 135 can buy aircraft in response to receiving with online actions
The input audio signal of ticket and with 160 real-time Communication for Power of ISP's computing device corresponding to airline's entity, with realize
Conversion --- purchase plane ticket.There are six the moons for the second action in this example.In this six months periods or other times window
In mouthful, the other assemblies of direct action API 135 or such as content selection device assembly 125 can be (latent in response to the second action
Water course) and select content item or execute other operations.For example, direct action API can be by from data repository 145
Or it obtains the information from third party's data repository in relation to course of diving under water and obtains offline.Offline play can or can be with
It is not real-time, and offline play does not require the time interval (for example, six months) between action.For example, as with client
The communication session of computing device or the part either synchronously or asynchronously talked with, data processing system 105 can be deposited from data in real time
Storage cavern 145 obtains information in response to action from third party database.
Fig. 4 depicts management indicator sequence correlation in the computer network environment based on packet of voice activation and grasps
The method 400 of the audio input data communication of the voice activation of work.Method 400 can receive at least one first audio input letter
Number (ACT 405).For example, via interface 115, NLP components can receive packet (ACT 405).Data processing system 105
NLP components 110 are able to carry out, start or call, to be based on from the reception of at least one client computing device 150 via network
Grouping or the transmission of other agreements.Packet can include or corresponding to the biography by the first client computing device 150
The input audio signal that sensor 151 detects, such as first terminal user customer computing device 150 are (for example, intelligent hand
Machine) it says " OK, I would like to go to go dinner tonight (good, I, which wants to go to tonight, has supper) ".Method
400 can parse input audio signal, to identify at least one first request or at least one the from input audio signal
One triggering keyword (ACT 410).For example, NLP components 110 can parse input audio signal, it is (right with identification request
The amusement of " dinner (dinner) " is asked) and correspond to or be relevant to the triggering keyword of the request (" to go to (are wanted
Go) ").Based on associated with the first audio input signal received identified request or keyword, 400 energy of method
Enough generate at least one first action data structure (ACT 415).For example, direct action API 135 can generate instruction first
The action data structure of action, such as taxi connect position, requested ISP or the restaurant recommendation of people.
Method 400 can receive at least one second audio input signal (ACT 420).For example, NLP components 110 can
It is received from the identical or different client computing device 150 for initiating the first input audio signal based on grouping via network 165
Or the transmission of other agreements.Packet can include or corresponding to the sensor by the second client computing device 150
151 input audio signals detected, such as terminal user say " OK, I would like to client computing device 150
To catch a movie later (good, I wants to go to later watches movie) ".Method 400 can be from the second input audio signal
Identify at least one second request or at least one second triggering keyword (ACT 425).For example, NLP components 110 can solve
Input audio signal is analysed, asks and (ask the amusement of " movie (film) ") and correspond to or be relevant to this to ask with identification
The triggering keyword (" to catch (going to see) ") asked.It is identified based on associated with the first audio input signal received
Request or keyword, method 400 can generate at least one second action data structure (ACT 430).For example, directly
Action API 135 can generate the action data structure of the second action of instruction, and such as taxi connects the position of people, requested clothes
Business supplier or film information.
Method 400 can build data transmission (ACT 435) from action data structure.For example, 135 energy of direct action API
It is enough from the first action data Structure Creating first data transmission corresponding to the first input audio signal, and can from corresponding to
Second the second data transmission of action data Structure Creating of the second input audio signal.By will be from corresponding action data structure
The information block of acquisition, or otherwise action data structure is converted into as the communication session broadly defined one
Partial transmission form, such as calculate and set with content provider in terminal user's computing device 150 via data processing system 105
Standby 155 either between ISP's computing device 160 back and forth or asynchronous conversations either data transmission can build or give birth to
At the data transmission (ACT 435) of first and second (or other numbers).It is set with multiple third parties corresponding to different entities
Can be considered as the communication session of (for example, content provider's computing device 155 or ISP's computing device 160)
A part for common communication session.Communication session can travel to and fro between client computing device 150 back and forth in dialogue event
Data transmission synchronization, or exist between data transmission asynchronous in the case of for example, at least one hour rest period.
Method 400 can obtain data (ACT 440) from data transmission.For example, from data transmission (or from corresponding
Action data structure), thread optimized component 120 can (for example, from data repository 145) access or retrieve about action
