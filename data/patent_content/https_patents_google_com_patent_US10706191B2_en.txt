- a hierarchical Bayesian model may be a Bayesian model that has a hierarchy of model levels or “sub-models.” Bayesian hierarchical models are used to generate posterior distributions for parameters of the model based on collected data for said parameters and a prior distribution for said parameters.
- the prior distribution may have its own parameters, often referred to as hyper-parameters.
- the hyper-parameters themselves may be trained based on data and priors for said hyper-parameters, often referred to as a hyper-priors.
- Bayesian modelling can allow for prior information be used to inform the model and can model more complex models i.e., with informative priors.
- Bayesian hierarchical models can further provide more natural uncertainty statements and track both parameter and model uncertainties. Further, Bayesian modelling may allow propagation of uncertainty to optimization statements.
- MMM Media mix model
- KPIs key performance indicators
- Regression can be used to infer causation from observational data.
- the gold standard for making causal statements is randomized experiments, regression is popular because experiments in advertising face many hurdles. Advertisers are often unwilling to incur the technical and operational expense of running randomized experiments and a large number of experiments would be needed over sufficiently long time periods, to adequately capture ad shape and carryover effects.
- Historical media mix data is usually aggregated weekly or sometimes monthly for 2-5 years, providing the possibility to model the media impact over a longer period of time than experiments.
- a Bayesian media mix model can be used with ad shape and carryover effects for a single brand aggregated at the national-level (referred to as a national-level BMMM herein).
- This model may suffer from small sample size and insufficient variation in media spend unless strong priors are used.
- One improvement to the model may be to pool data from one or more brands into the same product category and pass the knowledge via informative priors to a single brand within the same category.
- Media mix modeling is a statistical analysis on historical data to measure the return on investment (ROI) on advertising and other marketing activities.
- ROI return on investment
- a BMMM that utilizes data aggregated at a national-level often suffers from small sample size and insufficient variation in the media spend.
- a geo-level Bayesian hierarchical media mix model (GBHMMM) can be generated on said sub-national data.
- a GBHMMM can provide estimates with tighter credible intervals compared to a model with national-level data alone. This reduction in error is due to having more observations and useful variability in media spend, which can protect advertisers from unsound reallocation decisions.
- the geo-level model can reduce advertisement targeting bias.
- the geo-level model estimates generally deteriorate as more media variables are imputed using the national-level data.
- the country of focus in an MMM can usually be partitioned into a set of geographic areas which can be referred to herein as “geos.”
- Data for building a MMM i.e., a GBHMMM
- the geo-level data has a larger effective sample size compared to the national-level data as long as the geo-level time series are not perfectly correlated with national-level values. Gathering data at a geo-level can enhance the data used to generate the Bayesian modeling, improving the performance of the Bayesian model. Also, it is common that an advertiser may never decrease their national-level media spend close to zero or always keep the spend of a media channel at a level too small compared to other channels.
- the marketing spend at the geo-level generally has a wider range than that at the national-level, which is critical to MMM as insufficient variation often leads to extrapolation issues. If it is assumed that the mechanism of media impact is similar across geos, the MMM can take advantage of this additional level of variation using a geo-level model (i.e., the GBHMMM).
- Advertising bias can occur when the advertiser directs marketing efforts towards an underlying base demand. Hence, the media spend may be highly correlated with the base demand. When control variables do not perfectly capture the base demand, biases are introduced and media attribution may be incorrect.
- the GBHMMM can be simulated with the presence of advertising bias resulting from directed marketing efforts as discussed with reference to FIGS. 10-11 . Another challenge to the GBHMMM is that the geo-level data may not be available for all media channels. The GBHMMM is tested with imputed data, the test and results are shown and discussed with reference to FIGS. 12-13 . These simulations, as well as the various other simulations discussed herein, can be performed with the software environment R.
- a Bayesian hierarchical model can be generated based on pooled information from multiple geographic regions and prior knowledge. The prior knowledge may be based on industry experience.
- the properties of geo-level data that can be used to generate a Bayesian hierarchical model, various variable transformations, and a geo-level Bayesian hierarchical model, and the systems and methods for generating the geo-level Bayesian hierarchical model are described in further detail with reference to FIGS. 1-2 and elsewhere herein. Comparisons between the national-level BMMM and GBHMMM are discussed through various simulations and the simulation results shown in FIGS. 5-9 .
- the GBHMMM is generated on example real data i.e., the historical geo-level media mix data of advertisers in the auto category, which is further discussed with reference to FIGS. 14-17 .
- Media mix data can be aggregated at a national-level. This data aggregation at the national-level may suffer from small sample size and insufficient variation with a large amount of model parameters.
- a Bayesian hierarchical model can incorporate regional variations to enhance media mix modeling. Simulations and a real example from the auto category demonstrate that the geo level Bayesian hierarchical model (GBHMMM) helps reduce uncertainty of estimators compared to the BMMM using national-level data alone, and thus yields more accurate attribution results.
- GBHMMM geo level Bayesian hierarchical model
- the improvement over the national-level BMMM is more pronounced when the level of media spend per capita varies significantly across geos.
- the geo-level model may not eliminate advertising bias, it can generally tighten the credible intervals of the estimators and sometimes lowers the bias.
- Another common challenge is that regional level spend data is not always available for all media channels. Obtaining accurate geo-level data may be important for improving the performance of the GBHMMM. However, the imputed geo-level model can still generate useful information for the media channels with complete geo-level data. Hence it is better to build a geo-level model when the geo-level data is available, or partially available, as long as the geos have similar media impact mechanism.
- the model specification discussed herein is one way to set up a geo-level model.
- Other functions to model shape and carryover effect can be used instead of the Hill and geometric adstock functions discussed herein.
- the hierarchical structure of the GBHMMM may not be necessary for all the predictors.
- Bayesian model selection techniques such as Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) can be employed to choose a model.
- the geo-level model can be extended to help correct advertising bias in MMM.
- Various simulation methods can be used to test the GBHMMM such as multi-stage simulation which may model a wider variety of marketing situations.

- the national priors 342 may be probability distributions for parameters of the national-level model. Since the national-level model is not geo based, the priors are not specific to parameters for particular geos but and thus are referred to as national priors.
- National estimates 340 are shown in FIG. 3C .

- the posterior densities for the national-level model are 360 , 362 , 364 , and 366 .
- the posteriors for the GBHMMM 138 have less uncertainty than the posteriors of the national-level Bayesian model.
- posteriors with less uncertainty can be understood as “taller” i.e., the majority of the probability of the posterior lies within a smaller range of values (e.g., refer to posterior 350 ).
- posteriors with more uncertainty can be understood as “wider” i.e., the probability of the posterior is spread out across values (e.g., refer to posterior 360 ).
- Posteriors which have less uncertainty are desired for models as opposed to posteriors with greater uncertainty. For this reason, it can be seen that the GHBMMM 138 has better posteriors than a national level model, even though the GBHMMM 138 was trained on the same data as the national level.
- One reason for the improvement is the specific steps of data manipulation that can be used to generate the geo-level data 136 from the geographic sub-region data 344 i.e., steps 302 - 308 .
- the modelling improvements of the GBHMMM 138 over the national-level BMMM can be seen.
- both models use the same national data set.
- the GBHMMM 138 breaks the national data set down based on geographic regions to generate the geo-level data 136 . Leaving the national data as is, i.e., not breaking the data down by geographic region, is the geographic sub-region data 344 .
- the GBHMMM 138 can be generated to be a significantly stronger model than the national level model.
- the posteriors 350 - 356 are shown to have less uncertainty than the posteriors 360 - 366 of the national level model. Having posteriors with less uncertainty indicates that the model is more accurate in its predictions.

- the Bayesian modeler 122 can be configured to perform the various methods described herein. Specifically, the data manager 126 can be configured to perform the various data collection, data sorting, and data manipulation steps described. Further, the modeler 124 of the Bayesian modeler 122 can be configured to perform the various model fitting steps described herein. Generating, the GBHMMM 138 begins with the identification of the geos 134 . It may be necessary to serve advertisements according to these geographic regions with reasonable accuracy and to track advertising spend and the response metrics at the geographic-level. One possible set of geos 134 is cities. Cities are often adopted as a geo-targeting unit by many advertising platforms.
- cities e.g., geographic sub-regions
- geos it may be useful to aggregate cities (e.g., geographic sub-regions) into larger geos for two reasons.
- One reasons may be that data at the city level can be sparse and noisy for small cities.
- Advertisers generally track key predictor indicators (KPIs) at a very granular level and it is relatively straightforward to aggregate the KPIs to geos. It is easier to obtain geo-level advertisement spend data for certain types of media than others.
- Spot television advertising is by definition aggregated at specific geographic areas where the television advertisements are placed. National television ad spend in each geo can be estimated by data manager 126 from television Gross Rating Points data at the geo-level and is available from comScore Inc. Price and promotion are sometimes available at the geo-level.
- Data sources 110 may include Information Resources, Inc (IRI), Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG), and/or R.L. Polk & Company. Information Resources, Inc (IRI) may provide price and promotion data for consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands at the geo level and R.L. Polk & Company provides such data for auto brands.
- Digital advertising publishers generally have the capability to break down media exposure and spend by geo.
- the GBHMMM 138 is useful in such a case. This may be because the available geos may represent the majority of sales and ad spend.
- the geo-level variability in the data may help the geo-level model to outperform a national-level BMMM.
- geo-targeting techniques make it possible to vary ad spend across geo locations.
- Geo experiments are often used to measure the ad effectiveness by modifying the media spend in randomly picked treatment geos and estimating the response relative to the control geos.
- Independent variation in marketing spend across geos from the experiments offers the possibility to improve MMM results by eliminating or reducing advertisement bias, that occurs from the result of directed marketing efforts, and increasing the effective sample size. It may also be less expensive for advertisers to change marketing spend in a few selected geos than nationally.
- Both the response and predictor variables can be normalized by the target population size of a geo in order to build a model with similar media impact across geos. While control variables such as temperature, unemployment rate, etc. are independent of the target population size in each geo, KPI and marketing spend are generally positively correlated with it. In addition, a certain amount of media spend may reach the saturation point in one city but not in another city, since the cities differ in the target population size. Hence in order to build a model with shared advertising shape effect, media spend can be standardized to the amount per capita. In some use cases, the census population size may be one proxy for the target population.
- This data may be the geographic sub-region data and/or the geo-level data 136 .
- the response variable may be a KPI (e.g. revenue, online inquiries, etc.).
- the media variables could be advertising spend or number of impressions delivered.
- the control variables can include product price, promotions, and macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment rate, gasoline price, etc.
- the number of geos 134 , g may be in the tens and the number of time periods T may be in the hundreds depending on the aggregation level of the data.
- the target population size for one geo 134 , g Letting the target population size for one geo 134 , g, be s g . It may vary across the geos 134 but can be assumed to be the same across time during the observation period.
- the variables ⁇ x and ⁇ z can be the set of indices for media variables and control variables that are subject to the target population size and ⁇ x c and ⁇ z c can be their complements.
- the former variables to be the amount per capita using s g .
- the ranges of media variables could vary significantly across channels.
- the data manager 126 can be configured to normalize x t,m,g to be between zero and one for each of the M media channels. Standardization of variables is described with further detail herein.
- Advertising may exhibit a lag or carryover effect, i.e., a delayed response can occur in subsequent time periods of advertising.
- a delayed response can occur in subsequent time periods of advertising.
- Several functional forms such as geometric adstock, polynomial distributed lags (PDL), and delayed adstock, can be used to model the carryover effect.
- PDL polynomial distributed lags
- advertising can have diminishing returns at high level of spend, referred to as shape effect.
- Non-linear transformation of media variables are often used to model the curvature of the response, including the logarithmic transformation, Hill function, and logistic growth function.
- the carryover and shape effect of advertising can be modeled through the (normalized) adstock function and the Hill function.
- the adstock function can be defined as (Equation 7),
- the integer L is the maximum duration of carry effect.
- geometric adstock x t *( ⁇ , L) in the model specification hereafter.
- Other adstock functions can be used in a similar fashion.
- the Hill function can be applied after the adstock transformation.
- the Hill function is defined as (Equation 10),
- the GBHMMM 138 can be a Bayesian hierarchical model with non-linear transformation on some of the predictors.
- the hierarchical linear model or mixed effect model may assume that the data is drawn from a hierarchy of subpopulations with repeated measurements on each. Such a model can control for unobserved heterogeneity across subpopulations with random coefficients. The random coefficient can have a different value for each subpopulation. It can be assumed for simplicity that there is no synergy effect between media, which may not be true in practice.
- the geo-level response (e.g., the response of the GBHMMM 138 ) can be modeled as shown in (Equations 11-14),
- These parameters can be restricted to be the same across geos but can be allowed to vary across media. While these parameters could be allowed to vary across the geos 134 , this can raise identifiability problems. Priors for parameters associated with the carryover and shape effects, such as ⁇ , K, S may be needed.
- the maximum duration of carryover effect L is fixed to be the same for all the media channels. L may be predetermined by users and not estimated in the GBHMMM 138 , although it would be possible to allow L to be a parameter estimated in the model as well.
- the priors may be set to default priors. Alternatively, category level priors can be used as informative priors for the GBHMMM 138 . If the data is strong enough, the posterior will be pulled towards the true parameters, otherwise, the posteriors will be close to the priors. If non-negativity is desired for ⁇ , a gamma prior or a half-positive normal prior can be put on ⁇ . Using an improper prior uniform (0, ⁇ ) on scale parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ can lead to slow convergence. The scale parameters may be unlikely to exceed a low range, especially when modeling the response variable on the log scale. It may be necessary to have a bounded prior or a prior with much of its probability mass near zero, for example, half normal distribution.
- the modeler 124 can use a variety of methods to generate (fit) the GBHMMM 138 .
- the methods may include Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
- MCMC can be used to fit the GBHMMM 138 .
- STAN® which uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, offers a general implementation to fit Bayesian models.
- Customized algorithms which take advantage of the specific model form of the GBHMMM 138 , can also be developed to fit such models and be faster than STAN®.
- the GBHMMM 138 may be a hierarchical linear model when conditioning on the transformation parameters. Gibbs sampling can be used to fit the geo-level model by alternating between sampling the transformation parameters and the hierarchical linear model parameters. When conditioning on the parameters of the hierarchical linear model, slice sampling can be used to draw samples from the full conditional distribution of the transformation parameters. When conditioning on the transformation parameters, Gibbs sampling can be used to draw samples for parameters associated with the hierarchical linear model.
- the hierarchical structure of the GBHMMM 138 may not be needed for all predictors.
- Such models have much fewer parameters to estimate than a full GBHMMM.

- the risk of using imputed geo-level media spend in the GBHMMM 138 through simulation is explored.
- the GBHMMM 138 with the actual regional level spend can be referred to as the full GBHMMM 138 while the GBHMMM 138 with the media spend imputed by the national-level spend can be referred to as the imputed GBHMMM 138 .
- Three media variables are simulated using the same model parameters as in Table 1, denoted media.1, media.2, and media.3, each positively correlated with the base demand at the geo level. The correlation is set to be 0.5 for all three media channels. Conditioning on the base demand, the three media variables are independent over time. Other simulation settings are kept the same as in Simulation I.
- the GBHMMM 138 can be fit to each of the following data sets.

- the true response is illustrated by curve 1201 .
- the performance of the estimates deteriorates as more media variables are imputed.
- the positive biases in the estimated response curves and the ROASs of the imputed geo-level model stem from the low variation in the imputed geo-level media spend and the geometry of the Hill transformation.
- charts 1300 illustrates three boxplots 1302 , 1304 , and 1306 of the estimated national average ROAS for the GBHMMM 138 for three different medial channels (e.g., Internet advertising, radio advertising, printed advertising, etc.) for over 100 simulated datasets is shown.

- Charts 1300 compare the model performance over simulated datasets with increasing number of imputed media variables.
- FIG. 13 and Table 6 it appears that when only media.1 is imputed, the ROAS estimates for media.2 and media.3 are slightly worse than those of the full geo-level model, but are still reasonable. This may be due to the fact that the correlation between the media variables and the base demand is only 0.5. If the correlations among the media variables increase, we would expect to see worse performance for media.2 and media.3.
- the collected data used in the GBHMMM 138 is data gathered from advertisers in automobile category (e.g., data received and/or collected from data sources 110 ).

- the ad spend may be controlled by local dealerships.
- MarketShart is a marketing analytics company.
- the 18 DMAs cover more than 50% of total new car registrations in the entire category. Advertising for the 12 auto brands in the United States is dominated by television which includes more than 80% of tier one nameplate marketing budgets. The ad spend may come from the national advertising budget of an automobile manufacturer. The monthly dollar sales can be calculated by multiplying the number of car registrations with the average sales price of a brand at each DMA.

- chart 1404 illustrates television advertising spend at each of the 18 geos
- chart 1406 illustrates total sales for each of the 18 geos.
- FIG. 14 shows the distribution of sales, television ad spend, and search ad spend across 18 geos (the numbers are relative). These variables are positively correlated across geos because they are all confounded by the geo level target population size.
- the target population size in each DMA is estimated by the average monthly sales during the entire sample period.
- the monthly sales and media spend in each DMA are standardized by the target population size to be the amount per capita. Transformed dollar sales can be logged to be the response variable.
- the media spends are transformed to be between zero and one, this standardization of variables is discussed further herein. There is little change in the market price over the two year period for the 12 brands and thus the price is not included in the model. Control variables are centered and scaled within each DMA.
- a normal(0,1) prior e.g., a hyper-prior
- a customized Gibbs sampler with 10,000 iterations can be used to fit the model.
- the aggregated search query volume for the 12 brands in each DMA is included in the model to approximate the local seasonal demand for automobiles.
- the national-level data for a single brand only have 24 observations (monthly over the two-year period). Hence a comparison between the category-level model using the national-level data with the category-geo-level model (see Equations 15-19) to understand the benefit of the geo-level data can be done.
- the national-level media mix data for the entire category (12 brands) have 288 observations.
- the category based GBHMMM yields considerably tighter credible intervals than the category base BMMM due to larger sample size and wider range of media spend.
- both models show that the television effect peaks around one month after the ad exposure and decays gradually over the next two months, while the search effect peaks around one to two weeks.
- FIG. 16 shows that the distribution of television spend at the national-level is extremely skewed with many observations at or close to zero while the search spend at the national-level is approximately normally distributed, with fewer observations close to zero. television seems to be closer to the saturation point at its maximum historical spend than search.

- FIG. 17 shows the boxplot of the posterior samples of the average ROAS at the national-level for 12 brands.
- the geo-level data reduces the estimation uncertainty in the ROAS estimates.
- the improvement varies across brands and channels, which could be a result of different media spend variation at the geo level.
- data manager 126 can be configured to perform data scaling i.e., standardization of variables.

- for g=1, . . . , G, t=1, . . . , T.
where {xt, t≥1} is a media spend time series and w(l), for l∈{0, . . . L−1} is a nonnegative weight function.
w g(l;α)=αl, for l∈{0,. . . ,L−1},
where α ∈ (0,1) is the retention rate of ad effect of the media.
w d(l;α,θ)=α(l−θ)
where θ ∈ [0, L−1] is the delay of the peak effect and α ∈ (0,1) is the retention rate.
where S>0, K>0 and x is the adstock transformed media spend. K can be referred to as EC50, the half saturation point as Hill(K; K, S)=½ for any value of K and S. The Hill function goes to 1 as the media spend goes to infinity. The corresponding response curve is defined as βHill(x; K, S) where β is the maximum ad effect achievable. If the true K is far outside the range of observed historical media spend, the parameters K, S, β are essentially unidentifiable. The range of geo-level media spend may generally be wider than that at the national-level and thus makes the estimation of these parameters more feasible.
where each geo is a sample from the overall population and is allowed to deviate from the population level mechanism through the random effects τg, βg=(β1,g, . . . , βM,g) and γg=(γc,1, . . . , γC,g), g=1, . . . , G. The geo-level variation is controlled by the standard deviations κ, η=(η1, . . . , ηM) and ξ=(ξ1, . . . , ξC), respectively. The parameters τ, β=(β1, . . . , βM), γ=(γ1, . . . , γC) are hyper-parameters, representing the common mechanism of media impact at the total population level. Priors (e.g., hyper-priors) are needed for the hyper-parameters τ, β, γ and standard deviations κ, η, ξ.
where yt is the response variable, xt,m is the spend of media channel m, for m=1, . . . , M and zt,c is the control variable for c=1, . . . , C at the time t. τ, β=(β1, . . . , βM), γ=(γ1, . . . , γC) are the hyper-parameters. Priors may be needed for τ, β, γ, α, K, S, σ.
where Xt,g 1.01,m is the media spend time series with the m−th media spend multiplied by 1.01 during the period [T0, T1].

Read Data Case Study
x t,m,g=(x t,m,g−mint,g(x t,m,g))/(maxt,g(x t,m,g)−mint,g(x t,m,g)).
and rescale media variables relative to the range of total weekly ad spend or exposure across times and geos (Equation 32),
x t,m,g=(x t,m,g−mint,g(x t,g))/(maxt,g(x t,g)−mint,g(x t,g))
z t,c,g=ζc,g +v t,c,g
where vt,c,g is white noise and ζc,g is the baseline product price in geo g. Without centering zt,c,g the Bayesian estimate of the coefficient of zt,c,g would be highly correlated with the intercept of geo g. Also when both household income and product price serve as control variables, their coefficients would be correlated. On the other hand, with centering, the model would focus on explaining the impact of change in control variables within each geo and leave the difference of price across geos to the intercept. The centering and scaling also facilitate the use of common priors on the coefficients of the control variables. However, these transformations alter the meaning of the coefficients, so modellers should decide on a case by case basis what transformation is needed for the control variables.
Derivation of the Geo Level Correlation
x t,g =u g+ρg h t,g+√{square root over (1−ρg 2)}v t,g
where ρg=Cor(xt,g, ht,g) is the correlation between the media spend and the base demand. It can be assumed that the geos are of equal size but the conclusion could be extended to the case that geos are of different sizes. As ug, g=1, . . . , G are fixed, without loss of generality, we could set ug=0 for g=1, . . . , G and E(ht,g)=0. We first consider a simple case that the geo-level base demand time series are the same ht,g=ht,Var(ht)=1 and the correlations ρg=ρ, g=1, . . . , G are the same across geos.
where ht is independent of the geo specific factor vt,g. The correlation between the national-level media spend xt and the base demand ht is (Equation 35-37),
for G≥2 i.e., the national-level correlation between the media spend and the base demand is higher than that at the geo level.
i.e., the national-level correlation between the media spend and the base demand is higher than that at the geo level.
