Person's module 108 can block 408 to drafting system 112 send data.In certain embodiments, module 129 or module 108 can
Whether to be related to foot including the geographic position data 314 for analyzing user's drawing activity data 300 to determine any discovery
To continue to prefetch one or more computer executable instructions that map tile data are used to store in cache 110.
For example, module 129 or module 108 can only determine one of geographic position data 314 according to user's drawing activity data 300
Example, the example indicates that " Boston " is geographical position.Only one indicates ensure any further action of system 100
Cache map tile data.But the finger of the specific geographic position data 314 from more users drawing activity data 300
Number of thresholds can jointly be reached to ensure to perform the further instruction for cache map tile data by showing.Module
129 or 108 can include being used for can in the computer of one or more data repository memory storage geographic position data 314
Execute instruction.For example, module 129 or 108 can analyze graphics module search history 306, the geography determined in history 306
Position data 314 and in the data of the memory storage determination of depots 132.If the ground of the determination in data repository 132
Reason position data 314 is met or more than number of thresholds, then the quantity of geographic position data 314, which can ensure to perform, is used for high speed
Cache the further instruction of map tile data.
User's drawing activity data 300 or the geographic position data 314 determined can also include timestamp information, and
Module can include the computer executable instructions for the threshold value period, for the threshold time period, geographical position number
It will ensure cache map tile data according to 314 determination.If for example, module 129 or 108 is within the period of one week
It is determined that three geographic position datas 314 for " Boston " indicate that then module can determine to already exceed one or more
Threshold value and perform for cache be used for the position map tile data further instruction in contrast, if module
129 or 108 determine that three geographic position datas 314 for " Boston " indicate that then module can in year section
To determine to have not exceeded one or more threshold value and return to block 402.Certainly, block 404 and 406 can perform user's drawing
The statistics of activity data 300 and other it is analyzed to determine whether to continue next piece or to continue to fetch user's drawing activity data
300。
