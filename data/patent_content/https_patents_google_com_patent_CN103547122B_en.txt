Figure 1A and Figure 1B shows the example implementation of a part including 102 data center 100 of data center's cooling unit
Top view and cross-sectional side view.As shown, data center 100 include support computer (for example, server, processor,
Motherboard, memory module, pallet and other) rack 131 two rows 130.Row 130 by being substantially parallel to each other arranges, and
Each neighbouring mankind can occupy the channel of working space 132.In some embodiments, the calculating being supported in rack 131
Machine the mankind can be occupied working space 132 be it is open, allow air-flow during the routine operation of system from work
Space 132 is recycled by rack 131, and make the accessible particular device of technical staff and substantially without interfering other to set
Standby upper air-flow, this rack be sealing and technical staff must open the door could one of access equipment in the case where may hair
It is raw.
Data center 100 further includes cooling unit 102, can also be known as cooling unit or refrigerating module, be disposed in
Between the phase adjacency pair of the row 130 of rack 131.In some implementations, cooling unit 102 can be located at the computer in data center
Between rack, with the cooling air to warm when passing through computer rack, wherein air can be followed again by computer rack
Ring.For doing so, cooling unit 102 can be located at the similar cooling unit being placed between the row of computer rack
In one long row (for example, 20 feet or more).It the back side (for example, face opposite with working space) of rack can be neighbouring cooling single
Member 102.Air can be by the front of computer rack (for example, neighbouring rack is usually from its accessed working space
Face), pass through various computation modules (such as, processor and power supply) and be extracted, and be discharged to from the rear portion of rack cooling single
The warm air air compartment 141 of member 102.Other cooling units in cooling unit 102 or row then can be with cooling air, and keeps its heavy
Newly it is circulated back to working space.In some implementations, it can be controlled or be managed by the air-flow of cooling unit, so as to each
Cooling unit is utilized effectively.As detailed below, the airflow management of this type can be by based on along cooling unit row
The set point of warm air air compartment realized to adjust one or more fans of each cooling unit.
Each cooling unit 102 include multiple fans 122 (for example, 6 as shown in the figure), it is arranged to by air from
Working space 132, by arranging that the rack 131 being expert in 130 recycles.As shown, surrounding air 134 is followed by rack 131
Ring and the heat generated by electronic equipment (for example, server, processor, continual power supply and other equipment), into
Enter the air-flow 136 of heating.The air-flow 136 of heating is recycled by one or more cooling worms (coil) 108 of cooling unit 102
To cooling air-flow 138.Cooling air-flow 138 is recycled to working space 132 by fan 122, as leaving from cooling unit 102
Air-flow 140.When cooling unit 102 is mounted, leaves air-flow 140 and usually transmitted with pipeline or be otherwise directed to
The upper area of data center 100, so that air direct circulation is entered upper area by fan 122.In other implementations, air
It can be entered by routing and promote floor, into the space between computer rack, into ceiling void, or can be with other conjunctions
Suitable mode is guided.In some implementations, cooling air-flow 138 and the temperature for leaving air-flow 140 can be substantially the same, example
Such as, if there is no the mixing of electronic equipment or other air between two electronic equipments.Alternatively, in some realizations
In, leaving air-flow 140 can be slightly warmer than cooling air-flow 138, to consider that the fan motor for example from driving fan 122 (does not show
Motor heat out).
Therefore, as shown, be defined between the row 130 of two substantially parallel racks 131, it is one or more cold
But unit 103 can be deployed in volume therein, may include that one or more warm air air compartments 141 and one or more are cold
Air plenum.For example, warm air air compartment 141 can be defined by thermal current 136 by the space that fan 122 is recycled into.One
In a little realizations, warm air air compartment 141 can longitudinally extend beyond the row 130 of rack 131.Alternatively, warm air air compartment 141 can be with
It is defined as the length substantially the same with the row 130 of rack 131.Cold air air compartment can be recycled by cold airflow 138
Space be defined.Therefore cooling worm 108 can make warm air air compartment 141 and cold air wind between the row 130 of rack 131
Room thermal release.
As shown, cooling fluid supply 142 is (for example, chilled water, freezing ethylene glycol, Water in Condenser, and/or one or more
The mixing of a liquid flow) (for example, pumping) logical cooled liquid feed line 144 is recycled to cooling worm 108.It is logical in circulation
Supercooling coil 108 is transferred to the heat from thermal current 136 after cooling fluid supply 142, and coolant liquid returns to 146
(for example, cooling fluid supply 142 leaves cooling worm 108) is recycled, via coolant liquid return conduit 149, from cooling worm 108
And such as extremely central cooling facility.Although illustrated as being disposed thereon the row 130 and cooling unit 102 that support rack 131
Floor under, but conduit 142 and/or 146 can be arranged in working space 132, on cooling unit 102, and
And/or person is in individual aerial (overhead) air chamber.
The system of diagram further includes one or more temperature sensor 148,150 and pressure sensor 152.For example, such as
Shown in figure, temperature sensor 148 can be placed on one or more positions, leave gas from cooling unit 102 with measurement
The temperature of stream 140.In some implementations, cooling air-flow 138, leave the surrounding flow 134 of air-flow 140 and working space 132
Temperature can be essentially similar and/or equal.Therefore, measure any one of these air-flows temperature can at least be similar to it is cold
But unit 102 leaves air themperature.Additional temperature sensor 150 can be placed to measure the temperature of cooling fluid supply 142
Degree.Pressure sensor 152 can be placed on each point along warm air air compartment 142.For example, one or more pressure pass
Sensor 152 can be placed along warm air air compartment 141 at certain intervals, be directly adjacent to each cooling unit 102 with measurement
Air compartment air pressure.
In operation, cooling unit 102 can be controlled, such as individually controlled using control system, one or more,
And/or the master controller of data center, to maintain specific temperature.Temperature can be single temperature, such as the gas being discharged from fan
The temperature of stream, or alternatively, close to temperature.In some implementations, it can indicate to leave the air-flow of cooling unit 102 close to temperature
Temperature (for example, cold airflow 138, leaving air-flow 140, surrounding flow 134, and/or from one or more of these gas flow temperatures
Determining mean air flow temperature) with the temperature difference of cooling fluid supply 142.In some implementations, such control is (for example, close
Control) can provide convection current supercooling coil 108 cooling fluid supply 142 amount (for example, GPM) adjustment, to remain specific
Close to temperature.In some implementations, this can be for example including adjusting (for example, passing through servo antrol (servo close to control
Control)) coolant control valve 154 can also be put although control valve 154 is illustrated as being included in liquid return pipe
Set the other positions in liquid supply tube or in system, with controller 156, the controller can with independent operation or
It is operated according to the order from master controller, to stablize close to temperature to desired value.For example, due to eliminating by rack
The amount of cooling fluid supply 142 needed for the heat for the specific quantity (for example, kW) that electronic equipment in 131 generates with it is anti-close to temperature
Correlation, so one " handle " (knob) can be provided by changing close to temperature, to by making cooling fluid supply 142 flow through cooling
Coil 108 come adjust eliminate produced by GPM/kW needed for heat.
In some implementations, in any given time on snapshot at, some racks in data center 131 may ratio
Other racks 131 more hardy work, for example, generating more kW.Therefore, needed for any specific position in the data center
Cooling power may change over time.Therefore, it can be automatically provided close to control (approach control) to coolant liquid
The distribution of supply 142 is loaded so that " adaptations " is cooling, even if may be not present to any power (for example, kW) or flow velocity (for example,
GPM direct measurement), but there are temperature measurements.
In some implementations, can be close to control it is essentially static, for example, can not be with close to temperature set-point
Time change.For example, static approach all or most cooling units 102 application that control can into data center for approaching
The individually fixed value of temperature set-point.This may make the distribution to coolant liquid (for example, setting from central plant or other coolings
Apply) it is merely capable of being based in each 102 available information in part of cooling unit (for example, leaving air themperature and entering coolant liquid
Temperature) adapt to cooling load.This mode can permit the temperature in data center floor for example according to weather to cooling plant energy
The influence of power adapts to season, such as by maximizing the chance freely cooled down.
It in some implementations, can be dynamic close to control, for example, connecing for one or more cooling units 102
Nearly temperature set-point can be with time change.For example, dynamically can permit close to control desired close to controlling set point
Progress changes on room and time.As a result it will be, (such as refrigerating plant, freely cool down facility from central cooling device
And/or the two) all or most of available capability of cooling liquid available more optimally dispose.By in response to example
The type of the electronic equipment of each position in data center floor is such as deployed in (for example, server, processor, memory group
Part), type (for example, Web search, Email and other services based on web), the data of the service that are executed by these equipment
Factor as practical cooling system ability under practical aggregation heat load, present weather conditions on center floor etc. and dynamic
Ground changes close to temperature set-point, adjustable data center air temperature, such as the temperature of air-flow 134,135,138 and/or 140
Degree.In addition, by dynamically changing close to temperature, it is possible to reduce the overages of cooling liquid supply 142, for example, having more
In the design of the cooling system of used available cooling liquid.
In some implementations, it dynamically can use the non-local letter of specific cooling unit 102 close to the realization of control program
Breath.For example, in realization of some dynamics close to control, in order to select and update each cooling unit 102, specific cooling list
The group of member 102 and/or all cooling units 102 it is best close to set point, information for example can be server disposition, total clothes
Business device power consumption, total cooling device ability, weather value and weather forecast.In addition, when cooling unit 102 can be for example individual
The local of cooling unit 102 is realized static close to when control, dynamically may be implemented as service based on cloud close to control.
As described above, fan 122 is arranged to air circulation by cooling unit 102, so that air can be cooled simultaneously
And it is returned to working space 132.In the example shown, six fans of two rows, every row three are provided for cooling unit.Often
A fan is operated respectively by corresponding electric machine controller.The electric machine controller of fan may include various speed drive VSD, with
For adjusting the speed of fan 122.In some implementations, fan is operated to remain in such as working space 132 or cold
But the specific temperature in any one of the cold and heat air air compartment 141 of unit 102.Alternatively, fan is operable to maintain
Certain pressure difference in system.As an example, fan is operable to maintain to receive the cold of air from computer rack
But the insignificant pressure difference between the side of unit 102 and working space 132, for example, zero pressure difference.When this insignificant
When pressure difference is maintained, due to the pressure difference close to zero, any air circulation device in rack, such as each of with rack
The associated fan of pallet can be operated as working in open room.It must overcome pressure with recycle unit
The realization of difference is compared, and this realization can be operated more effectively.As another example, fan is operable to remain micro-
Small negative pressure differential, to avoid return air circulation.In some instances, pressure difference is maintained at about -0.03 to 0.03 English
Between very little water.
Cooling unit can also be controlled to maintain specified pressure gradient between multiple positions along warm air air compartment or
Pressure difference.As detailed below, maintain barometric gradient can by warm air air compartment by air from relatively high flow area
Domain drives to relatively low flow area, to support the airflow management between multiple cooling units.Except above-described close
Except temperature control scheme or alternatively, this kind of compartment pressure control program may be implemented.For example, control system can be compiled
Journey close to temperature control loop will cover in more comprehensive control ring to be used for the airflow management between cooling unit.

Cooling unit can also be spatially separated between each other according to specified " spacing ".It in some implementations, will be modular cold
But cell distribution will provide enough amount of cooling water on a region in more cost-effective mode.In this case,
The current view of offer is used for the purpose of clear and is easy to discuss.
As shown, three modular cooling unit 202a to 202c are aligned with 6 computer rack 231a to 231f.
Two parallel the row 230a and 230b that rack 231a to 231f is arranged in any side of cooling unit 202a to 202c.It is special
Not, cooling unit 202a and rack 231a and 231b direct neighbor；Cooling unit 202b and the direct phase of rack 231c and 231d
It is adjacent；Cooling unit 202c and rack 231e and 231f direct neighbor.Each of rack 231a to 231f include 3 it is vertical every
Cabin 258.Compartment can each be connected, so that rack 231a to 231f becomes can move jointly on such as wheel (not shown)
Individual unit.Each compartment can be similar to the width and depth of computer motherboard, and can use and bakery or coffee
The closely similar form of the rack in coffee shop, every in compartment above have support frame on one side, and mainboard can slide on the support frame
And fall into the position such as the pallet in toast rack.Rack 231a to 231f supports corresponding cooling unit 202a to 202c.Therefore,
The air warmed up can be directly discharged into cooling unit in any computer that rack 231a is supported into 231f by B referring to fig. 2
In any warm air air compartment 209 of the lower section of the horizontal cooling worm (not shown) of 202a to 202c.Warm air air compartment 209 along
Row 230a and 230b is continuously distributed, and organic frame 231a to 231f is shared, to allow air to flow transversely through cooling unit, example
Such as, along the longitudinal direction of row 230a and 230b.
As shown, each of cooling unit 202a to 202c includes one group of fan 222a to 222c, and operation is to incite somebody to action
Air is recycled to from warm air air compartment 209 and passes through corresponding cooling worm.In this illustration, each fan group 222a is extremely
222c includes 6 fans.Fan can be independently controlled or control in groups, to will be along the multiple of warm air air compartment 209
Pressure at position or region drives to corresponding pressure set-point.Pressure specific to position can be referred to as " local air compartment
Pressure ", and pressure set-point can be referred to as " local pressure set point ".In some instances, local pressure set point is
Close to zero and/or slightly below zero, apply pressure demand to avoid on fan associated with the pallet in rack, and avoid
Return air circulation.
The speed of adjustable fan 222a to 222c sets the driving of local compartment pressure to corresponding local pressure
Point.For example, the fan near specific rack can be operated with the speed of raising, local compartment pressure is driven to opposite
Lower local pressure set point, for example, than current local compartment pressure closer to 0 or further below 0 pressure set-point.
Similarly, under the same conditions, the fan near rack can be operated with reduced speed, to allow local compartment pressure
Close to relatively high local pressure set point.In some instances, the fan speed of specific fan can be by including that speed change passes
The single motor of dynamic device is directly adjusted.Higher power consumption will be caused with higher fan speed operation fan.One
In a little situations, power consumption changes with fan speed in cubicity, so that operating fan with maximum (such as 100%) ability
8 times of consumption are operated with 50% ability the power of fan.
One group of part compartment pressure in warm air air compartment 209 jointly defines the pressure distribution (profile) of air compartment.?
In this example, three designated positions in warm air air compartment 209 measure local compartment pressure.Every group of measurement position along
Warm air air compartment 209 and be separated from each other rule fore-and-aft distance spacing.In this illustration, each pressure distributing position exists
In the region of warm air air compartment 209 between opposite pairs of rack 231a to 231f.Pressure sensor 252a to 252c is put
It sets for measuring local compartment pressure.
The electric machine controller of each fan can be according to corresponding first order controller (for example, the first order described below
Controller 260) order that is issued operated.First order controller can be respectively or each with the formal operations of batch set
Each of fan.There can be multiple first order controllers.In some implementations, exist with pressure sensor 252a into 252c
Each associated independent first order controller.For example, in this illustration, first order controller 260 is configured as
(for example, be suitably programmed and be electrically connected) is based on the pressure sensor 252a local compartment pressure measured and corresponding part pressure
Power set point operates one group of fan 222a.In some instances, these first order controllers are programmed to, through realization control
Ring feedback routine (for example, in proportional, proportional differential, proportional mouth or proportional integral control ring) operates
The electric machine controller of fan, with determination fan speed appropriate, to obtain local pressure set point.Local pressure set point by
Second level controller 261 determines and is sent to first order controller 260 as order.
It can choose local pressure set point, the pressure between pressure distributing position to cause warm air air compartment 209
Gradient.Barometric gradient can be enough, such as amplitude appropriate and direction, with by by air from warm air air compartment 209
Relatively high flow area drives the relatively low flow area to air compartment to support cooling unit 202a between 202c
Airflow management.Airflow management refers to a kind of control technology, wherein from one or more racks near the first cooling unit into
Enter a part of air-flow of warm air air compartment by purposefully driving to another position along air compartment, so as to cooling single by second
Member is handled.Airflow management can be by reducing air circulation fan (for example, the general power of fan group 222a to 222c) disappear
Consumption, to improve the power utilization of data center.For example, usually with 50% ability come drive multiple fans or fan group ratio with
Maximum capacity drives the more efficient of single fan or fan group.Airflow management can also improve given cooling unit and its
Maximum airflow ability provided by associated fan.
When the computer supported in particular chassis is more than other racks on row, a region ratio of warm air air compartment
Other regions of the air compartment undergo relatively high air-flow.For example, the air capacity being discharged into warm air air compartment is in rack
The increase of computer number and increase.Computer in other racks on the computer and the row supported in particular chassis
When compared to work harder and generating more heats, it is also possible to form high gas flow region.This is likely to occur in computer adjustment
When set temperature of its airborne fan to maintain the air for being discharged into warm air air compartment.The region of relatively low air-flow can
It can be formed in the opposite case, for example, lower density of computers or being operated in rack with computer with capabilities.
Fig. 2 B shows the exemplary diagram of the part of data center 200, and it illustrates the air hoses between cooling unit
Reason.In this illustration, computer has not been supported in rack 231e and 231f.In this way, attached compared to rack 231a to 231d
The region of close fan, the region of the warm air air compartment 209 of neighbouring rack 231e and 231f is low-flow region, and rack 231a
The region of fan near to 231d is considered relatively high flow area.For example, attached in one or more racks
The specific region of close air compartment is compared to the more use of " intensive " machine for other regions of air compartment, such as server makes
With will lead to the variation of air-flow.For example, compared to the server in other racks, server in some racks can be
Or operated close to peak use rate and/or power consumption, to need more air-flows to cool down the server.
In some implementations, in order to support airflow management, pass through control fan 222a to 222c in warm air air compartment 209
Barometric gradient is generated, to meet one group of specified local pressure set point.For example, the warm air between rack 231e and 231f
The local pressure set point in the region of air compartment 209 can be lower than other racks 231a to the warm air air compartment 209 between 231d
The local pressure set point in region.As shown, rack 231a to barometric gradient final between 231d by air from rack
231a is to the relatively high flow area driving between 231d to the relatively low flow area between rack 231e and 231f
Domain, as shown.The distribution of air compartment air-flow allows the air circulation fan of cooling unit 202a to 202c with more in this mode
Dynamical ability operates, for example, using in all or most fans identical or close to identical fan speed.
As described above, the second level controller of such as second level controller 261 can operate one or more first order controls
Device processed.For example, as described above, second level controller, which can be configured as, determines local pressure set point appropriate, to generate edge
The barometric gradient of warm air air compartment, the barometric gradient be enough to promote the airflow management between cooling unit.In some implementations,
Second level controller can monitor local compartment pressure, to determine whether the region in warm air air compartment is more than scheduled pressure threshold
Value.This pressure buildup can indicate：One or more fans are broken down or are currently operated with maximum capacity, are not enough to delay
Solution is discharged into the pressure of the air-flow of air compartment.If pressure threshold is exceeded, second level controller can operate first order controller, with
Promote the airflow management between cooling unit, to alleviate high pressure region.
In some cases, second level controller is configured to realize control ring feedback routine, to determine that local pressure is set
Fixed point.As shown in an example, second level controller can determine local pressure set point based on the current fan speed of highest.
In this case, second level controller is by (the example from multiple fans of the operation to recycle the air in specific warm air air compartment
Such as, in the subset in all fans along air compartment placement, or along the fan of air compartment) it determines with the current fan speed behaviour of highest
The fan of work.This determination directly by comparing fan speed or can compare to come corresponding to the fan operation situation of fan speed
It carries out, fan operation situation such as duty factor, power dissipation rates and current input.The current fan speed of highest or corresponding behaviour
It can be used as the set point of feedback control loop as situation.That is, second level controller determines local pressure set point, this is set
Fixed point drives other fans to the current fan speed of highest.For example, the equation of following exemplary can be used for each feedback control
System circulation：
PS=a* (FSmax-FSL)+b
Pressure setpoint=a × (the highest current current fan speed in fan speed-part)+b (equation 1).
In this equation, PSFor pressure set-point, " a " is tuner parameters, represents less than the oblique of 0 barometric gradient
Rate, driving air from high gas flow region to low-flow region, FSmaxFor the current fan speed of highest, FSLWork as part
Forefan speed, and " b " is compensating parameter, is used for the current fan speed limitation in part between a minimum value and a maximum value.
The current fan speed of highest can reduce step by step with the completion of feedback control loop.Over numerous cycles, all wind
Fan can be operated with fan speed that is equal or being essentially equal, and the fan speed is lower than initial highest when forefan speed
Degree.For determining that the other methods of local pressure set point appropriate include：Determine the average current fan speed of multiple fans,
And use this value as the set point of feedback control loop.In some implementations, equation 1 can extend to PI or PID controller,
Wherein can according in the particular demographic of modular cooling unit the current fan speed of highest and modular cooling unit
Particular demographic in average fan speed determine error.For example, error can be calculated as follows：
FSmax-FSL(equation 2).
In alternative realizations, second level controller is configured as operating multiple first order controls without using feedback control scheme
Device processed.For example, second level controller can be controlled based on the fan for being identified as to be operated with the current fan speed of highest
First order controller.In this case, second level controller can issue instructions to first order controller, so that all
Fan is operated with ability identical with identified fan.
Fig. 3 shows the exemplary multi-stage control ring of the cooling unit 320 in multiple rows for controlling data center
300.In some implementations, cooling unit 102 shown in cooling unit 320 and such as Figure 1A, Figure 1B and Fig. 1 C or in this public affairs
Other cooling devices in opening are similar.Control ring 300 can control cooling unit, to maintain along shared warm air air compartment
Specified pressure gradient.
As shown, control ring includes second level input signal 304 and second level feedback signal 306, it is provided to
Second level summing function 302.In this illustration, second level input signal 304 indicates desired fan speed, for example, institute as above
It states, the current fan speed of highest or average fan speed in row.Second level feedback signal 306 indicates each fan in row
Current fan speed.Summing function 303 compares second level input signal 304 and second level feedback signal 306, and provides second
Grade error signal 308.Second level error signal indicates the difference between desired fan speed and each local fan speed
Or error.
Second level error signal 308 is supplied to second level controller 310.In some implementations, second level controller 310
It can be the ratio that is integrated into, PID, controller.Alternatively, control program can utilize state space scheme (example by controller
Such as, temporal scalable scheme) it realizes, the mathematical model of physical system is expressed as first order difference equation by temporal scalable scheme has
The set of the input of pass, output and state variable.Second level controller 310 receives second level error signal 308, and generates table
Show the second level output signal 314 of multiple local pressure set points.Local pressure set point can be designed to generate shared wind
Barometric gradient in room, to promote the airflow management between cooling unit 320.
In this illustration, first order control ring is embedded in the control ring of the second level.First order control ring includes receiving the
The first order summing function 312 of two-level output signal 314 and first order feedback signal 316.First order feedback signal 316 indicates more
A local compartment pressure measured.First order summing function compares second level output signal 314 and first order feedback signal
316, and first order error signal 318 is supplied to first order controller 320.First order controller receives first order error signal
318, and generate the first order output signal 322 including the fan speed of each fan in row.It is included in first order output signal
In fan speed be designed to drive local compartment pressure to local pressure set point.Cooling unit 324 receives first
Output signal 322, to adjust accordingly corresponding fan speed.In some implementations, the measurement of sensor 328 and 330 is cooling single
The output 326 of member, and generate feedback signal 306 and 316.
Fig. 4 respectively illustrates the top view of two rows 462 and 464 in computer data center 402, computer data center
With the cooling unit 400 between the rack being disposed in row.In some implementations, data center 400 may be implemented
One or more airflow managements that face discusses or close to temperature control scheme.In general, the figure shows to be similar to above
The density and flexibility ratio for certain rank that the structure of discussion is realized.Every a line of row 462,464 is by being clipped in computer rack 431
The row composition of cooling unit 420 between two rows 430.In some implementations, row can have uniline computer rack, this is for example
It is the metope by the way that cooling unit to be pushed through to data center, to provide the blank face all across the side of cooling unit row
Plate, or by providing the coldplate of the only opening with side.
Every a line of the row of every a line and cooling unit of the row for the computer rack being expert in 462,464 every row can be with
With certain cooling unit density.Particularly, certain number of this calculating or cooling unit can be in specific row length
It is repeated on (such as 100 feet).Alternatively, being said differently, the every X feet of repetition in the line of each cooling unit.
In this illustration, about 40 feet of every a line long.About 6 feet of each rack of three compartments are long.Also, it is every
A cooling unit is slightly longer than each rack.Thus, for example, if each rack be exactly 6 feet of long and all racks close to,
Rack cooling unit is by every 6 feet of repetitions.Thus, rack can be referred to as " spacing " with 6 feet.
It can be seen that the spacing of the cooling unit row in row 462 is different from row 464.Row 462 includes 5 cooling units
402, and row 464 includes 6 cooling units 402.Therefore, if it is assumed that the total length of every row is 42 feet, then cold in row 464
But the spacing of unit will be 7 feet, and by 42/6, and the spacing of the cooling unit in row 462 will be 8.4 feet, i.e., 42/5.
Computer rack and cooling unit spacing can be different, and the two respective length of class equipment can be different,
Because warm air can be expert at and 430 flow up and down.Thus, for example, warm air can be discharged to not cooling down in compartment or rack
The received region of unit.But the warm air can be laterally extracted under the row, and enter neighbouring module, herein may be used
It with the cooling warm air and is recycling it in working space, in passageway 432.
Row 462 can receive the cooling air that can receive less than row 462.However, 462 may need less cooling,
In order to calculate certain amount of cooling unit in every a line, to match desired cooling requirement.For example, row 462 can fill
Have the pallet for holding new, low-power consumption microprocessor；Row 462 may include more memory pallet, be usually less than
The power of processor pallet and less processor pallet；Alternatively, can be typically that the distribution of row 462 is calculated not as good as row 464
Intensive work.
In addition, two rows 462 and 464 can have the cooling unit of equivalent amount, but data center later in some time
Operator can determine that row 462 does not need so many module effectively to be operated.Therefore, operator can remove mould
One in block, so as to use the module elsewhere.
The specific density of required cooling unit can be by calculating the heat of the computer rack of the two sides of entire row for the first time
Amount output is to calculate.Amount of cooling water provided by one cooling unit can be known, and be segmented into the heat totally calculated
Load, and assemble to obtain the quantity of the cooling unit of needs.Such as it is more than other when computer rack certain in row generates
When rack heat generated, it can be separated along row after these cooling units, to actually be equally spaced, Huo Zheke
To be actually closely matched the position of heat load.In addition, being explained in more detail as following, the row of cooling unit, which can be aligned, to be set
The middle row for supporting column is applied, and cooling unit can be distributed along row, to avoid either rank is hit.
When between cooling unit there are blank face plate 468 when space, can be used to block the space (block) so that
The air come out from warm air capture air compartment will not escape in working space upwards.Panel 468 can simply use sheet
Sheet metal the form organized in pairs, sheet metal slides along the gap 470 in a thin slice is opposite between each other, and
It can be fixed in position by the connector on tightening gap.
Fig. 4 also shows removal with the rack 431a for repairing or supplementing.Rack 431a can be mounted on castor, be made
It can be pulled in downwards in passageway 432 and be rolled out later by a technical staff 472.Blank face plate in the figure
474 have been placed in the opening left by the removal of rack 431a, to prevent the air come out from working space to be drawn into warm sky
Gas captures air compartment, or the air come out from air compartment is prevented to be mixed into working space.Blank plane 474 can for firm plane,
Flexible thin slice uses any other form appropriate
In one embodiment, for maximal density, the cooling unit installed by " side to side " can be used to sky
Between be laid out, but the cooling unit of half can be omitted during installation, such as make the covering there are 50%.Such cloth
Coolant flat ability (for example, about each four racks of cooling unit) fully can be matched to the heat load of rack by office,
Wherein rack is the length about the same with cooling unit and is back-to-back placed on cooling unit.It is higher having used
In the case where the rack of power, cooling unit can be moved into it is closer, to adapt to compared with high heat load, for example, if
Rack space is limited by maximum cable length or rack can be separated from each other to and cooling device is sufficient to make not need to be moved
It is dynamic.In this way it is possible to may be implemented flexibly by change rack spacing (pitch) or by change cooling unit spacing
Property.
In this example, rack 413b and 431c is empty, is supported on computer therein for example, not having, and
Therefore it is blocked by one group of blank face plate 474 to prevent air-flow from passing through rack.This is arranged in being total near rack 413b and 413c
With foring relatively low flow area in warm air air compartment.In order to utilize neighbouring cooling unit 402a, conjunction can be used
Suitable airflow management technology come drive air relatively high from air compartment flow area (for example, active computer rack is attached
Region in close gas chamber) it is attracted to the low-flow region of neighbouring rack 413b and 431c.As seen above, this mode
Air flow method allow cooling unit to operate with more energy efficiency abilities.
