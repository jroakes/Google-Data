In having been placed on user equipment 106 and the cookie that can be accessed with searched system and/or Content Management System
Cookie data.Cookie data can specify one or more resources previously asked and/or by user equipment 106
The one or more search inquiries submitted to via user equipment 106.Can by similar in the way of discussed below using available
Other users device context data, with select for customizable content item content.
For example, cookie data may be used to determine the specific of the previous website whether having accessed content promoter of user
The page, and select to include the content in customizable content item based on this determination.For example, when cookie data specifies user
Have accessed content promoter website check out the page but and during incomplete transaction, including content promoter may wish to
Hold discount offered in item it is intended to allow user to complete on its site to buy in this specific occasion.
Content item modifier 122 is based on customer equipment context data 204 and according to feed data 124, and selection will be by
It is inserted into the content in customizable content item.In some implementations, (for example, content item modifier 122 is based on adaptation function
MF1, MF2 or MF3) select content, this adaptation function is directed to one or more combinations of user equipment attribute it is intended that will use
Which suitable subset of feed data 124 is creating customized content item.
For example, according to Fig. 2A, adaptation function MF1 specify when user equipment attribute designated equipment type be mobile device and
When the geographical position (" geographical ") of user equipment 106 is in five miles of the business location of content promoter, feed data 124
Row 1 will be used to create a log assembly that customized content item.In order to carry out following discussion it is assumed that postcode 30309 is content promoter's
In five miles of business location.
It is mobile device that adaptation function MF2 specifies when user equipment attribute designated equipment type, the geography of user equipment 106
Position in five miles of the business location of content promoter, and user equipment attribute specify user be male when, feed
The row 2 of data 124 will be used to create a log assembly that customized content item.
When meeting adaptation function MF3, the row 3 of feed data is used for creating customized content item.With adaptation function MF1 and
MF2 is the same, and it is mobile device that adaptation function MF3 requires device type, and requires geographical position in the business of content promoter
In five miles of position.However, it is women that adaptation function MF3 requires user equipment attribute instruction user, to use feed
The row 3 of data.
The customer equipment context receiving data 204 and adaptation function are compared by content item modifier 122, with true
Determine whether customer equipment context data meets one or more adaptation functions.For example, content item modifier 122 can determine use
Family device context data 204 includes the required user equipment attribute of adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2 so that using
Family device context data 204 may be considered that the requirement of the requirement meeting adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2.User
Device context data 204 meets adaptation function MF1 and the requirement of adaptation function MF2, because customer equipment context data 204
The geographical position of specified user equipment is in five miles of the business location of content promoter, and specified user device type is
Mobile device, they are all required by each of adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2.Further, user equipment
It is male that context data 204 specifies the sex of user, and in addition to the foregoing, this is required by adaptation function MF2.However,
Customer equipment context data 204 is unsatisfactory for the requirement of adaptation function MF3, and the sex of this function requirements user is women.Therefore,
In this example, the row 1 of feed data 124 or row 2 can be used to create customized content item.
When customer equipment context data 204 meets more than one adaptation function, content item modifier 122 can select
Coupling letter by which part (for example, suitable subset) controlling being used to create the feed data 124 of customized content item
One of number adaptation function.In some implementations, this selection can specificity based on adaptation function.Adaptation function
Specificity typically increases with the quantity of the user equipment attribute specified by adaptation function.For example it is considered that it is desirable to by with
Family device context data specifies the first adaptation function of three special user equipment attributes, and ratio requires by using context data
The second adaptation function only specifying two in three special user equipment attributes has more specificity.Therefore, when on user equipment
When context data includes each user equipment attribute that the first and second adaptation functions require, the first adaptation function can be used
Controlled which part using feed data, because the first adaptation function is considered more specificity.
In the above examples, adaptation function MF2 has more specificity than adaptation function MF1, because adaptation function MF2 requires to use
Family device context data 204 include those required by except adaptation function MF1 in addition to additional user devices attribute (for example,
Sex=man).Therefore, when based on specific selection adaptation function, interior by selecting adaptation function MF2 to specify will to be used for creating
Hold the part of the feed data of item.Therefore, in this example, the row 2 of feed data 124 will be for creating customized content
?.
In some implementations, select adaptation function from the adaptation function that customer equipment context data meets, be
Historical performance (for example, independent of the specificity of matched rule) based on the content item having been created using matched rule.For example,
Assume that the content item creating using adaptation function MF1 has the conversion ratio higher than the content item creating using adaptation function MF2.
It is also supposed that customer equipment context data 204 is satisfied by adaptation function MF1 and adaptation function MF2.In this example, content item is repaiied
Change device 122 can select adaptation function MF1 as by control feed data which partly for creating the coupling of content item
Function, because the performance of adaptation function MF1 is higher than the performance of adaptation function MF2.Therefore, in this example, feed data 124
Row 1 will be for creating content item.
Content item modifier 122 can use the feed data specified by adaptation function (for example, adaptation function MF2)
The content of 124 partly cited (for example, being stored), creates the customized content item of content requests 202.In some implementations
In, replace including in one or more of customizable content item by the content that this part of feed data is quoted by insertion
Variable, creates this customized content item.Partly cited content by the feed data for creating customized content item is permissible
It is referred to as changing data.
As described above, when content item modifier 122 selects adaptation function MF2 as the coupling for creating customized content item
During function, select the modification data as customized content item for the row 2 of feed data 124.For example, it is assumed that customizable content item
206 have been chosen to change using modification data.Customizable content item 206 include two customizable portion 208 and 210 with
And immobilized substance 212.Immobilized substance 212 be no matter for change customizable content item 206 feed data 124 part and
The content in customizable content item 206 will be present in.For example, immobilized substance can be the content item with each content promoter
The standardized messages including together.Referring to the selection to customizable content item for Fig. 3 discussion.
Customizable portion 208 and 210 is the part of customizable content item 206, wherein may be inserted into feed data 124
Customization customizable content item 206.In some implementations, each customizable portion of customizable content item and (for example, bag
Include) it is associated using the variable (or another placeholder) of feed data 124 parsing.For example, as shown in Figure 2 A, customizable portion
208 are divided to include variables A, it specifies the modification data corresponding to variables A will be inserted in customizable portion 208.Similarly, may be used
Customization part 210 includes variable B, and it specifies the modification data corresponding to variable B will be inserted in customizable portion 210.
Content item modifier 122, by modification data is inserted into customizable portion 208 and 210 from feed data, is repaiied
Change customizable content item 206.For example, when changing customizable content item according to adaptation function MF2, content item modifier 122 can
To be inserted in customizable portion 208, modification is from for parsing the data of the row 2 of the feed data 124 of variables A.At this
In particular example, the modification data for parsing variables A is text " entering shop indulgence-all necktie half prices ", and it is located at " variables A "
In the row 2 of row.Therefore, this modification data can be inserted in customizable portion 208 for content item modifier 122.Similarly, interior
Hold item modifier 122 " direction link " can be inserted in customizable portion 210, because this content is by feed data 124
In " variable B " row 2 of arranging quote, and variable B is associated with customizable portion 210.
Once using changing data modification customizable content item 206, customizable content item 206 is considered as then in customization
Hold item 214, and this customized content item 214 (or quoting to customized content 214) is supplied to user equipment 106.
Feed data 124 can be created by content promoter and safeguard so that can be by feed data 124
More newly arrive renewal for creating the modification data of customized content item.Because multiple different customizable content items can be using subscription
Source data is filled, so content promoter can update the content for creating multiple difference customized content items, without more
Each single content item new.For example, it is assumed that two customizable content items respectively include variable B, and content promoter wants to make
Its business telephone number rather than direction link are presented in its content item.Here, content promoter can simply update ordering
Read source data 124 to come globally (or optionally) and change variable B to be associated with the business telephone number with content promoter,
Rather than be required individually to update each of two customizable content items.When subsequently assuming two customizable content items,
The feed content of renewal can be inserted in content item business telephone number (rather than the direction so that content promoter
Link) replace variable B to be presented.
Feed data can be manually entered by content promoter, or automatically update feed data from other sources.Example
As it is assumed that hotel related content promoter creates specifies in its hotel the quantity in available each type of room and every kind of
The feed data of the lowest price in the room of type.It is further assumed that using the stock's pipe for hotel related content promoter
Reason system is filling feed data.In this example, content item modifier 122 can be obtained with regular visit inventory management system
The availability that must update and pricing information, and update feed data 124 using the data obtaining.If the user while first
Time point receives the content item of hotel related content promoter, then content item can specify certain amount of room with given price
Lattice can use.If however, user (or different users) receives the content item of hotel related content promoter after a while, should
Content item can indicate that less room can use, and price may be specified not with respect in the previous case of content item
With.
Feed data 124 can obtain from each introduces a collection, including the login page of content item.For example, using in response to
Interacting of content item and the network site of login page that redirects the user to, content item modifier 122 can ask to log in
The page simultaneously obtains data, the such as business address of content promoter or business telephone number.This data can be inserted into subscription
In source data 124, and in the customizable content item that can be used for be inserted into content promoter.If content promoter has multiple
Position, then list of locations and corresponding associated person information can be included in feed data 124.Content promoter can specify
The information of the position near user is made to be inserted into the adaptation function in customizable content item.
Fig. 2 B shows the block diagram 250 of another kind of technology for selecting feed data based on adaptation function.As with
Lower more detailed description, block diagram 250 shows the insertion in customizable content item 206 for the content.It is inserted into customizable content item
Content in 206 is selected from the feed data 124 of multiple different groups, and it is referred to as feed 252 and 254.Can be in response to interior
Hold request 202 and select content from feed 252 and 254, as described above, this content requests 202 can to include user equipment upper and lower
Civilian data 204.
In some implementations, can based on the variable in the customizable portion 208 and 210 being included in content item 206,
Specify the feed from the content wherein selecting for insertion.For example, variables A can be included to (or being mapped to) feed 1
252 quote, and variable B can include quoting to (or being mapped to) feed 2 254.In this example, work as content item
When modifier 122 detects variables A at customizable portion 208, content item modifier 122 can quote feed 1 252
The content that selection will present in customizable portion 208.Similarly, when content item modifier 122 is examined at customizable portion 210
When measuring variable B, content item modifier 122 can be quoted feed 2 254 to select will to present in customizable portion 208
Content.
Each different feed can have different adaptation functions, and content item modifier 122 can be using use
Content is selected in the adaptation function of each feed comes from this feed.For example, as shown in Figure 2 B, feed 1 252 with
Join function " (MF (feed 1)) " to be associated, it is defined as：OK. sex=user equipment. sex row. geographical position<With
Family equipment. geographical position.In this example, adaptation function given content item modifier 122 should identify from feed 252
OK, the sex that the sex wherein specified is specified with customer equipment context data matches, and geographic value is less than and is set by user
The geographic value that standby context data is specified.
Be continuing with the exemplary user equipment context data from Fig. 2A, content item modifier 122 it was determined that with
The sex that family equipment 106 is associated is male, and postcode represents in five miles of the geographical position of content promoter
Position.Using this information, content item modifier 122 it was determined that row 256 includes the sex with user equipment gender matched,
And the distance (for example, in five miles) of customer location is less than the geographic value specified for this row.Therefore, content item modifier
122 can select content in row 256 to fill customizable portion 208.
Feed 2 254 is associated with adaptation function " (MF (feed 2)) ", and it is defined as：OK. device type=use
Family equipment. device type.In this example, adaptation function given content item modifier 122 should be from wherein device type and use
This row is identified in the feed 254 of device type coupling that family device context data is specified.In this example, it is assumed that user sets
Standby type can be one of desktop computer/laptop computer, tablet device or telephone plant, and customer equipment context data
Designated equipment type is phone.Using this information, content item modifier it was determined that row 258 include upper and lower with by user equipment
The device type that the device type that civilian data is specified matches.Therefore, content item modifier can select content to fill out from row 258
Fill customizable portion 210.In this example, the content for filling customizable portion 210 is the telephone number of clothes shop.If
User device type is tablet device, then provide the link of shop situational map will have been inserted in customizable portion 210,
And if device type is desk-top or laptop computer, then the link arriving shop website will have been inserted into customizable portion
Divide in 210.In some implementations, adaptation function can be similarly used to determine whether content item will include web site url
And/or which (which) link will be included in this web site url.
Be used for select for insert the content in customizable content item 206 adaptation function in subscription source dates can wrap
Include the available any data of content item modifier 122.For example, content promoter can create which specify Current Temperatures or
The feed of other atmospheric condition, and adaptation function can specify from wherein select content row specify be more than, less than or
The temperature value (or another kind of atmospheric condition) mating with Current Temperatures.In some implementations, can be from Weather information source (example
As provided the webpage of present weather conditions for one or more positions) obtain Current Temperatures (or another kind of free-air value).
Other subscribe to source dates and/or other information source can be used to create adaptation function and it is determined which uses
Row feed data 124 is filling customizable content item.For example, the time parameter in a day can be used to specify and feed number
When the content that particular row according to 124 is associated is suitable to be chosen to be inserted in customizable content item.Other information can also be by
Other online resources provide, and are used for filling feed data or with acted on which satisfaction determining feed data
The context data of adaptation function.This information can be provided by content promoter, and the website specified from content promoter obtains, or
Person is identified by the resource that crawl provides information from it to the public.When by capturing resource acquisition feed data, permissible
It is periodically executed to capture to keep the feed data updating.
In the case that two row of particular feed meet adaptation function, can select in a variety of ways to be chosen
To fill the particular row of content item.For example, content promoter can two row have eligible in the case of specify which
There is priority.For example priority can be determined based on the priority score (for example, bidding) being associated with every a line.As another
One example, can determine the priority of row based on one or more rules.
Content promoter can also specify rotation, and such as 50%-50% splits (or another segmentation), wherein each be about to by
Time using equal portions.Initially can be using rotation, for example, to collect with regard to when using in customization during from the data of particular row
Hold the data how item executes.Furthermore it is possible to make content promoter ask to meet the condition of offer content in multiple different row
In the case of, select in the context of Current Content request (for example, based in customer equipment context data and any other
Hereafter available information) (for example, click-through rate, conversion ratio or reality or the another of estimated performance measure, such as to provide peak performance
The fraction being associated with forecast model) row.
In some implementations, content item modifier 122, or another data processing equipment, can execute data
Quality and accordance operation, with verify feed data meet terms of service and be easy to identify wrong data.The quality of data and
Accordance operation can include, for example, for guaranteeing not include negative valency lattice and the assessment to the price specified in feed, for true
Protect spell check and/or the syntax check that feed data does not include typing error or syntax error and carries out.Quality and meeting
Property operation can also assess feed data, with guarantee the content specified by feed not include to forbid content (for example, as by
The content specified by the terms of service of use of management content item modifier), and/or the content specified by feed meets sample
Formula/placement constraint.For example, content item modifier 122 can analyze the content of feed 124, to guarantee the content in every row not
Exceed the max number of characters that can present in customizable portion, this customizable portion is by by the fills in this row.Content
Modifier 122 can provide to content promoter the result summarising the quality of data and accordance operation report so that
In some implementations, content promoter can be taken action based on report.
The quality of data and accordance operate the assessment that can also include the adaptation function to feed.In some implementations
In, the assessment to adaptation function can include determining that whether adaptation function is not corresponding with the data in any row, and this will lead to
Will not be using the customizable advertisement of fills from feed data.For example, it is assumed that the adaptation function quilt for feed 252
It is defined as：OK. sex=user. sex row. geographical position<User. geographical position row. device type=user. equipment class
Type.In this example, adaptation function requires the device type specified in user device type and the row of feed 252 to match.
However, feed 252 does not include the data of designated equipment type.Therefore, in this example, adaptation function will not result in identification
To be used for filling the row of the feed 252 of customizable content item 206.Coupling letter will not be used when content item modifier 122 determines
When number identifies the row in feed 252, content item modifier 122 can provide warning to content promoter, inform adaptation function
Invalid, and specified adaptation function is invalid the reason.Similarly, if adaptation function will be mated with two or more row simultaneously
When, content item modifier then can enable content promoter specify and will select the mode of single row.
In some implementations, after the filling of customizable portion subscribed source data, can also be to customizable content
Item execution quality and accordance operation.After filling customizable portion, the assessment to customizable content item, can aid in knowledge
The quality that cannot not detected based on the assessment to feed data itself and meet sex chromosome mosaicism.For example, it may be possible to order using
Before readding source data filling customizable content item, based on quality and accordance operation, customizable content item and feed data quilt
Be considered as effectively, but after using feed data filling customizable content item, obtained content item be incongruent or
Person's invalid (for example, do not observe terms of service or include syntax error).Assessment to customized content item can include assessing
Have been applied to the customized content item of user equipment and/or assess determining of the part generation as quality or test process
Content item processed, wherein in quality or test process, carries out quality evaluation (for example, in batch process to customized content item
In), but this customized content item will not be provided in response to the specific request to content.
If content item modifier 122 determines, when for filling specific customizable content item, the spy of feed data
Determining combination leads to content item not meet or invalid, and this content item modifier 122 can provide to content promoter and specify gained
To content item be considered the information of the reason do not meet or be invalid, and/or content item can be adjusted to comply with or effectively
Mode.
Content item modifier 122 can take action in case distributing incongruent customizable content item.In some realization sides
In formula, content item modifier 122 can be used for filling Crestor by preventing particular feed (or part of feed)
Content item processed come to prevent distribute.For example, it is assumed that when the content using the particular row from feed data is filled with, specific
Customizable content item is considered not meeting.In this example, content item modifier 122 can prevent feed data this is specific
Row is used for filling this specific customizable content item.Content item modifier 122 can be using default content (for example, when being unsatisfactory for
The content using during adaptation function) substitute from feed data this particular row content.
If the specific part of feed and at least specified quantity (or part) do not meet or invalid content item is associated,
This specific part of feed data then can be disabled, thus prevent feed data this specific part be used to fill any
Customizable content item.Similarly, if not the meeting or invalid content item of particular feed and at least specified quantity (or part)
Associated, then can disable this particular feed, thus preventing this feed to be used to fill customizable content item.
If there is lead to not meet or invalid content the content from feed particular combination, content item modifier
122 can safeguard the index identifying the combination of those contents.In some implementations, content item modifier 122 is based on index
Content combines, and assessment is using the customizable content item of feed filling.For example, it is assumed that the elder generation being created using particular feed
The content item of front assessment is considered not meeting due to including phrase " word _ A word _ B ".In this example, content item modification
Device 122, or another data processing equipment it can be estimated that using particular feed filling each customizable content item, with
Determine whether customizable content item includes phrase " word _ A word _ B ".If identifying this phrase in customizable content item,
The distribution of customizable content item then can be stoped.
Assess the content item being produced by the filling of customizable portion and action is taken based on this assessment, contribute to identification not
Meet or invalid content item, assess possible each content combination without based on the content that each available subscriptions source provides.
Therefore, it is estimated by only those actual selection are used for fill with the content combination of customizable content item, or only to
(for example, the customized content item of multiple fillings can participate in wherein customizing to be chosen user equipment to be supplied to
Hold item and win the auction of auction) customized content item be estimated, decrease identification do not meet or invalid resource needed for calculating
Resource (for example, is estimated with respect to the combination possible to each).
Fig. 3 is the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 300 for providing customized content item.The operation of process 300 can for example by
Data processing equipment (the content item modifier 122 of such as Fig. 1 and/or Content Management System 110) is realizing.Process 300 also may be used
To be implemented as the instruction being stored on computer-readable storage medium so that data processing equipment allows data processing to fill instruction execution
Put the operation of implementation procedure 300.
Content requests including customer equipment context data are received (302).Can be from user equipment or to
The user equipment of request content item provides the content delivering system of content item, receives content requests.Customer equipment context data
It is the data assuming chance characterizing for the content item presenting in response to content requests.
In some implementations, customer equipment context data includes user/user equipment attribute, this user/user
Device attribute describe by/assume the user of the content item providing in response to request and/or user equipment at it.For example,
It is mobile device or desk device (example that customer equipment context data can be specified the user equipment in its presenting content item
As being not yet classified as the equipment of mobile device).Customer equipment context data can also include specifying the screen of user equipment
The data of the broad sense position of curtain size and/or user equipment.Customer equipment context data can also include user to be provided
And/or authorize the data (for example, sex) of the content for selecting user to be supplied to.
Customer equipment context data can also specify search for inquiring about, and for described search inquiry, result of page searching is just
It is being provided to user equipment and selected content item will assumed thereon.For example, it is assumed that user submits to search system
Search inquiry " hotel ".In this example, searching request can include specifying be chosen to be supplied to the content item of user will be with
The data presenting together including the result of page searching of the Search Results in response to search inquiry " hotel ".
Customer equipment context data may further include the cookie's that can access for content delivering system
Cookie data.Cookie data can specify being asked by user equipment (for example, from result of page searching) or
Multiple resources, and/or the data whether instruction user concludes the business in any specified resource execution.For example, cookie data can refer to
Determine user equipment by interacting requested webpage with Search Results, and finally navigate to the website for the webpage asked
Check out the page.If the user while being bought after accessing the page of checking out, then cookie data can include indicating
The data flag that row is bought.If the user while not bought after accessing the page of checking out, then cookie data can include
Indicate the data flag bought, or lack the data flag that instruction bought and can be construed as to imply that
Do not bought.
Have identified (304) with the customizable content item of the distribution parameters of customer equipment context Data Matching.Crestor
Content item processed is the content item including the one or more variables being parsed based on customer equipment context data.For example, more than such as
Discussed with reference to 2A and Fig. 2 B, customizable content item can include variable, this variable is for based on upper and lower to user equipment
The assessment of civilian data and the adaptation function specified for customizable content item are inserted into the placeholder of the content in content item.
In some implementations, based on to the search inquiry being identified by customer equipment context data with for customizable
The determination that the distribution keyword of content item matches, selects customizable content item.For example, it is assumed that hotel chains is specific customizable
Content item controls the distribution of customizable content item using distribution keyword " hotel ".In this example, work as customer equipment context
When data includes the data that instruction user equipment submits search inquiry " hotel " to, customizable content item will meet the bar being distributed
Part.Discussed as described above with claim 1, exist can be considered with distribution key word " hotel " match other search
Rope is inquired about.
In addition, or alternatively, can be based on to one or more user equipment attributes and for customizable content item
The determination that distribution parameters match, selects customizable content item.For example, it is assumed that content promoter has requested that, except with search
Outside the distribution keyword of match query, when user equipment is located in the distance to a declared goal of the business location of content promoter, point
Send out one group of content item specific.In this example, if user equipment not specifying in the business location for content promoter
In the distance, or user submit to search inquiry with for specific group content item distribution keyword mismatch, then this is specific
The content item of group will not meet the condition being distributed.Therefore, it can based on customer equipment context data, be different users
The different customizable content item of group selection.
In some implementations, the distribution ginseng of customizable content item is alternatively adjusted based on customer equipment context data
Number (306).The adjustment of distribution parameters can include being used for going out of customizable content item based on customer equipment context data point reuse
Valency.Can be based on adjustment bid when meeting bid change condition.Bid change condition can specify one or more attributes, works as quilt
Including when in context data on a user device, this attribute will trigger the change of the bid being used for customizable content item.
For example, it is assumed that content promoter specifies, when customer equipment context data specifies the business of user and content promoter
When industry position is in same city, the bid of customizable content item should double.It is further assumed that content promoter specifies, when
Customer equipment context data specify user be not located at business location identical city in when, should not adjust bid.Show at this
In example, when customer equipment context data instruction user is in same city positioned at the business location with content promoter,
The bid of content item will be doubled (that is, being set to designated value).
Other change conditions of bidding can also be specified for customizable content item.In some implementations, content promoter
The variable bid that the distance of the business location away from content promoter based on user can be specified and change.For example, content promoter
Maximum bid can be specified, and indicate that bid the distance of the business location away from content promoter proportionally should be subtracted with user
Little.In this example, content promoter can be for (for example, 5 miles of the distance to a declared goal of the business location being in content promoter
Interior or be located at same city) in user, pay and be up to maximum bid (for example, based in customer equipment context data
Including geodata).However, for user distribute content item pay price can based on user to business location away from
From and reduce.
Specify bid change condition data can be included in feed data, and can use with above by reference to
Similar adaptation function described by Fig. 2A with Fig. 2 B, identification should be used for changing the part of the feed data of bid.Therefore,
By create the change condition that includes bidding feed data and make feed data can be used for content item modifier 122 with/
Or content delivering system, content promoter can specify the variable bid standard for multiple different content items.In addition, by right
Feed data is changed, and the bid that content promoter can adjust for multiple different content items changes condition, without
Individually to change bid change condition for each content item evaluating price-reform change condition using feed data.
Modification data is selected to parse including the variable (308) in customizable content item.Above with reference to Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B
Described, modification data can be selected according to the adaptation function having created for customizable content item.Each adaptation function can
With specify for be selected for use in customizable content item modification data feed data specific part it is necessary to
(or can obtain) particular community is specified based on using context data in the device context data of family.For example, it is assumed that it is specific
Adaptation function is specified when user is located in 20 miles of business location of content promoter, feed data to be used specific
Partly to parse variable.In this example, the business away from content promoter when customer equipment context data instruction user equipment
Position 50 miles per hour, the not specific part using feed data is parsed variable.
In some implementations, adaptation function (or other modification data select attribute) can specify adaptation function to have
The time period of effect.For example, if the online customer service chat of content promoter on Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to afternoon 8
Point is available, make chat initiate link be inserted into the adaptation function of content item then only on Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to afternoon 8
Point is effectively.Particularly, adaptation function can specify current time (for example, receiving the time of content requests) to be in satisfaction coupling letter
In the specified time period of number.Alternatively, what feed data may be configured so that feed partly can be only in specified period
Interior available.For example, feed data item and/or adaptation function can specify effective Start Date and/or Close Date.
In addition, or alternatively, be selected as the part of the feed data of modification data of customizable content item, can
With based on the performance metric being previously used for the various pieces of the feed data of the variable parsing customizable content item.One
In a little implementations, can be determined for specific customizable interior based on assuming cohersive and integrated data for specific customizable content item
Hold the performance metric of item.For individually presenting of customizable content item, cohersive and integrated data specifies the user for previous contents request
Device context data, assumes customizable content item in response to the request of described previous contents.Cohersive and integrated data for each can also be in
Existing specified performance data, this performance data designates whether to there occurs user and the interacting of the content item being presented.For example, performance number
According to can specify user whether click on presented content item and/or on the content item being presented hovering pointer or slip finger
Reach at least minimum specified time period.In some implementations, performance data also (or alternatively) can specify user with
After the content item interaction being presented, whether user performs the action constituting conversion.
The modification data that cohersive and integrated data may further include the variable specifying replacement customizable content item and inserts
Variable parsing data.For example, variable parsing data can specify the feed data for parsing each variable row and/or
Row.Alternatively, or in addition, may change over because of feed data, variable parsing data can specify identification to be inserted
Enter the data of the actual content in customizable content item.
In some implementations, for the modification data being used for the variable parsing customizable content item each not
With gathering, determine performance metric.For example, it is assumed that parse the change of customizable content item using two different modification data sets
Amount.In this example, corresponding performance data can be assumed based on those of content item, for each different modification data
Collection determines single performance metric, for this content item, parses the variable of customizable content item using different modification data sets.
For example, when customer equipment context data meets multiple different adaptation function, performance metric can be used to select
Select modification data.For example, each the different suitable subset of the feed data quoted by adaptation function can be identified as using
Candidate modifications data in parsing variable.In this example, the candidate modifications data being selected as changing data can be tool
Peak performance is had to measure that candidate modifications data set of (or at least have threshold performance measure).In order to select to change data
Performance metric can be click on rate, conversion ratio, interaction rate or when using modification data filling when content item another
Performance metric.
Performance metric can be further specified that on the basis of each user's context.In some implementations, it is based on
The specification of the performance metric of each user's context can include determining that specifically different modification data sets are used to parsing and become
Amount, to respond the content requests specifying two different customer equipment context data sets.For example, it is assumed that being used for selecting to change
The adaptation function of data, does not specify the device type needing to be specified by customer equipment context data.It is further assumed that by
Join the identical modification data set that function specifies to be used to parse variable, to respond the content from mobile device and desk device
Request.In this example it may be determined that the first performance of modification data set is measured, so as to mobile device presenting content item, and
And can determine the second performance metric changing data set, (for example, to be not recognized as setting of mobile device to desk device
Standby) presenting content item.Therefore, it can determine performance metric on the basis of each user's context.
These performance metrics can for example be used for selecting the modification data for customizable content item, or is initiated with content
Person can be supplied to content promoter in the form of the report using, to determine if to want to change its content activity.At some
In implementation, when customer equipment context data meets two adaptation functions, it is possible to use each user's context performance
Measure and to determine and will select which modification data set changing customizable content item.For example, it is assumed that specific user equipment is upper and lower
Civilian data set meets two adaptation functions, but customer equipment context data includes any one of two adaptation functions and is not required to
The adeditive attribute wanted.In this example, in addition to those required to adaptation function attribute, the unwanted genus of two adaptation functions
Property can be used to identify for changing each user's context performance metric of data.Then, can select with highest each
The modification data set of user's context performance metric is as by the modification data for parsing variable.
Using modification data modification customizable content item (310).As described above with described by Fig. 2, modification data is permissible
It is inserted in customizable content item, replace the variable being included in content in item.
There is provided customized content item (312) in response to content requests.Customized content item can be supplied to request content item
User equipment, or it is supplied to management to the content delivering system of the content distribution of user equipment.
Fig. 4 is the block diagram of the example system 400 for providing customized content item.News pages 402 are shown in user equipment
On 404.News pages 402 include interior tank 406.Content requests (for example, " content requests 1 ") 408 quilts for interior tank 406
It is supplied to content server 410.Content server 410 can identify the contextual information being associated with content requests 408.
For example, content requests 408 can include contextual information 412, and the user being such as associated with user equipment 404 is set
Standby identifier, the device type of user equipment 404, the positional information being associated with user equipment 404, with content requests 408 phase
The network of association, and/or other information.As another example, content server 410 can (for example, using the user receiving/
User equipment identifiers) identify the contextual information being associated with user equipment 404, such as include storing in customer equipment data
Contextual information in storehouse 414.For example, customer equipment data thesauruss 414 can include the use being associated with user equipment 404
Family equipment files 416, it is included the information being associated with user equipment 404 and/or is associated with the user of user equipment 404
Information (when for example, wherein user being had agreed to store and use such information).For example, user equipment archives
416 instruction user equipment 404 are mobile devices, and the user of user equipment 404 was the age between 30 to three ten five years old
Women.
Content server 410 can identify from one or more qualified content items have upper and lower with identified
The content item of the distribution parameters of civilian information match.For example, the content item being identified can mate and is associated with user equipment 404
One or more users/user equipment attribute and/or other contextual informations being associated with content requests 408.Identified
Content item can include based on be associated with content requests 408 contextual information parsing one or more variables and/or
One or more users/user equipment the attribute being associated with user equipment 404.
For example, content server 410 can identify customizable content item 418 (for example, in customizable content item thesauruss
In 420).Among other possible distribution parameters, customizable content item 418 can be with dividing of being for example associated with female gender
Send out parameter to be associated.Customizable content item 418 includes variable (for example, being expressed as " % variables A ").In this example, " % " word
Symbol is used for representing the variable in customizable content item.Customizable content item 418 include " ABC accessory ", " continuously several days, the 4th day cut
Only " and " swimsuit sale at special price " immobilized substance textual portions.
In order to parse variable (for example, " variables A "), content server 410 can be the son of variable selection feed data
Collection is as the modification data being by variable resolution.Can be set based on the context being associated with content requests 408 or user/user
Standby attribute is mated with the subset of feed data, selects the subset of feed data.
For example, content server 410 can identify the feed data 422 (example being associated with customizable content item 418
As in feed data thesauruss 424).Shown feed data 422 can be the feed data including multiple entries
A part.Although with other feed data in feed data thesauruss 424 (for example, feed data 422 is illustrated as
Feed data 426, feed data 428) detached data structure, but in some implementations, feed data
422nd, two or more in 426 and 428 can be included in identical data structure.
Content server 410 can be including the variable in customizable content item 418, assesses identified feed number
According to one or more rules or element, to position the subset of feed data, with when parsing this variable with the data that makes an amendment.
For example, it is possible to execute rule-based coupling.Content server 410 can be assessed related to the entry in feed data 422
Connection rule, with determine this entry when include including or the data with the data that makes an amendment.For example, feed data 422
Each entry can include one or more for be estimated for the contextual information that is associated with content requests 408
Standard.
In some implementations, the one or more row in the entry of feed data 422 include one or more
Regular and/or one or more standards.For example, feed data 422 includes " standard " row.Content server 410 can be based on
The entry to select feed data 422 for the coupling of the data in the standard row of entry, to determine when entry includes including
Or the data with the data that makes an amendment.For example, the standard row for the first entry of feed data 422 include " sex=female "
Standard.This standard is by the contextual information being associated with content requests 408 (for example, by including in user equipment archives 416
In female gender attribute) mating.First entry based on feed data 422 with upper with what content requests 408 were associated
The coupling of context information, content server 410 can determine that the data in " variables A " row of first entry will be selected for use in
It is included in the modification data of the variable in customizable content item 418.
In this example, selected modification data includes " countdown " element (for example, " countdown to (7/4/14) ").
Countdown element in this example accepts the parameter of the time (for example, fiducial time) that instruction countdown is arrived.For example, currently fall
(for example, current date is 7/1/14 to the time quantum that timing time can be determined that between current time and fiducial time, currently
Count down time is 3 days, is 7/3,/14 8 when current date/time:During 00pm, current count down time is 4 hours).
Content server 410 can be by including the expression (for example, " 3 days ") of current count down time based on selected
In the customized content item 430 of the modification as customizable content item 418 of the modification data selected, parsing is selected for use in Crestor
The countdown element of the modification data of content item 418 processed.That is, including " variables A " in customizable content item 418
Represent " % variables A ", customized content item 430 is resolved to " 3 days " (for example, and be included in text items " for three days on end,
Cut-off in 4th day！”).
In response to content requests 408, customizable content item 430 is supplied to user equipment 404, so that in interior tank 406
In present, as shown in the content item 432 being provided and the content item 434 being presented.In some implementations, including in institute
The expression of the current count down time in the content item 434 presenting is roll counter, and it is showing presented content item 434
While counted from current count down time.In some implementations, for example, roll counter include second value (
Among other possible dates and/or time value), and seconds value is per second changes.As another example, roll counter
The sky numerical value (for example, as depicted to " 3 days ") when current count down time is more than one can be included, and ought currently fall
Timing time is e.g., less than one day, one hour, one minute etc. when, one or more shorter renewal unit of time can be included
(for example, hour, minute, second).
In some implementations, countdown element is included in customizable content item text, rather than in feed
In data.Countdown element can be resolved before customizable content item is provided to user equipment.For example, content item text
Can include such as " sell countdown (feed. variables A) in terminate " etc information, wherein " variables A " is specific ordering
Read the timestamp in source.As another example, countdown element is includable to be held in item, and without reference to feed.
For example, content item can include the text of " sell and terminate (" 7/4/14 ") in countdown ".
For example feed data 422 (and/or feed data 426 or 428) can be received from content promoter.For example,
Feed data 440 is supplied to content server 410 by content initiator device 442.Content promoter can such as subscribe to
In source data 440, provide coupling standard to content server 410.For example, coupling standard can be included in feed data
In one or more of 440 row.As another example and as described above, it is possible to use one or more couplings
Function is specifying matching criterior.One or more adaptation functions can be included in feed data 440.In some implementations
In, coupling standard and/or adaptation function can be included in for (example in the feed of the modification data separating parsing variable
As modification data can be in another single feed).In this implementation, modification data and/or matching criterior
Or (multiple) adaptation function can include changing the information that data is associated with matching criterior or (multiple) adaptation function, or
Associated with it.
In some implementations, the entry in feed data can include the mark specified by external condition or service
Accurate.When content server 410 identifies the entry quoting external condition or service, content server 410 can be (for example, from outer
Portion services) retrieve information for external condition, and the information retrieving is entered with the contextual information asking to be associated
Row compares.When determining coupling, content server 410 can select information as modification data from entry, for parsing
One or more variables.
For example, for including the interior tank 446 in result of page searching 448, content server 410 can set from user
Standby 404 receive content requests 444 (for example, " content requests 2 ").In response to the search inquiry 450 of " weekend event ", set in user
Result of page searching 448 is assumed on standby 404.Content requests 444 include contextual information 452, and can with for example on other
Context information (information in such as user equipment archives 416) is associated.Contextual information 452 can include such as search inquiry
450.
Content server 410 can identify there is the distribution that (for example and at least in part) is mated with search inquiry 450
The customizable content item 453 of parameter (for example, keyword " weekend ").Feed data 426 can be identified by content server 410
It is to be associated with customizable content item 453.Content server 410 can for example assess the first condition row of feed data 426
With the value in second condition row, to determine when parsing the variable in customizable content item 453, the bar in feed data 426
When mesh is included in or with the data that makes an amendment.For example, the entry 454 in feed data 426 includes being expired by content requests 444
The condition " keyword=weekend " of foot.Entry 454 also includes " temperature (Saturday)>80 and prediction (Saturday)=" bright spring day " bar
Part.Entry 455 in feed data 426 includes condition " conditions present ()=" rain ".
Content server 410 can be configured to determine that include in entry 454 and 455 with (jointly) temperature (),
Prediction () and conditions present () quote associated external source.For example, content server 410 can be by temperature (), prediction ()
Each of quote with conditions present () and be mapped to the request that external source 456 will be carried out.For example, in order to parse entry 454
In " temperature (Saturday) " quote, content server 410 can to external source 456 submit to request 458, to determine that the next one will
The predicted temperature (for example, for the position being associated with user equipment 404) of the Saturday arriving.External source 456 can determine down
The predicted temperature of one Saturday on the horizon, and will determined by temperature be supplied to content server 410 (for example, as drawing
Fetch data 460).Content server 410 can submit other requests to external source 456, is included in entry 454 with parsing
" prediction (Saturday) " quotes and entry 455 includes " conditions present () " quotes.
Content server 410 can use such as pulling data 460 (for example, the temperature of next Saturday on the horizon)
With receive the data asked for " prediction (Saturday) " from external source 456, to parse the bar in entry 454 second condition row
Part.For example it is assumed that pulling data 460 indicates that the predicted temperature of next Saturday on the horizon is 90 degree, and other receptions
Data instruction to next Saturday on the horizon be " bright spring day " prediction.In this example, the second condition row of entry
In condition be assessed as very.As described above, " keyword=weekend " condition in the first condition row of entry 454 is also evaluated
It is true.It is assessed as very due to including two conditions in entry 454, so content server 410 can determine in parsing
Entry 454 to be used during variable in customizable content item 453.Although the condition in the second condition row of entry 455 may be commented
It is true for estimating, but leads to entry 454 to have more specificity (for example, than entry 455 because multiple conditions of entry 454 are satisfied
As above for specific described), entry 454 can be selected on entry 455.
Data during content server 410 can select " variables A " of entry 454 to arrange is made with the data in " variable B " row
For the first variable (for example, " % variables A ") of being included in customizable content item 453 and the second variable (such as " % variable
B ") modification data.For example, it is possible to the customized content item 462 in the modification being created as customizable content item 453 is included " too
Positive mirror " is replacing " % variable B ".
When parsing " variables A " variable of customizable content item 453, content server 410 can parse that " variables A " arrange
" temperature (Saturday) " that entry 454 includes quotes.As shown in entry 454, external condition or quoting of service can be wrapped
Include in modification data and/or coupling standard.For entry 454, content server 410 can determine that " temperature (Saturday) " quotes
It has been resolved (for example, by pulling data 460), and content server 410 can " having become in customizable content item 453
In the modification data of amount A ", replace using " temperature (Saturday) " using the pulling data 460 (for example, 90 (spending)) receiving.For example, it is worth
90 (for example, 90 degree) be included in replace customized content item 462 in " % variables A " variable included by " Saturday will be sunshine
My god, temperature is 90！" modification data in.In response to content requests 444, customized content item 462 is supplied to user equipment 404,
To present in interior tank 446, as shown in the content item 464 being provided and the content item 466 being presented.
In some implementations, in response to the request to content, based on the entry in feed data and with to content
The associated contextual information of request comparison, automatically there is the identification of particular subscription source data.For example, content server
410 can receive content requests 470 (for example, " content requests 3 ") from user equipment 472, for use in including in sports news
Interior tank 474 in the page 476.
Content requests 470 can include for example contextual information 478 (its can include for example with the sports news page 476
Associated one or more keywords (for example, " move ", " baseball ", " basketball ", " football "), and other information.Including
Permissible in the contextual information (for example, the information in the archives 476 of user equipment 472) in customer equipment data thesauruss 414
It is associated with content requests 478.Content server 410 can automatically determine content requests 470 and be associated with such as motion.Content
Server 410 can automatically determine feed data 428 and also be associated with physical culture (for example, based on including in feed data 428
In " Giants " (and other information) team's title).Content server 410 can determine customizable content item 479 with
Feed data 428 is associated.
Content server 410 can be assessed including in the entry 480 of feed data 428 and the condition row of entry 482
Condition, using determine change customizable content item 479 when be used which entry as modification data.For example, content server
410 can for entry 480 appreciation condition "<Xschedule.com/ Giants/today>. " include (" in Giants home court ").
“<Xschedule.com/ Giants/today>" quote and can refer to external data source.Content server 410 can carry to external source
Hand over request, in response to ask receiving data, and with data replace "<Xschedule.com/ Giants/today>" quote.Example
As content server 410 can receive the data of " 4/14/14 cardinal team is in Giants home court " from external source.Content server
410 can assess " 4/14/14 cardinal team is in Giants home court ". include the remaining expression of (" in Giants home court "), to determine
The Conditions Evaluation of such as entry 480 is that true (for example, the condition for entry 480 is configured to it is assumed that when in Giants home court
The data returning from external source includes textual value " in Giants home court ", if Giants plays for home court, is evaluated as
Very).Similarly, content server 410 can assess the condition of entry 482, and can determine that the Conditions Evaluation of entry 482 is
False.Below the condition of entry 482 is explained in more detail.
Content server 410 can select entry 480 as by the variable " % variables A " of customizable content item 483 and become
The subset of the feed data that amount " % variable B " is parsed into.For example, as shown in customized content item 484, variable " % variables A "
Can be resolved to including textual value " Giants's match today in " variables A " row of entry 480！", and variable " % change
Amount B " can be resolved to including the textual value " medicated cushion sale " in " variable B " row of entry 480.In response to content requests
470, customizable content item 484 is supplied to user equipment 472, to present in interior tank 474, as by the content being provided
486 and the content item 488 that presented shown in.
When the modification data be associated when coupling standard and/or with feed data is related to external source, from identical Crestor
The customized content item that content item processed creates can have different contents.For example, for the difference being sent to same external service
Request, analytically temperature (), conditions present () and prediction () quote the data of acquisition may be different, this depends on asking
Time and position.As another example, when when not calling corresponding external service on the same day, "<Xschedule.com/ giant
Team/today>" quote and can return different results.
For example it is assumed that in Giants not in that day of home match, content server 410 connects from user equipment 472
Receive content requests 489 (for example, " content requests 4 "), the interior tank 490 including for the sports news page 491.Content please
Ask 489 can include for example contextual information 491 (its can include being for example associated with the sports news page 491 or
Multiple key words (for example, " physical culture " (and other key words)).As described above, content server 410 can automatically determine
Content requests 489 and feed data 428 are each associated with motion, and customizable content item 479 and feed data 428
Associated.
Content server 410 can assess the condition that the condition row of entry 482 include.For example, content server 410 can
Assessing for entry 482 " non-"<Xschedule.com/ Giants/today>. include (" in Giants home court ") " " bar
Part.Content server 410 can submit request to external source, in response to this request receiving data, and by received data
Replace with "<Xschedule.com/ Giants/today>" quote.For example, when giant and cardinal carry out away match, content
Server 410 can receive the data of " 4/20/14 giant is in cardinal team home court ".As another example, content server 410
Some other data values that empty textual value (for example, " ") or instruction Giants did not compete on the same day can be received.When giant exists
During the away match of cardinal team, content server 410 can assess " non-" 4/20/14 giant is in cardinal team home court ". include (" huge
People team home court ") remaining expression, be that true (for example, the condition of entry 482 is configured with the Conditions Evaluation determining such as entry 482
If for giant not in home match, it is evaluated as true).
Content server 410 can select entry 482 as the variable " % variables A " of customizable content item 479 and " % becomes
Amount B " is by the subset of the feed data being resolvable to.For example, as shown in customized content item 492, variable " % variables A " is permissible
It is resolved to including the textual value " medicated cushion sale " in " variables A " row of entry 482, and variable B " % variable B " can be solved
Analysis be including entry 482 " variable B " row in textual value " in the match of giant couple using！”.Please in response to content
Ask 489, customized content item 492 is supplied to user equipment 472, to present in interior tank 490, as by the content being provided
493 and the content item 494 that presented shown in.
Content server 410 such as can receive, ask from content promoter (for example, from content initiator device 442)
Or the renewal of retrieval feed data.Renewal can include the such as renewal to modification data and/or the renewal to coupling standard,
To use when selecting the subset of feed data in response to content requests.Renewal from content promoter can be such as
It is pushed to feed data or pulled in feed data.Can receive from the entity outside promoter unless the context
(for example, pushing) or retrieval (for example, pulling) renewal to feed data.For example, external source 496 can be by propelling data
498 are pushed to including in one or more of feed data thesauruss 424 feed.
In some implementations, feed data entry and/or customizable content item can be included to one or more
Quoting of data manipulation function, for example, convert text to the function of capitalization, small letter or initial caps.When customizable content item
When being converted into customized content item, function can be quoted and resolve to such as textual value.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 500 for providing customized content item.The operation of process 500 can for example by
Realizing, the content item modifier 122 of such as Fig. 1, the Content Management System 110 of Fig. 1 and/or Fig. 4's is interior for data processing equipment
Hold server 410.Process 500 is also implemented as the instruction being stored on computer-readable storage medium so that data processing fills
Put and instruction execution is allowed with the operation of data processing equipment implementation procedure 500.

For the content delivering system of content item, receive the request to content.
Identification with and ask the associated information (for example, contextual information) of specific user/user equipment of being associated and
The context (504) of one or more users/user equipment attribute and/or request.For example, the request of content can be included with
The contextual information that associated user/user equipment is associated with request.For example, content information can include user and carried
For and/or authorize for select to be supplied to the user equipment being associated with user content data (for example, sex).As
Another example, the user that request can include can be used to identify the contextual information being associated with user/user equipment sets
Standby identifier (for example, cookie).
As other examples, the context of request can be specified one or more of following：Whether user equipment
It is provided of the coupling class of the keyword that the resource corresponding with the specific part of content promoter website is associated with request
Inquiry or description that the device type that the network that type is associated with request is associated with request equipment is associated with request
Or quote the information of the resource being assumed asked content according to this.
Identification has the content item (506) of the distribution parameters with context and/or user/user equipment attributes match.Institute
The content item of identification is included for example resolved one or many based on context or one or more user/user equipment attribute
Individual variable.
In response to the request receiving, select one or more variables as content item for the suitable subset of feed data
By the modification being resolved to data (508).This selection can based on context or one or more user/user equipment attribute with
The coupling of the suitable subset of feed data.
For example, the suitable subset of feed data is selected can to include identifying feed data (510).For example, it is possible to know
Do not include the data structure of feed data.Data structure can include multiple entries.The content item that can identify and be identified
Associated feed data.As another example, can based on the entry in feed data and context or one or
The comparison of multiple users/user equipment attribute, automatic identification feed data.
The suitable subset of selection feed data can include one or more rules or the element assessing feed data
To position suitable subset (512).For example, it is possible to execute rule-based coupling.For example, it is possible to assess one or more rules,
Wherein each rule is associated with the entry in data structure.Rule can be assessed to determine when entry includes being included in
Data in modification data.
In some implementations, each entry of data structure is included for for context or one or more use
One or more standards that family/user equipment attribute is estimated.For example, each entry can be the row of data structure, and
One or more row of entry can include this standard.
In some implementations, the entry in data structure includes the standard specified by external condition.For example, standard can
To refer to external service.The information for external condition (for example, it is possible to retrieving information from external service) can be retrieved.As another
Individual example, external condition can define the request (example of the multiple current viewer that will ask particular delivery person's resource to publisher
As, the quantity of the current viewer being associated with the user of user equipment in social networkies or general current viewer
Quantity).
Modification data (514) is selected based on assessment.When content item includes more than one variable, can select for each variable
Select corresponding modification data.
When each entry of data structure is included for entering for context or one or more user/user equipment attribute
During one or more standard of row assessment, can be based on standard and context or one or more user/user equipment attribute
Mate and to select the entry (for example, OK) of feed data.One or more modification data row of selected entry can include repairing
Change data.Modification data row can be in for example selected entry in addition to other row one or more including standard
Or multiple row.
When the entry in data structure includes the standard specified by external condition, can will retrieve for external condition
Data is compared with context or one or more user/user equipment attribute.When determining coupling, can select from bar
Purpose information is as modification data.In some implementations, identify oracle in the entry.Can retrieve from outside
The data in source simultaneously is used as changing data.
At least partially through including replacing one or more variables, selected modification data, modification is in response to request
The content item (516) providing.When content item includes more than one variable, the corresponding modification selecting for relevant variable can be included
Data, to replace the relevant variable in content item.
The content item (518) of modification is provided in response to this request.The content item of modification can be supplied to offer to content
The user equipment of request or manage user equipment content distribution content delivering system.
In some implementations, variable can include or reference another variable.That is, variable can be nested into
Multiple ranks.For example, in addition to other information, the first variable can include one or more second variables.In second variable
One or more can include for example one or more ternaries.The parsing of the first variable can include (multiple) second variable
Parsing.Bivariate parsing can include parsing of (multiple) ternary etc..
