Definitions
- Some computing platforms may provide a user interface from which a user can chat, speak, or otherwise communicate with a virtual, computational assistant (e.g., also referred to as “an intelligent personal assistant” or simply as an “assistant”) to cause the assistant to output useful information, respond to a user's needs, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks.
- a computing device may receive, with a microphone, voice input (e.g., audio data) that corresponds to a user utterance.
- An assistant executing, at least in part, at the computing device may analyze the voice input and attempt to satisfy the utterance by outputting useful information based on the utterance, responding to a user's needs indicated by the utterance, or otherwise perform certain operations to help the user complete a variety of real-world or virtual tasks based on the utterance.
- the disclosure is directed to a method that includes determining, by an assistant executing at one or more processors, content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, selecting, by the assistant, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and causing, by the assistant, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user.
- the disclosure is directed to a system that includes one or more processors and a memory comprising instructions that when executed cause the one or more processors to determine content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, select, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and cause, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user.
- the disclosure is directed to a computer-readable storage medium including instructions that when executed cause one or more processors of a system to determine content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, select, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and cause, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user.
- the disclosure is directed to a system comprising means for determining, by an assistant executing at one or more processors, content for a conversation with a user of a computing device, means for selecting, by the assistant, based on the content and information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user, and means for causing, by the assistant, in the modality, a signaling of the conversation with the user.
- FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system that executes an example virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device that is configured to execute an example virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating example operations performed by one or more processors executing an example virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device that is configured to execute an example virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- techniques of this disclosure may enable a virtual, computational assistant (e.g., also referred to as “an intelligent assistant” or simply as an “assistant”) to notify, without user prompting, information that may be of interest to the user.
- the assistant may proactively guide the user to interesting information, even in instances where there was no explicit user request for the information. For instance, in response to the assistant determining that a flight reservation for the user indicates that the flight is delayed, the assistant may notify the user without the user requesting that the assistant provide information about the flight status.
- the assistant may determine a correct modality to inform a user of information that is meaningful to the user.
- Examples of modality may include a voice or audible notification, a text notification, triggering a light indicator on a device, highlighting content inside an assistant app (e.g. in a dashboard view), or another modality.
- the assistant may automatically maintain or have access to information associated with the user. Using such information, the assistant may identify information that is worthy of proactively outputting to the user. For instance, the assistant may proactively notify a user of a flight delay but refrain from proactively notifying the user about a trivial package delivery and instead wait to notify the user of the package delivery until the user chooses to interact with the assistant.
- the assistant may determine an appropriate surface (e.g., computing device) to convey information in a useful manner.
- surfaces may include, a mobile device, tablet, laptop computer, desktop computer, multimedia device (e.g., television, screen, projector, etc.), speaker device, automobile platform, or other surfaces.
- the assistant may determine, based on device usage history, a user location, a state of the user devices, and other signals, a home computing device that a user is likely to be using or have access to when the user is at a home location. In the example, the assistant may notify the user on the home computing device during a time of day that the user is likely to be home.
- the assistant may automatically select a user experience (e.g., a voice user experience, visual user experience, etc.) to inform a user of information in a useful manner.
- a user experience e.g., a voice user experience, visual user experience, etc.
- the assistant may select a user experience that provides a length or detail level of a notification based on an importance of the notification or content being delivered to the user. For instance, the assistant may generate a longer notification (e.g., Jon, your flight to Topeka is delayed by four hours. The new departure time is 7 pm.") as one type of user experience for an important notification and a shorter message (e.g., your package arrives tomorrow.”) as a different type of user experience for a trivial notification.
- a longer notification e.g., Jon, your flight to Topeka is delayed by four hours. The new departure time is 7 pm.
- a shorter message e.g., your package arrives tomorrow.
- the assistant may generate a single notification representing multiple notifications and multiple types of user experiences, based on an importance of the notifications. For instance, the assistant may collapse multiple notifications into a single notification (e.g., Jon, you have four alerts. Your package is on time, your flight is still on time, and your credit card was paid.") for trivial notifications.
- the assistant may optionally use one type of user experience (e.g., a longer message) to represent the most important notification compared with the user experiences associated with the other, less important notifications by collapsing the other notifications.
- the assistant may output "Your package is on time” to direct a user to information regarding a package delivery in response to determining that the package delivery notification is of less importance, and the assistant may output "Your package containing toothpicks will be on time, and should reach at 2pm tomorrow" when the assistant determines that the notification about the package delivery is more important.
- the assistant may only maintain or have access to information associated with the user after first receiving explicit permission from the user to do so. Thus, the user may have complete control over how the assistant collects and uses information about the user. Before the assistant stores personal information, the assistant may encrypt or otherwise treat the information to remove the actual identity of the user, so that personally- identifiable information is removed while being stored. The assistant may provide a way for the user to modify or remove information maintained by the assistant. In this way, the user may have complete control over the information being retained by the assistant.
- the assistant can immediately use that information to determine a correct modality to inform a user of information that is meaningful to the user. If there is no ongoing task, the assistant may direct the user to the information to help the user in the future. For example, the assistant may create information for a restaurant reservation scheduled through the assistant. In the example, the assistant may direct the user to information about a change to the reservation (e.g., rescheduling of the reservation, cancellation of the reservation, etc.). In this manner, the user may be made aware of meaningful information that may cause the assistant to seem more useful and desirable to the user. In this way, the example assistant may proactively direct a user to meaningful information that the example assistant infers will likely be useful and desirable to the user even if the user never requests or prompts the assistant for the information.
- a change to the reservation e.g., rescheduling of the reservation, cancellation of the reservation, etc.
- a computing device and/or a computing system analyzes information (e.g., context, locations,
- certain data may be encrypted and/or treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used by the assistant or underlying computing device and/or computing system, so that personally-identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined about the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state as opposed to a coordinate location or physical address), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state as opposed to a coordinate location or physical address

- user input e.g., detected at UID 112
- location awareness e.g., based on context
- other information e.g., weather or traffic conditions, news,
- the respective assistant provided by remote assistant module 122B and local assistant module 122A may, e.g., in the course of executing operations to support conversations with a user of computing device 110A, automatically maintain information associated with a user, or pointers to locations of information associated with a user (e.g., stored by information sources located at computing devices 1 10, server systems 160 or 180, or by any other server or device located elsewhere on network 130).
- Modules 122B and 122 A may maintain the information, or pointers to information, associated with the user as, respectively, user information data store 124B and user information data store 124 A.
- information associated with a user may be information obtained, with permission from the user, during a conversation between the user and the assistant, calendar information, contact information, user interests, user preferences, and any other information associated with a user that may be used by modules 122 to proactively direct the user to meaningful information.
- sources of information associated with the user may include, but are not limited to, intelligence built in an e-mail system, user interactions with assistant modules 122A and 122B, usage on devices (e.g., 110) associated with the user, or other sources of information.
- Assistant modules 122A and 122B may maintain user information data stores 124A and 124B as part of a virtual assistant service that assistant modules 122A and 122B together, or separately, provide to computing device 110A.
- Data stores 124 A and 124B may enable the assistant executed by assistant modules 122A and 122B to quickly access the personal information to complete a real-world task, a virtual task, or otherwise respond to immediate and/or future needs of the user of computing device 110A.
- the techniques of this disclosure are described primarily from the perspective of being performed by local assistant module 122A.
- conversation refers to regular interactions between a user of a computing device and an assistant executing at or accessible from the computing device as opposed to interactions that might occur during initial set up, installation, first time use, etc.
- the conversation occurs during everyday use of the assistant, by the user, as the user is performing a task other than setting up the assistant.
- Conversation does not refer to a user answering questions as part setting up an app or providing in preset fields of a user interface.
- local assistant module 122A may proactively determine content for a conversation with a user of computing device 110A. For instance, assistant module 122 may automatically, without requiring user interaction, identify from information associated with the user (e.g., an e-mail confirmation, a text message confirmation, data from a third-party application confirming a flight reservation, etc.) and/or from public information (e.g., flight data accessible using network 130), that a flight reservation for the user has been cancelled due to severe weather.
- information associated with the user e.g., an e-mail confirmation, a text message confirmation, data from a third-party application confirming a flight reservation, etc.
- public information e.g., flight data accessible using network 130
- assistant module 122 may select, based on the content and information associated with the user, a particular modality to signal the conversation with the user that is most likely to gain the attention of the user without being overly intrusive or annoying.
- assistant module 122 may select a particular modality as an audible notification that is more pressing than a visible notification. In this way, assistant module 122 may select an appropriate modality for alerting the user to information that avoids overwhelming the user with an amalgamation of notifications for trivial and meaningful information.
- assistant module 122 may cause a signaling, in the modality, without prompting by the user, of the conversation with the user to provide the content to the user without actually providing the specific content (e.g., that may be personal or private in nature). For example, assistant module 122 may cause UID 112 to output an audible notification of "I have something for you. Are you here?" to signal initiating a conversation with the user to provide the content to the user. Additionally, or alternatively, assistant module 122 may cause UID 112 to output for display a visible notification of "I have something for you. Are you here?" to signal initiating the conversation with the user to provide the content to the user. In any case, the output by UID 112 may proactively signal the user that meaningful information is available.
- assistant module 122 may determine whether a user has received the signaling (e.g., audible notification, visible notification, etc.) of the conversation. For instance, assistant module 122 may determine that the user has received an audible notification when the assistant module 122 receives an indication of consent from the user (e.g., a microphone of UID 112 determining an utterance indicating "Yes, I'm here"). In another instance, assistant module 122 may determine that the user has received a visible notification when the assistant module 122 receives an indication that the user has activated a display of UID 112 and/or has interacted with UID 112 to indicate consent (e.g., swipe or tap a consent indicator).
- the signaling e.g., audible notification, visible notification, etc.
- assistant module 122 may cause UID 112 to output an audible notification of "Your flight tonight to Topeka was cancelled due to bad weather. Would you like me to reschedule?" to proactively initiate a conversation with the user that provides the content (e.g., the information that the flight was cancelled) to the user and to optionally, without prompting by the user, suggest an action (e.g., reschedule the flight to Topeka). In this way, assistant module 122 may proactively direct the user to meaningful information without necessarily inundating the user with trivial information.
- Assistant module 122 may restrict the signaling of content to specific content to ensure that users find value in the content. For example, based on information stored in user information data store 124, assistant module 122 may determine that a particular package delivery is trivial. For instance, in response to assistant module 122 determining that a particular package delivery is frequently ordered, has low value compared to other orders by the user, or based on other information stored in information data store 124, assistant module 122 may be configured to decrease a personalized ranking for notification related to the particular package delivery. Said differently, assistant module 122 may refrain from causing UI module 120 to output audio via UID 112 notifications regarding a trivial package delivery because the user is not likely to not find the notification to be useful.
- assistant module 122 may choose to notify the user on a status for a high-value package. For instance, assistant module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output an audible notification via UID 112 regarding a shipping delay in a camera that is relatively expensive compared to previous items purchased by the user.
- Assistant module 122 may determine a surface (e.g., a computing device of computing devices 110) to appropriately signal the notification to a user. For example, assistant module 122 may maintain a list of surfaces (e.g., computing devices 110) that are associated with the user and configured to operate assistant module 122. In the example, assistant module 122 may identify a surface from the list of surfaces based on information stored in user information data store 124. Said differently, assistant module 122 may select a surface for signaling the conversation to the user in the modality based on content for a conversation with the user, and information associated with the user (e.g., information stored in user information data store 124).
- a surface e.g., a computing device of computing devices 110
- assistant module 122 may identify a surface by examining the usage on each device, the time of day, the best known location of the user, and the capability of the device, or other information. More specifically, for instance, assistant module 122 may choose not to notify a user on a home-based device when assistant module 122 determines that the user is likely to be away from home (e.g., based on a flight reservation on a calendar, or in e-mail, or during a commute time when a user is typically away from home, etc.).
- assistant module 122 may choose not to notify a user on a device when assistant module 122 determines that the user is not likely to notice an indication on the device because the user has not interacted with the device often (e.g., a user has not refreshed a feed on the device for many months). Said differently, assistant module 122 may to notify a user on computing device HOB when assistant module 122 determines that computing device HOB was the most recently used computing device 110. In this way, assistant module 122 may signal initiating a conversation to a user at an appropriate surface such that interactions with the assistant module 122 seem more useful and desirable to the user.
- Assistant module 122 may identify a surface from the list of surfaces according to a capability of the surface. That is, assistant module 122 may determine whether a surface is configured to signal initiating a conversation in the modality and based on a determination that a particular surface is configured to signal initiating the conversation in the modality, assistant module 122 may select that particular surface for signaling a notification to the user in the modality. For instance, assistant module 122 may choose to notify (e.g., signal) a user on computing device HOB when assistant module 122 determines that computing device HOB has a capability to output a notification that requires showing pixels on a screen (e.g., "Here is your flight reservation.).
- notify e.g., signal
- Assistant module 122 may identify a surface from the list of surfaces according to an availability of the surface. For example, assistant module 122 may refrain from selecting a speaker surface that is associated with a home of the user when assistant module 122 determines that the user is at a work location of the user.
- Assistant module 122 may be configured to select a modality (e.g., audible notification, text or visual notification, light indictor, etc.) to appropriately signal initiating a conversation to a user.
- a modality e.g., audible notification, text or visual notification, light indictor, etc.
- assistant module 122 may select a modality based on a capability of a surface.
- assistant module 122 may select a modality as an audible notification when using a particular device that cannot output a text or visual notification.
- assistant module 122 may select a modality based on based on a ranking of the content.
- assistant module 122 may select, for output by an audio surface, a modality using a blinking light of the audio surface for low ranking content. In the example, in response to seeing the blinking lights, the user may ask the device "Ok, Assistant, what's up?", or "Ok,
- assistant module 122 may select, for output by the audio surface, a modality as an audible notification using a speaker of the audio surface for high ranking content.
- Assistant module 122 may signal a user after outputting a reactive response to the inquiry (e.g., at the end of a reactive interaction of available information). For example, assistant module 122 may receive an indication (e.g., data or information indicative of) of an inquiry from the user. For instance, UI module 120 may receive an audio or text input from a user to "Set an alarm for 5pm.” In the example, assistant module 122 may output an initial conversation that indicates a reactive response to the inquiry from the user in response to receiving the indication of the inquiry from the user. In the example, after outputting the initial conversation that indicates the reactive response to the inquiry from the user, assistant module 122 may cause a signaling of a subsequent conversation with the user to provide the content to the user.
- an indication e.g., data or information indicative of
- assistant module 122 may output an initial conversation that indicates a reactive response to the inquiry from the user in response to receiving the indication of the inquiry from the user.
- assistant module 122 may cause a signaling of a subsequent conversation with the user to provide the
- assistant module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output audio or text via UID 112 "I have set an alarm for 5pm tomorrow. I have a notification for you. would you like to hear it?"
- the user may speak the word "Yes” and computing device 110A may receive the spoken word 'yes' as an additional voice input via UID 112.
- local assistant module 122A may signal the content by causing UI module 120 to output audio or text via UID 112 "Your flight to Topeka has been delayed by four hours. The new departure time is 11 pm.”
- assistant module 122 may ensure that a user get meaningful information both proactively and during the course of normal conversation.
- Assistant module 122 may prompt a user that information is available without divulging the content. For example, assistant module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output an indication that information is available using blinking lights. In response to no user input for a duration (e.g., a minute), assistant module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output audio or text via UID 112 "Viki, I have something for you. Are you here?". The user may state "Yes, I'm here.” In response assistant module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output audio or text via UID 112 "Your flight tonight to Topeka was cancelled due to bad weather. Would you like me to reschedule?". In some examples, assistant module 122 may prompt a user that information is available without divulging the content based on a ranking of the notification. For instance, assistant module 122 may only signal content that has a high personalized and/or generalized ranking.
- Assistant module 122 may determine whether to output a notification of content inline (e.g., in a chat UI that a user is using) or through other notification mechanisms (e.g., a notification shade in a platform, widgets, etc.). For example, assistant module 122 may output a notification inline or through other notification mechanisms based on a ranking of the notification. For instance, assistant module 122 may output a notification, on a mobile client, inline when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is high. Additionally, or alternatively, assistant module 122 may output a notification inline or through other notification mechanisms based on information in user information data store 124A.
- a notification of content inline e.g., in a chat UI that a user is using
- other notification mechanisms e.g., a notification shade in a platform, widgets, etc.
- assistant module 122 may output a notification inline or through other notification mechanisms based on a ranking of the notification. For instance, assistant module 122 may output a notification,
- Assistant module 122 may automatically select a voice user experience to inform a user of content in a useful manner. For example, assistant module 122 may select a length or detail level of a notification of content based on a ranking of the content. For instance, assistant 122 may generate a shorter notification (e.g., "Sports team X won.” when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is low and a longer and/or more detailed notification (e.g., "Sports team X defeated sports team Y, player A scored 2 points, player B scored C points, player D was injured”). Additionally, or alternatively, assistant module 122 may signal a set of notifications based on a ranking of the content for each notification of the set of notifications.
- a shorter notification e.g., "Sports team X won.” when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is low and a longer and/or more detailed notification (e.g., "Sports team X defeated sports team Y, player A scored 2 points, player B scored C points, player D was
- assistant module 122 may collapse multiple notifications into a single message (e.g., "Sports team X won. Your package is on time, your flight is still on time, and your credit card was paid.") when a ranking for each content signaled by the notification is low.
- an example assistant according to the present disclosure may be able to ascertain what information is meaningful to a user based on information associated with the user, without having to be directed to the information. Because the example assistant proactively directs the user to meaningful information, the user need not spend time directing the assistant using specific inquiries. An example assistant according to the present disclosure may therefore complete tasks more quickly and/or respond to a user faster than other assistants. By proactively directing the user to meaningful information, the assistant may seem natural, less awkward, and more desirable to the user.
- the processing complexity and time for a device to act may be reduced by proactively directing the user to the meaningful information rather than relying on specific inquiries from the user;
- meaningful information and information associated with the user may be stored locally reducing the need for complex and memory-consuming transmission security protocols on the user's device for the private data;
- the example assistant directs the user to information, fewer specific inquiries may be requested by the user, thereby reducing demands on a user device for query rewriting and other computationally complex data retrieval;
- network usage may be reduced as the data that the local assistant module needs to respond to specific inquires may be reduced as a quantity of specific inquires is reduced.

For example, assistant module 222 of computing device 210 may determine whether one or more other computing devices (e.g., computing device 110 of FIG. 1) associated with the user and compatible with assistant module 222 are accessible. More specifically, assistant module 222 of computing device 210 may determine that a computing device is accessible when the computing device responds to an inquiry requesting confirmation that the computing device is available. For instance, assistant module 222 of computing device 210 may output an inquiry to computing device HOB of FIG. 1, and in response to receiving a response from computing device HOB that computing device HOB is available for signaling content, determine that computing device 110B is available. Similarly, remote assistant module 122B of FIG. 1 may determine whether one or more other computing devices (e.g., computing device 110 of FIG. 1) are accessible.
- other computing devices e.g., computing device 110 of FIG. 1
- Assistant module 222 may select a surface from the list of surfaces for signaling the content. For example, assistant module 222 may select a surface based on a proximity of the surface to the user (e.g., positioned closest to the user). For instance, assistant module 222 may select computing device 210 when computing device 210 is a mobile device carried by the user or an automotive based computing device associated with a vehicle the user is traveling in while the user is commuting from work to home instead of a tablet at home or a work computer. In some examples, assistant module 222 may select a surface that most was most recently accessed by the user.

- assistant module 222 may select a surface that is configured for a notification of the content being signal.
- assistant module 222 may select computing device 210 when computing device 210 is a multimedia device (e.g., television or a content streaming device operably coupled to a television) having a display capable of showing a flight reservation instead of a computing device that includes only a speaker and/or light array.
- a multimedia device e.g., tablet
- assistant module 222 may select computing device 210 when computing device 210 is a multimedia device (e.g., television or a content streaming device operably coupled to a television) having a display capable of showing a flight reservation instead of a computing device that includes only a speaker and/or light array.
- Assistant module 222 may select, for the selected surface, a modality to signal a conversation with the user.
- assistant module 222 may select the modality for the selected surface based on a capability of the selected surface. For instance, assistant module 222 may determine that a selected surface that is a multimedia device (e.g., television) may only support visual notifications because the multimedia device is currently outputting sound for multimedia (e.g., a movie, television show, sporting event, etc.).
- a multimedia device e.g., television
- Assistant module 222 may select the modality for the selected surface based on a ranking of the content. For example, assistant module 222 may compare a ranking of the content with a threshold value associated with a modality. For instance, assistant module 222 may select a visual notification that is overlaid on video content currently being output by a multimedia device (e.g., television) when the ranking of the content satisfies (e.g., indicates a higher importance than the threshold) a threshold for a visual notification to be overlaid on video content.
- a multimedia device e.g., television
- assistant module 222 may overlay a visual notification for an expensive package delivery on video content output by a multimedia device (e.g., television) when the ranking of the content indicates a higher importance than the threshold for a visual notification to be overlaid on video content. However, assistant module 222 may refrain from overlaying a visual notification for a trivial package delivery on video content output by a multimedia device (e.g., television) when the ranking of the content indicates a lower importance than the threshold for a visual notification to be overlaid on video content.
- a multimedia device e.g., television
- Assistant module 222 may use a personalized ranking of types of information associated with the user that may be worthy of a proactive notification. That is, assistant module 222 may determine a ranking for content based on the information associated with the user. For example, based on information stored in user information data store 224, assistant module 222 may determine that a user values sports content as a high ranking type of information. In the example, assistant module 222 may be configured to increase a personalized ranking for sports content in response to determining that the user values sports content. In this manner, assistant module 222 may direct the user to meaningful sports content (e.g., nearby games, scores for favorite teams, team selection) as opposed to other types of information associated with a user. In addition to sports content, other types of information associated with a user may include weather information, news, travel information (e.g., flight, traffic, train, bus, etc.), notifications from software applications, package deliveries, or other types of information.
- weather information e.g., news, travel information (e.g., flight, traffic, train, bus, etc.),
- Assistant module 222 may use a generalized ranking for information that may be worthy of a prompting. That is, assistant module 222 may determine a ranking for content based on public information. For example, based on public information stored in search server system 180 of FIG. 1, assistant module 222 may determine that general users are querying for a specific term. For instance, in response to assistant module 222 determining that general users are querying for information for a musical event in the area, assistant module 222 may increase a generalized ranking for the musical event in the area. In this manner, assistant module 222 may direct the user to meaningful notifications based on other users. It should be understood that assistant module 222 may determine a ranking for content based on a combination of the public information and the information associated with the user.
- assistant module 222 may signal the notification in the modality.
- assistant module 222 may cause UID 212 to signal, in a selected modality, a conversation with a user.
- display component 202 may signal content visually by overlaying a message "Your package from company X has been delivered" on video content being displayed when the modality is selected as a visual indication.
- Assistant module 222 may use a contextual ranking of types of information associated with the user that may be worthy of a proactive notification. For example, based on information received from contextual module 230, assistant module 222 may determine a contextual ranking of types of information associated with the user that may be worthy of a proactive notification. For instance, based on information received from contextual module 230, assistant module 222 may determine that a user is home and therefore more likely to find news content worthy than when the user is at work.
- assistant module 222 may use a combination of rankings of content. For example, assistant module 222 may use a generalized ranking, personalized ranking, and a contextual ranking to select a modality and/or surface. In some examples, assistant module 222 may use a generalized ranking and personalized ranking to select a modality and/or surface. In some examples, assistant module 222 may use a generalized and contextual ranking to select a modality and/or surface. In some examples, assistant module 222 may use a personalized ranking and a contextual ranking to select a modality and/or surface.
- assistant module 222 may signal the notification in the modality without divulging the content. For instance, rather than overlaying a message "Your package from company X has been delivered" on video content being displayed, assistant module 222 may cause UID 212 to overlay a message "I have a notification for you. Pause the movie to if you want to hear it" on video content being displayed". In response to receiving an acknowledgment from the user (e.g., pausing the movie), assistant module 222 may signal the content. For instance, assistant module 222 may cause speaker component 208 to output" Your package from company X has been delivered.”
- Assistant module 222 may automatically select a voice user experience to inform a user of information in a useful manner. For example, assistant module 222 may select a length or detail level of a notification of content based on a ranking of the content. For instance, assistant module 222 may generate a longer message (e.g., Jon, your flight to Topeka is delayed by four hours. The new departure time is 7 pm.” when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is high and a shorter message (e.g., your package arrives tomorrow.” when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is low.
- a longer message e.g., Jon, your flight to Topeka is delayed by four hours. The new departure time is 7 pm.” when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is high and a shorter message (e.g., your package arrives tomorrow.” when a ranking for content signaled by the notification is low.
- assistant module 222 may signal a set of notifications based on a ranking of the content for each notification of the set of notifications. For instance, assistant module 222 may collapse multiple notifications into a single message (e.g., Jon, you have four alerts. Your package is on time, your flight is still on time, and your credit card was paid.") when a ranking for each content signaled by the notification is low. In the example, in response to assistant module determining that content has a high ranking, assistant module 222 may optionally use a longer message to represent the notification compared with instances where assistant module 222 collapses the notification with other notifications.
- assistant module 222 may optionally use a longer message to represent the notification compared with instances where assistant module 222 collapses the notification with other notifications.
- assistant module 222 may output "Your package containing toothpicks will be on time, and should reach at 2pm tomorrow" when assistant module 222 determines that the package is more important and/or not collapsed with other notifications into a single message.
- Assistant module 222 may automatically suggest actions on behalf of the user. For example, assistant module 222 may determine using information associated with the user and/or public information a suggested action. For instance, in response to content indicating that a scheduled flight reservation was cancelled, assistant module 222 may suggest cancelling existing restaurant reservations. In instances where public information indicates that there is a storm warning, assistant module 222 may suggest a family- friendly movie to watch if it is a weekend evening.

- remote assistant module 122B while executing at one or more processors of assistant server system 160, may perform operations 300-308, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is described below within the context of computing devices 110 of FIG. 1.
- computing device 110 may receive consent from the user to make use of and store the personal information (300). For instance, in response to identifying potential personal information, local assistant module 122A may cause UI module 120 to request permission from the user to store and make use of personal information obtained during interactions with local assistant module 122A and the user. It should be understood that computing device 110 may not require a user to consent prior to each time that local assistant module wants to make use of or store personal information. For example, if computing device 110 receives consent once a year, once a day, or even just one time (e.g., after initial product purchase, set up, etc.) computing device 110 may treat that prior consent as consent to make use and store personal information in the future.
- the user may provide a voice input "yeah that's ok to store information about me" and in response to the voice input, local assistant module 122A may begin maintaining personal records about the user at data store 122A.
- Computing device 110A may determine content for a conversation with a user of a computing device (302). For example, local assistant module 122A of computing device 110A may determine that a flight for the user of computing device 110A has been rescheduled. Computing device 110A may select, based on information associated with the user, a modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user (304). For instance, local assistant module 122A may select an audible notification as the modality to signal initiating the conversation with the user in response to determining that a content indicating that the flight for the user has a rank that is greater than a threshold
- local assistant module 122A may rank the content indicating the flight for the user based on the information associated with the user (e.g., a record of the assistant module 122 making the flight reservation, an e-mail confirming the flight reservation, etc.) and/or public information (e.g., public flight information indicating that the flight has been rescheduled).
- information associated with the user e.g., a record of the assistant module 122 making the flight reservation, an e-mail confirming the flight reservation, etc.
- public information e.g., public flight information indicating that the flight has been rescheduled.
- Computing device 110A may optionally select a surface to signal initiating the conversation with the user (306).
- local assistant module 122A may select a surface from a list of surfaces when the surface is configured to output an audible notification as the modality signal and when the surface is likely to be proximate to the user (e.g., a home computing device when the user is home, a work computing device when a user is at work, a mobile computing device typically carried by a user, etc.).
- Computing device 110A may cause a signaling of the conversation with the user in the modality (308).
- local assistant module 122A may signal to the user that a content for a conversation is available by causing UI module 120 to output audio or text via UID 112 "I have a notification for you. Would you like to hear it?"

- Communication units 442 are analogous to communication units 242 of computing system 210 of FIG. 2.
- Storage devices 448 are analogous to storage devices 248 of computing system 210 of FIG. 2.
- Communication channels 450 are analogous to communication channels 250 of computing system 210 of FIG. 2 and may therefore interconnect each of the components 440, 442, and 448 for inter-component
- communication channels 450 may include a system bus, a network connection, an inter-process communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data.
- Search module 482 of assistant server system 460 is analogous to search module 182 of search server system 180 and may perform integrated search functions on behalf of assistant server system 460. That is, search module 482 may perform search operations on behalf of assistant module 422. In some examples, search module 482 may interface with external search systems, such as search system 180 to perform search operations on behalf of assistant module 422. When invoked, search module 482 may perform search functions, such as generating search queries and executing searches based on generated search queries across various local and remote information sources. Search module 482 may provide results of executed searches to the invoking component or module. That is, search module 482 may output search results to assistant module 422.
- Assistant module 422 may include all functionality of local assistant module 122A and remote assistant module 122B of FIG. 1, as well as assistant module 222 of computing device 210 of FIG. 2. Assistant module 422 may perform similar operations as remote assistant module 122B for providing an assistant service that is accessible via assistant server system 460. That is, assistant module 422 act as an interface to a remote assistant service accessible to a computing device that is communicating over a network with assistant server system 460. For example, assistant module 422 may be an interface or API to remote assistant module 122B of assistant server system 160 of FIG. 1. For instance, assistant module 422 may select a surface and/or modality for signaling content.
- User information data store 424 is analogous to user information data store 224 of FIG.
- Assistant module 422 may rely on the information stored at data store 424, to select a surface and/or modality for signaling content.
- assistant module 422 may receive content for a conversation with a user of computing device 210. For example, assistant module 422 may receive content from search module 482. In response to receiving content, assistant module 422 may select a surface from the list of surfaces for signaling the content. For example, assistant module 422 may select a surface that was most recently accessed by the user.
- Assistant module 422 may select a modality for the selected surface. For example, assistant module 422 may select the modality for the selected surface based on a ranking of the content. For example, assistant module 422 may compare a ranking of the content with a threshold value associated with a modality. For instance, assistant module 422 may select an audible notification when the ranking of the content satisfies (e.g., indicates a higher importance than the threshold) a threshold for an audible notification. That is, for instance, assistant module 422 may select an audible notification for an expensive package delivery when the ranking of the content indicates a higher importance than the threshold for an audible notification.
- assistant module 422 may select an audible notification for an expensive package delivery when the ranking of the content indicates a higher importance than the threshold for an audible notification.
- assistant module 422 may select a visible notification (e.g., flashing a light indicator) for a trivial package delivery when the ranking of the content indicates a lower importance than the threshold for an audible notification. In this manner, the user may be made aware of meaningful information that may cause assistant module 422 to seem more useful and desirable to the user.
- a visible notification e.g., flashing a light indicator
