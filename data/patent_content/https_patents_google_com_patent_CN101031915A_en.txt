Fig. 4 is the block diagram of the notion element of explanation document locator 225.Document locator 225 can comprise descriptor maker 405, search component 410 and format assembly 415.Descriptor maker 405 can generate describes current document and based on userspersonal information's descriptor.In one implementation, descriptor can comprise search inquiry.Descriptor maker 405 can generate descriptor based on user's personal information and/or the document of current input (or information relevant with current document).
Can be input to search component 410 from the descriptor of descriptor maker 405 outputs, search component 410 can use this descriptor to generate attached document.The link of attached document or other are quoted and can be inserted in the original document by format assembly 415.
As mentioned, descriptor maker 405 can generate descriptor, for example search inquiry.Descriptor usually can be based on current in relevant information of the document of watching (or request watch) and user's personal information with the user.The information relevant with current document can comprise the information based on the current document text.The text can be processed into and for example comprise: (1) occurrence number surpasses all terms of a certain pre-determined number, the named entity that (2) can extract automatically, the date in (3) document, (4) author and publication name, and/or key word or classification extraction.
About top (1), the term that occurrence number surpasses a certain pre-determined number can regard as important or document in the special term of describing, and can be regarded as the descriptor of the document.For example, the term number that is chosen to be included in the descriptor can be defined as the most frequent predetermined number that term occurs.In the possible variant of this conception of species, the number of times that term occurs can be got in touch the sum frequency that term occurs and be considered together in document language.Therefore, selecting before repeatedly the generic term can appear in document in the term that is tending towards less appearance in the language.
The tabulation of predetermined named entity or other noun can be by 405 storages of descriptor maker.For example, location name, famous person's name, well-known commodity or the consumption name of an article and exabyte can be by manually (that is, by people operator's input) or automatic technique produce in advance.As mentioned above, the text of document can compare with these named entities and the coupling in the descriptor that is included in the document.With reference to the example of Figure 1A and 1B, the tabulation of predetermined named entity may comprise for example term of " Mt.Everest " and " Novolog Peaks and PolesChallenge ", makes these terms be included in the descriptor of document 105.
Date in the document (above item (3)), document author and publication name ((4)) can be included in the descriptor.This information usually can be determined automatically by the mode-matching technique that is applied to document.The date of document can be used to locate the document of publishing other same period.Similarly, publishing entity (for example, web website) and document author can be used to locate from the document of identical or similar publishing house or same author write or document.Document date, author and publishing house are particularly useful under the situation of news report.About (5), key word that can analytical documentation for example extracts the key word that is extracted based on term frequency or by named entity.
Except generating descriptor based on document, descriptor maker 405 can also generate descriptor based on the information (" personal information ") specific to the user.Personal information can comprise user's geographic position for example (for example, prior search queries submit to or link selected), the personal information that when register account number, provides of user, based on the personal information of user's browsing histories, from the personal information of document that the user generates or the extraction of other personal information source.User's geographic position can be estimated according to user's IP address.Personal information can also comprise temporal information, for example current date or season.Temporal information can be used for incident related with individual preference or document content.For example, if the document of just browsing about Edinburgh, and current month be July or August, then can show relevant documentation about the Edinburgh art festival.
In one implementation, personal information can be based on the user profiles that is made of the prior search queries that is submitted to search engine.Class row matching technique can be used for inferring from search item user's interest.For example, though user's inputted search item " photography " in fact never, but inquired about term " Nikon ", " aperture " and " f-stop ", these terms can be used to infer that the user is interested in photographing.
Be used for generating a kind of technology of classification mapping based on collecting a large amount of historical user search queries based on the user search session tokens from search inquiry.Ultimate principle is that the people who for example searches for the search terms of " Canon " probably imports other search inquiry relevant with same item, for example " photography " or " f-stop " in identical search sessions.By analyzing many this search inquiry sessions, can carry out classification and infer (for example, if there is the people to search for " Nikon ", then might they are interested in photographing).
One of skill in the art will recognize that other technology that is used for forming from the descriptor that generated search inquiry also can use.For example, additional information can be used for determining whether inquiry comprises term, for example the sum frequency that occurs in language of term.In addition, when determining in inquiry, whether to comprise specific name, entity or other predefine term, can give their additional weight.For example some term of Netherlands can have different weights with other term of for example ProductName.ProductName limits after can appending to ProductName by the exabyte that it is related automatically.In addition, descriptor can with as described above those bunch or the class matching technique use so that generate other term can be used in the search inquiry.
Fig. 5 is the figure that the example implementation of search component 410 more specifically is described.Search component 410 can comprise search engine 505 and queuing (rank) assembly 510.
Queued component 510 can be operable to queuing and/or prune the collection of document that is returned by search engine 505.In one implementation, queued component 510 can based on definition institute return to document gather in each document and search inquiry mate how well match query and must assign to the collection of document of lining up and being returned.With the document of search inquiry " better " coupling, for example comprise the document of a plurality of term examples in the search inquiry, than the bad document of coupling higher correlativity score is arranged with tending to.Queued component 510 can also come ranking documents based on the measured value of other correlativity or quality (for example based on based on the linked document quality measured values).The top n ranking documents (for example, N=3) can select to present to the user by queued component 510.
Other technology that is used to line up or prunes the relevant documentation set also can be used by queued component 510.For example, can be chosen in the document that occurs in a plurality of collection of document corresponding to a plurality of related search queries, can select the document of those most recent, can select those most popular documents (for example, based on the selecteed number of times of document links).As other example, can get rid of (or comprising) clearly from the document of commerce site.
In some is realized, can receive a plurality of possible search inquiry, and can use the inquiry of returning " the best " result corresponding to descriptor." the best " result can measure in many ways, for example by seeing the target queuing value of the document that returns from search engine corresponding to the possible search inquiry of response.In addition, can use multiple different search engine, for example news search engine, product search engine or general search engine based on web.
In one implementation, the format assembly 415 can with the link (for example, hyperlink) be inserted into the embedded attached document of the text of current document in.When may the time, to the link of each attached document can be inserted in the current document with the relevant especially part of attached document in.This notion illustrates in Figure 1A and 1B, wherein to the link of related content, for example to the link about the document of Mt.Everest, is inserted in the document 105 place near term " Mt.Everest ".Although the link among Figure 1A and the 1B is shown the summary info that comprises in the bracket and is shown that speech shows the link of discerning in the current input document by revising, other technology that is used for the graphic presentation link also can be used.
Technology except that embedded hyperlink can be used for attached document is embedded into current document.For example, can use " floating (the float-over) " text that when the user is put into cursor on certain words, image or other object in the current document, shows.
The operation of document locator 225
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram of the performed exemplary operations of explanation document locator 225.Document locator 225 can respond the user and ask document (for example request of carrying out from web website or search engine) and begin operation.
Can generate the descriptor relevant (action 603) with importing document.As previously discussed, descriptor can be generated also by descriptor maker 405 and can comprise the search inquiry that comprises the term relevant with the userspersonal information with current input document.Descriptor can be used to locate additional correlation document (action 604).As discussed, this can submit to search inquiry to carry out to search engine by search component 410.
One or more in the additional correlation document can be embedded into current input document or related with it (action 605).Shown as Figure 1A and 1B, the additional correlation document can with the embedded embedding of current input document.Then, comprise and to present to user's (action 606) the revision of the current input document of the link of additional correlation document.
The example implementation of document locator 225
