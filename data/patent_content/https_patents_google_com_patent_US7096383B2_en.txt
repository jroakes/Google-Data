Definitions
- FIG. 6 illustrates VPN and VR replication using remote object references in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention
- FIG. 7 illustrates a user interface layer showing the saving of VPN and VR information in a configuration file in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention
- FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating the generation of a list of VPN & VR IDs present in a primary processor engine in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- control blade 200 is illustrated as having several separate functional elements, one or more of the functional elements may be combined and may be implemented by combinations of software configured elements, such as processors including digital signal processors (DSPs), and/or other hardware elements.
- processors including digital signal processors (DSPs)
- DSPs digital signal processors
- the fault manager may provide a list of VPNs and VRs identified by the object manager to a command line interface engine, such as CLI engine 210 ( FIG. 2 ).
- the fault manager may also provide information identifying the failed processing engine and new processing engine to the CLI engine.
- the identity information of a processing engine may include a slot ID and PE ID which identifies the blade location, such as a particular VRE 104 ( FIG. 1 ) and particular processing engine on the blade.
- the object manager database may be updated to correlate the particular VPNs and VRs as operating on the new processing engine.
- the routing system may continue to operate the VPNs and VRs accordingly and monitor keep-alive messages in accordance with operation 304 .
- Processor node failures refer to any failure, which may cause a processing node that runs the router software to refuse to accept packets. The node may appear dead to the network when this fault occurs. These faults may be easily detected, although it may not be possible to isolate the fault further than identifying which processing node is faulty. Such failures may reside either in the node itself or the communication coprocessor. A processor node that is found to be faulty may be removed from service, and a redundant node if any, may be activated and put into service.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a distinction between an object class and an object group in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Both are a collection of objects.
- An object class may be a set of objects that have the same type signature and behavior.
- Distribution 500 is illustrated with applications object class 502 , TCP/IP object class 504 and interface object class 506 .
- the constituent objects do not necessarily have the same type signature and behavior (e.g. object groups 508 , 510 and 512 ).
- object groups 508 , 510 and 512 There may be multiple objects of the same class in an object group.
- object group 510 has two objects of interface object class 506 .
- an object group need not have an object of each class.
- object group 512 does not have an object of interface object class 506 .
- Embodiments of the present invention provide distributed object-oriented network-processing platform including software, which concurrently runs several objects. Each concurrently running object may be viewed as an object instance that encapsulates data and their functions with an independent execution unit. These concurrent objects provide services by communicating with each other without knowing each other's physical locations or internal structures. Each node may be multiple objects, network operating system, and a real-time kernel.
- the distributed processing platform provides a fault-tolerant mechanism in which fault-tolerant objects may be handled flexibly, with its internal structures hidden and indicated by logical IDs and the execution overhead for fault tolerance may be minimized.
- a blade-level failover i.e., one of VREs 104 FIG. 1
- the blade may reboot and all affected VRs may be recreated on backup PEs.
- a PE-level failover i.e., if one or more of PEs 116 fails
- affected VPNs and VRs may be recreated on a backup PEs. This is described in more detail below.
- processor engine failure detection may be implemented using a heartbeat mechanism.
- a management processor engine such as fault manager 204 ( FIG. 2 ) that resides in a control blade monitors the health of all processors.
- the primary PE may periodically send a keep-alive packet to the management PE over a ring network that is marked for internal communication.
- the management PE raises a failure suspicion event after it detects a number of consecutive missing heartbeats from the primary PE. Once a failure suspicion is raised, a standard voting protocol can be used to confirm that the primary process is out of service, because the primary PE is down, the application process has crashed, or the communication link from the primary is broken.
- the failure detection mechanism should detect failures quickly and precisely.
- FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating the generation of a list of VPN & VR IDs present in the primary processor engine that failed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- fault management 902 may query object manager 904 for list of VPNs and VRs that were created in the failed PE identified by a slot/PE ID.
- Object manager 904 may query object manager database 910 and return list 906 that includes VPN and VR IDs.
- Fault manager 902 may save this list in memory 908 .
- FIG. 9 illustrates how the fault manager generates a list of VPN & VR IDs—for example VPN 1 and VR 1.1.1.1 were present in the primary processor engine (slot 3 PE 1 ) that failed.
- fault manager 902 may pass this list to a CLI engine for processing along with the slot/PE ID of the failed PE and slot/PE ID of the new active PE.
- the list contains VPN & VR IDs.
- CLI engine uses these IDs and the slot/PE ID of the failed PE to find the set of command lines from the configuration file that correspond to the VPN/VR IDs in the list and the slot/PE ID of the failed PE.
- FIG. 13 illustrates a fault management system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- the fault management system 1300 may be implemented by fault manager 204 ( FIG. 2 ).
- Fault manager 1302 may include a fault tolerance (FT) configurator 1304 , fault detector 1306 , blade/PE state machine 1308 , and failure recovery agent 1309 .
- Fault manager 1302 may be capable of scaling to large number of processor engines.
- Fault manager 1302 may identify faults on processing engines 1310 and may restore affected virtual routers and applications accurately.
- Fault manager 1302 may identify problems in a timely fashion, so that responses and corrective actions may be taken as soon as possible to meet failover requirements.
- Fault manager 1302 may utilize low overhead and monitoring so as not to have a significant impact on the performance of virtual routers and application processes.
- Fault manager 1302 may also support a range of application-specific fault detection policies and usage models. For example, applications may wish to control which entities are monitored, how often they are monitored, the criteria used to report failure,
