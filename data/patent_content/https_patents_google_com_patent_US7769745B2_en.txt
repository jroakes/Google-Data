Definitions
- a dataset is a collection of information. Some datasets associate the collected information with location information, and may be referred to herein as location-based datasets.
- location-based dataset is a collection of digital photographs publicly available at a web site such as flickr.com, which is a public photo sharing site. At such web sites, persons who submit photos can add short contextual labels or “tags” to their photos such as the place at which the photo was taken, in addition to any device-generated context information. These labels help others search for and locate the photo. These tags are often related to the photo in some way, such as by subject, time, location (geo-reference information), etc.
- SMS Short Message Service
- datasets include restaurants searched by users on Yahoo! Local, search results or search terms, news reports and other location-annotated information.
- datasets may include diverse types of information, each item in any dataset sharing some commonality with other elements or information in the dataset.
- Mobile devices including, but not limited to, mobile phones and digital cameras, represent just one example of devices capable of generating location-dependent datasets.
- Such mobile devices are capable of determining or capturing information capable of at least partly defining the context of the environment in which they are used.
- location services may be used to supply spatial information about the device such as latitude and longitude from a Global Positioning System (GPS) device.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- Such spatial information may be associated with messages, digital photographs or other content sent, received or otherwise captured by a mobile device, thereby providing spatial context for the content.
- Some context information may be automatically generated by a device (referred to generally as device-generated data) and associated with the content.
- a device referred to generally as device-generated data
- a mobile phone may automatically generate time and date metadata associated with the capture of a digital photograph or the transmission of a Short Message Service (SMS) text message.
- SMS Short Message Service
- subjective semantic information may be entered by a user at the time of capture (or later) and associated with the content.
- a context server may receive stored datasets containing one or more of context information, media objects, and user-generated subjective characterization information associated with the context information from one or more users.
- the context information in these datasets may include metadata that relates to time, date, location, ambient conditions, aperture, shutter speed, and other settings (for digital photos), biometrics (e.g., relating to the user of the device), device/user identifications, geographical reference data (e.g., from a GPS location device, cell identification, or other location technology), or combinations thereof.
- the user-generated subjective characterization information may include one or more tags for a media object, such as a title, a description of the image, annotations, geographical location and comments.
- the context server associates service information with the user-generated subjective characterization information based on the context information.
- the service information may include, but is not limited to, keywords identifying popular or heavily searched points of interest, locations (e.g. streets, towns, cities, and the like), restaurants, people, advertisements, popular words in context-based messages, sponsored search advertisements, or combinations thereof.
- the service information may include other values associated with each label and obtained from the context information and the user-generated subjective characterization information, such as a latitude, longitude, a time or date or range for which the information is valid, and one or more associated values such as a value indicating the popularity of the label.
- keywords derived from datasets including “arbitrary” keywords normally thought of as being not intrinsically linked to any particular geographical feature (e.g. movies, people, words in SMS messages), by enabling a user to see those keywords on a map with some further indication of the extent of their popularity, relevance or relationship to some metric.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of an exemplary conventional map of San Francisco, Calif. and surrounding areas, showing a few landmarks and cities whose text varies according to their size (e.g. Oakland is in a larger font than Alameda).
- Guten registration (see http://www.groregistr.org/), which uses a map to visualize geographic locations mentioned in books, with the geographic location names being shown in various sizes according to the number of times they were mentioned.
- Stanley Milgram introduced the idea of displaying landmarks sized in accordance with their popularity in 1976.
- these conventional systems only display location-dependent objects (e.g. cities and/or landmarks) tied to a particular geographic region, and none or these systems display keywords not intrinsically linked to any particular geographical feature (e.g. movies, people, words in SMS messages).
- Embodiments of the invention visualize datasets by associating text (keywords) with location and optionally with time. This visualization may help the user better understand and analyze the contents of the dataset.
- the visualization takes as input a keyword and related parameters such as location, importance/relevance factors, time, visualization level, and keyword category, and displays (visualizes) the selected keywords on a map, at their associated location, with the size or other characteristic of the keyword varying according to its relevance to some metric (e.g. popularity).
- Visualization data may be generated by a context server located at the server side, or by a computer located at the client side.
- the visualization data may contain keywords tied to a particular geographic location (e.g. cities and landmarks) and associated relevance parameters, but also geographically independent keywords (e.g. people, movie titles, current events, search terms, products, and the like) that are not intrinsically linked to any particular geographical feature but nonetheless have been associated with a particular location, along with their location and relevance parameters. These keywords may be referred to as location-based keywords.
- the visualization data may be pre-computed all at once, in advance of any selection of a map area, or may be computed in an ad hoc manner “on the fly,” only when a particular map area is specified.
- visualization data is generated from all keywords in the dataset without regard to the location associated with the keywords.
- visualization data is computed in an ad hoc manner, visualization data is generated from only those keywords associated with a location within the selected map area.
- Map data can also be rendered both on the server or on the client. For example, when a user selects a certain map area, in some embodiments raw map data is retrieved from a map server on the server side and transmitted to the client side, where the client-side computer utilizes the raw map data and a rendering program to display the selected map data on the client-side computer. Alternatively, a rendering program may be executed at the server side to operate on the raw map data and generate rendering data that need only be transmitted to the client side for display on the client-side computer. In other embodiments, map data can be generated and maps may be rendered from any other source.
- the visualization data Before the keywords can be visualized (i.e. before they can appear on a map), the visualization data must be applied to the keywords in accordance with a visualization scheme that applies appearance information to keywords in accordance to keyword relevance.
- the result When visualization data is applied to a keyword, the result may be referred to herein as presentation data.
- the presentation data for “flagsofourfathers” may comprise the text “flagsofourfathers” along with code for rendering the text in 12-point font, specification of colors and other visual elements, as well as specification regarding the visual/map location in which to render the keyword.
- the visualization scheme for the selected location-based keywords may also be established. In some embodiments, all presentation data will follow the same visualization scheme. Any number of visualization schemes may be employed, including, but not limited to, size (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being larger), color (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being brighter colors (red for the most popular or more recent keywords)), shadings (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being darker), three-dimensional (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being taller), blinking or animation (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords blinking faster, fading in and out faster, moving or wiggling faster, etc.), and the like.
- size e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being larger
- color e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being brighter colors (red for the most popular or more recent keywords)
- shadings e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being darker
- three-dimensional e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being taller
- the keywords themselves may be supplemented by or replaced with symbols, icons, links to web sites or web pages, graphics, thumbnail pictures, and the like, and these items may also vary in size, color, or shading, and may blink, fade in and out, pop-up, and the like.
- the visualization algorithm may have a fixed visualization scheme for all keywords or may have different schemes for different keyword categories, or alternatively the visualization schemes may be user-selectable.
- the visualization scheme may then be applied to the location-based keywords to be converted to presentation data. For example, if “movie titles” appearing in text messages are to be converted to presentation data according to where the text message was sent, and a font size visualization scheme is to be employed using three font sizes, then the three most relevant (e.g. popular) keywords having a keyword category of “movie title” may be assigned to the appropriate font sizes. In other embodiments, some presentation data may be assigned the same appearance information (e.g. assigned the same font size) to indicate similar relevance characteristics.
- a similar assignment of visualization scheme to keywords can be applied to other visualization schemes and keyword categories.
- the presentation data may be pre-computed all at once, in advance of any selection of a map area, or may be computed in an ad hoc manner “on the fly,” only when a particular map area is specified.
- presentation data is generated from all keywords without regard to the location associated with the keywords. However, only the presentation data that is located within the map area selected by the user will be visualized (appear on the map).
- presentation data is computed in an ad hoc manner, presentation data is generated from only those keywords associated with a location within the selected map area.
- Presentation data may be generated by a server located at the server side, or by a computer located at the client side. In still other embodiments, the presentation computation mode is user-selectable.
- the presentation data can be dependent on zoom level, screen-viewable area, type of screen, screen resolution and the like, and the decisions on how to further modify the presentation data may be made either in the client or the server. For example, if the presentation data includes keywords sized in five different fonts according to some measure of keyword relevance, but a server or processor at either the client or server determines or is made aware that either the zoom level is very high (i.e. “zoomed out”), the screen size is small, and/or the screen resolution is low, the smallest font sizes may not be readable.
- the server or processor may further modify the presentation data to increase all font sizes, eliminate the presentation data with font sizes smaller than a certain level, or take other measures to ensure that the presentation data that is ultimately visualized is readable.
- the presentation data includes keywords in five different colors according to some measure of keyword relevance, but a server or processor at either the client or server determines or is made aware that the display device is monochrome (e.g. black and white) or limited in color resolution, the color distinctions may not be visible when visualized.
- the server or processor may further modify the presentation data to replace color distinctions with some other visual distinction (e.g. font size distinctions) or take other measures to ensure that the presentation data that is ultimately visualized is properly distinguishable.
- the server or processor may further modify the presentation data to replace font distinctions with some other visual distinction (e.g. color distinctions) or take other measures to ensure that the presentation data that is ultimately visualized is properly distinguishable.
- some other visual distinction e.g. color distinctions
- the location-based keywords to be converted to presentation data may be established.
- all keywords are modified and converted into presentation data.
- keywords to be visualized may already have been limited to a particular category (e.g. cities), or may fall into a number of different selected categories (e.g. cities, landmarks, movies, people and the like).
- the keywords to be converted to presentation data are category-dependent. If the keywords to be converted are category-dependent, keywords may have a “category” parameter (e.g. cities, landmarks, movies, people, and the like, and the user may select one or more of these categories of keywords to be converted to presentation data.
- the map area to be displayed may be established. In some embodiments, the map area is fixed, but other embodiments, the map area is user-selectable.
- Whether the visualization is to be time-dependent may also be established. In some embodiments, there is no time-dependency. If no time-dependency is selected, all location-based keywords to be visualized will be visualized. In other embodiments, visualization is time-dependent, and only those keywords having a time/date stamp (a parameter associated with the keyword) corresponding to a particular time, date or range will be visualized. In still other embodiments, this is user-selectable. In time-dependent visualization, either the visualization algorithm may automatically determine a time, date or range (in some embodiments selecting the range based on the keywords to be visualized having the earliest and latest time/date stamps), or the user may select a time, date or range, or whether the visualization is to be animated.
- the presentation data may then be rendered (visualized) by a server located at the server side, or by a computer located at the client side, or by any device capable of generating rendering data.
- the location-based keywords are visualized by applying the presentation data to the map data, and the modified map data may be sent to the user for rendering on the user's web browser.
- time-independent visualization only a single map is rendered.
- time-dependent visualization a fixed or user-selectable time, time/date, time range or date range may be used to limit the keywords to be displayed.
- a sequence of modified map data may be transmitted for rendering, each set of modified map data in the sequence representing a different time or date in the selected time or date range. As these views are rendered, the keywords will appear and disappear in accordance with their associated time/date stamps.
- the views may be rendered automatically, giving the user a time-dependent animation, or the user may step through the different views one at a time.
- the location-based keywords and the map data are sent separately to the user's web browser, where rendering logic combines the information before rendering it.
- the visualization process and transmission process may be repeated in preparation for map re-rendering.
- some previously hidden keywords may appear, and some previously displayed keywords may disappear.
- the displayed keywords may change according to a visualization level parameter associated with the keywords that identifies a particular zoom or geographic level (e.g. city, state, etc).
- the keywords may be filtered according to some other parameter such as frequency of occurrence, so that only a subset of the keywords is shown. For example, if a user is viewing a map of San Francisco with a visualization level of “city,” all restaurants with 10 or more occurrences or some threshold value may appear. However, at a visualization level of “state,” only restaurants with 50 or more occurrences may appear, or only the five restaurants with the most occurrences may appear.

- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating the main steps of the visualization algorithm according to embodiments of the invention.
- One skilled in the art will recognize that the order of some of these steps may be changed without affecting the final visualization.
- Visualization data may be generated by a context server located at the server side, or by a computer located at the client side. Although the visualization data may have been received from the previously described context server, the present invention is applicable to any dataset, however it may have been compiled.
- the visualization data according to embodiments of the invention may contain keywords tied to a particular geographic location (e.g. cities and landmarks) and associated relevance parameters, but also geographically independent keywords (e.g. people, movie titles, current events, search terms, products, and the like) that are not intrinsically linked to any particular geographical feature but nonetheless have been associated with a particular location, along with their location and relevance parameters. These keywords may be referred to as location-based keywords.
- the visualization data may be pre-computed all at once, in advance of any selection of a map area, or may be computed in an ad hoc manner “on the fly,” only when a particular map area is specified.
- visualization data is generated from all keywords in the dataset without regard to the location associated with the keywords.
- visualization data is computed in an ad hoc manner, visualization data is generated from only those keywords associated with a location within the selected map area.
- Map data can also be rendered both on the server or on the client. For example, when a user selects a certain map area, in some embodiments raw map data is retrieved from a map server on the server side and transmitted to the client side, where the client-side computer utilizes the raw map data and a rendering program to display the selected map data on the client-side computer. Alternatively, a rendering program may be executed at the server side to operate on the raw map data and generate rendering data that need only be transmitted to the client side for display on the client-side computer. In other embodiments, map data can be generated and maps may be rendered from any other source.
- the visualization data Before the keywords can be visualized (i.e. before they can appear on a map), the visualization data must be applied to the keywords in accordance with a visualization scheme (i.e. the application of appearance information to keywords in accordance to keyword relevance).
- a visualization scheme i.e. the application of appearance information to keywords in accordance to keyword relevance.
- presentation data the result may be referred to herein as presentation data.
- the presentation data for “flagsofourfathers” may comprise the text “flagsofourfathers” along with code for rendering the text in 12-point font, specification of colors and other visual elements, as well as specification regarding the visual/map location in which to render the keyword.
- the presentation data may be pre-computed all at once, in advance of any selection of a map area, or may be computed in an ad hoc manner “on the fly,” only when a particular map area is specified.
- presentation data is generated from all keywords without regard to the location associated with the keywords. However, only the presentation data that is located within the map area selected by the user will be visualized (appear on the map).
- presentation data is computed in an ad hoc manner, presentation data is generated from only those keywords associated with a location within the selected map area.
- Presentation data may be generated by a server located at the server side, or by a computer located at the client side. In still other embodiments, the presentation computation mode is user-selectable.
- step S 602 a determination may be made as to whether the generation of presentation data is to be pre-computed all at once, in advance of any selection of a map area, or to be computed in an ad hoc manner “on the fly,” only when a particular map area is specified (see S 602 -A).
- visualization data is generated from all keywords in the dataset without regard to the location associated with the keywords.
- visualization data is computed in an ad hoc manner, visualization data is generated from only those keywords associated with a location within the selected map area (see S 602 -B).
- location-dependent generation of presentation data the user may select a map area first, and only those keywords located within the selected map area will be converted to presentation data.
- the visualization mode is user-selectable (see S 602 -C).
- step S 604 determines the location-based keywords to be subjected to pre-computed generation of presentation data.
- all location-based keywords are pre-computed and converted into presentation data (see S 604 -A).
- the location-based keywords to be visualized may already have been limited to a particular category (e.g. cities), or may fall into a number of different categories (e.g. cities, landmarks, movies, people and the like.)
- the generation of presentation data is category-dependent (see S 604 -B). If the generation of presentation data is category-dependent, all keywords may have a “category” parameter (e.g. cities, landmarks, movies, people, and the like), and the user may select one or more of these categories of keywords to be converted to presentation data.
- Step S 606 determines how the selected location-based keywords will be visualized.
- all presentation data will follow the same visualization scheme.
- Any number of visualization schemes may be employed, including, but not limited to, varying the appearance of a keyword utilizing an appearance characteristic such as size (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being larger), color (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being brighter colors (red for the most popular or more recent keywords)), shadings (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being darker), three-dimensional (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being taller), blinking or animation (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords blinking faster, fading in and out faster, moving or wiggling faster, etc.), and the like.
- an appearance characteristic such as size (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being larger), color (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being brighter colors (red for the most popular or more recent keywords)), shadings (e.g. with more popular or more recent keywords being darker), three
- the keywords themselves may be supplemented by or replaced with appearance elements such as symbols, icons, links to web sites or web pages, graphics, thumbnail pictures, and the like, and these items may also vary in size, color, or shading, and may blink, fade in and out, pop-up, and the like.
- the visualization algorithm may have a fixed visualization scheme for all keywords or may have different schemes for different keyword categories, or alternatively the visualization schemes may be user-selectable.
- Step S 608 applies the visualization scheme to the location-based keywords to be converted to presentation data. For example, if “movie titles” appearing in text messages are to be converted according to where the text message was sent, and a font size visualization scheme is to be employed using three font sizes, then the three most relevant (e.g. popular) keywords (e.g. “Flags of Our Fathers,” “The Prestige,” and “Marie Antoinette”) having a keyword category of “movie title” would be assigned to the appropriate font sizes. In other embodiments, some presentation data may be assigned the same appearance information (e.g. assigned the same font size) to indicate similar relevance characteristics.
- a similar assignment of visualization scheme to keywords can be applied to other visualization schemes and keyword categories.
- the presentation data can be dependent on zoom level, screen-viewable area, type of screen, screen resolution and the like, and the decisions on how to further modify the presentation data may be made either in the client or the server. For example, if the presentation data includes keywords sized in five different fonts according to some measure of keyword relevance, but a server or processor at either the client or server determines or is made aware that either the zoom level is very high (i.e. “zoomed out”), the screen size is small, and/or the screen resolution is low, the smallest font sizes may not be readable.
- the server or processor may further modify the presentation data to increase all font sizes, eliminate the presentation data with font sizes smaller than a certain level, or take other measures to ensure that the presentation data that is ultimately visualized is readable.
- the presentation data includes keywords in five different colors according to some measure of keyword relevance, but a server or processor at either the client or server determines or is made aware that the display device is monochrome (e.g. black and white) or limited in color resolution, the color distinctions may not be visible when visualized.
- the server or processor may further modify the presentation data to replace color distinctions with some other visual distinction (e.g. font size distinctions) or take other measures to ensure that the presentation data that is ultimately visualized is properly distinguishable.
- the server or processor may further modify the presentation data to replace font distinctions with some other visual distinction (e.g. color distinctions) or take other measures to ensure that the presentation data that is ultimately visualized is properly distinguishable.
- some other visual distinction e.g. color distinctions
- Step S 610 determines the map area to be displayed.
- the map area is fixed (see S 610 -A), but other embodiments, the map area is user-selectable (see S 610 -B).
- Step S 612 determines if the visualization is to be time-dependent. In some embodiments, there is no time-dependency (see S 612 -A). If no time-dependency is selected, all location-based keywords to be visualized will be visualized. In other embodiments, visualization is time-dependent (see S 612 -B), and only those keywords having a time/date stamp (a temporal parameter associated with the keyword) corresponding to a particular time, date or range will be visualized. In still other embodiments, this is user-selectable (see S 612 -C).
- either the visualization algorithm may automatically determine a time, date or range (in some embodiments selecting the range based on the keywords to be visualized having the earliest and latest time/date stamps) and whether the visualization is to be animated, or the user may select a time, date or range and whether the visualization is to be animated.
- the changes in time may also mean the same keywords will be shown but with other properties (e.g. change color, size, and the like).
- the presentation data may then be rendered (visualized) by a server located at the server side, or by a computer located at the client side.
- Step S 614 visualizes the location-based keywords by applying the keywords according to the visualization scheme to the map data, and step S 616 sends this modified map data to the user for rendering on the user's web browser.
- map data and presentation data are separately sent to the user's web browser for combining and rendering.
- time-independent visualization only a single map is rendered.
- time-dependent visualization a fixed or user-selectable time, time/date, time range or date range may be used to limit the keywords to be displayed. For example, if a particular time, time/date, time range or date range is selected (e.g. “5 p.m.”, “5 p.m. on Oct. 24, 2006,” “5-7 p.m.”, or “Oct.
- all keywords having temporal keyword parameters falling within that range will be displayed on a single map.
- the same presentation data may be visualized with changes to color, size or other presentation characteristics.
- a sequence of modified map data may be transmitted for rendering, each set of modified map data in the sequence representing a different time or date in the selected time or date range.
- the keywords will appear and disappear in accordance with their associated time/date stamps.
- the views may be rendered automatically, giving the user a time-dependent animation, or the user may step through the different views one at a time.
- step S 614 the visualization process (step S 614 ) and transmission process (step S 616 ) will be repeated in preparation for map is re-rendering.
- step S 616 the transmission process
- the visualization process (step S 614 ) and transmission process (step S 616 ) will be repeated when the map is re-rendered.
- the displayed keywords may change according to a visualization level parameter associated with the keywords.
- a Golden Gate Bridge (GGB) keyword may appear, as will other keywords having a visualization level parameter of “city.”
- the label for GGB may disappear, and only a label for San Francisco may appear, as will other keywords having a visualization level parameter of “state.”
- a visualization level parameter may be attached to each keyword that identifies a particular zoom or geographic level (e.g. city, state, etc).
- the keywords may be filtered according to some other parameter such as frequency of occurrence, so that only a subset of the keywords is shown.
- a user is viewing a map of San Francisco with a visualization level of “city,” all restaurants with 10 or more occurrences or some threshold value may appear. However, at a visualization level of “state,” only restaurants with 50 or more occurrences may appear, or only the five restaurants with the most occurrences may appear.
- Step S 618 determines the map area to be displayed. This step is similar to step S 610 .
- Step S 620 determines the keywords to be converted to presentation data. This step is similar to step S 604 , except that only those location-based keywords located within the geographic range of the selected map area will be converted to presentation data.
- Step S 622 determines how the selected keywords will be visualized. This step is similar to step S 606 .
- Step S 624 applies the visualization scheme to the keywords to be visualized. This step is similar to step S 608 .
- Step S 612 determines if the visualization is to be time-dependent.
- Step S 614 visualizes the keywords by applying the keywords according to the visualization scheme to the map data, and step S 616 sends this modified map data to the user for rendering on the user's web browser.
