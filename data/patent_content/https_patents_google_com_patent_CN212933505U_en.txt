Description
Technical Field
The present application relates generally to electronic devices, including but not limited to voice activated display assistant devices for use as user interface devices in smart home (smart home) environments.
Background
Microphone-integrated electronic devices have been widely used to collect voice input from a user and implement different voice-activated functions according to the voice input. For example, many prior art mobile devices include voice Assistant systems (e.g., Siri and Google assistance) that are configured to use voice input to initiate phone calls, conduct restaurant searches, begin selecting routes on maps, create calendar events, add posts to social networks, identify songs, and accomplish many other tasks. These mobile devices include complex operating systems that implement tasks initiated by voice input, but do not constantly detect voice input from their surroundings. The voice interface function must be activated by the operating system to allow the mobile device to listen to voice input. On the other hand, when an electronic device having a relatively simple structure and low cost is applied to realize a voice-activated function similar to a mobile device, the electronic device is generally reduced to a combination of a microphone and a speaker, while eliminating the benefit of using a display screen.
Furthermore, the voice-activated functionality currently implemented in many electronic devices is limited to internet-based functionality involving a remote server (e.g., a search engine, a social networking server, or a voice assistant server). The result of the voice activated function is used to control the electronic device itself and does not affect any other remote or local electronic devices accessible to the user. In addition to internet-based functionality where requests are limited between a remote server and the electronic device itself, it is beneficial to allow the user to use voice input to control other electronic devices accessible to the user, given that voice input is convenient for the user.
SUMMERY OF THE UTILITY MODEL
Thus, electronic devices are employed in smart home environments to provide a hands-free and hands-free voice interface that can activate voice-activated functions to control media devices or smart home devices in the smart home environment. The electronic device is configured to be located at a fixed location in a smart home environment and includes at least a display screen in addition to a microphone and a speaker. The electronic device does not include a complex operating system, but rather provides a low-cost user interface solution that is dedicated to constantly listening to its surroundings, collecting audio input, and presenting both audio and video information in response to the audio input. Further, in some implementations, audio input is collected from the surrounding environment to initiate voice-activated functions on other media playback devices or smart home devices coupled within the smart home environment. Examples of such voice-activated functions include, but are not limited to, initiating playback of media content, transferring media content between different media devices, viewing smart device readings and status, turning smart devices on or off, and controlling smart device settings.
According to one aspect of the present application, a display assistant device includes: a base configured for seating on a surface, the base having a front side and a rear side higher than the front side; a screen having a rear surface at which the screen is supported by the front side and the rear side of the base, wherein the base is substantially concealed behind the screen from a front view of the display assistant device; a camera integrated in a bezel area of the screen, the camera facing a front view of the screen and configured to capture a still image or real-time video of a field of view; a volume control button disposed on the rear surface of the screen; a power adapter interface exposed from a rear surface of the base and configured to be connected to an external power source; a first speaker concealed within the base, wherein the first speaker is oriented to project sound toward a first side of the base; and two second speakers, each second speaker oriented to project sound to a respective side of the base different from the first side of the base.
According to one aspect of the present application, a display assistant device includes a base, a screen, and a rear speaker. The base is configured to sit on a surface and has a front side and a rear side higher than the front side. The screen has a rear surface and is supported at the rear surface by the front and rear sides of the base. The base is substantially concealed behind the screen from a front view of the display assistant device. The rear speaker is hidden inside the base and is configured to project sound out of the base substantially via the rear side of the base. That is, in some implementations, the rear speakers are oriented to project sound toward the rear side of the base. The rear speaker has a rear speaker opening facing the rear side of the base and projects sound directly out of at least a threshold portion (e.g., 60%) of the area of the rear side of the base. The rear speakers may project a majority (e.g., > 90%) of the volume through the rear side of the base. Further, in some implementations, the display assistant device also includes one or more (e.g., 2) front speakers that are hidden within the base, face the front view of the display assistant device (i.e., oriented to project sound toward the front side of the base) and are configured to project sound out of the base substantially through the front side of the base. In an example, the rear speakers are woofers and the one or more front speakers include two tweeters configured to produce higher audio frequencies than the audio frequencies produced by the woofers.
According to various embodiments of the present application, the display assistant device has a small footprint that allows the display assistant device to be conveniently located in many different locations (e.g., kitchen, living room, and bedroom) in a smart home environment. The speaker has a relatively heavy weight despite a small footprint, and is configured to pull the center of mass of the display assistant device closer to a surface on which the display assistant device is located. The low centroid allows the display assistant device to maintain stability when it is touched or bumped. The display assistant device also includes a number of mechanical features configured to protect the screen of the display assistant from falling off the base and from damage when the display assistant device hits the floor. In these ways, the present application provides a low cost, mechanically robust, and voice activated user interface solution with visual display capabilities and support for a variety of voice activated functions.
In various implementations of the present application, a display assistant device provides home monitoring services in addition to core consumer use for entertainment, home connectivity, and productivity. The display assistant device includes a built-in camera configured to allow a user to track what is happening in the home, thereby reassuring the user. The display assistant device also includes functional visibility that identifies the user (e.g., account owner, family members, and guests) their mode of operation as the user interacts with the device.

Detailed Description
While the digital revolution provides many benefits from publicly sharing information to a sense of community worldwide, emerging new technologies often cause confusion, doubt, and fear among consumers, thereby preventing consumers from benefiting from the technology. The electronic device is conveniently used as a voice interface to receive voice input from a user and to initiate voice-activated functions, thereby providing a hands-free and hands-free solution to both existing and emerging technologies. In particular, voice input received on the electronic device may carry instructions and information even if the user's line of sight is obstructed and the hands are busy. To achieve a hands-free and hands-free experience, a voice-activated electronic device may listen to the ambient environment (i.e., process audio signals collected from the ambient environment) constantly or only when triggered. The user identity, on the other hand, is associated with the user's voice and the language used by the user. To protect user identity, voice activated electronic devices are commonly used in non-public locations in protected, controlled and private spaces (e.g., homes and cars).
According to some implementations of the present invention, a voice-activated electronic device includes a screen configured to provide additional visual information in addition to audio information that may be broadcast via a speaker of the voice-activated electronic device. For example, the electronic device displays caller information (e.g., the caller's name and number) on a screen in response to receiving a voice command to initiate a telephone call. In response to receiving a voice command that includes identification information for a video clip, the electronic device may play a YouTube video clip on the screen. The electronic device may display a list of restaurants and their contact information in response to receiving a voice command to conduct a restaurant search. The electronic device may display the map and the suggested route in response to receiving a voice command to identify a route to a destination on the map. The electronic device may display event information for an upcoming event in response to receiving a voice command to view a calendar event. The electronic device may display the post transcribed from the voice message in response to receiving a voice command to add the post to the social network. The electronic device may display information for the song currently being played (e.g., title of the song, composer and singer, YouTube link) in response to receiving a voice command identifying the song.
In particular, a voice activated electronic device, when integrated with its own display screen, constitutes a display assistant device. The display assistant device thus includes a base, a screen, and a speaker. The base is configured to sit on a surface and has a front side and a rear side higher than the front side. The screen has a rear surface and is supported at its rear surface by the front and rear sides of the base. The speaker is hidden inside the base and is configured to project sound substantially towards the rear side of the base. The bottom edge of the screen is configured to be held at a predefined height above the surface, and the dock is substantially concealed behind the screen from a front view of the display assistant device (i.e., the dock appears to float in air from a front view). The footprint of the display assistant device is small, but the center of mass of the display assistant device is configured to be close to the surface on which the display assistant device sits, allowing the display assistant device to maintain stability when touched or impacted. That is, the display assistant device provides a low cost, mechanically robust and voice activated user interface solution with visual display functionality and support for various voice activated functions.
In various implementations of the present application, a display assistant device integrated with a microphone and camera may be used to collect audio and visual input from a user and implement voice activated functions in accordance with the voice input. Some electronic devices include a voice assistant feature that is configured to use audio input to perform a number of tasks. The functionality of these display assistant devices can be further extended to home security and remote monitoring to reassure the user.
For example, consider a use case where a first user purchases a voice activated display assistant device having video surveillance capabilities. In commissioning (e.g., provisioning) a display assistant device for use in its smart home environment (e.g., using a smart home application installed on its mobile device), a first user receives a welcome message on the smart home application asking her whether she would like to configure the display assistant device for smart home monitoring. The first user accepts the offer and completes a provisioning process during which the display assistant device is configured to perform video and audio monitoring functions in addition to a series of voice and display assistant functions. Thereafter, the first user can move around the room in which the display assistant device is located while issuing a plurality of verbal requests to the display assistant device. The assistant device receives the verbal request and presents a response that includes visual and/or audio information for viewing and/or listening by the first user. Thereafter, when the first user is at work, having configured the display assistant device for smart home monitoring, she can use her smart home application to view a real-time video stream of the room, which is captured using the camera of the display assistant device. The first user can also receive a notification to remind her to notice unusual activity or an unfamiliar face in the room captured by the camera and/or microphone of the display assistant device. In response to the notification, the first user can review a real-time view of the room and respond accordingly via her smart home application.
The use cases described above refer to a particular modality by which the first user interacts with the display assistant device (e.g., speech input or input received from a smart home application) and receives information from the display assistant device (e.g., information presented by the smart home application or from the display assistant device through audio or video playback). However, in some implementations, the display assistant device responds to a wider range of inputs, including one or more of: a voice input, an input received from a smart home application, a touch input entered on a touch-sensitive display of a display assistant device and/or a gesture performed near the display assistant device, the gesture captured by a sensor such as a radar transceiver or a PIR detector included in its camera or display assistant device.
In some implementations, various subscription options are provided to the user while the display assistant device is provisioned. The subscription options include a first option (e.g., a free or low cost rating) that provides one or more of the following: "Live View" capability (e.g., the ability to View video from a camera through a smart home application or browser at least near real-time); a "Talk & Listen" capability (e.g., the ability to speak and Listen in real-time to a person near the display assistant device through a smart home application or browser); basic event notifications (e.g., notifications for motion events and/or sound events and/or human events captured by a camera and/or microphone of a display assistant device); displaying an assistant device camera history (e.g., a one, three, or five hour camera recording history); and monitoring settings including home/away assistance "settings (e.g., settings where the display assistant device is configured to turn on its camera and enter monitoring mode when the user is" away "and turn off its camera and exit monitoring mode when the user is" at home "), and camera scheduling (settings that the user can define for the scheduling of turning on and off the camera and monitoring mode). More details regarding Live View and Talk & Listen Operation are described below in the section entitled "Device Operation Modes". In some implementations, the order options include a second option (e.g., a payment level or higher cost level) that includes all of the features and additional features of the first option. In some implementations, additional features included in the second option include smart event notifications, such as familiar faces, activity areas, dog calls, human speech, broken glass, and baby crying reminders; a continuous video history; time interval video summarization; and/or close-up follow-up viewing of events of interest. Details of intelligent Event notification are described in U.S. patent application No.15/207,458 entitled "Methods and Systems for Providing Event Alerts," filed on 11/7/2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Reference will now be made in detail to implementations, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various implementations described. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various described implementations may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the implementations.
Fig. 1 is an example smart home environment 100 according to some implementations. The smart-home environment 100 includes a structure 150 (e.g., a house, office building, garage, or mobile home) having various integrated devices (also referred to herein as "connected" or "smart" devices). It will be understood that smart devices may also be integrated into a smart-home environment 100, such as an apartment, apartment house, or office space, that does not include the entire structure 150. In some implementations, the smart device includes one or more of: personal client device 104 (e.g., a tablet computer, laptop computer, or mobile phone), display device 106, media delivery or streaming device 108, thermostat 122, home protection device 124 (e.g., smoke, fire, and carbon dioxide detectors), home security devices (e.g., motion detectors, window and door sensors, and alarms), including connected doorbell/camera 126, connected lockset 128, alarm system 130 and camera 132, connected wall switch transponder 136, connected appliance 138, WiFi communication device 160 (e.g., hub, router, extender), connected home cleaning device 168 (e.g., vacuum cleaner or floor cleaner), smart home communication and control hub 180, voice assistant device 192, and display assistant device 190.
It should be understood that the term "smart home environment" may refer to a smart environment for a home, such as a single family residence, although the scope of the present teachings is not so limited. The present teachings also apply to, but are not limited to, a townhouse, multi-unit apartment building, hotel, retail store, office building, industrial building, yard, park, more generally, any living space or workspace.
It should also be understood that although the terms user, customer, installer, homeowner, occupant, guest, tenant, landlord, serviceman, etc. may be used to refer to a person or persons in the context of certain particular situations described herein, such references do not limit the scope of the present teachings with respect to the person or persons performing such actions. Thus, for example, the terms user, customer, purchaser, installer, subscriber, and homeowner generally refer to the same person who makes a purchase decision, purchases the unit, and installs and configures the unit, and is also one of the users of the unit, in the case of a single family home. However, in other cases, such as a landlord-tenant environment, with respect to the purchase unit, the customer may be the landlord, the installer may be a local apartment manager, the first user may be the tenant, and with respect to the remote control function, the second user may again be the landlord. Importantly, while the identity of the person performing the action may be germane to the particular advantages provided by one or more implementations, such identity should not be construed in the description that follows as necessarily limiting the scope of the present teachings to those particular persons having those particular identities.
The depicted structure 150 includes a plurality of rooms 152, which rooms 152 are at least partially separated from each other by walls 154. The wall 154 may include an inner wall or an outer wall. Each room may further include a floor 156 and a ceiling 158.
One or more media devices are provided in the smart home environment 100 to provide a user with access to media content that is stored locally or streamed from a remote content source (e.g., content host 114). In some implementations, the media devices include a media output device 106 that outputs/displays/plays media content directly to the audience, and a delivery device 108 that streams media content received over one or more networks to the media output device 106. Examples of media output devices 106 include, but are not limited to, Television (TV) display devices, music players, and computer monitors. Examples of delivery devices 108 include, but are not limited to, intermediate streaming boxes, delivery devices (e.g., GOOGLE streaming devices), set-top boxes (STBs), DVD players, and television boxes.
In the example smart home environment 100, the media output devices 106 are disposed in more than one location, and each media output device 106 is coupled to a respective delivery device 108 or includes an embedded delivery unit. Media output device 106-1 includes a television display that is hard wired to a DVD player or set top box 108-1. Media output device 106-3 comprises a smart television device that integrates an embedded delivery unit to stream media content for display to its viewers. The media output device 106-2 includes a conventional television display coupled to a television box 108-1 (e.g., google television or apple television products), and such television box 108-2 streams media content received from a media content host 114 and provides access to the internet to display internet-based content on the media output device 106-2.
In addition to the media devices 106 and 108, one or more electronic devices 190 and 192 are disposed in the smart-home environment 100. Electronic device 190 is a display assistant device and electronic device 192 is a voice assistant device. In some implementations, the display assistant device 190 is also a voice assistant device. The electronic devices 190 and 192 collect audio input for initiating various media playback functions of the devices 190 and 192 and/or the media devices 106 and 108. In some implementations, devices 190 and 192 are configured to provide media content that is stored locally or streamed from a remote content source. In some implementations, electronic devices 190 and 192 are voice-activated and are disposed near the media device, e.g., in the same room as delivery device 108 and media output device 106. Alternatively, in some implementations, the voice-activated display assistant device 190-1 is disposed in a room having one or more smart home devices but no media devices. Alternatively, in some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190 is provided in a location that does not have a networked electronic device. This allows devices 190 and 192 to communicate with the media device and share content being displayed on one device to the other device (e.g., from device 190-1 to device 190-2 and/or media device 108).
The voice-activated electronic device 190 includes at least one microphone, a speaker, a processor, and a memory storing at least one program for execution by the processor. The speaker is configured to allow the electronic device 190 to communicate voice messages to the location where the electronic device 190 is located in the smart home environment 100, to broadcast information related to the current media content being displayed, to report the status of audio input processing, to converse with or provide instructions to a user of the electronic device 190. For example, in some embodiments, the device provides audible information to the user through a speaker in response to a user query. As an alternative to a voice message, the visual signal may also be used to provide feedback to the user of the electronic device 190 regarding the status of the audio input process, such as a notification displayed on the device.
According to some implementations, the electronic device 190 is a voice interface device that is networked to provide voice recognition functionality via the server system 140. In some implementations, the server system 140 includes the cloud delivery service server 116 and/or the voice/display assistance server 112. For example, in some implementations, the electronic device 190 includes a smart speaker that provides music (e.g., audio of video content displayed on the device 190 or the display device 106) to the user and allows for hands-free and hands-free access to voice Assistant services (e.g., Google Assistant). Alternatively, the electronic device 190 is a simple and low-cost voice interface device, such as a speaker device and a display assistant device (including a display screen without touch detection capability).
In some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190 integrates a display screen (e.g., 190-2 and 190-4) in addition to a microphone, speaker, processor, and memory, and is referred to as a "display assistant device". The display screen is configured to provide additional visual information (e.g., media content, information related to the media content, etc.) in addition to audio information that may be broadcast via the speakers of the voice-activated electronic device 190. In the event that the user is nearby and his or her line of sight is not obstructed, the user may view the additional visual information directly on the display screen of the display assistant device. Optionally, the additional visual information provides feedback to the user of the electronic device 190 regarding the status of the audio input processing. Optionally, the additional visual information is provided in response to a user's previous voice input (e.g., a user query) and may be related to audio information broadcast by the speaker. In some implementations, the display screen of the voice-activated electronic device 190 includes a touch display screen configured to detect touch input on its surface (e.g., instructions provided by touching the display screen). Alternatively, in some implementations, the display screen of the voice-activated electronic device 190 is not a touch display screen, which is relatively expensive and can detract from the goal of providing the display assistant device 190 as a low-cost user interface solution.
When voice input from electronic device 190 is used to control electronic device 190 and/or media output device 106 through delivery device 108, electronic device 190 enables a new level of control over the delivery-enabled media device to be effectively implemented, whether or not electronic device 190 has its own display. In an example, the electronic device 190 includes a recreational speaker with far-field voice access and functions as a voice interface device for Google Assistant. The electronic device 190 may be disposed in any room in the smart-home environment 100. When multiple electronic devices 190 are distributed among multiple rooms, they become audio receivers, which are synchronized to provide speech input from all of the rooms. For example, the first electronic device 190 may receive a user instruction directed to the second electronic device 190-2 (e.g., a user instruction of "OK this photo album on the Kitchen device").
Specifically, in some implementations, the electronic device 190 includes a WiFi speaker with a microphone that connects to a voice-activated personal Assistant service (e.g., Google Assistant). The user may issue a media play request via the microphone of the electronic device 190 and ask the personal assistant service to play media content on the electronic device 190 itself and/or another connected media output device 106. For example, a user may speak "OK Google, Play cat video on my Living room TV" to a Wi-Fi speaker. The personal assistant service then satisfies the media play request by playing the requested media content on the requested device using the default or specified media application.
The user may also issue a voice request via the microphone of the electronic device 190 related to media content that has been played and/or is playing on the display device. For example, the user may instruct the device to provide information related to the current media content being displayed, such as ownership information or subject matter of the media content. In some implementations, closed captioning of currently displayed media content is initiated or deactivated on the display device by voice when no remote control or second screen device is available to the user. Thus, the user can open closed captioning on the display device through the hands-free and hands-free voice-activated electronic device 190 without involving any other device with a physical user interface, and such voice-activated electronic device 190 meets the joint barrier-free requirements of users with hearing impairments. In some implementations, the user wishes to have a current media session with them as they move through the house. This requires the personal assistant service to transfer the current media session from the first delivery device to a second delivery device that is not directly connected to the first delivery device or is unaware of the existence of the first delivery device. After the media content transfer, second output device 106, which is coupled to second delivery device 108, continues to play the media content previously played by first output device 106 from the exact point in the album or video clip where the play of the media content was stopped on first output device 106, which is coupled to first delivery device 108.
In some implementations, the display assistant device includes a display screen and one or more built-in cameras (e.g., 190-4). The camera is configured to capture images and/or video and then transmit (e.g., stream) the images and/or video to the server system 140 for display on a client device (e.g., authorized client device 104 of fig. 2).
In some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190, smart home device, may also be mounted on, integrated with, and/or supported by a wall 154, floor 156, or ceiling 158 of the smart home environment 100 (which is also commonly referred to as a smart home environment given the presence of the smart home device). Integrated smart-home devices include intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected devices that can be seamlessly integrated with each other in a smart-home network (e.g., 100 in fig. 1) and/or with a central server or cloud computing system to provide a variety of useful smart-home functions. In some implementations, smart home devices are provided as delivery devices 108 and/or output devices 106 at the same location of the smart home environment 100 and, thus, are positioned near or at a known distance from delivery devices 108 and output devices 106.
In some implementations, the smart-home devices in the smart-home environment 100 include, but are not limited to, one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected camera systems 132. In some embodiments, the content captured by the camera system 132 is displayed on the electronic device 190 at the request of the user (e.g., a user instruction of "OK Google, Show the baby room monitor") and/or according to settings of the home environment 100 (e.g., settings that display the content captured by the camera system during the night or in response to detecting an intruder).
The smart-home devices in the smart-home environment 100 may include, but are not limited to, one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected thermostats 122, one or more smart, network-connected, multi-sensing hazard detectors 124, one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected entry interface devices 126 and 128 (hereinafter "smart doorbells 126" and "smart doorlocks 128"), one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected alarm systems 130, one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected camera systems 132, and one or more smart, multi-sensing, network-connected wall switches 136. In some implementations, the smart-home devices in the smart-home environment 100 of fig. 1 include a plurality of smart, multi-sensing, network-connected appliances 138 (hereinafter "smart appliances 138"), such as refrigerators, stoves, ovens, televisions, washing machines, dryers, electric lights, stereos, intercom systems, garage door openers, floor fans, ceiling fans, wall air conditioners, pool heaters, irrigation systems, security systems, space heaters, window AC units, electric plenum vents, and the like.
Smart home devices in the smart home environment 100 may additionally or alternatively include one or more other occupancy sensors (e.g., touch screens, IR sensors, ambient light sensors, and motion detectors). In some implementations, smart home devices in the smart home environment 100 include Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers (e.g., in each room 152 or portion thereof) that determine occupancy based on RFID tags located or embedded in occupants. For example, an RFID reader may be integrated into smart hazard detector 124.
In some implementations, in addition to containing sensing capabilities, devices 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 136, 138, and 190 (which are collectively referred to as "smart home devices" or "smart home devices 120") are capable of data communication and information sharing with other network-connected smart home devices, central servers, or cloud computing systems, and/or other devices (e.g., client device 104, delivery device 108, and voice-activated electronic device 190). Similarly, each delivery device 108 and voice-activated electronic device 190 can also be capable of data communication and information sharing with other delivery devices 108, voice-activated electronic devices 190, smart home devices, central server or cloud computing systems 140, and/or other devices (e.g., client devices 104) connected to the network. Data communication may be performed using any of a number of custom or standard wireless protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, Thread, Z-Wave, Bluetooth Smart, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, Miwi, etc.) and/or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols (e.g., Ethernet, HomePlug, etc.), or any other suitable communication protocol including communication protocols not developed until the date of filing of this document.
In some implementations, the delivery device 108, the electronic device 190, and the smart home device function as wireless or wired repeaters. In some implementations, a first delivery device 108 of the delivery devices 108 communicates with a second delivery device 108 of the delivery devices 108 and the smart home device 120 via a wireless router. The delivery device 108, electronic device 190, and smart-home device 120 may also communicate with each other via a connection (e.g., network interface 160) to a network, such as the internet 110. Through the internet 110, the delivery device 108, the electronic device 190, and the smart home device 120 may communicate with a server system 140 (also referred to herein as a central server system and/or a cloud computing system). Alternatively, server system 140 may be associated with a manufacturer, support entity, or service provider associated with delivery device 108 and the media content displayed to the user.
In general, any connected electronic device described herein may be configured with a range of capabilities to interact with a user in the environment. For example, an electronic device may be configured with one or more microphones, one or more speakers, and voice interaction capabilities, where a user interacts with the device display assistant device through voice input received by the microphone and audible output played back by the speakers to present information to the user. Similarly, electronic devices may be configured with buttons, switches, and/or other touch responsive sensors (such as a touch screen, touch panel, or capacitive or resistive touch sensors) to receive user input, and with haptic or other haptic feedback capabilities to provide haptic output to the user. The electronic device may also be configured with Visual output capabilities, such as a display panel and/or one or more indicator lights, to visually output information to the User, as described in U.S. patent application No.15/592,120 entitled "LED Design Language for Visual audio of Voice User Interfaces," which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, the electronic device may be configured with a motion sensor, such as a Radar transceiver or PIR detector, that can detect motion of objects and persons in the vicinity of the electronic device, as described in U.S. patent application No.15/481,289 entitled "Systems, Methods, and Devices for using Radar-Based Touch Interfaces," which is incorporated herein by reference.
The input received by any of these sensors may be processed by the electronic device and/or a server (e.g., server system 140 of fig. 1) communicatively coupled to the electronic device. In some implementations, the electronic device and/or the server process and/or prepare a response to the user input that is output by the electronic device via one or more of the output capabilities of the electronic device. In some implementations, the electronic device outputs information via one or more of the output capabilities of the electronic device, which information is not directly responsive to user input, but is transmitted to the electronic device by a second electronic device in the environment or by a server communicatively coupled to the electronic device. The information transmitted may be virtually any type that is displayable/playable by the output capabilities of the electronic device.
The server system 140 provides data processing for monitoring and facilitating data viewing events (e.g., motion, audio, security, etc.) captured from the smart device 120, such as the camera 132, the smart doorbell 126, and the display assistant device 190-4. In some implementations, server system 140 may include: a voice/display assistance server 112 that processes audio input collected by the voice-activated electronic device 190, one or more content hosts 114 that provide displayed media content, and a cloud delivery service server 116 that creates a virtual user domain based on distributed device terminals. The server system 140 also includes a device registry for maintaining records of distributed device endpoints in the virtual user environment. Examples of distributed device terminals include, but are not limited to, voice-activated electronic device 190, delivery device 108, media output device 106, and smart home device 122 and 138. In some implementations, these distributed device terminals are tied to user accounts in the virtual user domain (e.g., Google user accounts). In some implementations, each of these functions and content hosts is a different server within server system 140. In some implementations, a subset of these functions are integrated within server system 140.
In some implementations, network interface 160 includes a conventional network device (e.g., a router). The smart-home environment 100 of fig. 1 also includes a hub device 180, the hub device 180 being communicatively coupled to the network 110, either directly or through the network interface 160. The hub device 180 is further communicatively coupled to one or more of the intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected devices described above (e.g., delivery device 108, electronic device 190, smart home device, and client device 104). Each of these network-connected devices optionally communicates with the hub device 180 using one or more radio communication networks (e.g., ZigBee, Z-Wave, Insteon, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other radio communication networks) available at least in the smart-home environment 100. In some implementations, the hub device 180 and devices coupled to the hub device may be controlled and/or interacted with via an application running on a smart phone, home controller, laptop, tablet, game console, or similar electronic device. In some implementations, a user of such a controller application can view the status of a hub device or coupled network connection device, configure the hub device to interoperate with devices newly introduced to the home network, debug new devices, and adjust or view settings of connected devices, among other things.
Fig. 2 is an example operating environment 200 in which a voice-activated electronic device 190 (e.g., a display assistant device) interacts with a delivery device 108, a client device 104, or a server system 140 in a smart-home environment 100, according to some implementations. The voice-activated electronic device 190 is configured to receive audio input from an environment proximate to the voice-activated electronic device 190. Optionally, the electronic device 190 stores the audio input locally and processes the audio input at least in part. Optionally, the electronic device 190 transmits the received audio input or the partially processed audio input to the voice/display assistance server 112 via the communication network 110 for further processing. Delivery device 108 is configured to obtain media content or internet content from one or more content hosts 114 for display on output device 106 coupled to delivery device 108. As described above, delivery device 108 and voice-activated electronic device 190 are associated with each other in the user domain, and more specifically, with a user account in the user domain. Information for delivery device 108 and information for electronic device 190 are stored in device registry 118 in association with the user account.
In some implementations, delivery device 108 does not include any display screen, and voice-activated electronic device 190 includes a display assistant device having a display screen. Both delivery device 108 and display assistant device 190 must rely on client device 104 to provide a user interface during the commissioning process. In particular, the client device 104 is installed with an application that enables a user interface to facilitate commissioning a new delivery device 108 or a new display assistant device 190 disposed in proximity to the client device 104. The user may send a request on the user interface of client device 104 to initiate a commissioning process for a new delivery device 108 or display assistant device 190 that requires commissioning. After receiving the commissioning request, client device 104 establishes a short range communication link with a new delivery device 108 or display assistant device 190 that requires commissioning. Optionally, the short-range communication link is established based on Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or the like. Client device 104 then transmits wireless configuration data associated with the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) to the new delivery device 108 or display assistant device 190. The wireless configuration data includes at least a WLAN security code (i.e., a Service Set Identifier (SSID) password) and optionally an SSID, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a proxy configuration, and a gateway configuration. After receiving the wireless configuration data via the short-range communication link, the new delivery device 108 or display assistant device 190 decodes and restores the wireless configuration data and joins the WLAN based on the wireless configuration data.
Additional user domain information is entered on the user interface displayed on client device 104 and used to contact the new delivery device 108 or display assistant device 190 to an account in the user domain. Optionally, the additional user domain information is transmitted with the wireless communication data via a short-range communication link to the new delivery device 108 or the display assistant device 190. Optionally, after the new device joins the WLAN, the additional user domain information is transmitted over the WLAN to the new delivery device 108 or display assistant device 190.
Once delivery device 108 and display assistant device 190 have been commissioned into the user domain, delivery device 108, output device 106, and their associated media playback activities may be controlled by two control paths (control path a and control path B). According to control path a, a delivery device application or one or more media playback applications installed on client device 104 are used to control delivery device 108 and its associated media playback activities. Alternatively, display assistant device 190 is used to enable hands-free and hands-free control of delivery device 108 and its associated media playing activities (e.g., playback of media content play on output device 106) according to control path B.
In some implementations, delivery device 108 and display assistant device 190 are two distinct and distinct devices configured to act as a delivery receiver device and a delivery transmitter device, respectively. Display assistant device 190 may provide information or content (either generated locally or received from another source) for projection onto output device 106 through delivery device 108. Alternatively, in some implementations, delivery device 108 and display assistant device 190 are incorporated in an integrated delivery device coupled to output device 106.
In some cases, the smart-home environment 100 includes one or more smart-home devices 220 (e.g., the thermostat 122, the hazard detector 124, the doorbell 126, the door lock 128, the alarm system 130, the camera system 132, the wall switch 136, and the smart appliance 138 of fig. 1). Regardless of whether the smart-home device 220 has a display screen, it may rely on the client device 104 during commissioning to provide a user interface. In particular, the client device 104 is installed with a smart device application that enables a user interface to facilitate commissioning of the new smart home device 120. Like the new delivery device 108 or the display assistant device 190, the new smart-home device 120 may establish a short-range communication link with the client device 104 and communicate wireless configuration data to the new smart-home device 120 over the short-range communication link, allowing the smart-home device 120 to join the WLAN based on the wireless configuration data. In addition, smart-home device 120 optionally contacts an account of the user domain that delivery device 108 and display assistant device 190 also contact. Once the smart-home device 120 and the display assistant device 190 have been commissioned into the user domain, the smart-home device 120 can be monitored and controlled via the display assistant device 190 according to the control path C as the delivery device 108 is controlled via the display assistant device 190 according to the control path B. For example, voice commands may be entered into the display assistant device 190 to view a recording of the outdoor camera 132 installed near the door and to control the door lock 128 based on security events detected in the recording.
Referring to fig. 2, after delivery device 108 and voice-activated electronic device 190 are both commissioned and contacted to a common user domain, voice-activated electronic device 190 may serve as a voice user interface to enable hands-free and hands-free control of media content being streamed to delivery device 108 without involving remote control, client device 104, or other second screen device. For example, the user may give a voice command, such as "Play Lady Gaga on Living Room speakers". The Lady Gaga music tracks or video clips will be streamed to delivery devices 108 associated with "Living Room sprinklers". Neither client device 104 nor any delivery device application or media playing application loaded on client device 104.
In accordance with the voice designation of the media output device, the cloud delivery service server 116 associates with the electronic device 190 and couples to the delivery device of the media output device 106 in the user domain in the device registry 118. Delivery device 108 is configured to execute one or more media playback applications to control media output devices 106 to play media content received from one or more media content hosts 114. Cloud delivery service server 116 then sends a second media play request to delivery device 108 that includes information for the first media play application and the media content that needs to be played. Upon receiving the information sent by cloud delivery service server 116, delivery device 108 executes the first media playback application and controls media output device 106 to play the requested media content.
In some implementations, the user voice designation of the media output device 106 includes a description of the destination media output device. The cloud delivery service server 116 identifies a destination media output device of the plurality of media output devices in the registry according to the description of the destination media output device. In some implementations, the description of the destination media output device includes at least a brand ("Samsung TV") or a location of the media output device 106 ("my Living Room TV").
In some implementations, the smart-home environment 100 includes a plurality of delivery devices 108, a plurality of output devices 106, and one or more voice-activated electronic devices 190. Delivery device 108 is communicatively coupled to cloud delivery service server 116 and content host 114, while each two of them are optionally located in the same location (e.g., living room) or two different locations (e.g., two rooms) in smart home environment 100. Each delivery device 108 is configured to retrieve media or internet content from a media host 114 for display on an output device 106 coupled to the respective delivery device 108. One or more voice-activated electronic devices 190 are communicatively coupled to cloud delivery service server 116 and voice/display assistance server 112. The one or more voice-activated electronic devices 190 include at least one display assistant device. In some implementations, voice-activated electronic device 190 is provided independently of delivery device 108 and output device 106. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, electronic device 190-4 is disposed in a room where delivery device 108 or output device 106 is not located. In some implementations, electronic device 190-1 is disposed near delivery device 108-1 and output device 106-1, and thus electronic device 190-1, delivery device 108-1, and output device 106-1 are located in the same room.
Referring to FIG. 1, while playing media content on a first output device 106-1, a user may send a voice command to any electronic device 190 (e.g., 190-1, 190-2, 190-3, and 190-4 in FIG. 1) to request that playback of the media content be transferred to a second output device 106-2. The voice command includes a media play transfer request. The voice command is transmitted to cloud delivery service server 116. Cloud delivery service server 116 sends a media display information request to first delivery device 108-1 to request instant media play information for media content currently playing on first output device 106-1 coupled to first delivery device 108-1. First delivery device 108-1 then returns the requested instant play information to cloud delivery service server 116, which includes at least information for the first media playing application (e.g., YouTube), the media content currently being played (e.g., "Lady Gaga-National antem-Super Bowl 2016") and the time location associated with the playing of the media content. Second delivery device 108-2 then receives the media display request including the instant play information from cloud delivery service server 116 and, in accordance with the instant play information, executes a first media play application that controls second output device 106-2 to play the media content from the temporal location.
Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example display assistant device 300 that serves as a voice interface to collect user voice commands in the smart-home environment 100, according to some implementations. The display assistant device 300 generally includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 302, one or more network interfaces 304, memory 306, and one or more communication buses 308 for interconnecting these components, sometimes referred to as a chipset. The display assistant device 300 includes one or more output devices 312, including one or more speakers 352, a display 354, and one or more indicators 356. The display assistant device 300 also includes one or more input devices 310 that facilitate user input, including one or more microphones 342, a volume control 344, and a privacy control 346. Volume control 344 is configured to receive a user operation (e.g., pressing a volume up button or a volume down button, pressing volume up and down buttons simultaneously for a duration) that controls the volume level of speaker 352 or resets display assistant device 300. The privacy control 346 is configured to receive user operations (e.g., whether to deactivate the microphone 342) that control privacy settings of the display assistant device. The one or more indicators 356 are configured to indicate at least whether the microphone 342 is deactivated (e.g., muted). In some implementations, the input device 310 of the display assistant device 300 includes a touch detection module 348 integrated on the display panel 354 and configured to detect touch inputs on a surface thereof. In some implementations, the input device 310 of the display assistant device 300 includes a camera module 350 configured to capture a video stream of a field of view. Alternatively, in some implementations, the input device 310 of the display assistant device 300 does not include any camera or touch detection module because they are relatively expensive and can detract from the goal of providing the display assistant device 300 as a low-cost user interface solution.
In some implementations, the display assistant device 300 also includes a presence sensor 360 configured to detect the presence of a user in a predetermined area around the display assistant device 300. In some cases, the display assistant device 300 operates in a sleep or hibernate mode in which detection and processing of audio input is disabled and the ambient environment is not woken up or listened to from the sleep or hibernate mode (i.e., audio signals collected from the ambient environment are processed) until the presence sensor 360 detects the presence of a user in a predetermined area. An example of a presence sensor 360 is an ultrasonic sensor configured to detect the presence of a user.
In some implementations, the display assistant device 300 also includes an ambient light sensor 370 (e.g., a white ambient light sensor, an RGB color sensor). The ambient light sensor 370 is configured to detect lighting conditions in the smart home environment 100 where the display assistant device 300 is located. In some implementations, the display assistant device 300 is configured to adjust the brightness level and/or the hue of its screen according to lighting conditions. The ambient light sensor 370 is disposed behind a bezel area of the screen of the display assistant device 300 and is exposed to light via a transparent portion of the bezel area.

In some implementations, the input/output control module 320 also includes an image processing module (not shown) configured to process image data captured by the camera module 350. Specifically, in an example, the image processing module is configured to analyze image data captured by the camera module 350 and associate biometric features (e.g., faces, speech, and gestures) identified from the image data with known or unknown users. The user profile may be selected based on the biometric features to adaptively control the display assistant device 300 itself, the delivery device 106, or the smart home device.
Each of the elements identified above may be stored in one or more of the aforementioned memory devices and correspond to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above-identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, modules, or data structures, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various implementations.

Further, memory 406 may optionally store additional modules and data structures not described above.
Fig. 5A-5F are perspective, front, back, side, top, and bottom views, respectively, of a display assistant device 500 according to some implementations. The display assistant device 500 includes a base 502 and a screen 504. The base 502 is configured to sit on a surface (e.g., substantially flat in some cases). The screen 504 has a rear surface 506 where the screen 504 is supported by the base. In some implementations, the base and screen are coupled to each other by a plurality of fasteners (e.g., 1210 in fig. 12) and cannot be separated from each other by manual manipulation by a human without the use of tools. The bottom edge 508 of the screen 504 is configured to be held at a predefined height h above the surface. Referring to fig. 5B, the base 502 is substantially concealed behind the screen 504 from a front view of the display assistant device 500. That is, the predefined height h is less than a predetermined threshold (e.g., 15mm) such that the screen 504 appears to float in the air and the base 502 may be substantially concealed behind the screen 504 from the front view of the display assistant device. In an example, the predetermined threshold is 10% of the width w of the screen 504. If the screen 504 is a seven inch screen with a width of 5 inches, the bottom edge 508 of the screen 504 is held at a height of 12.7 millimeters or less above the surface.
Referring to fig. 5D, in some implementations, the base 502 extends along a central axis 510, and the central axis 510 of the base 502 is not perpendicular to a surface when the base 502 is seated on the surface (here, substantially flat). Optionally. The base 502 has a front side 502A and a back side 502B, both of which are parallel to a central axis 510. When the base is seated on a surface, the central axis 510, the front side 502A, and the back side 502B of the base 502 are tilted forward by a base angle α. Note that the front side 502A of the base is shorter than the back side 502B of the base, e.g., the height of the front side 502A is only 20% of the height of the back side 502B. When the screen 504 is supported by the base 502 at its rear surface 506, the screen 504 is not perpendicular to the surface, but rather faces generally forward and is tilted slightly rearward by a screen angle β to provide a desired viewing angle for an average user. In an example, the base angle α and the screen angle β are both equal to 15 degrees, except that the base angle α, at which the base is tilted forward 15 degrees, and the screen angle β, at which the screen is tilted backward 15 degrees. In these ways, the display assistant device 500 is less likely to tip over (forward or backward) when a blunt force F strikes a top edge of the display assistant device 500 or the screen 202 of the display assistant device 500 is touched by a user.
The base 502 serves as a speaker box (i.e., an enclosure for one or more speakers). The rear speaker (e.g., 616 in fig. 6A and 6B) is hidden inside the base 502 and is configured to project sound substantially toward the rear view of the display assistant device, i.e., substantially out of the base 502 via the rear side 502B of the base 502. The rear speakers are oriented to project audio toward the rear side 502B of the base 502. In some implementations, the base 502 further conceals one or more front speakers (e.g., 620 in fig. 6A and 6B). Each front speaker faces the front side of the display assistant device 500 (i.e., is oriented to project audio toward the front side 502A) and is configured to project sound out of the base 502 substantially via the front side 502A of the base 502. That is, each front speaker projects sound through a space of predefined height h that separates the bottom edge 508 of the screen 504 and the surface on which the display assistant device 500 is configured to sit. Further, in some implementations, the rear speakers include woofers configured to produce first audio frequencies in a first frequency range, and each of the one or more front speakers includes tweeters configured to produce second audio frequencies in a second frequency range. The second audio frequency of the front speakers is higher than the first audio frequency of the rear speakers.
That is, in the example, the rear speakers and the front speakers form an integrated 2.1 speaker system that provides a stereo effect and high quality indoor sound enjoyment. A given stereo component may steer low frequencies (e.g., <100Hz) to a dedicated subwoofer (i.e., the rear speaker) rather than to both front speakers along with all other frequencies. Alternatively, the integrated 2.1 speaker system does not need to obtain anything from the recording other than the left and right two audio tracks. The integrated 2.1 speaker system may allow for reduced pressure and reduced size of the front speaker for compensating for poor acoustic effects in the room, such that strong mid-to-mid bass variations have little or no rumble as expected.
Referring to fig. 5B, the display assistant device 500 has a very narrow bezel area surrounding the active display area of the screen 504. The bezel area is optionally white and the bezel width is less than a threshold width (e.g., a fixed value of 5 millimeters or% 5 of the screen width w). In some implementations, the active display area has a plurality of rounded corners. Rounded corners are formed when a white paint is applied on the back surface of the cover glass (e.g., 902 in fig. 9A and 9B) to define the active display area. In some implementations, the array of display pixels visible through the transparent portion of the cover glass is also round, i.e., a subset of the display pixels outside the rounded corners are not driven to display any color and brightness information that varies over time.
In some implementations, the bezel area includes a subset of one or more microphone apertures 512, indicator window 514, camera window 520, and sensor window 516. One or more microphones 342 may be placed behind the microphone aperture 512 and configured to collect sound from the surrounding environment of the display assistant device 500. An indicator may be disposed behind the indicator window 514 and configured to provide a sequential illumination pattern to indicate whether the display assistant device 500 is active or inactive, whether the display assistant device 500 is in a muted and/or speech processing state (e.g., hotword detection, listening, thinking, and speaking). The camera module 350 may be disposed behind the camera window 520 to capture a video stream of the field of view. The ambient light sensor 370 may be disposed behind the sensor window 516 and configured to detect lighting conditions in the smart-home environment 100 in which the display assistant device 500 is located. Further details regarding these input and output devices are explained below with reference to fig. 9A and 9B.
Referring to fig. 5C, the display assistant device 500 further includes a volume control 344, a privacy control 346, and a power adapter interface 518. In this example, the volume control button 344 and the privacy control 346 are disposed on the rear surface 506 of the screen 504, and the power adapter interface 518 is disposed on the rear side 502B of the base 502. Volume control 344 includes a mechanical component (e.g., a button, knob, switch) configured to receive user input to adjust the volume level of a speaker in display assistant device 500. In an example, the volume control 344 includes two buttons (separate or connected) configured to initiate an increase or decrease, respectively, in the volume level of the speaker. In some implementations, two buttons of the volume control 344 may be pressed simultaneously to reset the display assistant device 500 regardless of the control of the volume level of the speaker. Note that the volume control 344 is not disposed on any edge of the screen 504 of the display assistant device 500. Instead, volume control 344 is disposed on rear surface 506 of screen 504 at a predefined distance from a short edge of screen 504, such that volume control 344 is readily accessible to a user's finger when the user grasps display assistant device 500 by the short edge of screen 504.
Further, privacy controls 346 disposed on rear surface 506 are configured to provide privacy protection to a user of display assistant device 500. For example, the privacy control 346 may mute one or more microphones 342 of the display assistant device 500, disable a camera if present in the display assistant device 500, disconnect the display assistant device 500 from the internet while keeping the display assistant device coupled in a local area network, and/or disconnect the display assistant device from all communication networks available to the display assistant device 500. The type of privacy protection enabled by the privacy control 346 may vary depending on the identity of the person associated with the display assistant device 500 and/or the time of a particular moment. In some implementations, when privacy control 346 is opened for privacy protection, it dynamically activates one privacy operation of a set of privacy operation groups based on a user profile that is recognized in real-time as a user associated with display assistant device 500 (e.g., a person whose image or voice is captured and recognized by display assistant device 500). Specifically, in the example, the display assistant device 500 has an owner mode, a family mode, and a stranger mode that are each associated with a unique subset of the set of privacy operations, and the user profile is associated with one of the three modes. Further, in some cases, the privacy operations of the set of privacy operations associated with the display assistant device vary according to a time of day according to a user profile of the user. The display assistant device 500 may also use a camera or microphone to collect user information (e.g., facial features, voice fingerprints, and gestures) and use the user information to identify the user associated with the display assistant device 500 in real-time and retrieve the user profile of the user for purposes of setting the type of privacy protection that may be enabled by the privacy controls 346. For more details on the privacy controls, reference will be made to PCT patent application No. PCT/US18/064449 entitled "Display Assistant Device", filed 2018, 12, month 7, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
In these implementations, the power adapter interface 518 of the display assistant device 500 is disposed on the back side 502B of the base 502. The power adapter interface 518 includes a female connector that receives a male connector configured to connect the display assistant device 500 to an external power source (e.g., a direct current power source). In some implementations, the display assistant device 500 must be constantly connected to an external power source and turned off when the external power source is disconnected. Alternatively, in some implementations, the power strip is coupled to the power adapter interface 518 and includes rechargeable batteries. The rechargeable battery is configured to be charged with an external power source and temporarily drive the display assistant apparatus 500 when the external power source is disconnected from the display assistant apparatus 500.
The bottom surface of the base 502 constitutes the footprint of the display assistant device 500. The length of the bottom surface of the base 502 is less than (e.g., 75% of) the length of the screen 504, and the width of the bottom surface of the base 502 is significantly less than (e.g., < 40% of) the width w of the screen 504. As a result, the footprint of the display assistant device 500 is very small, and thus the display assistant device 500 may be suitable for different physical settings (e.g., kitchen, living room, and bedroom) in the smart-home environment 100. Note that fig. 5A-5F focus on showing the overall appearance and mechanical features of the assistant device 500. Further details showing the functionality of the assistant device 500 are described above with reference to fig. 1-4.
Fig. 6A and 6B are two exploded views of a display assistant device 500 from a front perspective view and a back perspective view, respectively, according to some implementations. The display assistant device 500 includes a base 502 and a screen 504. The screen 504 of the display assistant device 500 includes a display front 602, a middle frame 604, and a back cover 606. The display front 602 is coupled to a display module configured to provide a backlight and to drive individual display pixels of the display front 602. The display front 602 and the middle frame 604 are mechanically coupled to each other using an adhesive, which is optionally applied near the edges of the display front 602 and the middle frame 604. In some implementations, the front surface of the display front 602 has (1) a display active area for presenting information and content, and (2) a touch sensing area that is sensitive to touch events. The touch sensing area surrounds the display active area and extends beyond the display active area around an edge of the display active area.
In some implementations, a heat sink may be placed between and in contact with the display front 602 and the middle frame 604 to redistribute heat generated by the display panel of the display front 602. The display front 602 has a back surface made of a conductive material (e.g., a metal plate), and when the heat sink is in contact with a portion (e.g., half) of the back surface of the display front 602, the heat sink redistributes heat uniformly thereon and over a portion of the back surface of the display front 602, thereby avoiding the formation of hot spots on the display front 602. In an example, the heat spreader includes a graphite sheet.
The base 502 of the display assistant device 500 includes a housing 608, a speaker assembly 610, and a base mounting plate 612. The housing 608 encloses a speaker assembly 610 and includes a plurality of speaker grill sections 614 that allow sound generated by the speaker assembly 610 to exit the housing 608 of the base 502. Referring to fig. 6B, the speaker assembly 610 includes at least a rear speaker 616 mounted in an enclosure 618. The rear speaker 616 includes a speaker opening exposed from the enclosure 618 and faces the rear side 502B of the base 502. The enclosure 618 provides a sealed enclosure for the rear of the rear speakers 616 near the front side 502A of the base 502. The speaker opening of the rear speaker 616 faces rearward while being inclined at an inclination angle (e.g., angle λ in fig. 8A)1) Angled upward such that the rear speakers 616 are configured to project a majority of the sound generated by the rear speakers 616 rearward to exit the housing 608 of the display assistant device 500 through the rear side 502B of the base 502.
Referring to fig. 6A, in some implementations, the speaker assembly 610 is embedded in one or more front speakers 620 in the enclosure 618. Optionally, each of the one or more front speakers 620 is separately packaged and has its separate sealed enclosure integrated in the enclosure 618. Optionally, the enclosure 618 includes different sub-structures configured to provide a respective sealed enclosure for each of the one or more front speakers 620. Each front speaker 620Facing a space of predefined height h configured to separate the bottom edge 508 of the screen 504 from the surface on which the display assistant device 500 sits. In some implementations, the respective speaker opening of each front speaker 620 has a dimension that is significantly larger than the predefined height h of the space, and is at an oblique angle (e.g., angle λ in fig. 8B)2) Faces forward while tilting downward such that the respective front speakers 620 are configured to project a majority of the sound generated by the respective front speakers 620 forward and toward the space between the bottom edges of the screen 504, thereby allowing the generated sound to exit the housing 608 of the display assistant device 500 via the front side 502A of the base 502. Optionally, in some implementations, the size of the respective speaker opening of each front speaker 620 is commensurate with the predefined height h of the space, i.e., the projection of the size to the predefined height h is substantially equal to the predefined height h (fig. 8B).
In some implementations, the enclosure 618 is configured to direct a portion of the sound generated by the front speakers 620 and the rear speakers 616 further toward different areas of the housing 608. Specifically, for example, the plurality of speaker grill portions 614 of the housing 608 are distributed at least on the front, rear, left, and right sides of the housing, and thus, sound generated by the speakers 616 and 620 is directed within the housing by the enclosure 618 to exit the housing 608 from the front, rear, left, and right sides of the housing 608.
The enclosure 618 of the rear speaker 616 includes an upper portion 618A and a base portion 618B. The rear speaker 616 is mounted in the base portion 618B, and the speaker opening of the rear speaker 616 is exposed on the rear surface of the base portion 618B. The upper and base portions 618A and 618B together provide a sealed enclosure for the rear of the rear speaker 616. The upper portion 618A is conductive. The one or more electronic components 632 are coupled to the upper portion 618A such that the upper portion 618A at least partially provides electromagnetic shielding for the one or more electronic components while forming a portion of the sealed enclosure of the rear speaker 616. In some implementations, the one or more electronic components 632 are also thermally coupled to the upper portion 618A, which acts as a heat sink, to absorb heat generated by the one or more electronic components and dissipate the generated heat from the electronic components 632. In some implementations, one or more electronic components 632 are mounted on the back surface of the main logic board 622. A conductive plane disposed in the substrate of the main logic board 622 is grounded to provide electromagnetic shielding for the electronic components 632, along with the upper portion 618A. Further details of the multi-function Speaker Enclosure 618 are described in PCT international patent application No. PCT/US19/28959 entitled "multi-function Speaker Enclosure in a Display Assistant Device" filed on fig. 10 and 2019, 24/8 of the present application, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
In some implementations, the housing 608 is covered by fabric and the plurality of speaker grill sections 614 are hidden behind the fabric. In other words, the plurality of speaker grill sections 614 are not visible to a user of the display assistant device 500 from an appearance. Optionally, the fabric is secured to the housing 608 by heat activating an adhesive applied to selective areas to prevent the fabric from moving during speaker operation and also not to obscure sound output. In some implementations, the fabric may be tensioned over the housing and held in place by mechanical clamping. The fabric is cut at the power adapter interface 518 and wrapped around the circular edge of the power adapter interface 518.
In some implementations, the base 502 also includes a power strip that is also contained within the housing 608. In some embodiments, the power strip is embedded in the rear of the enclosure 618 and aligned with the power adapter interface 518 when the enclosure 618 is assembled into the base 502. The power board is electrically coupled to a power adapter interface 518 exposed on the back side 502B of the base 502 to obtain external power, while it is also electrically coupled to the main logic board 622 of the display assistant device 500 through a flexible Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or an interconnect cable (e.g., 1202 in fig. 12). By these means, the power board is configured to drive the main logic board 622 of the display assistant device 500 with an external power source.
The front side 502A of the housing 608 is shorter than the back side 502B of the housing 608, e.g., the height of the front side 502A is only 20% of the height of the back side 502B, such that the housing 608 has a sloped opening 624 on the top thereof. Angled opening 624 is mechanically coupled to rear surface 506 of screen 504. The back cover 606 has a back opening 626 and the angled opening 624 of the base 502 aligns with the back opening 626 of the back cover 606 to allow interconnection to connect electronic components (e.g., a display module) mounted in the screen 504 to the main logic board 622. When the screen 504 and the base 502 are mechanically coupled, a central portion of the back surface 506 of the screen 504 is covered by the base 502. Optionally, the central portion of the rear surface 506 covered by the base 502 occupies 50-70% of the entire area of the rear surface 506. In some implementations, to assemble the rear cover 606 to the base 502, each edge of the rear opening 626 of the rear cover 606 is fastened to the inner surface of the housing 608 by one or more fasteners (e.g., screws). For example, the top and bottom edges of the rear opening 626 of the rear cover 606 are secured to the interior rear and front surfaces of the housing 608, respectively.
The base mounting plate 612 is made of a flexible material and is mechanically coupled to the body of the base 502 (e.g., the bottom of the speaker assembly 610) via at least one edge of the base mounting plate 612 (e.g., around the peripheral edge of the base mounting plate 612). In some implementations, the edge of the base mounting plate 612 includes a raised portion configured to wrap around the edge of the body of the base 502 to which the base mounting plate 612 is attached. The edge of the body of the base 502 optionally has a retaining structure to couple to a raised portion of the base mounting plate 612 to facilitate retention of the edge of the base mounting plate 612 on the body of the base 502. In some implementations, the base mounting plate 612 is made of a non-slip material (e.g., silicone) and has a bottom surface that has a predefined coefficient of friction with a surface on which the display assistant device 500 is configured to sit. The predefined coefficient of friction is greater than the threshold coefficient of friction such that the base 502 may sit tightly on a surface. Optionally, the bottom surface of the base mounting plate 612 has a generally concave shape that is slightly concave toward the body of the base 502.
Further, in some implementations, the base mounting plate 612 also includes a top surface opposite the bottom surface. Fig. 7A illustrates a top surface of a base mounting plate 612 and a bottom surface of a body of a base 502 mated to each other according to some implementations. The top surface of the base mounting plate 612 includes a plurality of bolt fasteners 702 configured to mate with a plurality of receiving fasteners 704 on a bottom surface of the body of the base 502 (e.g., a bottom surface of the enclosure 618). The plurality of receiving fasteners 704 includes at least a reference receiving fastener 704R. The reference bolt fastener 702R has a shape that is substantially complementary to the shape of the reference receiving fastener 704R, except that the size of the reference bolt fastener 702R is slightly larger than the size of the reference receiving fastener 704R, so that the reference bolt fastener 702R can be substantially tightly seated, i.e., pressed into, the corresponding reference receiving fastener 704R. Optionally, in addition to the reference-receiving fastener 704R, the plurality of receiving fasteners 704 include one or more adjustable receiving fasteners 704A. For example, each adjustable receiving fastener 704A includes a recessed fastener having an extended length. The width of the corresponding bolt fastener 702A is slightly greater than the width of the recess fastener, but the length is substantially less than the length of the recess fastener, such that the corresponding bolt fastener 702A can fit tightly into the recess structure at the width of the recess fastener while sliding along the extended width of the recess fastener. In some implementations, all of the plurality of bolt fasteners 702 are the same, and the reference-receiving fastener 704R has a shape that is different from the shape of the one or more adjustable-receiving fasteners 704A.
Specifically, in the example, the base mounting plate 612 has an elliptical or oblong shape with a major axis and a minor axis. Four bolt fasteners 702 are disposed adjacent to the edge of the base mounting plate 612. Two of the bolt fasteners 702 are placed on the major axis and two of the bolt fasteners 702 are placed on the minor axis. Each bolt fastener 702 has a hexagonal shape. One of the four corresponding receiving fasteners 704R is a round hole at the bottom surface of the body of the base 502 that is slightly smaller than the hexagonal shape of the bolt fastener 702 to allow the bolt fastener 702 to be tightly pressed into the round hole. Each of the other three corresponding receiving fasteners 704A includes a recessed fastener at the bottom surface of the body of the base 502 and which is slightly narrower than the hexagonal shape of the bolt fastener 702 to allow the bolt fastener to be tightly pressed into the recessed fastener while being able to move within the recess.
It should also be noted that in some implementations, the locations of the bolt fasteners 702 and receiving fasteners 704 may be interchanged, i.e., the top surface of the base mounting plate 612 includes a plurality of receiving fasteners 704 configured to mate with a plurality of bolt fasteners 702 on the bottom surface of the body of the base 502. Alternatively, in some implementations, the base mounting plate 612 is coupled to the body of the base 502 using an adhesive.
Fig. 7B illustrates another top surface of the base mounting plate 612 and another bottom surface of the body of the base 502 mated to each other according to some implementations. The top surface of the base mounting plate 612 includes a plurality of bolt fasteners 722, the bolt fasteners 722 configured to mate with a plurality of receiving fasteners 724 on a bottom surface of the body of the base 502 (e.g., a bottom surface of the enclosure 618). In the example, six bolt fasteners 722 are disposed adjacent to an edge of the base mounting plate 612. A pair of bolt fasteners 722 are placed on each of the first, intermediate and second ends of the long axis. Each bolt fastener 722 has a hexagonal shape, optionally with a hollow center, and each receiving fastener 724 includes a circular hole at the bottom surface of the body of the base 502. The round hole is configured to receive a corresponding bolt fastener 724, and the size of the round hole is slightly smaller than the size of the hexagonal shape of the bolt fastener 722 to allow the bolt fastener 722 to seat tightly into the round hole (i.e., press into the round hole).
The plurality of bolt fasteners 722 includes a reference bolt fastener 722R. The datum receiving fastener 724R has a shape that is substantially complementary to the shape of the datum bolt fastener 722R, except that the datum bolt fastener 722R is sized slightly larger than the datum receiving fastener 724R so that the datum bolt fastener 722R may be substantially snugly seated into the corresponding datum receiving fastener 724R. Optionally, the plurality of bolt fasteners 722 include one or more adjustable bolt fasteners 722A in addition to the reference bolt fasteners 722R. The receiving fasteners 724A have a shape that is substantially complementary to the shape of each adjustable bolt fastener 722A, and the respective adjustable bolt fastener 722A is configured to seat substantially snugly into the corresponding receiving fastener 724A. In some implementations, all of the plurality of receiving fasteners 724 are identical, and example shapes of the receiving fasteners 724 are circular or rectangular. Each bolt fastener 722 includes a hexagonal protrusion. Each adjustable bolt fastener 722A has two more semicircular cutouts than the reference bolt fastener 722R. Two semi-circular cutouts 728 are recessed on the top surface of the base mounting plate 612 and surround the hexagonal protrusions. The two semicircular cutouts are configured to facilitate a smaller twist and/or displacement (e.g., 5 degrees of twist, 0.2-0.3mm of displacement) of the respective adjustable bolt fastener 722R during the process of tightly seating the respective adjustable bolt fastener 722A into the respective receiving fastener 724A.
Each bolt fastener (702 and 722) and receiving fastener (704 and 724) are made of a respective compliant material such that both fasteners of a pair of mating bolt fasteners and receiving fasteners can be deformed to fit tightly into each other. In some implementations, the bolt fasteners 722 are not solid, i.e., hollow (fig. 7B), allowing the bolt fasteners 722 to more easily deform to seat into their corresponding receiving fasteners 724.
It should also be noted that in some implementations, the locations of the bolt fasteners 722 and the receiving fasteners 724 may be interchanged, i.e., the top surface of the base mounting plate 612 includes a plurality of receiving fasteners 724 configured to mate with a plurality of bolt fasteners 722 on the bottom surface of the body of the base 502. In general, the plurality of bolt fasteners 702 or 722 includes: a first bolt 702R or 722R configured to mate with a first receiving fastener 704R or 724R having a first tolerance; and a second bolt 702A or 722A configured to mate with a second receiving fastener 704A or 724A having a second tolerance. The first tolerance is less than the threshold tolerance and the second tolerance is greater than the first tolerance. That is, when the base mounting plate 612 is assembled to the body of the base 502, the first bolt 702R or 722R is snapped onto the first receiving fastener 704R or 724R before the second bolt 702A or 722A is snapped onto the second receiving fastener 704A or 724A with adjustment of the position of the second bolt 702A or 722A within the second tolerance.
Referring to fig. 7B, in some implementations, the bottom surface of the body of the base 502 includes a data port 726 (e.g., a micro universal serial bus (micro USB) connector) configured to exchange data with an external computing device via a cable plugged onto the data port 726. The data port 726 is accessible when the base mounting plate 612 is detached from the base 502. In many cases, the engineer uses the data port 726 internally to load programs into the display assistant device 500, diagnose any faults, monitor the performance of the device 500, and so forth.
Referring to fig. 6A and 6B, the display assistant device 500 includes a plurality of microphones 342 (e.g., four microphones). For example, two first microphones 342A are placed behind two microphone apertures 512 that open on the cover glass 902 and are configured to collect first audio signals from the surroundings of the display assistant device 500. Further, in some implementations, the second microphone 342B is disposed inside the housing 608 and proximate the front side 502A of the base 502, e.g., between the two front speakers 620. The second microphone 342B is configured to collect a second audio signal that enters the housing 608 via the speaker grill portion on the front side 502A of the base 502. In some implementations, the third microphone 342C is disposed within the housing 608 and proximate the back side 502B of the base 502, e.g., adjacent the power adapter interface 518. The third microphone 342C is configured to collect a third audio signal that enters the housing 608 via the speaker grill portion on the back side 502B of the base 502.
In some implementations, the first audio signal is used to detect human speech including one or more predefined hotwords, while the second and/or third microphones 342 enable one or more adaptive sound features (e.g., including monitoring background sound in the ambient environment that is used for sound equalization). For example, the second and third audio signals collected by the second and third microphones 342 are used to automatically equalize the sound projected by the front and rear speakers 620 and 616 of the display assistant device 500. Specifically, the second and third microphones 342 are covered by fabric wrapped around the housing 608 of the base 502 and are not visible to the user. The second and third audio signals collected from the second and third microphones 342 are used to determine the ambient noise and the phase difference between them. The phase difference may be used to identify an equalization setting that matches the environment in which the display assistant device 500 is located. Optionally, the determined ambient noise and phase difference are used to determine an equalization setting for the front speaker or the rear speaker based on a look-up table or machine learning.
Fig. 8A and 8B are two cross-sectional views of the display assistant device 500 taken at the rear speaker 616 and the front speaker 620, respectively, according to some implementations. The display assistant device 500 includes a speaker assembly 610, and the speaker assembly 610 further includes a rear speaker 616 and one or more front speakers 620. The enclosure 618 provides a sealed structure for the rear of the rear speakers 616, while the speaker openings of the rear speakers 616 are exposed from the rear surface of the enclosure 618. In other words, the enclosure 618 directly prevents sound waves projected into the rear of the rear speaker 616 by the diaphragm of the open speaker driver of the rear speaker 616 from interacting with (i.e., interfering with) sound waves projected into the speaker opening of the rear speaker 616. The speaker opening of the rear speaker 616 faces rearward and optionally at an inclination angle λ1Is inclined upwards.
The enclosure 618 optionally provides a sealed structure for the rear of each front speaker 620, with the speaker opening of the respective front speaker 620 exposed from the front surface of the enclosure 618. That is, a portion of the enclosure 618 directly prevents sound waves projected by the diaphragm of the open speaker driver of the front speaker 620 into the rear of the front speaker 620 from interacting with (i.e., interfering with) sound waves projected toward the speaker opening of the front speaker 620.
Alternatively, in some implementations, each front speaker 620 may not rely on the enclosure 618 to provide a sealed structure. Rather, the front speaker 620 is separately packaged and mechanically integrated into the enclosure 618, and the enclosure 618 provides mechanical support to the front speaker 620 without controlling the sound waves projected by the front speaker 620.In some implementations, the speaker opening of each front speaker 620 has a size that is substantially larger than or matches a predefined height h of a space separating the bottom edge of the screen 504 from a surface on which the display assistant device 500 is configured to sit. The speaker opening of each front speaker 620 faces forward and is optionally at an angle of inclination λ2And is inclined downwards. In some implementations, the tilt angle λ1And λ2Are equal. Further, in some implementations, the tilt angle λ1And λ2Equal to the base angle alpha and the screen angle beta (e.g., equal to 15 degrees).
The rear speakers 616 are oriented to face the rear side of the base and are configured to project sound substantially toward the rear view of the display assistant device 500, i.e., project most of the sound generated by the rear speakers 616 out of the base 502 through the rear sides 502B thereof. Instead, each front speaker 620 (if any) is oriented to face the front side of the base and is configured to project sound substantially toward the front view of the display assistant device 500, i.e., a substantial portion of the sound generated by the speaker is projected toward the space between the bottom edge of the screen 504 and the surface. The housing 608 of the base 502 includes a plurality of speaker grill portions disposed on one or more of the front side 502A, the back side 502B, the left side, and the right side of the base 502. In some implementations, a substantial portion (e.g., 80% or more) of the sound generated by the front speakers 620 or the rear speakers 616 exits the base 502 via the speaker grill portions on the front side 502A or the rear side 502B, respectively, of the base 502. The remainder of the sound generated by the front/rear speakers is directed within the enclosure 608 to exit the base 502 through a subset of the speaker grill portions disposed on one or more of the rear/front, left and right sides of the base 502.
The speaker assembly 610 is disposed in a lower portion of the base 502 to lower a center of mass of the entire display assistant device 500, for example, below a predetermined portion (e.g., one-third) of the height of the display assistant device 500. In some implementations, to reduce the center of mass, the speaker assembly 610 having a greater weight is selected instead of the speaker assembly having a lesser weight when the cost or speaker cabinet volume of the speaker assembly 610 is comparable. For example, the volume of the rear speaker 616 is 120cc, and a ferrite-based speaker is selected instead of a neodymium-based speaker due to its weight advantage. Given the center of mass and center of gravity of the display assistant device 500, the display assistant device 500 does not easily tip over (forward or backward) when a blunt force F strikes the top edge of the display assistant device 500 or the screen 504 of the display assistant device 500 is touched by a user. For example, the center of mass is configured such that the display assistant device 500 can withstand an impact force of 50 newtons without tipping over.
In some implementations not shown in fig. 8A and 8B, the enclosure 618 includes two shoulders, each recessed and separated from the housing 608 by a respective sound space, and sound projected from the rear speakers 616 is configured to be directed through the sound spaces to exit the base 502 (not shown in fig. 8A and 8B) from one or both of the speaker grill portions located on the left and right sides of the housing 608. In some implementations, the two shoulders of the enclosure 618 have different shapes, such as a hyperbolic shape and a parabolic shape, respectively. In some implementations, a sound space is created to eliminate air interference associated with sound exiting the base 502 via the back side of the housing 608, thereby reducing noise in the sound broadcast from the back speakers 616. Similarly, a sound space may be created to direct sound projected from the front speaker 620 to the right and/or left side of the housing 608. Further details of the Speaker Assembly 610 of the Display Assistant Device 500 will be discussed with reference to PCT international patent application No. PCT/US18/64536 entitled "Speaker Assembly of a Display Assistant Device", filed on 7.12.2018, which claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application No.62/743,464, filed on 9.10.2018, entitled "Speaker Assembly of a Display Assistant Device", each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Fig. 9A and 9B are two exploded views of a screen 504 of a display assistant device 500 from a front perspective view and a back perspective view, respectively, according to some implementations. According to some implementations, the screen 504 includes a cover glass 902, a display panel 904, a middle frame 604, and a back cover 606 of the display assistant device 500. In some implementations, the cover glass 902 and the display panel 904 are integrated into the display front 602, the display front 602 optionally being available as an off-the-shelf module. The edge area of the back surface of the cover glass 902 is covered with paint to define a bezel area surrounding the active display area of the screen 504. In some implementations, the bezel area includes a subset of one or more microphone apertures 512, indicator window 514, camera window 520, and sensor window 516. The microphone 342, the indicator 356, or the camera module 350 may be disposed between the display panel 904 and the intermediate frame 604, and in particular, behind each of the microphone aperture 512, the indicator window 514, and the camera window 520, respectively. Optionally, the display panel 904 has a rear surface made of a thermally and electrically conductive material (e.g., a metal plate). When the heat sink is attached to a portion of the back surface of the display panel 904, it redistributes heat evenly over itself and a portion of the back surface of the display panel 904, thereby avoiding the formation of hot spots on the display panel 904.
In particular, in some implementations, one or more microphones 342 are placed behind the microphone aperture 512 and are configured to collect sound from the surrounding environment of the display assistant device 500. In some implementations, the display assistant device 500 also includes a sensor window 516 configured to access the ambient light sensor 370 (e.g., a white ambient light sensor, an RGB color sensor). The ambient light sensor 370 is disposed behind the bezel area and is exposed to light through a transparent portion of the bezel area, e.g., the sensor window 516. The ambient light sensor 370 is configured to detect lighting conditions in the smart home environment 100 in which the display assistant device 500 is located. In some cases, the display assistant device 500 is configured to adjust the brightness level and/or color tone of its screen 504 according to lighting conditions. In some implementations, the indicator 356 is disposed behind the indicator window 514 and is configured to provide a sequential illumination pattern to indicate whether the display assistant device 500 is active or inactive, whether the display assistant device 500 is in a muted and/or speech processing state (e.g., hotword detection, listening, thinking, and speaking). The sequential illumination pattern of the indicator is defined by an illumination specification, for example, one or more of LED illumination duration, pulse frequency, duty cycle, color sequence, and brightness. In some implementations, the camera module 350 is disposed behind the camera window 520 to capture a video stream of its field of view.
A middle frame 604 is disposed between the display front 602 and the back cover 606. In some implementations, the middle frame 604 is mechanically coupled to the display front 602 using an adhesive applied adjacent to the edges of the display front 602 and the middle frame 604. The middle frame 604 has a plurality of first retaining elements 906, and each first retaining element is formed on the back surface of the middle frame 604 and adjacent to an edge of the middle frame 604. The back cover 606 has a plurality of second retaining elements 908 that are complementary to and configured to mate with the plurality of first retaining elements 906. The plurality of first 906 and second 908 retaining elements mate with each other when the middle frame 604 (which has been integrated with the display front 602) and the back cover 606 are aligned and assembled to each other. In some implementations, the first and second retention elements 906, 908, when mated, are configured to control in-plane displacement of the edges of the back cover 606 in response to an impact of a force against the edges of the back cover 606, thereby limiting undue displacement of each edge of the back cover 606 and protecting the edges of the display front 602 from falling off the edges of the back cover 606. More detailed information regarding fall Protection features of the Display Assistant Device 500 (e.g., the first and second retaining elements 906 and 908) will be discussed with reference to PCT international patent application No. PCT/US 18/64452 entitled "fall Protection for a Display Assistant Device" filed on 7.12.2018, which claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No.62/742,888 entitled "fall Protection for a Display Assistant Device" filed on 8.10.8.2018, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Referring to FIG. 9A, the display panel 904 at the front side 602 of the display is coupled to a display module 910, the display module 910 being configured to provide a backlight and to drive individual display pixels of the display panel 904. Optionally, the display module 910 is disposed adjacent to an edge of the display panel 904. The display module 910 protrudes from a rear surface of the display panel 904. In some implementations, the display module 910 is attached to the middle frame 604 disposed adjacent to the display panel 904.
In some implementations, the middle frame 604 is made substantially of a polymeric material (e.g., glass-reinforced polycarbonate). For example, a predetermined amount (e.g., 30%) of glass fibers is added to the polycarbonate to increase the tensile strength, stiffness, and compressive strength, and to decrease the coefficient of thermal expansion of the mid-frame 604.
Fig. 10A and 10B are two exploded views of a speaker assembly 610 of a display assistant device 500 from a front perspective view and a rear perspective view, respectively, according to some implementations. The speaker assembly 610 includes a rear speaker 616, two front speakers 620, and an enclosure 618 for the rear speaker 616. The enclosure 618 also includes an upper portion 618A and a base portion 618B. The base portion 618B is configured to hold a front speaker and a rear speaker. The upper and base portions 618A and 618B include a first plurality of fastener structures 1002 and a second plurality of fastener structures 1004 that are complementary to each other. The upper portion 618A is mechanically coupled to the base portion 618B via fastener structures 1002 and 1004 (e.g., coupled to each other via fasteners 1006), thereby forming a sealed enclosure for the rear speaker 616. Specifically, the open speaker drivers of the rear speakers 616 are mounted on the rear surface of the enclosure 618, and the speaker openings of the rear speakers 616 face rearward to display a rear view of the assistant device 500. The enclosure 618 directly prevents sound waves projected into the rear of the rear speaker 616 by the diaphragm of the open speaker driver of the rear speaker 616 from interacting with (i.e., interfering with) sound waves projected toward the speaker opening of the rear speaker 616. In some implementations, the upper portion 618A has an inner surface configured to directly control sound waves projected into the rear of the rear speaker 616. In some implementations (not shown in fig. 10A and 10B), when the open speaker driver of the rear speaker 616 is mounted on its rear surface, the base portion 618B itself comprises a sealed enclosure, and the upper portion 618A is attached to the base portion 618B without controlling the sound waves projected into the rear of the rear speaker 616.
The one or more front speakers 620 face a front view opposite the rear view that the rear speakers face. In some implementations, each front speaker 620 is not individually packaged, but rather relies on the base portion 618B to provide the front enclosure 1008. The front enclosure 1008 is separate from the sealed enclosure that controls the sound waves generated by the rear speakers 616. Open speaker drivers for respective front speakers 620 are provided in the front enclosure 1008 to seal the front enclosure 1008. The front enclosure 1008 is configured to confine sound waves projected rearward by the diaphragm of the open speaker driver of the respective front speaker 620 within the front enclosure 1008, separating them from sound waves projected forward by the diaphragm. That is, the enclosure 618 includes a plurality of separate enclosures, each of which provides a respective sealed enclosure for one of the front speakers 620 and the rear speakers 616.
Alternatively, in some implementations, each front speaker 620 is separately packaged and integrated into the base 618B of the enclosure 618, i.e., has its own sealed enclosure, for separating the forwardly projected sound waves from the sound waves projected rearwardly by the diaphragm of the open speaker driver of the respective front speaker 620. In some cases, the base portion 618B has a front enclosure 1008 for each front speaker 620. The front enclosure 1008 is separate from the sealed enclosure for controlling sound waves generated by the rear speakers 616. The front enclosure 1008 is configured to receive the respective front speaker 620, allowing the respective front speaker 620 to face forward when placed in the front enclosure 1008. Alternatively, in some cases, the base portion 618B has a front opening 1008 for each front speaker 620. The front opening 1008 is connected to a sealed enclosure for controlling sound waves generated by the rear speaker 616. The front opening 1008 is sealed when a separately packaged respective front speaker 620 is disposed therein.
In some implementations, when the enclosure 618 is assembled into the housing 608, the sidewall 1010 of the enclosure 618 is in contact with an inner surface of the housing 608. Alternatively, in some implementations, a sound space is created between the side wall 1010 of the enclosure 618 and the interior surface of the housing 608 to modulate sound projected from the corresponding front speaker 620 or rear speaker 616. The sound space may be separated into two sound spaces to separately modulate sound projected from the corresponding front speaker 620 or rear speaker 616. In an example, the sidewall 1010 of the enclosure 618 has one of a hyperbolic shape and a parabolic shape. It is noted that the sidewalls 1010 on two different sides (also referred to as shoulders) of the enclosure 618 may have the same shape or different shapes.
The upper portion 618A is configured to support a main logic board 622 of the display assistant device 500. A plurality of electronic components 632 are mounted on both sides of the main logic board 622. The upper portion 618A includes a recess 1012 configured to receive one or more of the electronic components 632 mounted on or raised from the rear surface of the main logic board 622. According to some implementations of the present application, the upper portion 618A is made of an electrically conductive material and provides electromagnetic shielding, at least in part, for a subset of the electronic components 632 while forming a portion of the sealed enclosure of the rear speaker 616. In some implementations, a subset of the electronic components 632 are also thermally coupled to the upper portion 618A, which acts as a heat sink, to absorb heat generated by one or more of the electronic components and dissipate the generated heat out of the electronic components 632. By these means, the upper portion 618A may serve a dual or triple purpose (i.e., serve as two or more of a sealed enclosure for the rear speakers, an electromagnetic shield, and a heat sink) in the display assistant device 500. Further details of the electromagnetic shielding and heat dissipation functions of the multi-function Speaker Enclosure 618 will be described below with reference to PCT international patent application No. PCT/US19/28959 entitled "multi-purpose Speaker Enclosure in a Display Assistant Device," filed 2019, 24/8, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
According to some implementations of the present application, the upper portion 618A is electrically and thermally conductive and serves a variety of functions including, but not limited to, sealing the rear speaker 616 from electromagnetic interference and absorbing heat generated by the electronic components 632. An example material for the upper portion 618A of the enclosure 618 is metal. The base 618B, while electrically and thermally conductive, may not necessarily be electrically and thermally conductive, and thus in some implementations, the base 618B is made of a non-metallic material (e.g., wood and synthetic fibers) to control the overall weight of the display assistant device 500. In some implementations, the upper portion 618A is a metal hollow structure to reduce cost and control the weight of the display assistant device 500. In some implementations, the upper portion 618A has a top surface made of an electrically and thermally conductive material configured to facilitate heat dissipation and electromagnetic shielding, while the body of the upper portion 618A is electrically and thermally non-conductive.
Fig. 11 is a flow diagram of an example assembly process 1100 of the display assistant device 500 according to some implementations. The display front 602, middle frame 604, and base 502 are provided 1102, respectively. Specifically, the cover glass 902 is coupled (1104A) to the display panel 904 to cover the display panel 904, and the display module 910 is optionally disposed (1104B) on a rear surface of the display panel 904. In some implementations, a heat sink is attached (1104C) to the back surface of the display panel 904 to at least partially distribute heat over the back surface of the display panel 904 and/or dissipate heat to the front surface of the display assistant device 500. The speaker assembly 610 is formed by integrating a rear speaker 616 and one or more front speakers 620 onto a base portion 618B of an enclosure 618 of the rear speaker 616, securing an upper portion 618A onto the base portion 618B, and coupling a main logic board 622 onto a top surface of the upper portion 618A of the enclosure 618 (1106). The speaker assembly 610 is disposed (1108A) in the housing 608 (optionally with a power strip), and the housing 608 is covered (1108B) by the base mounting plate 612, thereby forming the base 502 of the display assistant device 500.
The back cover 606 is assembled (1110) to the base 502. The back cover 606 has a back opening 626, and when the back cover 606 is assembled to the base 502, the top surfaces of the main logic board 622 and the speaker assembly 610 are exposed from the back opening 626. Fig. 12 is an intermediate assembly 1200 as viewed through a rear opening 626 of the rear cover 606 when the rear cover 606 is assembled 1110 onto the base 502 according to some implementations. Optionally, the top and bottom edges of the rear opening 626 of the rear cover 606 are secured to the interior rear and front surfaces of the housing 608, respectively.
After assembling (1110) the back cover 606 to the base 502, the middle frame 604 is coupled (1112) to the back cover 606 via the first plurality of fastener structures 1002 of the middle frame 604 and the second plurality of fastener structures 1004 of the back cover 606. The display front 602 is coupled (1114) to the bezel 604, optionally by an adhesive applied near the edges of the display front 602 and the bezel 604. Alternatively, the display module is mounted on the front surface of the middle frame 604. Note that the order of operations in the exemplary assembly process 1100 of the display assistant device 500 may vary.
Referring to fig. 12, when the back cover 606 is assembled to the base 502, a power cable 1202 is applied to couple a power board in the base 502 to the main logic board 622. A plurality of antenna boards 1204 (including antennas and corresponding transceiver circuitry) are disposed on the front surface of the back cover 606 and near the edges of the back cover 606 (i.e., away from the conductive upper portion 618A of the enclosure 618 in the base 502). A volume control plate 1206 and a privacy control plate 1208 are respectively disposed on a front surface of the rear cover 606, e.g., behind or adjacent to the volume control 344 and the privacy control 346, respectively. Each of the plurality of antenna boards 1204, volume control board 1206, and privacy control board 1208 are electrically coupled to the main logic board 622 via respective interconnection cables.
Each antenna board 1204 includes one or more antennas configured to enable the display assistant device 500 to wirelessly communicate with other electronic devices, such as the hub device 180, the smart device 120, the client device 104, another display assistant device 500, and/or the server system 140. In some implementations, the antennas are configured to operate simultaneously using two different frequencies. In some implementations, the antennas are configured to operate simultaneously using two different communication protocols. In some implementations, one or more of the antennas are configured for broadband communications (e.g., Wi-Fi) and/or point-to-point communications (e.g., bluetooth). In some implementations, one or more of the antennas are configured for mesh network communication (e.g., ZWave). In some implementations, the first antenna is configured for 2.4GHz Wi-Fi communication and the second antenna is configured for 5GHz Wi-Fi communication. In some implementations, the first antenna is configured for 2.4GHz or 5GHz Wi-Fi communication and the second antenna is configured for thread-based communication. In some implementations, a first antenna is configured for 2.4GHz Wi-Fi communication and point-to-point communication, a second antenna is configured for 5GHz Wi-Fi communication and point-to-point communication, and a third antenna is configured for mesh network communication. In some implementations, two or more of the antennas are configured to transmit and/or receive data simultaneously with the other antennas.
In some implementations, the antennas of the display assistant device 500 include at least one dual-band inverted-F antenna (IFA). In some implementations, the antenna is manufactured by Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC), Laser Direct Structuring (LDS), stamping, or other prior art antenna manufacturing techniques. In some implementations, the size of the antenna is approximately a quarter wavelength at 2.4 GHz. In some implementations, each antenna includes a radiating element, a feed line, and a ground stub. In some implementations, at least one of the antennas includes a ground stub. The second ground stub is adapted to match the antenna to both 2.4GHz and 5 GHz. In some implementations, the antenna feed is the feed point for 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi signals. In some implementations, the feed point is connected to an output of the WiFi chip. In some implementations, the antennas include two identical IFA antennas. Both antennas are attached to the rear surface of the middle frame 604 and covered by a rear cover 606.
