- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an overview of aspects of the invention in accordance with an embodiment. As illustrated several users 102 a , 102 b , 102 c , and 102 d (collectively the user(s) 102 ) are coupled to each other and to an information control network 108 . The users and the information control network are coupled to the Internet 110 .
- any of the users 102 can be publishers or consumers of information.
- the user 102 b is a publisher, which provides information via the information control network 108 , to other users, and over the Internet 110 via a computer server 112 a .
- the same is true for the user 102 d , which has a computer server 112 b .
- the computer servers 112 a and 112 b are referred to collectively as the computer server(s) 112 ).
- the computer servers 112 can be a broad range of data sources, business, education, entertainment, and the like, constituted with a single or cluster of shared or dedicated computer servers. Suitable computer servers include, but are not limited to those available from IBM of Armonk, N.Y. and Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif.
- the users 102 a and 102 c are consumers, which persistently request information in accordance with the present invention, and subsequently receive notification that the requested information is available from another user 102 , the information control network 108 , and/or the Internet 110 .
- the users 102 a and 102 c use client computers 104 a and 104 b (collectively client computer(s) 104 ) to request, and subsequently receive information, as it becomes available, from the computer servers 112 .
- the user 102 a has a microserver 106 embedded in its client computer 104 a , which facilitates the user 102 a to be a publisher as well as a consumer.
- the client computers 104 are intended to represent a broad range of well-known computers of any number of forms, desktop, laptop, hand-held, and the like, equipped with the proper communication or networking equipment, as well as operating systems and other software.
- Suitable client computers include, but are not limited to those available from Dell Computer of Austin, Tex. and Apple Computers of Cupertino, Calif.
- Operating systems include, but are not limited to the Windows® family of operating systems available from Microsoft® Corporation of Redmond, Wash., Linux available from Red Hat of Durham, N.C., and OS/& available from Apple Computers of Cupertino, Calif.
- Any of the client computers 104 may be equipped with a well-known web browser (not shown), which facilitates accessing and surfing the world-wide-web (web) using the Internet 110 .
- Suitable web browsers include, but are not limited to Internet Explorer available from Microsoft® Corporation of Redmond, Wash. and Netscape Navigator available from Netscape® Communication of Mountain View, Calif.
- the microserver 106 is a “stripped down” web server, having minimal functionality to support delivering of requested information in the form of a request to store information from information control network 108 .
- the employment of micro-server 106 facilitates the user to persistently submit their requests for information, and subsequently receive the information as they become available, without requiring the users to remain “connected” to the information control network 108 , while awaiting availability of the requested information.
- the functionality to support a request to store information is known in the art, and implemented in many well-known web servers. Accordingly, implementation of these functionalities will not be further described.
- the information control network 108 is equipped to detect publication of information, organize information into topics, to facilitate the users 102 a and 102 c to persistently subscribe to information related to topics of interest, to dynamically route information subscribed to the users 102 a and 102 c based on the topic and their particular levels of interest, and to deliver the information matching the subscription to the users 102 a and 102 c on the client computers 104 a and 104 b.
- the information control network 108 is a single centralized network through which all detections, organizations, subscriptions, registrations, preferences, and information flows.
- the information control network 108 is located within an organization without being connected to the “outside world.” In this embodiment, the information control network 108 also hosts business logic rules.
- the Internet 110 is intended to represent a broad range of public and private data networks that have hubs, routers, switches, gateways, and the like, known in the art, and not necessarily “the Internet” of common usage. Suitable networking equipment is available from CISCO Systems and 3COM, both of San Jose, Calif.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a method 200 performed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.
- an embodiment of the present invention organizes information into topics.
- an embodiment facilitates a user 102 to persistently subscribe to one or more topics.
- the information control network 108 continuously and independently monitors/searches the Internet 110 for information related to the topic(s).
- An advantage the persistent subscription feature is that the user 102 is relieved from having to make multiple requests for information.
- the network 108 effectuates the repetitive/continuous request transparently to the user 102 .
- an embodiment routes information to a user 102 based on the user 102 's level of interest in the topic.
- a user 102 's level of interest can be determined in various ways.
- One embodiment facilitates a user 102 to generate device profiles and application profiles which set priorities for which topics are to be routed to which devices and/or applications. Priorities can depend on the time, day, date, etc.
- the network 108 determines which topics are to be routed to which devices and/or applications based on a user 102 's response to receipt of earlier information.
- an embodiment delivers information matching the subscription to a user 102 , on a user device or user application, or on a microserver-equipped client computer.
- the user 102 registers a client computer with the network 108 as a device on which to receive information, as it becomes available, under a subscription.
- microserver-equipped client computer 104 a can “locally” maintain (i.e., on the client computer itself) a communication path between the information-request-making application and receive the requested information on the application's behalf as an “independent” request for service from the information control network 108 .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the information control network 108 in more detail.
- the information control network 108 includes an organizer 302 , a router 304 , a sensor 306 , a priority module 308 , and a notification module 310 .
- the organizer 302 organizes information into canonical topics.
- the router 304 routes information to a user based on the user 102 's level of interest.
- the sensor 306 senses published information.
- the priority module 308 filters information according to a user 102 's preferences.
- the priority module 308 also scores information according to a user 102 's preferences.
- the notification module 310 notifies a user 102 that information that the user 102 has subscribed to is available.
- the information control network 108 also includes a subscription manager 320 that manages subscriptions to information, a registration manager 330 , which manages registration of devices and applications, and a preferences manager 340 , which manages preferences for the users 120 .
- the information control network 108 also includes a controller 380 , which facilitates communication within the information control network 108 .
- the controller 380 facilitates cooperation among the organizer 302 , the router 304 , the sensor 306 , the priority module 308 , the notification module 310 , the subscription manager 320 , the registration manager 330 , and the preferences manager 340 .
- the controller 380 also facilitates communication and cooperation of the information control network 108 with the users 102 and the Internet 110 .
- the information control network 108 also includes a database 390 to store information about topics, registration, subscriptions, users 102 preferences, routing, etc.
- the database 390 includes at least one index generator to generate index information that identifies relationships among the users 102 and topics, registration, subscriptions, preferences, priorities, etc.
- the index information establishes the organization of the information stored in the database 390 .
- the database 390 is a dedicated computer running a relational database.
- the database 390 can be implemented using any database management system that facilitates multiple processors to manipulate the stored information.
- the database 390 is depicted as only one database, persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art will readily recognize how to implement the database 390 using more than one database.
- Suitable database management systems include Microsoft Access available from Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Wash. or any well-known Structured Query Language (SQL) computer server. Moreover, many of the functions implemented by the database 390 can be implemented by other components.
- SQL Structured Query Language
- the information control network 108 senses or detects information from various locations.
- Sources of information can be electronic libraries, databases, business process, legacy environments (e.g., file computer servers, Notes), email applications, instant messaging applications, chat applications, or other information in electronic form, such as information posted on websites and message boards.
- the information can also be from news services, file sharing applications, network management applications, etc.
- the information control network 108 is passive and waits for information to be published. In another embodiment, the information control network 108 is active and crawls the various sources looking for information of interest. The information control network 108 scrapes information using well-known robot crawlers and text analysis techniques, and suitable systems are available from Napster.com in San Mateo, Calif. and FaceTime.com in Foster City, Calif.
- a user 102 may be interested in information just published on a web site.
- Conventional systems find the web site and repeatedly poll it. If the web site changes, the conventional systems send an email to the user 102 indicating that the web site has changed.
- Typical conventional systems do not provide information on what the information changed from and changed to.
- One such system is available from Netmind.com.
- the information control network 108 senses what the information changed from and changed to because it organizes the event based on its XML tags (e.g., the publisher marked up the electronic information with “who, what, when, where” XML tags), which is described more fully below.
- XML tags e.g., the publisher marked up the electronic information with “who, what, when, where” XML tags
- the information control network 108 organizes information into canons that include “who,” “what,” “when,” and/or “where.” Information can be organized based on other canons as well. For example, “price” can be a canon. Suppose that a Bach concert is being held Thursday, Oct. 12, 2000 at 7:00 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. The organization sponsoring the concert issues this fact as an “event.” The organization also may post the information on its web site.
- the “event” has a specific who, what, when, where, etc. For example, the “who” is “Bach,” the “what” is “concert,” the “when” is “Thursday, Oct. 12, 2000 at 7:00 p.m.” and the “where” is “Orange County Performing Arts Center.” The “what” also cross-posts as “symphony” because it is a synonym of “concert.”
- Information organized under the “who” topic can include names of individual people, groups of people, etc.
- the names can be personal, such as John, James, Gerald, the Jefferson's, etc., or common, such as boys, firemen, teachers, biologists, etc.
- Information organized under the “what” topic can include any type of information, and is generally arranged by category, sub-category, sub-sub-category, etc.
- Exemplar “what” categories can include recreation, entertainment, fashion, etc.
- exemplar sub-categories can include indoor recreation and outdoor recreation, concerts and movies, men's fashion and women's fashion.
- Information organized under the “when” topic can include times, such as “10:00 o'clock a.m.,” days, such as “Sundays,” and dates, such as “Feb. 19, 1935.”
- the “when” topic also can include times of day, such as “morning” or “lunchtime.”
- the “when” topic also can include “weekends” or “Father's Day.”
- Information organized under the “where” topic can be a galaxy, planet, country, state, city, street, address, etc. Thus, it can be as broad as “Milky Way Galaxy,” “Earth” “West Coast,” “Pacific Northwest,” “Washington,” and a narrow as “Woodinville,” and “Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery.”
- the organizer 302 When the organizer analyzes information, the organizer 302 considers linguistic relationships, such as synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, etc. Thus, the organizer 320 knows that “entertainment” is a hypernym (or sub-category) of “music,” which is a hypernym of “classical,” and that “reggae” is a hyponym of “music” and that “music” is a hyponym of “entertainment.” The organizer 302 also knows that “music” is a hyponym of “arts.” Likewise, the organizer 302 knows that with respect to music, “country” is a synonym of “western.” The organizer 302 also knows that “symphony” is a synonym of “concert,” and, as such, that a Los Angeles Times “symphony” event is comparable to a New York Times “concert” event.
- linguistic relationships such as synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, etc.
- the information control network 108 also cross-posts information.
- the “what” of the Bach concert also cross-posts as “symphony” because it is a synonym of “concert.”
- the “where” of “Orange County Performing Arts Center” cross-posts to the “where” of “California” because Orange County Performing Arts Center is a hyponym of California.
- the topic “Performing Arts Centers” would include hyponyms such as Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Wash., Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Wash.
- the “event” indicating that the Bach concert is being held Thursday, Oct. 12, 2000 at 7:00 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center therefore also may trigger other “events.”
- a non-profit watch organization may trigger “events” whenever it receives an “event” from a non-profit organization.
- the organizer 302 also considers what the words mean in context, or their semantics. For example, the organizer 302 knows that words can have several meanings, which change depending on the audience. Thus the organizer 302 knows that to a New Yorker “San Francisco” may include “San Jose,” but to anyone who lives in San Jose, “San Francisco” does not include “San Jose.”
- Information can come from a variety of sources and generally includes any information available in cyberspace, on the web, on the Internet, etc. Information typically is generated by commercial corporations, government entities, media, religious and other non-profit organizations, hospitals, etc. Although information has been referred to as an “event,” information may also be referred to as “non-events,” “alerts,” “messages,” “queries,” “data,” “data content,” “consumer/customer information,” or other terminology that can be interpreted to mean information usable by cyberspace and/or Internet users. Information can also be patterns, streams, queues, etc.
- Information can be in any language, such as English, Spanish, Japanese, Swedish, Chinese, Hebrew, Swahili, Portuguese, Farsi, etc., and can be in any form, such as video, audio, multimedia, or streaming media. This includes text, graphical images, computer-animated graphics, sound effects, and music, for example.
- a specific type, form, or language of information is not important for the invention, and those skilled in the art will understand that a wide variety of information may be made available on the web. That is, any type of information in any form or language can be made available to the users 102 .
- the organizer 302 assigns “who” “what” “when” and/or “where” extensible markup language (XML) tags (who-what-when-where XML tags) to information.
- XML extensible markup language
- a user can assign “who” “what” “when” and/or “where” XML tags to information prior to publishing it.
- the “who” “what” “when” and/or “where” XML tags operate as a protocol (the who-what-when-where protocol) rather than a static, binary, language-specific application programming interface (API) that can trip up internet-scale heterogeneous systems.
- API application programming interface
- a detected “event” “Rohit is going to San Francisco to buy that $5000 laptop from Sony” is organized into canonical topics and assigned who-what-when-where XML tags. According to this embodiment, the information becomes
- who-what-when-where XML tags also include a price XML tag.
- one aspect of the invention facilitates the users 102 to persistently express an interest in a topic.
- the information control network 108 searches for information related to the topic. When such information is found, the user 102 may be notified. Unlike with conventional systems, the user 102 does not have to make multiple manual requests for information. Instead, the user 102 makes one subscription indicating a persistent interest in the topic(s).
- a user 102 also can persistently subscribe to a web user, which is a person, or a web resource, which is any device that can be referenced by a uniform resource locator (URL).
- a web resource may also be a queue, event stream, etc., such as an electronic ticker tape.
- FIG. 4 shows a display on a client computer 104 of an exemplar user interface 400 whereby a user 102 can persistently subscribe to a topic by name or by category.
- the user interface 400 as well as other user interfaces described herein, run on a computer display and are viewable and operable by a user 102 .
- the user 102 simply selects the particular window by clicking on it.
- Some windows allow the user 102 to make entries via a computer keyboard. Other windows, when clicked on, transport the user 102 to another user interface.
- the user interface 400 depicts a “Subscribe to a topic” heading 402 , a “Subscribe by name” window 404 , and a “Subscribe by category” window 406 .
- the user 102 selects a “who” window 410 and enters a name, selects a “what” window 412 and enters a thing, selects a “where” window 414 and enters a location, and selects a “when” window 416 and enters a date, time, etc.
- a user 102 Miguel, subscribes to an R.E.M. concert at Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery in Woodinville, Wash. for Friday, Apr.
- a user can persistently subscribe to a category.
- the user 102 selects the R.E.M. window 420 .

- the user 102 selects a “Search” window 530 to check for the presence for persons matching entries.
- FIG. 6 shows an exemplar user interface 600 whereby a user 102 can persistently subscribe to a web resource.
- the user interface 600 depicts a “Subscribe to a Web resource” heading 602 .
- the user 102 selects a “URL” window 604 and enters a URL, such as http://www.bstz.com or http://www.knownow.com.
- the subscription manager 320 receives the entries as subscription data, processes the subscription data, and stores it for use by the information control network 108 .
- the users 102 are persistently subscribed to the entered user's presence, topic(s), and web resources.
- Subscription data can be stored in a database according to Table 1, which illustrates an embodiment of a Subscription Table.
- Table 1 illustrates an embodiment of a Subscription Table.
- the Subscription Table shows that Joe has subscribed to any Seattle R.E.M. concert and Bill has subscribed to books related to R.E.M. Bill's subscription persists until May 1, 2001. John has subscribed to all concerts, regardless of the venue, the date, or who is playing. Bob has subscribed to any REO Speedwagon information. Note that the Subscription Table shows from the example above that Miguel has subscribed to the R.E.M. concert at the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery on Apr. 11, 2000.
- a user subscribes to be notified on her spreadsheet whenever expenses in her department exceed $500,000. Other embodiments will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art reading the description herein.
- one aspect of the invention routes information to a user based on the user's level of interest in a topic.
- a user subscribes to a topic.
- the user registers a device or application for the subscription.
- “Subscription” refers to what to send or receive, i.e., information related to a topic, a user, a device, an application, or a resource, while “registration” refers to where to send information, i.e., to a pager, buddy list, etc.
- the user specifies a level of interest in a particular topic by establishing preferences.
- subscribing to a topic implicitly registers the device used to subscribe.
- the information control network 108 recognizes that the device used to subscribe to the topic is unknown to the information control network 108 and automatically registers the device.
- Registration also can refer to from where information is published. This is described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 8 below.
- the information control network 108 aggregates the user 102 's registrations, subscriptions, and preferences, and filters information such that when information relating to the subscribed topic is found, the information control network 108 routes the information on a topic-interest basis. This quells the barrage of alerts, events, etc., from brokers, doctors, auctioneers, etc., such that potential interruptions become decisions.
- FIG. 7 is an exemplar user interface 700 whereby a user can register a device or application on which to receive subscribed to information.
- the registration manager 330 may perform some of the functions described with reference to FIGS. 7 and 8 .

- the user interface 800 depicts a “Register an application/device—publish” heading 802 , a “Publish info to the Information Control Network” window 804 , and an “Also publish info to” window 806 .
- the user 102 selects a box 808 .
- the user 102 To register to publish information to a location other than the information control network 108 , the user 102 selects a box 810 , and enters a location, usually in the form of an address, in the window 812 . According to the example in FIG. 8 , the user 102 has entered a URL (ICN.mycorp.com).
- FIG. 9 shows an embodiment where a purchase order system 910 registers and subscribes to information related to printers 920 and 922 and to a copier 924 , which may be located at a Reprographics Business 926 , such as Kinko's®.
- the Reprographics Business 926 has registered to publish information related to printers 920 and 922 and the copier 924 to the information control network 108 .
- the printer 920 or 922 or the copier 924 publishes information indicating that it is out of paper
- the purchase order system 910 receives this information.
- the Reprographics Business 926 has registered to publish information related to printers 920 and 922 and the copier 924 to the purchase order system 910 .
- the printer 920 or 922 or the copier 924 publishes information indicating that it is out of paper
- the purchase order system 910 receives this information directly.
- the purchase order system 910 can act on the subscribed to information in various ways, including placing an order for paper to be sent to the Reprographics Business 926 . Note that no human intervention in this transaction, and in many aspects of the invention, no human intervention is necessary.
- a user 102 also may specify certain preferences for subscriptions, including threshold levels of interest in a topic.
- One embodiment allows a user 102 to assign a priority level for thresholds such that below a certain threshold, information is routed in one manner, and above a certain threshold, information is routed in another manner. For example, a user 102 may prefer to have information sent to his or her cellular phone in the mornings and afternoons during commuting times and to his or her laptop computer during the middle of the day. On weekends, the user 102 may prefer to be contacted on his or her pager. Both the sender's preferences and the recipient's preferences are taken into consideration.
- the information control network 108 can adaptively adjust a user's level of interest.
- the network sends information to a user. If the user never acknowledges receipt of information, the information control network 108 interprets the failure to acknowledge as a lack of interest and adjusts the preferences accordingly. This process can be iterative and dynamic such that the information control network 108 continually adapts to the user 102 .
- a user 102 can specify that if there are any messages from her parents, the information control network 108 should find the user, notifying the user 102 on any registered device or application. In this instance the information control network 108 escalates the priority on the device(s) or application(s) accordingly.
- the notification does not necessarily have to be on a registered device or application.
- the information control network 108 can dispatch a skywriter to deliver notifications, put messages on reader boards or electronic billboards, or other instrumentality to ensure the user 102 is notified.
- FIG. 10 is a user interface 1000 whereby a user 102 establishes or changes preferences.
- the router 304 and the priority module 308 may perform some of the functions described when referring to FIG. 10 .
- the user interface 1000 depicts a “Set/Change your preferences” heading 1002 , a “Notify me according to the following priorities:” heading 1004 , and an “Escalate information based on the following rules” heading 1006 .
- the user interface 1000 also shows the devices and applications that the particular user 102 has registered, which include e-mail, instant messaging (IM), and a pager.
- IM instant messaging
- the windows under the “Notify me according to the following priorities:” heading 1004 allow a user 102 to establish priorities for devices and applications, times, and dates. To set a preference for a device or application default priority level, the user 102 engages a “Default Priority Level” window 1020 .
- One embodiment allows a user 102 to assign a priority between 0 and 100 for thresholds. The example in FIG. 10 shows that for a particular subscription the user 102 prefers to receive information, as it becomes available, with a priority of 30 to his email, information with a priority between 31 and 89 on his instant messenger, and information with a priority greater than 89 on his pager.
- the user 102 can set or change preferences for other devices and applications not shown in FIG. 10 .
- the user 102 engages a “Lunch hour” window 1030 .
- the example in FIG. 10 shows that during lunchtime the user 102 prefers to receive information, as it becomes available, with a priority less than 75 on his email and information with a priority greater than or equal to 75 on his pager.
- the user 102 can set or change preferences for other times not shown in FIG. 10 .
- the user 102 engages a “Weekends” window 1040 .
- the example in FIG. 10 shows that on weekends the user 102 prefers to receive information, as it becomes available, with a priority less than 80 on his email and information with a priority greater than or equal to 75 on his pager.
- the user 102 can set or change preferences for other days (e.g., holidays, travel days, etc.) not shown in FIG. 10 .
- the information control network 108 may generate a device profile.
- the device/application profiles can be as follows. Email receives all information with a priority of less than 30 during the week, with a priority of less than 75 during the week at lunchtime, and with a priority of less than 80 on the weekends. Instant messenger only receives information during the week, and only information with a priority between 31 and 89.
- the windows under the “Escalate information based on the following rules” heading 1006 allow a user 102 to establish priorities for certain events. According to the entries in the windows under the “Escalate information based on the following rules” heading 1006 , the router 304 escalates any event having a priority of 50 (window 1052 ) or greater (window 1054 ) by 10 (window 1056 ) every fifteen minutes (window 1058 ) until the user 102 acknowledges receipt of the information.
- the default priority level for any preference is 75.
- Miguel has a default priority of 75 for information about the R.E.M. concert at Chateau Ste. Michelle.
- the topic-interest profile for Miguel's R.E.M. event is as follows. If Miguel receives her R.E.M. event during the week at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, the event is routed to her instant messenger. If Miguel receives her R.E.M. event during the week at lunchtime, the event is routed to her pager. If Miguel receives her R.E.M. event on the weekend, the event is routed to her email. These may change if Miguel fails to acknowledge receipt of the event, in which case the priority is escalated.
- a user 102 also can train the router 304 by providing a “more urgent” or “less urgent” response to information.
- the information control network 108 routes information using the “who, what, when, where” XML tags as a message protocol rather than a static, binary, language-specific application programming interface (API) that can trip up internet-scale heterogeneous systems.
- the “who, what, when, where” message protocol ensures interoperability with other proprietary devices, platforms, systems, etc.
- the router 304 uses a consistent hashing algorithm to calculate the set of subscribers needing to receive the information relating to the subscribed topic.
- the information control network 108 After a user 102 has subscribed, registered, and set preferences, the information control network 108 notifies the user 102 whenever information is sensed that matches the subscription, registration, and preferences. Notification is thus sent to pagers, instant messaging, spreadsheets, cellular telephones, etc., according to profiles described above.
- the user 102 who prefers to have information sent to his cellular phone in the mornings gets notified on his cell phone in the mornings. He is notified on his cell phone in the afternoons and during commuting times. He is notified on his laptop computer during the middle of the day. On weekends, he is notified on his or her pager.
- the user 102 wants to be notified whenever any story about Akamai is posted to the New York Times web site. The user 102 does not want to have to get the whole “newspaper,” just the Akamai story. When the story is posted, the registered user device or user application is notified and the changes are automatically synchronized.
- the information control network 108 knows which device or application to notify based on the user's profiles.
- Miguel has a subscription to information about the R.E.M. concert at Chateau Ste. Michelle, also has registered the client computer 104 a to receive information, as it becomes available, and the microserver 106 to publish information.
- Miguel might get an email announcing that tickets have gone on sale, which he may miss, especially if it is the weekend. Alternatively, Miguel is asleep and does not want to be awakened.
- the microserver 106 facilitates users being able to persistently submit requests for information, and subsequently receive the information as they become available, without requiring the users to remain “connected” to the information control network 108 , while awaiting availability of the requested information. For example, when the sensor 306 has detected an “event” indicating that tickets are now on sale for the R.E.M. concert at Chateau Ste. Michelle on Friday, Apr. 11, 2001, the information control network 108 notifies Miguel's client computer 104 a . The microserver 106 establishes a connection with a server at Ticket Master and sends a request to purchase four tickets to the R.E.M. concert.
- the microserver 106 accesses Miguel's credit card information stored on the client computer 104 a in a well-known manner and provides the credit card information to Ticket Master.
- the microserver 106 permits Miguel to purchase tickets regardless of where he is or what time it is.
