Definitions
- the present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to optical waveguides, and particularly relate to systems, devices, and methods that employ such optical waveguides in wearable heads-up displays.
- a majority of currently available wearable heads-up displays employ optical waveguide systems in the transparent combiner.
- a conventional optical waveguide operates under the principle of total internal reflection (TIR). TIR occurs when light remains in a first medium upon incidence at a boundary with a second medium because the refractive index of the first medium is greater than the refractive index of the second medium and the angle of incidence of the light at the boundary is above a specific critical angle that is a function of those refractive indices.
- Optical waveguides employed in wearable heads-up displays like those mentioned above consist of rectangular prisms of material with a higher refractive index than the surrounding medium, usually air (Google Glass®, Optinvent Ora®, Epson Moverio®) or a planar lens (Microsoft Hololens®). Light input into the prism will propagate along the length of the prism as long as the light continues to be incident at boundaries between the prism and the surrounding medium at an angle above the critical angle.
- Optical waveguides employ in-coupling and out-coupling elements to ensure that light follows a specific path along the waveguide and then exits the waveguide at a specific location in order to create a desired image or pattern.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “combiner” component of a wearable heads-up display is the physical structure where display light and environmental light merge as one within the user's field of view.
- the combiner of a wearable heads-up display is typically transparent to environmental light but includes some optical routing mechanism to direct display light into the user's field of view.
- wearable heads-up displays examples include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Microsoft Hololens® just to name a few.

- the term “carries” and variants such as carried by are generally used to refer to a physical coupling between two objects.

- the various embodiments described herein provide systems, devices, and methods for curved eyeglass lenses with waveguides integrated therewith. Such are particularly well-suited for use as or in the transparent combiner of wearable heads-up displays (“WHUDs”) in order to enable the WHUDs to adopt more aesthetically-pleasing styles and, in some implementations, to enable the WHUDs to include prescription eyeglass lenses.

No. 15/167,458, U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/167,472, and U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 15/167,484.
- Optical waveguides which operate under the principle of total internal reflection require that the waveguide be bounded by a material of a lesser refractive index than the material of the waveguide. If the waveguide is embedded in a lens in an attempt to mimic traditional eyeglasses/sunglasses, as in many current wearable heads-up display, then there are restrictions on the materials that can be used, i.e., the material of the waveguide must have a higher refractive index than the refractive index of the lens. Additionally, the architecture of an optical waveguide operating under the principle of total internal reflection is constrained by the critical angle of incidence of the light on the boundaries of the waveguide.
- the angle of reflection of the light signals changes as the light propagates along the waveguide and it may be difficult to maintain total internal reflection.
- the optical devices and wearable heads-up displays described below remove these restrictions and constraints because they do not require total internal reflection to propagate light within a waveguide.
- FIG. 1A is a schematic diagram of an optical waveguide 100 a in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- Optical waveguide 100 a includes a volume of optically transparent material 110 a , a first holographic optical element (HOE) 120 a , a second HOE 130 a , and a dedicated in-coupling element 140 .

- First HOE 120 a is shown as having the same length as first longitudinal surface 111 a and second HOE 130 a is shown as having greater than 80% of the length of second longitudinal surface 112 a , however, in other implementations first HOE 120 a and second HOE 130 a may cover any portion of first longitudinal surface 111 a and second longitudinal surface 112 a respectively, preferably equal to or greater than 50% of each respective longitudinal surface.
- the designation of a HOE as the “first” or “second” HOE is only for clarity during discussion and is not meant to imply any order, such as the order of incidence of light signals thereon.

- the light signals follow a path such that the light signals are eventually output from the waveguide to fulfill the purpose of the waveguide, e.g., creating an image, signaling, etc.
- In-coupling element 140 may in-couple individual light signals according to the wavelength of the light signal, the angle of incidence of the light signal on in-coupling element 140 , and/or the location of incidence of the light signal on in-coupling element 140 .
- Light signals 151 a , 152 a , and 153 a are directed towards first HOE 120 a by in-coupling element 140 and reflect off of first HOE 120 a towards second HOE 130 a .
- Second HOE 130 a reflects light signals 151 a , 152 a , and 153 a back towards first HOE 120 a .
- Lights signals 151 a , 152 a , and 153 a continue reflecting between first HOE 120 a and second HOE 130 a and travel down the length of volume of optically transparent material 110 a until the respective light signal is out-coupled by second HOE 130 a by transmission.
- the entire length of second HOE 130 a is an out-coupling region for outputting light signals, however in other implementations only a sub-region of second HOE 130 a may out-couple light signals.

- In-coupling element 140 may be a hologram, a holographic optical element, a volume diffraction grating, a surface relief grating, a transmission grating, or a reflection grating.
- the in-coupling region may be at least a portion of the first HOE or the second HOE
