Definitions
- This document relates to managing instant messaging sessions on multiple devices.
- Instant messaging is one manner in which online identities may communicate with each other electronically.
- a user may be able access an instant messaging online identity multiple times from multiple different devices. For example, the user may log into the user's instant messaging online identity through an instant messaging application on the user's desktop personal computer at home. At the same time, the user may log into the same instant messaging online identity through an instant messaging application on the user's personal digital assistant.
- instant messaging is intended to enable ongoing and continuous, though segmented, dialog between two users substantially in real time.
- an instant messaging user interface appears on a device use to inspire or receive an instant message, reflecting content presently sent or received by the instant messaging participants.
- an instant messaging user interface will appear on both controllers each time an instant message is received by that identity, whether or not the identity is actively operating devices at which those controllers are run.
- a user inspires a message
- their message appears only on the instant messaging user interface of the device from which the message was inspired. For example, if a user concurrently runs an instant messaging controller on a desktop and a personal digital assistant (PDA), and the user inspires a message using the instant messaging controller on the desktop, the instant messaging user interface does not appear on the PDA to reflect the instant message sent by the user from the desktop.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- the PDA interface When a reply to the user's instant message is received, and it inspires an instant messaging user interface on both devices, the PDA interface remains without an indication of the message that the user sent to inspire the reply.

- FIG. 8 is an expansion of the block diagram of FIG. 7 .
- One aspect of intelligent management involves replicating or transitioning information related to ongoing instant messaging conversations from an incumbent instant messaging controller to another instant messaging controller that has newly been run, automatically or in response to user input.
- Another aspect involves managing presentation of information and multiple concurrently running instant messaging controllers in an ongoing basis.
- a user is allowed to transfer (e.g., copy or transition) one or more current instant messaging sessions from among multiple instant messaging sessions from an instant messaging controller on one device to an instant messaging controller on another device.
- a user may sign on to an instant messaging system using an online identity (e.g., screen name) on an instant messaging controller on a desktop computer.
- the user may have multiple instant messaging sessions with multiple different co-users.
- the user may log on to an instant messaging controller on another device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), and transfer a subset of the multiple instant messaging sessions to the PDA.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- the full text of the transferred instant messaging sessions are made perceivable on the PDA, thus, enabling the user to seamlessly continue the existing instant messaging conversations by referencing some or all of the text of the conversation communicated prior to their logging onto the instant messaging controller on the PDA.
- the user may initiate the transfer of all or a subset of the ongoing instant messaging session from either the instant messaging controller on the incumbent device or the instant messaging controller on the later-invoked device.
- the user may initiate the transfer of the instant messaging sessions from either the instant messaging controller on the desktop computer or the instant messaging controller on the PDA.
- an instant messaging session transfer interface may be used to transfer one or more instant messaging sessions from among multiple instant messaging sessions.
- the instant messaging session transfer interface may be accessed and used from either the instant messaging controller on the incumbent device or the instant messaging controller on the later-invoked device.
- an instant messaging conversation interface may be configured to enable transfer of a corresponding instant messaging session.
- the user also may select the device to receive or send the instant messaging sessions. For example, if the user is signed on to three instant messaging controllers on three different devices, then the user may select which of two devices to send one or more (or all) instant messaging sessions. Additionally and/or alternatively, the user may select which of two devices from which to receive one or more (or all) instant messaging sessions.
- the exchange of instant messages between the user and the co-user in instant messaging session may be mirrored on all or less than all of the instant messaging controllers.
- the user may designate preferences as to whether the instant messaging sessions should be mirrored prior to and/or after the transfer.
- an idle or an away state of the instant messaging controller may disrupt the viewing of a mirrored instant messaging session.
- the interrupted instant messaging session may be refreshed.
- the display of the interrupted instant messaging session may be refreshed automatically upon the instant messaging controller transitioning into an active state.
- an interface may be used to designate which of the one or more interrupted instant messaging sessions to refresh.
- the legacy instant messaging conversation interface when an instant messaging session is transferred back to a device, the legacy instant messaging conversation interface may be refreshed with the entire instant messaging session or the legacy instant messaging conversation interface may be closed and a new instant messaging conversation interface instantiated and populated with the entire instant messaging conversation.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary process 100 for transferring an instant messaging session.
- a selection is received identifying at least one instant messaging session from among multiple instant messaging sessions to be transferred from a first instant messaging controller on a first device to at least a second instant messaging controller on a second device, where the user is signed on concurrently to at least the first instant messaging controller on the first device and the second instant messaging controller on the second device (step 105 ).
- the selected instant messaging session is transferred from the first instant messaging controller on the first device to the second instant messaging controller on the second device (step 115 ) and the transferred instant messaging session is made perceivable on the second instant messaging controller on the second device (step 120 ).
- An instant messaging session is a communication session that is established between a user and at least one co-user, where the user and the co-user can exchange instant messages in an instant messaging conversation interface.
- a user may have multiple instant messaging session ongoing at the same time with many different co-users, with each separate instant messaging conversation being made perceivable to the user in a corresponding instant messaging conversation interface.
- An instant messaging session may be established using an instant messaging controller and a device.
- a device is a general-purpose computer capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner.
- Other examples include a special-purpose computer, a personal computer (“PC”), a workstation, a server, a laptop, a cellular communications device, a Web-enabled telephone, a personal digital assistant (“PDA”), a Web-enabled PDA, an interactive television set, a settop box, a video tape recorder (“VTR”), a DVD player, an on-board (i.e., vehicle-mounted) computer, or any other component, machine, tool, equipment, or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions.
- PC personal computer
- PDA personal digital assistant
- VTR video tape recorder
- DVD player an on-board (i.e., vehicle-mounted) computer, or any other component, machine, tool, equipment, or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions.
- An example of a controller including an instant messaging controller, is a software application (e.g., operating system, browser application, micro browser application, server application, proxy application, gateway application, tunneling application, e-mail application; instant messaging client, online service provider client application, interactive television client application, and/or Internet service provider client) loaded on a device to command and direct communications enabled by the device.
- a software application e.g., operating system, browser application, micro browser application, server application, proxy application, gateway application, tunneling application, e-mail application; instant messaging client, online service provider client application, interactive television client application, and/or Internet service provider client
- Other examples include a computer program, a piece of code, an applet, a Java applet, a script, an instruction, another device, or some combination thereof. for independently or collectively instructing the device to interact and operate as desired.
- the controller may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to a device.
- the controller e.g., software application, computer program
- a storage media or device e.g., ROM, magnetic diskette, or propagated signal
- a general or special purpose programmable computer such that if the storage media or device is read by a computer system, the functions described herein are performed.
- a user is associated with an instant messaging online identity.
- the instant messaging online identity may be maintained at a remote location by an instant messaging service provider.
- a user may subscribe to an instant messaging online identity with a commercial instant messaging service provider, such as those provided by America Online, Inc., Yahoo, Inc., Microsoft, Inc., and other instant messaging service providers.
- a user may be a part of an enterprise instant messaging service and may have an instant messaging online identity as part of the enterprise system, such as a corporate instant messaging service.
- the instant messaging online identity may be part of both a commercially available instant message service provider and an enterprise instant message provider.
- the user may have an instant messaging online identity in a point-to-point (“P2P”) instant messaging system.
- P2P point-to-point
- the instant messaging online identity may be used to access one or more features or services, for example, through submission of the online identity and an associated password.
- the online identity may include a set of alphanumeric characters, symbols, tokens, or other types of online identities.
- a screen name may be used as the online identity.
- the instant messaging online identity typically is associated with information related to the user, such as a user's profile.
- the user's profile may include the user's preferences and a user-defined list of other co-users or co-subscribers, which may be called a user's buddy list.
- a user's buddy list may be maintained with or accessible as part of a user's profile and may be made accessible using a user interface (VI) that provides the online status and capabilities of certain screen names, i.e., “buddies,” identified by the user.
- VIP user interface
- the instant message service provider may inform the user whether or not identified buddies are online, i.e., currently accessing the instant messaging service provider, enterprise host, or PTP node, as the case may be.
- the instant message service provider also informs any other user who has identified the user as a buddy that the user is currently online.
- a buddy list may be used to facilitate instant messaging communications between users. For example, a user can activate an instant messaging user interface that is pre-addressed to a buddy simply by selecting the screen name of an online buddy from the buddy list.
- the first user generally initiates instant messaging communications by activating a blank instant messaging conversation interface and then addressing that interface to the online identity (e.g., screen name) of the intended recipient.
- the online identity e.g., screen name
- a user may look up the screen name of an intended recipient using the intended recipient's e-mail address or other means.
- the participant list may include a “buddy list” that lists other co-users of one or more instant messaging systems.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary buddy list 200 .
- a buddy list interface 200 for a given user displays the screen names of user-defined co-users of an instant messaging system with which the given user regularly communicates.
- the co-users form a buddy list for the given user. Communications with one of the co-users may be initiated through selection of the corresponding identifier (e.g., screen name) for the co-user from the buddy list.
- the co-users may have been added to the buddy list by the given user manually using identifiers of the co-users in the instant messaging system that are known to the given user at the time of addition.
- the buddy list interface 200 includes a text box 20 S that contains the buddy list for the given user, who is identified by a screen name “AOLUser,” as indicated in the title bar 203 of the buddy list interface 200 .
- the buddy list in the buddy list interface 200 includes multiple screen names 210 a - 210 e . More particularly, the buddy list includes the screen name “Friend1” 210 a , the screen name “Friend2” 210 b , the screen name “Mom” 210 c , the screen name “Dad” 210 d , and the screen name “Sister” 210 e.
- the screen names within the buddy list shown by buddy list interface 200 are organized into multiple buddy groups 215 a - 215 c . Each screen name within the buddy list is associated with at least one of the buddy groups 215 a - 215 c .
- the buddy list includes a “Buddies” buddy group 21 Sa, a “Family” buddy group 215 b , and an “Offline” buddy group 215 c .
- the screen name 210 a appears below the heading for the buddy group 215 a because the screen name 210 a has been associated with the buddy group 215 a and the corresponding user is present, that is, logged into the instant messaging system and available to send and receive instant messages.
- each of the buddy groups 215 a and 215 b indicates the number of buddies in the group currently logged into the instant messaging system, as well as the total number of buddies in the group. For example, two out of the two members of the buddy group 215 a are logged into the instant messaging system for which the buddy list interface 200 is displayed.
- the heading for the “Offline” buddy group 215 c indicates the number of other users on the buddy list that are not logged into the system (i.e., 0) and the total number of buddies on the buddy list (i.e., 5).
- screen names of the users are moved from the “Offline” buddy group 215 c to one of the other buddy groups 215 a or 215 b.
- the buddy list interface 200 also includes controls 220 that enable the given user to communicate with the co-users corresponding to the screen names 210 a - 210 c .
- the given user may send instant messages, chat invitations, or e-mail messages to the communications identities referenced in the buddy list through use of the controls 220 .
- the controls 220 also enable the user to obtain information describing the co-users, as well as to modify the set of co-users referenced in the buddy list interface 200 .
- the buddy list interface 200 includes controls 225 that enable the given user to access other information not directly related to sending and receiving instant messages.
- the given user may use the controls to access e-mail messages or other special features of the instant messaging system.
- the given user also may use the controls 225 to modify preferences for the buddy list interface 200 .
- the interfaces enable the user to select a subset of the instant messaging sessions to transfer from among multiple instant messaging sessions.
- FIG. 3A an instant messaging session transfer interface 300 is illustrated.
- the instant messaging session transfer interface 300 includes a listing of the current instant messaging sessions 305 a - 305 c .
- the current instant messaging sessions 305 a - 305 c may be presented with corresponding metadata-type or bibliographic information such as, for example, the co-user's online identity or alias (e.g., screen name) 307 , the date the instant messaging session was opened 308 , and the time the instant messaging session started 309 .
- Other metadata-type or bibliographic information also may be maintained and made perceivable to the user to identify a particular instant messaging session.
- Other metadata-type or bibliographic information may include the duration of the instant messaging session, the state of the co-user (e.g., active, idle, or away), and keywords from the session.
- the user In the case where the user is only signed in to one other instant messaging controller on one other device, when the user selects one or more of the instant messaging sessions for transfer (step 105 ) the selected instant messaging sessions are transferred to the instant messaging controller on that device (step 115 ). However, if the user is signed on to more than one other instant messaging controller on more than one other device, a device selection box 310 is presented to the user so the user can select which device or devices 315 a and 315 b to transfer the selected instant messaging sessions.
- FIG. 3A illustrates an exemplary implementation of the user initiating the transfer of the instant messaging sessions from the instant messaging controller on an incumbent device at which the listed instant messaging sessions currently are made perceivable and from which those sessions may be transferred responsive to user manipulation of the interface.
- the user has selected to transfer the instant messaging session 30 Sb with Friend2. Since the user is signed on to multiple other devices, a device selection box 310 is presented to the user to enable the user to select either or both of the devices 315 a and 315 b to send the instant messaging session. For instance, the user may be conducting the instant messaging session with Friend2 from an instant messaging controller on a desktop computer.
- the user selects PDA 315 b from the device selection box 310 .
- the selected instant messaging session 305 b is transferred to the instant messaging controller on the PDA (step 115 ) and the instant messaging session is made perceivable using the instant messaging controller on the PDA (step 120 ).
- the instant messaging controller on the PDA receives the entire session history including some or all of the text of conversation between the user and Friend2.
- a new instant messaging conversation interface is instantiated on the instant messaging controller on the PDA and the conversation interface is populated with the transferred instant messaging session.
- the user may designate a portion of the text of the instant message that is to be transferred. For example, upon initiating the transfer of an instant messaging session, the text of the session may be presented to the user. The user may select all or a portion of the text to transfer by highlighting the desired using a cursor control device. The designated text is then transferred to the instant messaging controller on the later-invoked device.
- FIG. 3B illustrates the exemplary implementation of the user initiating the transfer of the instant messaging sessions from the instant messaging controller on the later-invoked device that is going to receive the transferred instant messaging sessions from one or more other instant messaging controllers on other devices.
- An instant messaging session transfer interface 300 includes a listing of the current instant messaging sessions 305 a - 305 c identified by metadata or bibliographic-type information. The transfer interface 300 enables the user to select one or more of the instant messaging sessions 305 a - 305 c to receive.
- the transfer interface 300 also may include a device selection box 320 to enable the user to select the device 325 a or 325 b from which to receive the selected instant messaging session if the session is mirrored at multiple other instant messaging controllers on multiple other devices 325 a and 325 b.
- Enabling the user to select the device 325 a or 325 b from which to receive the selected instant messaging session may be advantageous, for example, if one of the devices 325 a or 325 b has a more complete instant messaging session than the other device. For instance, laptop 325 b may only have a partial instant messaging session 30 Sb because the instant messaging controller on the laptop 325 b was launched after the instant messaging session had begun on the instant messaging controller on the desktop 325 a .
- the device with the most complete instant messaging session may be distinguished from other devices using a visual identifier. Additionally or alternatively, the device with the most complete instant messaging session may be auto-selected for use in the transfer.
- Enabling the user to initiate the transfer of a subset of instant messaging sessions from among multiple instant messaging sessions from the receiving instant messaging controller on the later-invoked device is advantageous, for example, in the event the user walks away from the device where the instant messaging session was taking place. For example, if the user was conducting an instant messaging session with Friend2 305 b from his desktop computer 325 a and the user walked away from the desktop computer 325 a before transferring the instant messaging session to his PDA, then the user could still initiate the transfer of the session from the PDA to enable continued participation in or review of the conversation from the user's PDA
- FIG. 3C illustrates an exemplary implementation of the user initiating the transfer of more that one or all of the current instant messaging sessions.
- An instant messaging transfer interface 300 includes a listing of the current instant messaging sessions 305 a - 305 c identified by metadata or bibliographic-type information.
- the user has selected all three of the current instant messaging sessions 305 a - 30 Sc for transfer concurrently. The selection may be made using a cursor control device (e.g., a mouse) selection or manipulation or using radio button or checkbox selection (not shown).
- a cursor control device e.g., a mouse
- the transfer interface 300 also may include a device selection box 320 to enable the user to select the device 325 a or 325 b from which to receive the selected instant messaging session if the session is mirrored at multiple other instant messaging controllers on multiple other devices 325 a and 325 b.
- the instant messaging transfer interfaces described above with respect to FIGS. 3A-3C may be triggered or invoked in different ways.
- the transfer interfaces may be invoked manually by an input or an action of the user.
- the transfer interfaces may be invoked manually using a menu option on a toolbar within the instant messaging controller or by a right-click of a cursor control device that invokes a drop-down menu with an option to instantiate the transfer interface.
- the transfer interfaces may be invoked automatically based on a determined event, such as the user signing on to an instant messaging controller at another device for FIG. 3A or the device at which the transfer interface appears for FIGS. 3B and 3C .
- an instant messaging session may be transferred from one instant messaging controller on one device to another instant messaging controller on another device using an instant messaging conversation interface.
- FIG. 4A illustrates an instant messaging conversation interface 400 that is used to conduct an instant messaging session.
- the instant messaging conversation interface 400 includes a “From” portion 405 that lists the user who initiated the instant messaging session, a “To” portion 410 that lists the co-user with whom the user is exchanging instant messages, and an instant messaging conversation portion 415 that displays a chronological log of the instant messages exchanged between the user and co-user.
- the interface 400 also includes an instant messaging session transfer portion 420 .
- the instant messaging session transfer portion 420 is configured to enable the user to select one or more devices with which to transfer some or all of the instant messaging session represented by the instant messaging conversation interface 400 , which includes the transfer of the chronological log of instant messages exchanged between the user and the co-user.
- the instant messaging session transfer portion 420 includes a drop-down menu 425 that, when selected, reveals a scrollable window 430 that lists the devices 435 a and 435 b to which the instant messaging session can be transferred.
- the user is logged on to two other instant messaging controllers, one on a laptop 435 a and one on a PDA 435 b .
- the drop-down menu 425 and the scrollable window 430 may list just that one device or they may not list any devices at all and the instant messaging session may be transferred to the one device upon selection of the instant messaging transfer portion 420 .
- an instant messaging transfer portion and a drop-down menu in an instant messaging conversation interface may be used to select an instant messaging session to receive or pull into the conversation interface, where the instant messaging session currently resides only on other instant messaging controllers on other devices.
- the instant messaging transfer portion may appear only if the instant messaging session is available at the other instant messaging controller for transfer.
- an instant messaging conversation interface 400 includes a “From” portion 405 that lists the user who initiated the instant messaging session, a “To” portion 410 that lists the co-user with whom the user is exchanging instant messages, and an instant messaging conversation portion 415 that displays a chronological log of the instant messages exchanged between the user and co-user.
- the interface 400 also includes an instant messaging session transfer portion 420 .
- the instant messaging session transfer portion 420 is configured to enable the user to select one or more devices from which to receive some or all of an instant messaging session into the conversation interface 400 , which includes receiving the chronological log of instant messages exchanged between the user and the co-user.
- the received instant messaging session is populated in the instant messaging conversation portion 415 .
- the transfer portion 420 may only be enabled and/or made perceivable if the instant messaging session is available at the other instant messaging controller for transfer.
- the user is logged on to two other instant messaging controllers, one on a laptop 435 a and one on a PDA 435 b . If the user had been logged on to only one other device, the drop-down menu 425 and the scrollable window 430 may list just that one device or they may not list any devices at all, and the instant messaging session may be received from the one device upon selection of the instant messaging transfer portion 420 .
- the user may designate preferences as to which instant messaging sessions are “mirrored.” For instance, when an instance messaging session has been transferred to another instant messaging controller on another device, the text of the continued instant message exchange between the user and the co-user may be perceivable on both the device that sent the instant messaging session and the device that transferred the instant messaging session. However, the user may not desire to have the conversation continue to be made perceivable on the incumbent device. Either prior to or after the transfer of the instant messaging session the user may be presented with an interface that requests whether the user wants to continue the mirrored conversation on the incumbent device. Referring to FIG. 5A , an interface 500 is displayed which requests whether the user wants to have the instant messaging session continue on the device from which the instant messaging session is being transferred.
- the instant messaging session continues to be made perceivable on the device that sent the instant messaging session. If the user selects the “No” button 510 , then the instant messaging session is no longer made perceivable on the device that sent the instant messaging session.
- the instant messaging session may no longer be made perceivable if the state of the instant messaging controller and/or the device is idle or away.
- An idle state is when the user has not been active on the instant messaging controller or the device for a configurable period of time.
- An away state is when the user manually sets the instant messaging controller in a non-active state. The user may set preferences regarding whether to continue mirroring transferred instant messaging sessions during an idle and/or an away state. Referring to FIG. 5B , an interface 550 is displayed to solicit feedback to indicate whether the user wants to continue viewing the instant messaging session after an idle or an away state.
- the instant messaging session continues to be made perceivable on the device even when the instant messaging controller and/or the device is in an idle or an away state. If the user selects the “No” button 560 , the instant messaging session ceases being perceivable when the instant messaging controller and/or the device is in an idle or an away state. Thus, the instant messaging session may continue to be mirrored and perceivable on the device until they are interrupted by an idle or an away state at which time the instant messaging session is no longer made perceivable.
- the user may configure global settings specify on a session-by-session basis that apply to more than one session. For example, the user may specify a global setting that all transferred instant messaging sessions are to be copied or conversely that all transferred instant messaging sessions are to be transitioned and, therefore, not copied. Moreover, a user may want to set up global preferences on a device-by-device basis such that, for example, transfers to a PDA default to transition while transfers from PDA merely copy.
- the timeline includes an event column 600 , a desktop user interface column 605 and a PDA user interface column 610 .
- the first event is when the online identity, AOL User, is logged onto an instant messaging controller on a desktop computing device and begins and instant messaging session with co-user, Friend2 ( 600 a ).
- the user interface on the desktop ( 605 a ) displays an instant messaging conversation interface with a disabled transfer session button.
- the transfer session button is disable because AOL User is only signed on to one instant messaging controller and there are no other instant messaging controllers available to transfer the instant messaging session.
- the instant messaging conversation interface portion displays the text of the instant messaging session.
- AOL User invokes the instant messaging controller on the PDA ( 600 b ).
- the instant messaging conversation interface ( 605 b ) now display an enabled transfer session button because another instant messaging controller is available to transfer the instant messaging session with Friend2.
- the conversation interface portion continues to display the ongoing conversation of the instant messaging session.
- the PDA displays an instant messaging session transfer interface 61 ⁇ b , which lists the instant messaging session with Friend2 as available for transfer to the PDA.
- the desktop ( 605 ) may display an instant messaging session transfer interface (not shown) that enables AOL User to transfer this instant messaging session with Friend2 as well as other instant messaging sessions with other co-users.
- the user transfers the instant messaging session to the PDA so that the instant messaging session is mirrored on both the desktop and the PDA.
- the interface on the desktop indicates that the instant messaging session is blocked due to an idle state and in the instant messaging conversation interface ( 610 c ) on the PDA the instant messaging session conversation continues.
- the ongoing instant messaging session will not trigger or transition the desktop from the idle state to an active state. For instance, a host system setting may redirect messages from Friend2 only to the PDA once the desktop is in an idle state.
- the instant messaging conversation interface ( 605 d ) may be refreshed so that the entire conversation is perceivable on the desktop.
- the instant messaging controller and/or the device returns to an active state, the instant messaging sessions may be refreshed automatically.
- the user may designate which of the one or more interrupted instant messaging sessions to refresh.
- an exemplary selection interface 675 illustrates one or more instant messaging sessions that the user may select on an individual or on a collective basis to refresh.
- the legacy instant messaging conversation interface when an instant messaging session is transferred back to a device, the legacy instant messaging conversation interface may be refreshed with the entire instant messaging session or the legacy instant messaging conversation interface may be closed and a new instant messaging conversation interface instantiated and populated with the transferred back instant messaging window.
- user-inspired messages may be made perceivable on all instant messaging controllers on all devices. This ensures that the user is able to view an entire instant messaging conversation of user-inspired messages and co-user messages on all of the instant messaging controllers and not just on the instant messaging controller from which the user is composing and sending the user-inspired messages.
