Definitions
- the present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to holograms and particularly relate to controlling the side lobes in holograms.
- a hologram is a recording of a light field, with a typical light field comprising a pattern of optical fringes generated by interference between two beams of laser light.
- the hologram is made up of physical fringes, where physical fringes comprise variations in the refractive index or absorbance of the holographic recording medium.
- the holographic medium will diffract laser light with the same angle and pattern as the second beam of laser light used to record the hologram.
- the intensity of the diffracted light is determined by the efficiency of the hologram, where the efficiency of the hologram is the fraction of the light of the first beam of laser light that is diffracted in the direction of the second beam of laser light; hologram efficiency may be in a range from 0-100%.
- the efficiency of a hologram depends on both the angle and the wavelength of light used to illuminate the holographic medium.
- Multiple holograms may be recorded in a single holographic recording medium, the multiple holograms comprising a multiplexed hologram.
- a pattern of optical fringes may be generated by the interference of two beams of laser light; the two beams of laser light may be created by splitting a single beam of laser light.
- the two beams of laser light are typically referred to as the object beam and the reference beam.
- Hologram recording is typically designed such that, during playback, the recorded hologram is illuminated with laser light recreating the reference beam and the object beam is then replicated by the hologram.
- Holograms are recorded in a holographic recording medium which may be a silver halide photographic emulsion, dichromated gelatin, photopolymer, or other physical media.
- Silver halide emulsions record a hologram as a pattern of absorbance and reflectance of light.
- Dichromated gelatin and photopolymer both record a hologram as a pattern of varying refractive index. Recording a hologram as a pattern of refractive index is advantageous since all of the illuminating laser light may theoretically leave the hologram; no light is necessarily absorbed by the hologram.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- a challenge in the design of wearable heads-up displays is to minimize the bulk of the face-worn apparatus will still providing displayed content with sufficient visual quality.

- a hologram is a repeating pattern of physical fringes that, when illuminated with coherent light with the same wavelength and angle as one of the lasers used to record the fringes, diffracts at least a portion of the incident light at an angle equal to the angle of the other laser used to record the physical fringes; the wavelength of the light remains unchanged.
- Physical fringes may comprise local maxima (or minima) of refractive index within a recorded hologram.
- Physical fringes are the physical structures that comprise the recorded hologram.
- a holographic optical element comprises a hologram.
- a HOE may comprise one or more cover sheets.
- a cover sheet comprises a transparent material physically coupled to a surface of the hologram, cover sheets are advantageous as they may improve the strength, durability, scratch resistance, or ease of adhesion of the HOE.
- a hologram may be recorded within a holographic recording medium (HRM).
- HRM comprises photosensitive material which undergoes a chemical or physical change upon exposure to light. When a HRM is exposed to a pattern of optical fringes, the photosensitive material records the pattern of optical fringes as a pattern of physical fringes.
- HRMs are typically physically coupled to at least one transparent support covering at least one surface of the HRM.
- the transparent support maintains the shape of the HRM before, during, and after hologram recording; the transparent support may also protect the HRM from damage.
- Non-exclusive examples of materials which may comprise a transparent support include glass, polycarbonate, polystyrene, acrylic, or other optical plastic materials.
- HRMs are typically flat, planar materials with a thickness less than 0.1 mm; however, HRMs may have a thickness of up to 1 mm and may be curved.
- a curved surface may be a spherically curved surface; a spherically curved surface is curved around a center of curvature.
- a curved surface may be a cylindrically curved surface; a cylindrically curved surface is curved around an axis of curvature.
- the center or axis of curvature, as appropriate, of the HRM may be located at a distance of between 1 and 10 centimeters, between 10 and 50 cm, or between 50 and 100 cm from the surface of the HRM.
- a side lobe in a hologram is a local maximum adjacent to the primary peak in a plot of hologram efficiency versus either wavelength or angle of incidence. Side lobes may arise from the sharp difference in refractive index modulation ( ⁇ n) between where the hologram is recorded within the HOE and where the hologram is not recorded within the transparent support. ⁇ n (i.e., refractive index modulation) is the difference between the highest and lowest refractive indices in a recorded hologram.
- ⁇ n as a function of depth through the hologram can be described by a square-wave function.
- depth is the distance from a surface of the hologram to a point within the hologram measured in the z direction, where the z direction is normal to the surface of the plane, cylinder, or sphere of the hologram film (for planar, cylindrical, and spherical holograms, respectively).
- a sinc function (an abbreviation of “sine cardinal function”) is a mathematical function that describes the Fourier transform of a square wave function; a sinc squared function is the square of a sinc function.
- a sinc squared function possesses a primary peak and multiple side lobes, therefore a hologram with a ⁇ n profile equivalent to a square-wave function also has side lobes.
- a hologram recorded at a particular wavelength will be responsive to wavelengths outside the desired primary playback wavelength and therefore produce playback light when illuminated with light with a wavelength higher or lower than the wavelength used to record the hologram.
- Playback is the process of illuminating a hologram with light that replicates the reference beam in order to replicate the object beam.
- the reference beam is one of the laser beams used to record the hologram, the object beam is another laser used to record the hologram.
- a hologram recorded with green laser light could produce playback light when illuminated with blue laser light if the blue laser light is of a wavelength corresponding to one of the side lobes of the hologram recorded with green laser light; the same green hologram may also produce playback light when illuminating the hologram with red laser light matching another side lobe of the green hologram.
- the playback light produced by the side lobes will have a different playback angle than the playback light produced by the primary peak.
- additional playback beams at multiple angles due to side lobes is problematic when a hologram is used in a holographic display, including a holographic WHUD. If the additional playback beams are able to enter the eye of the user, the additional playback beams create secondary visible images displaced in space from the primary image being produced by the display. These additional images are typically lower in intensity than the main image and are referred to as “ghost images”. Ghost images may reduce the resolution of the display by blurring any images produced by the display, and ghost images may also occlude the primary images of the display if the ghost image produced by one portion of the primary image overlaps another portion of the primary image.
- Ghost image formation may be reduced or eliminated by reducing or eliminating, respectively, the presence of side lobes in the hologram.
- Softening the edges of the ⁇ n profile as a function of depth reduces the strength of the side lobes.
- Apodizing the ⁇ n profile as a function of depth significantly reduces or eliminates the presence of side lobes.
- An apodized hologram is a hologram with a minimum value of ⁇ n at both the maximum and minimum depth of the hologram, a maximum value of ⁇ n at some intermediate depth of the hologram, and no observable local maxima or minima of ⁇ n through the depth of the hologram.
- the side lobes could be accentuated by anti-apodizing the ⁇ n profile as a function of depth.
- a hologram with controlled side lobes comprises a hologram with side lobes that differ from the side lobes present in a hologram recorded with a single reference beam; in other words a hologram with controlled side lobes comprises a hologram with side lobes that are either greater or lesser in magnitude than the side lobes described by a sinc function.
- Described herein is a method of producing holograms with controlled side lobes, the resulting holograms, and components, systems, and devices comprising holograms with controlled side lobes.
- FIG. 1 is a flow-diagram showing a method 100 of producing a hologram with controlled side lobes 100 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- Method 100 includes five acts 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , and 105 though those of skill in the art will appreciate that in alternative embodiments certain acts may be omitted and/or additional acts may be added. Those of skill in the art will also appreciate that the illustrated order of the acts is shown for exemplary purposes only and may change in alternative embodiments.
- a recording substrate comprises a first surface and a second surface.
- a master hologram is a recorded hologram that may be used repeatedly to replicate a hologram in a second (or copy) holographic recording medium (HRM).
- Replication is the process of recording a copy hologram using a master and includes contact and non-contact copying, with contact copying being more typically used for mass production.
- the master is affixed to a first surface of a recording substrate.
- a recording substrate is an inflexible transparent substrate that defines the shape of a hologram during recording.
- Typical recording substrates are flat and planar, however recording substrates may be at least partially spherically curved and/or at least partially cylindrically curved; typical recording substrate materials include glass and polycarbonate.
- a HRM is affixed to a second surface of the recording substrate, where the second surface is opposite the first surface.
- a reference beam is passed through the HRM, the substrate, and the master. The master diffracts at least a portion of the reference beam to produce a diffracted object beam. The diffracted object beam and the reference beam interfere within the HRM, recording a hologram within the HRM that is substantively similar to the hologram recorded within the master.
- Contact copying is advantageous because the minimal distance between the master and the copy ensures that the path length difference between the reference beam and diffracted object beam is very small, allowing the use of less expensive laser light sources with shorter coherence lengths. Since contact copying includes physically coupling the master and copy hologram to the same substrate, motion of the copy hologram relative to the master hologram during recording is essentially eliminated and stringent vibration control is no longer needed.
- a master hologram is mounted on the first surface of the recording substrate. Mounting the master hologram on the recording substrate includes physically coupling the master hologram to the first surface of the recording substrate.
- a HRM is mounted on the recording substrate.
- Mounting the HRM on the recording substrate includes physically coupling the HRM to the second surface of the recording substrate, wherein the second surface of the recording substrate is opposite the first surface of the recording substrate.
- the master hologram is replicated within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes.
- the at least two reference beams may each be of a different wavelength than each other reference beam.
- the at least two reference beams may each be of a different angle than each other reference beam.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram wherein the intensity of the side lobes is less than 25%, less than 10%, or less than one percent of the intensity of the primary hologram peak.
- Side lobes with minimal intensity relative to the primary hologram peak may be produced by apodizing the distribution of ⁇ n as a function of depth within the hologram.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram wherein the intensity of at least one of the side lobes is at least 25% of, at least 50% of, or greater than the intensity of the primary hologram peak.
- Side lobes with maximal intensity relative to the primary hologram peak may be produced by anti-apodizing the distribution of ⁇ n as a function of depth within the hologram.
- Replicating the master hologram with at least two reference beams will produce at least two diffracted object beams; each of the at least two diffracted object beams will interfere with each of the at least two reference beams to produce at least two sets of optical fringes (at least a portion of each set of optical fringes is located within an internal volume of the HRM).
- the light diffracted by the master hologram follows the diffraction grating equation:
- ⁇ is the wavelength of the laser light
- ⁇ is the lateral grating spacing (of the optical fringes)
- ⁇ 1 is the angle of incidence (relative to the normal)
- ⁇ 2 is the angle of diffraction (relative to the normal)
- n is an integer.
- the lateral spacing of the fringes produced by interference between incident light and any light produced by the master hologram will be the same; any changes in incident wavelength or angle will affect the angle of the diffracted light (and therefore the angle of the resulting fringes) but not the spacing of the resulting fringes.
- the fringe spacing is always the same when replicating a single master with two laser beams, thus the at least two sets of optical fringes will both possess the same fringe spacing as the master hologram.
- the at least two sets of optical fringes may be recorded within the HRM to form at least two sets of physical fringes.
- replicating the master hologram with at least two reference beams includes illuminating the HRM and the master hologram with at least two reference beams; during replication the master hologram and the HRM are separated from one another by the recording substrate.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM includes passing each reference beam through the HRM, the recording substrate, and the master hologram.
- Replicating a transmission hologram includes passing each reference beam through the master hologram prior to passing each reference beam through the HRM.
- Replicating a reflection hologram includes passing each reference beam through the HRM prior to passing each reference beam through the master hologram.
- Replication may include recording a pattern of fringes within HRM that is substantively similar to the pattern of fringes within the master hologram.
- each reference beam possesses a phase within the HRM and each object beam possesses a phase within the HRM. Both the reference beam and the object beam must pass through the recording substrate, but the path length through the recording substrate of the reference beam is not necessarily equal to the path length through the recording substrate of the object beam.
- the difference in path length between the object beam and the reference beam causes a phase shift between the object beam and the reference beam within the HRM.
- the phase of the optical fringes produced by interference between the object beam and the reference beam within the HRM depends on the phase shift between the object beam and the reference beam.
- the term “meta-interference” refers to interference between sets of fringes; each set of fringes may be the product of interference between each reference beam and the respective object beam diffracted from each reference beam. Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams produces at least two sets of optical fringes that undergo meta-interference.
- the meta-interference of the at least two sets of optical fringes increases ⁇ n in regions of constructive meta-interference and decreases ⁇ n in regions of destructive meta-interference. The magnitude of the increase or decrease in ⁇ n depends on the magnitude of the constructive or destructive meta-interference, respectively.
- the position of the increased or decreased ⁇ n within the HRM depends on the net phase shift of each set of fringes, where the net phase shift of a set of optical fringes is the relative difference in phase between that set of optical fringes and another set of optical fringes within the HRM.
- Control over the side lobes of a hologram requires control over the positions of high and low ⁇ n within the HRM.
- Control over the positions of high and low ⁇ n within the HRM may be achieved by controlling the precise angle and wavelength of each reference beam employed during replication.
- the angle and wavelength of each reference beam determines the phase shift of each object beam, and therefore the phase of each set of optical fringes, the net phase shift between each set of optical fringes, the meta-interference between sets of optical fringes, and thereby the positions of high and low ⁇ n within the HRM.
- FIG. 2 shows a cross-sectional view of hologram with controlled side lobes 200 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.
- Hologram with controlled side lobes 200 may be produced by method 100 .
- Hologram with controlled side lobes 200 comprises first set of fringes 210 and second set of fringes 220 .
- First set of fringes 210 and second set of fringes 220 may be formed by replicating a master hologram with two reference beams.
- First set of fringes 210 and second set of fringes 220 have the same spacing but different angles, which causes first set of fringes 210 and second set of fringes 220 to interfere with each other.
- first set of fringes 210 and second set of fringes 220 interfere destructively, reducing ⁇ n to a minimum.
- first set of fringes 210 and second set of fringes 220 interfere constructively, increasing ⁇ n to a maximum.
- ⁇ n increases smoothly from either surface of the hologram towards the maximum.
- Hologram with controlled side lobes 200 is therefore apodized and will have minimal, if any, side lobes.
- the sets of fringes must have precisely matched spacing and phase.
- First set of fringes 210 may comprise an initial set of fringes.
- Second set of fringes 220 may comprise an additional set of fringes.
- hologram with controlled side lobes 200 may comprise n sets of fringes (where n is equal to or greater than 2) with one initial set of fringes and n ⁇ 1 additional sets of fringes, the various sets of fringes having different angles and, or different phase shifts from those of the other sets of fringes.
- hologram 200 may be carried on or by another structure, and such other structure may, for example, provide at least some additional optical function.
- one or more holograms may be carried on or by a waveguide or lightguide structure and may serve as, for example, an in-coupler, out-coupler, or exit pupil expander for such waveguide or lightguide structure.
- the term “hologram” may include a HRM layer and a combination of optional additional layers or structures such as protective material, waveguide/lightguide structures, substrates, etc. depending on the specific implementation.
- said hologram with controlled side lobes may be carried on or by other structures or layers, or may itself carry other structures or layers, depending on the specific implementation.
- replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating a wavelength-multiplexed master hologram with at least two reference beams to produce a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes.
- a wavelength-multiplexed hologram is a hologram comprising multiple wavelength-specific holograms. Each wavelength-specific hologram comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram diffracts laser light of a specific wavelength; a wavelength-specific hologram cannot diffract light of a wavelength outside of the spectral bandwidth of the wavelength-specific hologram.
- Wavelength-multiplexed holograms are advantageous since a wavelength-multiplexed hologram may be employed as a holographic combiner in a WHUD with a full-color display; single-wavelength holograms may be employed in monochromatic displays.
- a wavelength-multiplexed master hologram may be replicated to produce a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes.
- a wavelength-multiplexed master hologram may comprise a blue master hologram, a green master hologram, and a red master hologram.
- a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes may comprise a blue hologram with controlled side lobes, a green hologram with controlled side lobes, and a red hologram with controlled side lobes.
- a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master hologram with at least two blue beams of laser light, at least two green beams of laser light, and at least two red beams of laser light.
- Each beam of laser light used to replicate a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes from a wavelength-multiplexed possesses a respective wavelength.
- a blue wavelength-specific hologram with controlled sidelobes comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master with two blue beams of laser light, where the two blue beams of laser light differ in wavelength by a first ⁇ .
- a green wavelength-specific hologram with controlled sidelobes comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master with two green beams of laser light, where the two green beams of laser light differ in wavelength by a second ⁇ .
- a red wavelength-specific hologram with controlled sidelobes comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master with two red beams of laser light, where the two red beams of laser light differ in wavelength by a third ⁇ .
- the first ⁇ may be greater than, less than, or equal to the second ⁇ .
- the second ⁇ may be greater than, less than, or equal to the third ⁇ .
- a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes, where each wavelength-specific hologram has the same intensity of side lobes relative to the intensity of the primary hologram peak, may be replicated when the first ⁇ is highest and the third ⁇ is lowest.
- the master hologram possesses a Bragg peak wavelength.
- Each reference beam possesses a reference beam wavelength.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes wherein the difference between the Bragg peak wavelength of the master hologram and reference beam wavelength of each reference beam is less than 2 nanometers.
- Replicating the master hologram with a reference beam wherein the difference between the Bragg peak wavelength of the master hologram and the reference beam wavelength is small is advantageous since the efficiency of the master hologram may decrease significantly at wavelengths greater than 2 nanometers from the Bragg peak wavelength of the master hologram. Significant changes in master hologram efficiency may cause significant changes in the phase of any laser light diffracted by the master hologram, and therefore make it difficult to control the phase of the initial set of optical fringes and the net phase shift of the additional sets of optical fringes within the HRM.
- the bandwidth of a hologram is the range of angles and wavelengths of incident laser light that the hologram efficiently diffracts; bandwidth includes angular bandwidth and wavelength bandwidth.
- the angular bandwidth of a hologram is the range of angles of incident laser light that satisfies the Bragg condition for the hologram and therefore may be efficiently diffracted by the hologram.
- the wavelength bandwidth of a hologram is the range of wavelengths of incident laser light that satisfies the Bragg condition for the hologram and therefore may be efficiently diffracted by the hologram.
- a hologram with a narrow angular bandwidth also possesses a narrow wavelength bandwidth and a hologram with a broad angular bandwidth also possesses a broad wavelength bandwidth.
- any process that increases or decreases the angular bandwidth of a hologram will typically also proportionally increase or decrease (respectively) the wavelength bandwidth of a hologram.
- bandwidth therefore may refer either to the angular bandwidth or the wavelength bandwidth of a hologram unless otherwise specified as “angular bandwidth” or “wavelength bandwidth”.
- Each wavelength-specific hologram comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram possesses its own bandwidth.
- the bandwidth of the blue hologram may be greater than or less than the bandwidth of the green hologram
- the bandwidth of the green hologram may be greater than or less than the bandwidth of the red hologram.
- the phase shift introduced to the diffracted object beam by the master hologram due to the thickness of the master hologram depends on the bandwidth of the master hologram.
- a hologram with broader bandwidth will have a weaker dependence of phase shift on hologram thickness; varying the bandwidth of the wavelength-specific holograms allows further control of the phase shift of the respective diffracted object beams and therefore the side lobes of the resulting holograms.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram with at least two reference beams to record an initial set of fringes and at least one additional set of fringes within the HRM.
- the initial set of fringes possesses a phase within the HRM.
- Each additional set of fringes possesses a net phase shift relative to the initial set of fringes within the HRM. The net phase shift between each additional set of fringes and the initial set of fringes controls the meta-interference between each additional set of fringes and the initial set of fringes.
- defining a particular set of fringes as being an initial set of fringes is advantageous as such a definition establishes a common frame of reference for determining the phase of each set of fringes relative to each other set of fringes.
- a determination of the relative phase of each set of fringes may eliminate the need to determine the absolute phase of any set of fringes.
- Each set of fringes (initial or additional) will meta-interfere with each other set of fringes within the HRM. Constructive meta-interference between sets of fringes increases ⁇ n, while destructive meta-interference between sets of fringes decreases ⁇ n.
- the locations within the HRM where fringes meta-interfere constructively or destructively depends on the phase of the initial set of fringes within the HRM and the net phase shift of the at least one additional set of fringes within the HRM.
- the net phase shift of each additional set of fringes may be expressed in radians.
- the net phase shift of each additional set of fringes may be measured at a depth within the hologram equidistant from the first surface and the second surface of the HRM.

- a hologram with apodized ⁇ n comprises a hologram wherein ⁇ n is lowest at the shallowest and deepest depth within the hologram and wherein ⁇ n is highest at a depth between the shallowest and deepest depth within the hologram. In other words, ⁇ n is lowest at the first and second surface of the hologram and ⁇ n is highest at a depth between the first and second surface.

- ⁇ n within hologram with unmatched phase 300 b is therefore at a maximum at the highest and lowest depth of hologram with unmatched phase 300 b and at a minimum at the middle depth of hologram with unmatched phase 300 b ; hologram with unmatched phase 300 b is therefore anti-apodized and would show the strongest possible side lobes. This is advantageous if strong side lobes are desirable, however it is disadvantageous if minimal side lobes are desirable. Therefore, the phase of the diffracted object beams must be controlled during replication.

Abstract
Description
- The present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to holograms and particularly relate to controlling the side lobes in holograms.
- A hologram is a recording of a light field, with a typical light field comprising a pattern of optical fringes generated by interference between two beams of laser light. The hologram is made up of physical fringes, where physical fringes comprise variations in the refractive index or absorbance of the holographic recording medium.
- During hologram playback, at least a portion of the light field used to record a hologram may be recreated by illuminating the hologram with laser light. If the laser light comprises the same wavelength and angle as the first beam of laser light used to record the hologram, and the fringes have not been altered after recording, the holographic medium will diffract laser light with the same angle and pattern as the second beam of laser light used to record the hologram. The intensity of the diffracted light is determined by the efficiency of the hologram, where the efficiency of the hologram is the fraction of the light of the first beam of laser light that is diffracted in the direction of the second beam of laser light; hologram efficiency may be in a range from 0-100%. The efficiency of a hologram depends on both the angle and the wavelength of light used to illuminate the holographic medium. Multiple holograms may be recorded in a single holographic recording medium, the multiple holograms comprising a multiplexed hologram.
- A pattern of optical fringes may be generated by the interference of two beams of laser light; the two beams of laser light may be created by splitting a single beam of laser light. The two beams of laser light are typically referred to as the object beam and the reference beam. Hologram recording is typically designed such that, during playback, the recorded hologram is illuminated with laser light recreating the reference beam and the object beam is then replicated by the hologram.
- Holograms are recorded in a holographic recording medium which may be a silver halide photographic emulsion, dichromated gelatin, photopolymer, or other physical media. Silver halide emulsions record a hologram as a pattern of absorbance and reflectance of light. Dichromated gelatin and photopolymer both record a hologram as a pattern of varying refractive index. Recording a hologram as a pattern of refractive index is advantageous since all of the illuminating laser light may theoretically leave the hologram; no light is necessarily absorbed by the hologram.
- A head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head. A wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment. The “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment. Examples of wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, however, users also care a lot about aesthetics. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date employ large display components and, as a result, most wearable heads-up displays presented to date are considerably bulkier and less stylish than conventional eyeglass frames.
- A challenge in the design of wearable heads-up displays is to minimize the bulk of the face-worn apparatus will still providing displayed content with sufficient visual quality. There is a need in the art for wearable heads-up displays of more aesthetically-appealing design that are capable of providing high-quality images to the user without limiting the user's ability to see their external environment.

- The headings and Abstract of the Disclosure provided herein are for convenience only and do not interpret the scope or meaning of the embodiments.
- The various embodiments described herein provide systems, devices, and methods for side lobe control in holograms and are particularly well-suited for use in wearable heads-up displays (WHUDs).
- A hologram is a repeating pattern of physical fringes that, when illuminated with coherent light with the same wavelength and angle as one of the lasers used to record the fringes, diffracts at least a portion of the incident light at an angle equal to the angle of the other laser used to record the physical fringes; the wavelength of the light remains unchanged. Physical fringes may comprise local maxima (or minima) of refractive index within a recorded hologram. Physical fringes are the physical structures that comprise the recorded hologram.
- A holographic optical element (HOE) comprises a hologram. A HOE may comprise one or more cover sheets. A cover sheet comprises a transparent material physically coupled to a surface of the hologram, cover sheets are advantageous as they may improve the strength, durability, scratch resistance, or ease of adhesion of the HOE.
- A hologram may be recorded within a holographic recording medium (HRM). A HRM comprises photosensitive material which undergoes a chemical or physical change upon exposure to light. When a HRM is exposed to a pattern of optical fringes, the photosensitive material records the pattern of optical fringes as a pattern of physical fringes. HRMs are typically physically coupled to at least one transparent support covering at least one surface of the HRM. The transparent support maintains the shape of the HRM before, during, and after hologram recording; the transparent support may also protect the HRM from damage. Non-exclusive examples of materials which may comprise a transparent support include glass, polycarbonate, polystyrene, acrylic, or other optical plastic materials.
- HRMs are typically flat, planar materials with a thickness less than 0.1 mm; however, HRMs may have a thickness of up to 1 mm and may be curved. A curved surface may be a spherically curved surface; a spherically curved surface is curved around a center of curvature. A curved surface may be a cylindrically curved surface; a cylindrically curved surface is curved around an axis of curvature. The center or axis of curvature, as appropriate, of the HRM may be located at a distance of between 1 and 10 centimeters, between 10 and 50 cm, or between 50 and 100 cm from the surface of the HRM.
- A side lobe in a hologram is a local maximum adjacent to the primary peak in a plot of hologram efficiency versus either wavelength or angle of incidence. Side lobes may arise from the sharp difference in refractive index modulation (Δn) between where the hologram is recorded within the HOE and where the hologram is not recorded within the transparent support. Δn (i.e., refractive index modulation) is the difference between the highest and lowest refractive indices in a recorded hologram.
- In a typical hologram, Δn as a function of depth through the hologram can be described by a square-wave function. Within a hologram, depth is the distance from a surface of the hologram to a point within the hologram measured in the z direction, where the z direction is normal to the surface of the plane, cylinder, or sphere of the hologram film (for planar, cylindrical, and spherical holograms, respectively).
- Since the efficiency of the hologram with respect to either wavelength or angle is the Fourier transform of Δn as a function of depth, the efficiency response of a typical hologram is the Fourier transform of a square wave function. A sinc function (an abbreviation of “sine cardinal function”) is a mathematical function that describes the Fourier transform of a square wave function; a sinc squared function is the square of a sinc function. A sinc squared function possesses a primary peak and multiple side lobes, therefore a hologram with a Δn profile equivalent to a square-wave function also has side lobes.
- The presence of side lobes in a hologram may create a number of potential problems. A hologram recorded at a particular wavelength will be responsive to wavelengths outside the desired primary playback wavelength and therefore produce playback light when illuminated with light with a wavelength higher or lower than the wavelength used to record the hologram. Playback is the process of illuminating a hologram with light that replicates the reference beam in order to replicate the object beam. The reference beam is one of the laser beams used to record the hologram, the object beam is another laser used to record the hologram.
- For example, a hologram recorded with green laser light could produce playback light when illuminated with blue laser light if the blue laser light is of a wavelength corresponding to one of the side lobes of the hologram recorded with green laser light; the same green hologram may also produce playback light when illuminating the hologram with red laser light matching another side lobe of the green hologram. The playback light produced by the side lobes will have a different playback angle than the playback light produced by the primary peak.
- The creation of additional playback beams at multiple angles due to side lobes is problematic when a hologram is used in a holographic display, including a holographic WHUD. If the additional playback beams are able to enter the eye of the user, the additional playback beams create secondary visible images displaced in space from the primary image being produced by the display. These additional images are typically lower in intensity than the main image and are referred to as “ghost images”. Ghost images may reduce the resolution of the display by blurring any images produced by the display, and ghost images may also occlude the primary images of the display if the ghost image produced by one portion of the primary image overlaps another portion of the primary image.
- Ghost image formation may be reduced or eliminated by reducing or eliminating, respectively, the presence of side lobes in the hologram. Softening the edges of the Δn profile as a function of depth reduces the strength of the side lobes. Apodizing the Δn profile as a function of depth significantly reduces or eliminates the presence of side lobes. An apodized hologram is a hologram with a minimum value of Δn at both the maximum and minimum depth of the hologram, a maximum value of Δn at some intermediate depth of the hologram, and no observable local maxima or minima of Δn through the depth of the hologram. Alternatively, if side lobes are desired, the side lobes could be accentuated by anti-apodizing the Δn profile as a function of depth.
- A hologram with controlled side lobes comprises a hologram with side lobes that differ from the side lobes present in a hologram recorded with a single reference beam; in other words a hologram with controlled side lobes comprises a hologram with side lobes that are either greater or lesser in magnitude than the side lobes described by a sinc function.
- Described herein is a method of producing holograms with controlled side lobes, the resulting holograms, and components, systems, and devices comprising holograms with controlled side lobes.

FIG. 1 is a flow-diagram showing amethod 100 of producing a hologram with controlledside lobes 100 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods.Method 100 includes fiveacts - At 101, a recording substrate is provided. The recording substrate comprises a first surface and a second surface. A master hologram is a recorded hologram that may be used repeatedly to replicate a hologram in a second (or copy) holographic recording medium (HRM). Replication is the process of recording a copy hologram using a master and includes contact and non-contact copying, with contact copying being more typically used for mass production. In contact copying, the master is affixed to a first surface of a recording substrate.
- A recording substrate is an inflexible transparent substrate that defines the shape of a hologram during recording. Typical recording substrates are flat and planar, however recording substrates may be at least partially spherically curved and/or at least partially cylindrically curved; typical recording substrate materials include glass and polycarbonate. A HRM is affixed to a second surface of the recording substrate, where the second surface is opposite the first surface. A reference beam is passed through the HRM, the substrate, and the master. The master diffracts at least a portion of the reference beam to produce a diffracted object beam. The diffracted object beam and the reference beam interfere within the HRM, recording a hologram within the HRM that is substantively similar to the hologram recorded within the master.
- Contact copying is advantageous because the minimal distance between the master and the copy ensures that the path length difference between the reference beam and diffracted object beam is very small, allowing the use of less expensive laser light sources with shorter coherence lengths. Since contact copying includes physically coupling the master and copy hologram to the same substrate, motion of the copy hologram relative to the master hologram during recording is essentially eliminated and stringent vibration control is no longer needed.
- At 102, a master hologram is mounted on the first surface of the recording substrate. Mounting the master hologram on the recording substrate includes physically coupling the master hologram to the first surface of the recording substrate.
- At 103, a HRM is mounted on the recording substrate. Mounting the HRM on the recording substrate includes physically coupling the HRM to the second surface of the recording substrate, wherein the second surface of the recording substrate is opposite the first surface of the recording substrate.
- At 104, the master hologram is replicated within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes. The at least two reference beams may each be of a different wavelength than each other reference beam. The at least two reference beams may each be of a different angle than each other reference beam.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram wherein the intensity of the side lobes is less than 25%, less than 10%, or less than one percent of the intensity of the primary hologram peak. Side lobes with minimal intensity relative to the primary hologram peak may be produced by apodizing the distribution of Δn as a function of depth within the hologram. Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram wherein the intensity of at least one of the side lobes is at least 25% of, at least 50% of, or greater than the intensity of the primary hologram peak. Side lobes with maximal intensity relative to the primary hologram peak may be produced by anti-apodizing the distribution of Δn as a function of depth within the hologram.
- Replicating the master hologram with at least two reference beams will produce at least two diffracted object beams; each of the at least two diffracted object beams will interfere with each of the at least two reference beams to produce at least two sets of optical fringes (at least a portion of each set of optical fringes is located within an internal volume of the HRM). The light diffracted by the master hologram follows the diffraction grating equation:
-
- where λ is the wavelength of the laser light, Λ is the lateral grating spacing (of the optical fringes), θ1 is the angle of incidence (relative to the normal), θ2 is the angle of diffraction (relative to the normal), and n is an integer. The lateral spacing of the fringes produced by interference between incident light and any light produced by the master hologram will be the same; any changes in incident wavelength or angle will affect the angle of the diffracted light (and therefore the angle of the resulting fringes) but not the spacing of the resulting fringes. The fringe spacing is always the same when replicating a single master with two laser beams, thus the at least two sets of optical fringes will both possess the same fringe spacing as the master hologram. The at least two sets of optical fringes may be recorded within the HRM to form at least two sets of physical fringes.
- In other words, replicating the master hologram with at least two reference beams includes illuminating the HRM and the master hologram with at least two reference beams; during replication the master hologram and the HRM are separated from one another by the recording substrate. Replicating the master hologram within the HRM includes passing each reference beam through the HRM, the recording substrate, and the master hologram. Replicating a transmission hologram includes passing each reference beam through the master hologram prior to passing each reference beam through the HRM. Replicating a reflection hologram includes passing each reference beam through the HRM prior to passing each reference beam through the master hologram.
- Replication may include recording a pattern of fringes within HRM that is substantively similar to the pattern of fringes within the master hologram. During replication, each reference beam possesses a phase within the HRM and each object beam possesses a phase within the HRM. Both the reference beam and the object beam must pass through the recording substrate, but the path length through the recording substrate of the reference beam is not necessarily equal to the path length through the recording substrate of the object beam. The difference in path length between the object beam and the reference beam causes a phase shift between the object beam and the reference beam within the HRM. The phase of the optical fringes produced by interference between the object beam and the reference beam within the HRM depends on the phase shift between the object beam and the reference beam.
- Throughout this specification and the appended claims, the term “meta-interference” refers to interference between sets of fringes; each set of fringes may be the product of interference between each reference beam and the respective object beam diffracted from each reference beam. Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams produces at least two sets of optical fringes that undergo meta-interference. The meta-interference of the at least two sets of optical fringes increases Δn in regions of constructive meta-interference and decreases Δn in regions of destructive meta-interference. The magnitude of the increase or decrease in Δn depends on the magnitude of the constructive or destructive meta-interference, respectively. The position of the increased or decreased Δn within the HRM depends on the net phase shift of each set of fringes, where the net phase shift of a set of optical fringes is the relative difference in phase between that set of optical fringes and another set of optical fringes within the HRM.
- Control over the side lobes of a hologram requires control over the positions of high and low Δn within the HRM. Control over the positions of high and low Δn within the HRM may be achieved by controlling the precise angle and wavelength of each reference beam employed during replication. The angle and wavelength of each reference beam determines the phase shift of each object beam, and therefore the phase of each set of optical fringes, the net phase shift between each set of optical fringes, the meta-interference between sets of optical fringes, and thereby the positions of high and low Δn within the HRM.
- Consider
FIG. 2 , which shows a cross-sectional view of hologram with controlledside lobes 200 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Hologram with controlledside lobes 200 may be produced bymethod 100. Hologram with controlledside lobes 200 comprises first set offringes 210 and second set offringes 220. First set offringes 210 and second set offringes 220 may be formed by replicating a master hologram with two reference beams. First set offringes 210 and second set offringes 220 have the same spacing but different angles, which causes first set offringes 210 and second set offringes 220 to interfere with each other. At the top and bottom surface of hologram with controlledside lobes 200 first set offringes 210 and second set offringes 220 interfere destructively, reducing Δn to a minimum. At the middle depth of hologram with controlledside lobes 200 first set offringes 210 and second set offringes 220 interfere constructively, increasing Δn to a maximum. Δn increases smoothly from either surface of the hologram towards the maximum. Hologram with controlledside lobes 200 is therefore apodized and will have minimal, if any, side lobes. In order to achieve this smooth interference between sets of fringes with a maximum Δn at a desired depth, the sets of fringes must have precisely matched spacing and phase. - First set of
fringes 210 may comprise an initial set of fringes. Second set offringes 220 may comprise an additional set of fringes. A person of skill in the art will appreciate that for the sake of clarity only two sets of fringes are depicted in Figure two, however hologram with controlledside lobes 200 may comprise n sets of fringes (where n is equal to or greater than 2) with one initial set of fringes and n−1 additional sets of fringes, the various sets of fringes having different angles and, or different phase shifts from those of the other sets of fringes. - In some implementations,
hologram 200 may be carried on or by another structure, and such other structure may, for example, provide at least some additional optical function. For instance, one or more holograms may be carried on or by a waveguide or lightguide structure and may serve as, for example, an in-coupler, out-coupler, or exit pupil expander for such waveguide or lightguide structure. Thus, for the purposes of the present systems, device, and methods, including the appended claims, the term “hologram” may include a HRM layer and a combination of optional additional layers or structures such as protective material, waveguide/lightguide structures, substrates, etc. depending on the specific implementation. Likewise, when the term “hologram with controlled side lobes” is used, said hologram with controlled side lobes may be carried on or by other structures or layers, or may itself carry other structures or layers, depending on the specific implementation. - Returning to
FIG. 1 , replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating a wavelength-multiplexed master hologram with at least two reference beams to produce a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes. A wavelength-multiplexed hologram is a hologram comprising multiple wavelength-specific holograms. Each wavelength-specific hologram comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram diffracts laser light of a specific wavelength; a wavelength-specific hologram cannot diffract light of a wavelength outside of the spectral bandwidth of the wavelength-specific hologram. Wavelength-multiplexed holograms are advantageous since a wavelength-multiplexed hologram may be employed as a holographic combiner in a WHUD with a full-color display; single-wavelength holograms may be employed in monochromatic displays. - A wavelength-multiplexed master hologram may be replicated to produce a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes. A wavelength-multiplexed master hologram may comprise a blue master hologram, a green master hologram, and a red master hologram. A wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes may comprise a blue hologram with controlled side lobes, a green hologram with controlled side lobes, and a red hologram with controlled side lobes. A wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master hologram with at least two blue beams of laser light, at least two green beams of laser light, and at least two red beams of laser light. Each beam of laser light used to replicate a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes from a wavelength-multiplexed possesses a respective wavelength.
- A blue wavelength-specific hologram with controlled sidelobes comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master with two blue beams of laser light, where the two blue beams of laser light differ in wavelength by a first Δλ. A green wavelength-specific hologram with controlled sidelobes comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master with two green beams of laser light, where the two green beams of laser light differ in wavelength by a second Δλ. A red wavelength-specific hologram with controlled sidelobes comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled sidelobes may be replicated from a wavelength-multiplexed master with two red beams of laser light, where the two red beams of laser light differ in wavelength by a third Δλ. The first Δλ may be greater than, less than, or equal to the second Δλ. The second Δλ may be greater than, less than, or equal to the third Δλ. A wavelength-multiplexed hologram with controlled side lobes, where each wavelength-specific hologram has the same intensity of side lobes relative to the intensity of the primary hologram peak, may be replicated when the first Δλ is highest and the third Δλ is lowest.
- The master hologram possesses a Bragg peak wavelength. Each reference beam possesses a reference beam wavelength. Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes wherein the difference between the Bragg peak wavelength of the master hologram and reference beam wavelength of each reference beam is less than 2 nanometers. Replicating the master hologram with a reference beam wherein the difference between the Bragg peak wavelength of the master hologram and the reference beam wavelength is small is advantageous since the efficiency of the master hologram may decrease significantly at wavelengths greater than 2 nanometers from the Bragg peak wavelength of the master hologram. Significant changes in master hologram efficiency may cause significant changes in the phase of any laser light diffracted by the master hologram, and therefore make it difficult to control the phase of the initial set of optical fringes and the net phase shift of the additional sets of optical fringes within the HRM.
- The bandwidth of a hologram is the range of angles and wavelengths of incident laser light that the hologram efficiently diffracts; bandwidth includes angular bandwidth and wavelength bandwidth. The angular bandwidth of a hologram is the range of angles of incident laser light that satisfies the Bragg condition for the hologram and therefore may be efficiently diffracted by the hologram. The wavelength bandwidth of a hologram is the range of wavelengths of incident laser light that satisfies the Bragg condition for the hologram and therefore may be efficiently diffracted by the hologram. Typically, a hologram with a narrow angular bandwidth also possesses a narrow wavelength bandwidth and a hologram with a broad angular bandwidth also possesses a broad wavelength bandwidth. Any process that increases or decreases the angular bandwidth of a hologram will typically also proportionally increase or decrease (respectively) the wavelength bandwidth of a hologram. A person of skill of art will appreciate that the term “bandwidth” therefore may refer either to the angular bandwidth or the wavelength bandwidth of a hologram unless otherwise specified as “angular bandwidth” or “wavelength bandwidth”. Each wavelength-specific hologram comprising a wavelength-multiplexed hologram possesses its own bandwidth. In other words, for a wavelength-multiplexed hologram comprising a blue hologram, a green hologram, and a red hologram, the bandwidth of the blue hologram may be greater than or less than the bandwidth of the green hologram, and the bandwidth of the green hologram may be greater than or less than the bandwidth of the red hologram. The phase shift introduced to the diffracted object beam by the master hologram due to the thickness of the master hologram depends on the bandwidth of the master hologram. A hologram with broader bandwidth will have a weaker dependence of phase shift on hologram thickness; varying the bandwidth of the wavelength-specific holograms allows further control of the phase shift of the respective diffracted object beams and therefore the side lobes of the resulting holograms.
- Replicating the master hologram within the HRM with at least two reference beams to produce a hologram with controlled side lobes may include replicating the master hologram with at least two reference beams to record an initial set of fringes and at least one additional set of fringes within the HRM. The initial set of fringes possesses a phase within the HRM. Each additional set of fringes possesses a net phase shift relative to the initial set of fringes within the HRM. The net phase shift between each additional set of fringes and the initial set of fringes controls the meta-interference between each additional set of fringes and the initial set of fringes.
- A person of skill in the art will appreciate that defining a particular set of fringes as being an initial set of fringes (while all other sets of fringes are additional fringes) is advantageous as such a definition establishes a common frame of reference for determining the phase of each set of fringes relative to each other set of fringes. A determination of the relative phase of each set of fringes may eliminate the need to determine the absolute phase of any set of fringes.
- Each set of fringes (initial or additional) will meta-interfere with each other set of fringes within the HRM. Constructive meta-interference between sets of fringes increases Δn, while destructive meta-interference between sets of fringes decreases Δn. The locations within the HRM where fringes meta-interfere constructively or destructively depends on the phase of the initial set of fringes within the HRM and the net phase shift of the at least one additional set of fringes within the HRM. The net phase shift of each additional set of fringes may be expressed in radians. The net phase shift of each additional set of fringes may be measured at a depth within the hologram equidistant from the first surface and the second surface of the HRM. A net phase shift of 0 will result in maximum constructive meta-interference at a depth within the hologram equidistant from the first surface and the second surface of the HRM and maximum destructive meta-interference at the first surface and at the second surface; in other words, a net phase shift of 0 will produce an apodized hologram with minimized side lobes. A net phase shift of π will result in maximum destructive meta-interference at a depth within the hologram equidistant from the first surface and the second surface of the HRM and maximum constructive meta-interference at the first surface and at the second surface; in other words, a phase shift of π will produce an anti-apodized hologram with maximized side lobes.
- Factors that determine the phase of the initial set of fringes within the HRM include: the thickness of the recording substrate, the refractive index of the recording substrate, the thickness of the master hologram, the bandwidth of the master hologram, the angle of the reference beam diffracted by the master hologram to produce the initial set of fringes, and the wavelength of the reference beam diffracted by the master hologram to produce the initial set of fringes. Factors that determine the net phase shift of each additional set of fringes within the HRM include: the thickness of the recording substrate, the refractive index of the recording substrate, the thickness of the master hologram, the bandwidth of the master hologram, the angle of the reference beam diffracted by the master hologram to produce each additional set of fringes, and the wavelength of the reference beam diffracted by the master hologram to produce each additional set of fringes.
- Control over the side lobes of a hologram may be achieved by controlling the factors that determine the phase of the initial set of fringes within the HRM and by controlling the factors that determine the net phase shift of each set of additional fringes within the HRM. The thickness of the recording substrate may be controlled by casting, milling, cutting, grinding, or otherwise producing a recording substrate with a desired thickness. The refractive index of the recording substrate may be controlled by choosing a recording substrate material with a desired refractive index. The thickness of the master hologram may be controlled by recording the master hologram in a HRM with a desired thickness. The bandwidth of the master hologram may be controlled by controlling the thickness of the master hologram, where thicker master holograms typically have a narrower bandwidth. The bandwidth of the master hologram may be increased with bandwidth-broadening treatments. The angle of a reference beam may be controlled by positioning the laser light source for a given reference beam at a desired angle. The wavelength of a reference beam may be controlled by choosing a laser light source with appropriate wavelength outputs; laser light sources with variable wavelength outputs may have their output wavelength determined by the conditions under which the variable output laser light source is operated.
- A hologram with apodized Δn will have side lobes with the least magnitude, and thereby comprises a hologram with controlled side lobes. A hologram with apodized Δn comprises a hologram wherein Δn is lowest at the shallowest and deepest depth within the hologram and wherein Δn is highest at a depth between the shallowest and deepest depth within the hologram. In other words, Δn is lowest at the first and second surface of the hologram and Δn is highest at a depth between the first and second surface. A hologram with anti-apodized Δn will have side lobes with the greatest magnitude, and thereby comprises a hologram with controlled side lobes. A hologram with anti-apodized Δn comprises a hologram wherein Δn is highest at the shallowest and deepest depth within the hologram and wherein Δn is lowest at a depth between the shallowest and deepest depth within the hologram. In other words, Δn is highest at the first and second surface of the hologram and Δn is lowest at a depth between the first and second surface.
- Typically, a master hologram with a given thickness and bandwidth is used in combination with a recording substrate with a given thickness and refractive index (in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods). The wavelength and angle of the reference beam diffracted by the master hologram to produce the initial set of fringes within the HRM is fixed to achieve a desired playback wavelength and angle for the recorded hologram. The wavelength and angle of each reference beam diffracted by the master hologram to record each additional set of fringes is then fixed to achieve the necessary net phase shift for each additional set of fringes, such that the interference between the initial set of fringes and each additional set of fringes within the HRM will produce variations of Δn within the HRM that give the desired magnitude of side lobes relative to the main peak of the hologram with controlled side lobes.
- A reference beam comprises laser light. A reference beam may comprise a plane wave, wherein a plane wave comprises laser light with parallel wave fronts. A plane wave does not converge to a point and a plane wave does not diverge from a point. A plane wave may be generated by collimating laser light, wherein collimating laser light may include reflecting laser light with a mirror or refracting laser light with a lens. A hologram recorded with a plane wave will have the most parallel fringes; in other words, the slant angle of the fringes will have minimal change throughout the hologram. Recording a hologram with a plane wave may therefore be advantageous since the distribution of Δn as a function of depth within the resulting hologram will be the most consistent across the lateral dimensions of the hologram.
- A reference beam may comprise a spherical wave, wherein a spherical wave comprises laser light with spherically curved wave fronts; the curvature of the wave fronts includes a focal point. A spherical wave either converges to a focal point or diverges from a focal point. A spherical wave may be generated by focusing laser light with a converging lens or a converging mirror; a spherical wave may be generated by defocusing laser light with a diverging lens or a diverging mirror. Recording a hologram with a spherical wave may be advantageous since the recorded hologram will possess an optical power and therefore the recorded hologram may focus (or defocus) light in addition to any other optical functions the recorded hologram performs. A hologram recorded with a spherical wave will not have perfectly parallel fringes; in other words, the slant angle of the fringes will not be exactly the same throughout the lateral dimensions of the hologram. However, the difference in slant angle between fringes does not affect the magnitude of the side lobes of the hologram so long as the focal point of the spherical wave(s) is (are) at a distance from the hologram equal to at least 50%, at least 100%, or at least 200% of the largest lateral dimension of the hologram with controlled side lobes. Increasing the focal distance (relative to the size of the hologram) decreases the difference in slant angle between fringes, bringing the fringes of a hologram recorded with a spherical wave closer to parallel.
- Consider
FIG. 3A , which shows a cross-sectional view of hologram with unmatched fringe spacing 300 a in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Hologram with unmatched fringe spacing 300 a comprises first set offringes 310 a and second set offringes 320 a, where the spacing of first set offringes 310 a is less than the spacing of second set offringes 320 a. Hologram with unmatched fringe spacing 300 a comprises a hologram with anti-apodized Δn. Because the spacings of first set offringes 310 a and second set offringes 320 a do not match, the depth of maximum constructive interference, and therefore the depth of maximum Δn, will vary throughout the hologram laterally. ConsiderFIG. 3B , which shows a cross-sectional view of hologram withunmatched phase 300 b in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Hologram withunmatched phase 300 b comprises first set offringes 310 b and second set offringes 320 b. The phase of first set offringes 310 b and second set offringes 320 b combine such that first set offringes 310 b and second set offringes 320 b interfere constructively at the highest and lowest depth of hologram withunmatched phase 300 b and interfere destructively at the middle depth of hologram withunmatched phase 300 b. Δn within hologram withunmatched phase 300 b is therefore at a maximum at the highest and lowest depth of hologram withunmatched phase 300 b and at a minimum at the middle depth of hologram withunmatched phase 300 b; hologram withunmatched phase 300 b is therefore anti-apodized and would show the strongest possible side lobes. This is advantageous if strong side lobes are desirable, however it is disadvantageous if minimal side lobes are desirable. Therefore, the phase of the diffracted object beams must be controlled during replication. - Returning to
FIG. 1 , at 105, the hologram with controlled side lobes is dismounted from the recording substrate. Dis-mounting the hologram with controlled side lobes from the recording substrate includes physically de-coupling the hologram with controlled side lobes from the recording substrate. -
Method 100 may further comprise bleaching the hologram with controlled side lobes. Bleaching includes exposing the hologram with controlled side lobes to a bleaching agent. Non-exclusive examples of a bleaching agents include acids, peroxides, hypochlorites, and light. Photobleaching includes exposing the hologram with controlled side lobes to light. The light used for photobleaching may be incoherent. The light used for photobleaching may be polychromatic, wherein at least a portion of the light which is used for photobleaching may be absorbed by the photoinitiator or the monomer within the hologram with controlled side lobes. - Photobleaching the hologram with controlled side lobes converts at least a portion of the hologram with controlled side lobes from a photopolymerizable material to a material that is not photopolymerizable.
-
Method 100 may further comprise recording a master hologram. Recording a master hologram may include illuminating a master HRM with an object beam and a reference beam. -
FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of hologram with controlled sidelobes recording system 400 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. AlthoughFIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view, a dot-fill pattern has been used to differentiate various elements inFIG. 4 rather than a cross-hatch pattern to avoid confusion between the diagonal lines denoting fringes and diagonal lines denoting cross-hatching. - Hologram with controlled side
lobes recording system 400 comprisescopy HRM 410,recording substrate 420,master hologram 430,laser light source 440,first reference beam 441,second reference beam 442, first diffractedobject beam 443, and second diffractedobject beam 444. Hologram with controlled sidelobes recording system 400 may be employed to produce a hologram substantively similar to hologram with controlledside lobes 200 via method of producing a hologram with controlledside lobes 100. -
Copy HRM 410 comprises firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412.Recording substrate 420 comprises master-side surface 461 and copy HRM-side surface 462.Master hologram 430 is physically coupled to master-side surface 461 ofrecording substrate 420, while firstcopy HRM surface 411 ofcopy HRM 410 is physically coupled to copy HRM-side surface 462 ofrecording substrate 420. - Laser
light source 440 producesfirst reference beam 441 andsecond reference beam 442.First reference beam 441 may be of a different wavelength thansecond reference beam 442.First reference beam 441 may be of a different angle thansecond reference beam 442.First reference beam 441 andsecond reference beam 442 impinge onmaster hologram 430.Master hologram 430 comprisesmaster hologram fringes 431.Master hologram fringes 431 diffractfirst reference beam 441 andsecond reference beam 442 to produce first diffractedobject beam 443 and second diffractedobject beam 444.Master hologram 430 produces first diffractedobject beam 443 fromfirst reference beam 441 and produces second diffractedobject beam 444 from second diffractedobject beam 444. First diffractedobject beam 443 andfirst reference beam 441 interfere to produce initial set ofoptical fringes 451. Second diffractedobject beam 444 andsecond reference beam 442 interfere to produce additional set ofoptical fringes 452. - Initial set of
optical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 meta-interfere with each other withincopy HRM 410. Constructive meta-interference between initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 causes an increase in Δn in the physical fringes recorded from the optical fringes, while destructive meta-interference between initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 causes a decrease in Δn in the physical fringes recorded from the optical fringes. The depth withincopy HRM 410 at which constructive or destructive meta-interference between initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 occurs depends on the phase of the initial set ofoptical fringes 451 relative to the additional set ofoptical fringes 452. -
First reference beam 441 will have a given phase at copy HRM-side surface 462. First diffractedobject beam 443 will have a phase at copy HRM-side surface 462 that depends on the phase offirst reference beam 441 at copy HRM-side surface 462 and the effective distance travelled by the light comprising first diffractedobject beam 443. The effective distance travelled by the light comprising first diffractedobject beam 443 depends on the thickness and refractive index ofrecording substrate 420. The difference in phase betweenfirst reference beam 441 and first diffractedobject beam 443 at HRM-side surface 462 is the phase shift of first diffractedobject beam 443. -
Second reference beam 442 will have a given phase at copy HRM-side surface 462. Second diffractedobject beam 444 will have a phase at copy HRM-side surface 462 that depends on the phase ofsecond reference beam 442 at copy HRM-side surface 462 and the effective distance travelled by the light comprising second diffractedobject beam 444. The effective distance travelled by the light comprising second diffractedobject beam 444 depends on the thickness and refractive index ofrecording substrate 420. The difference in phase betweensecond reference beam 442 and second diffractedobject beam 444 at HRM-side surface 462 is the phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444. - The difference between the phase shift of second diffracted
object beam 444 and the phase shift of first diffractedobject beam 443 is the net phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444. The phase of initial set ofoptical fringes 451 depends on the phase shift of first diffractedobject beam 443. The phase of additional set ofoptical fringes 452 depends on the phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444. The difference in phase between additional set ofoptical fringes 452 and initial set ofoptical fringes 451 is the net phase shift of additional set ofoptical fringes 452. The net phase shift of additional set ofoptical fringes 452 depends on the net phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444. - The net phase shift of additional set of
optical fringes 452 determines the location of constructive and destructive interference of initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452. The net phase shift of additional set ofoptical fringes 452 may be measured in radians at a depth withincopy HRM 410 equidistant between firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412. If the net phase shift of additional set ofoptical fringes 452 is 0, then meta-interference between initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 will be most constructive at a depth withincopy HRM 410 equidistant between firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412 and most destructive at depths closest to firstcopy HRM surface 411 and second copy HRM surface. If the net phase shift of additional set ofoptical fringes 452 is π, then meta-interference between initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 will be most destructive at a depth withincopy HRM 410 equidistant between firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412 and most constructive at depths closest to firstcopy HRM surface 411 and second copy HRM surface. - If
first reference beam 441 and thesecond reference beam 442 comprise light of differing angles with the same wavelength,first reference beam 441 andsecond reference beam 442 will travel different paths to reachmaster hologram 430, and first diffractedobject beam 443 and second diffractedobject beam 444 will travel different paths to reachcopy HRM 410. The effective distance travelled by first diffractedobject beam 443 and second diffractedobject beam 444 will be different. The effective distance travelled by first diffractedobject beam 443 is equivalent to a first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443. The effective distance travelled by second diffractedobject beam 444 is equivalent to a second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444. Due to the different effective distances travelled, the first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443 is not equal to the second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444, and the difference between the first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443 and the second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444 is the net phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444. The difference between the first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443 and the second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444 depends on the thickness and the refractive index ofrecording substrate 420 since the difference in effective distance travelled depends on the thickness ofrecording substrate 420. Therefore, the net phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444 will be determined by the thickness and refractive index ofrecording substrate 420. - If
first reference beam 441 and thesecond reference beam 442 comprise light of differing wavelengths with the same angle, the net phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444 will be determined by the thickness and refractive index ofrecording substrate 420.First reference beam 441 andsecond reference beam 442 will travel identical paths to reachmaster hologram 430, and first diffractedobject beam 443 and second diffractedobject beam 444 will travel identical paths to reachcopy HRM 410. The effective distance travelled by first diffractedobject beam 443 and second diffractedobject beam 444 will be identical. The effective distance travelled by first diffractedobject beam 443 is equivalent to a first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443. The effective distance travelled by second diffractedobject beam 444 is equivalent to a second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444. The first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443 is not equal to the second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444, and the difference between the first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443 and the second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444 is the net phase shift of second diffractedobject beam 444; the difference between the first number of wavelengths of first diffractedobject beam 443 and the second number of wavelengths of second diffractedobject beam 444 depends on the thickness and the refractive index ofrecording substrate 420. - For a desired location of maximum constructive interference, a thickness of
recording substrate 420 may be calculated for the specific wavelengths of the first sub-beam of laser light and the second sub-beam of laser light at a given angle. In this manner, the phase of the light comprising initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 may be controlled; by extension the interference between initial set ofoptical fringes 451 and additional set ofoptical fringes 452 and thereby the location of maximum and minimum Δn may be controlled. - In a preferred embodiment, hologram with controlled side
lobes recording system 400 comprising a first reference beam with an angle of 50 degrees and a wavelength of 455.0 nm, a second reference beam with an angle of 50 degrees and a wavelength of 454.3 nm, a master hologram with a playback angle of 0 degrees and a thickness of 20 micrometers, a recording substrate with a thickness of 57 um, and a copy HRM thickness of 8 um will produce a copy HRM with the greatest magnitude of Δn at a depth equidistant from firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412, the least magnitude of Δn at firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412, and side lobes with the least magnitude. - In an alternative embodiment, the parameters of the preferred embodiment are used with one modification chosen from a group consisting of: increasing the wavelength of the first reference beam by up to 0.1 nm, decreasing the wavelength of the first reference beam by up to 0.1 nm, increasing the wavelength of the second reference beam by up to 0.1 nm, decreasing the wavelength of the second reference beam by up to 0.1 nm, increasing the angle of the first reference beam and the second reference beam each by up to 8 degrees, decreasing the angle of the first reference beam and the second reference beam each by up to 8 degrees, increasing the master hologram playback angle by up to 8 degrees, decreasing the master hologram playback angle by up to 8 degrees, increasing the master thickness by up to 30 um, decreasing the master thickness by up to 5 um, increasing the recording substrate thickness by up to 9 um, decreasing the recording substrate thickness by up to 9 um, increasing the copy HRM thickness my 1 um, and decreasing the copy HRM thickness by 1 um. The alternative embodiment will produce a copy HRM with a magnitude of Δn at first
copy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412 less than or equal to 50% of the highest magnitude of Δn within the copy HRM. A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that if more than one of the modifications disclosed in the alternative embodiment are applied to the preferred embodiment, and the magnitude of each modification is greater than the magnitude of the modifications disclosed in the alternative embodiment, then a copy HRM with a magnitude of Δn at firstcopy HRM surface 411 and secondcopy HRM surface 412 less than or equal to 50% of the highest magnitude of Δn within the copy HRM may be produced; the effect of each modification may at least partially counteract the effect of each other modification. - Substantively similar control of the location of maximum and minimum Δn may be achieved via control of the angles of the first sub-beam of laser light and the second sub-beam of laser light. Substantively similar control of the location of maximum and minimum Δn may be achieved via control of the thickness of
master hologram 430. Each fringe in the master hologram diffracts the incoming laser light, at an angle such that the diffracted light interferes at least partially constructively. If the diffracted light is at an angle that results in interference that is not completely constructive, then the interference is also partially destructive. The partially destructive interference decreases the amplitude of the diffracted laser light and simultaneously shifts the phase of the diffracted laser light. The magnitude of the decrease in amplitude and shift in phase is proportional to the number of fringes that contribute to the partially destructive interference, which is in turn dependent on the thickness of the master hologram. -

A person of skill in the art will appreciate that hologram with controlled sidelobes recording system 400 may also be used to replicate a transmission hologram by movinglaser light source 440 to the same side asmaster hologram 430. - A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that while two reference beams are produced by
laser light 440 inFIG. 4 ,laser light source 440 may alternatively produce 3, 4, or more reference beams. Each additional reference beam (in other words, each reference beam beyond the second) will have a wavelength and an angle, will pass through the master hologram, the recording substrate, and the copy HRM, and produce a respective additional diffracted object beam that passes through the recording substrate and the copy HRM. Each additional diffracted object beam will possess a net phase shift and interfere with each respective additional reference beam to produce a respective additional set of optical fringes. Each additional set of optical fringes will possess a respective net phase shift (determined by the wavelength and angle of the respective reference beam, the thickness and playback angle of the master hologram, and the thickness of the recording substrate) and will meta-interfere with each other set of optical fringes to record a hologram with Δn varying as a function of depth. The presence of additional sets of meta-interfering optical fringes allows more complex Δn profiles as a function of depth, allowing greater control of the side lobes of the holograms recorded with hologram with controlled sidelobes recording system 400. -

fringes 511 and additional set offringes 512 exhibit meta-interference. Portions of hologram with controlledside lobes 510 that exhibit constructive meta-interference between initial set offringes 511 and additional set offringes 512 possess higher Δn. Portions of hologram with controlledside lobes 510 that exhibit destructive meta-interference between initial set offringes 511 and additional set offringes 512 possess lower Δn. If Δn is least at depths closest tofirst surface 513 and/orsecond surface 514, and if Δn is greatest at a depth equidistant fromfirst hologram surface 513 andsecond hologram surface 514, then hologram with controlledside lobes 510 will have side lobes with the least possible magnitude. If Δn at depths closest tofirst hologram surface 513 and/orsecond hologram surface 514 is less than 50% of Δn at a depth equidistant fromfirst hologram surface 513 andsecond hologram surface 514 then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 is at least partially apodized and may exhibit side lobes with an intensity less than 25%, less than 10%, or less than one percent of the intensity of the primary peak. - If Δn is greatest at depths closest to
first surface 513 and/orsecond surface 514, and if Δn is least at a depth equidistant fromfirst hologram surface 513 andsecond hologram surface 514, then hologram with controlledside lobes 510 will have side lobes with the greatest possible magnitude. If Δn at a depth equidistant fromfirst hologram surface 513 andsecond hologram surface 514 is less than 50% of Δn at depths closest tofirst hologram surface 513 and/orsecond hologram surface 514 then hologram with controlledside lobes 510 is at least partially anti-apodized and will exhibit side lobes with an intensity at least 25% of, at least 50% of, or greater than the intensity of the primary peak. - If
net phase shift 550 is equal to 0, then hologram with controlledside lobes 510 will be apodized. Ifnet phase shift 550 is equal to π, then hologram with controlledside lobes 510 will be anti-apodized. A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that the position of highest Δn within hologram with controlledside lobes 510 depends onnet phase shift 550, and since the magnitude of the side lobes of hologram with controlledside lobes 510 depends on the position of highest Δn, the side lobes of hologram with controlledside lobes 510 may therefore be controlled by controllingnet phase shift 550. Control ofnet phase shift 550 may be achieved by controlling the angle and wavelength of the reference beams used to record initial set offringes 511 and additional set offringes 512. - A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that hologram with controlled
side lobes 510 may comprise more than one additional set of fringes; where each additional set of fringes comprises a respective additional fringe spacing (equal to the initial fringe spacing), additional slant angle, and net phase shift. Each additional set of fringes will also exhibit meta-interference with initial set offringes 511; hologram with controlledside lobes 510 would thereby possess a more complex distribution of Δn as a function of depth and greater possible control over the relative magnitude of the side lobes of hologram with controlledside lobes 510. - Hologram with controlled
side lobes 510 may comprise a wavelength-multiplexed hologram, where initial set offringes 511 comprises at least two wavelength-specific sub-sets of fringes and additional set offringes 512 comprises at least two wavelength-specific sub-sets of fringes. -

Initial fringe slant angle 643 comprises the angle between the fringes comprising initial set of fringes 633 and a line normal to at least one of: first hologram surface 635 and second hologram surface 636.
- Additional set of fringes 634 comprises additional fringe spacing 642, additional fringe slant angle 644, and net phase shift 645. Net phase shift 645 comprises the difference in phase between initial set of fringes 633 and additional set of fringes 634 at a depth equidistant between first hologram surface 635 and second hologram surface 636.

Additional fringe slant angle 644 comprises the angle between the fringes comprising additional set of fringes 634 and a line normal to at least one of: first hologram surface 635 and second hologram surface 636. Additional fringe slant angle 644 is not equal to initial fringe slant angle 643.
- Initial set of fringes 633 and additional set of fringes 634 exhibit meta-interference. Portions of hologram with controlled side lobes 631 that exhibit constructive meta-interference between initial set of fringes 633 and additional set of fringes 634 possess higher Δn. Portions of hologram with controlled side lobes 631 that exhibit destructive meta-interference between initial set of fringes 633 and additional set of fringes 634 possess lower Δn. If Δn is least at depths closest to first surface 635 and/or second surface 636, and if Δn is greatest at a depth equidistant from first hologram surface 635 and second hologram surface 636, then hologram with controlled side lobes 631 will have side lobes with the least possible magnitude. If Δn at depths closest to first hologram surface 635 and/or second hologram surface 636 is less than 50% of Δn at a depth equidistant from first hologram surface 635 and second hologram surface 636 then hologram with controlled side lobes 631 is at least partially apodized and may exhibit side lobes with an intensity less than 25%, less than 10%, or less than one percent of the intensity of the primary peak.
- If Δn is greatest at depths closest to first surface 635 and/or second surface 636, and if Δn is least at a depth equidistant from first hologram surface 635 and second hologram surface 636, then hologram with controlled side lobes 631 will have side lobes with the greatest possible magnitude.

- If net phase shift 645 is equal to 0, then hologram with controlled side lobes 631 will be apodized. If net phase shift 645 is equal to π, then hologram with controlled side lobes 631 will be anti-apodized. A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that the position of highest Δn within hologram with controlled side lobes 631 depends on net phase shift 645, and since the magnitude of the side lobes of hologram with controlled side lobes 631 depends on the position of highest Δn, the side lobes of hologram with controlled side lobes 631 may therefore be controlled by controlling net phase shift 645. Control of net phase shift 645 may be achieved by controlling the angle and wavelength of the reference beams used to record initial set of fringes 633 and additional set of fringes 634.
- A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that hologram with controlled side lobes 631 may comprise more than one additional set of fringes; where each additional set of fringes comprises a respective additional fringe spacing (equal to the initial fringe spacing), additional slant angle, and net phase shift. Each additional set of fringes will also exhibit meta-interference with initial set of fringes 633; hologram with controlled side lobes 631 would thereby possess a more complex distribution of Δn as a function of depth and greater possible control over the relative magnitude of the side lobes of hologram with controlled side lobes 631.
- Hologram with controlled side lobes 631 may comprise a wavelength-multiplexed hologram, where initial set of fringes 633 comprises at least two wavelength-specific sub-sets of fringes and additional set of fringes 634 comprises at least two wavelength-specific sub-sets of fringes.

FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of hologram with controlledside lobes 700 in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. Hologram with controlledside lobes 700 is substantively similar to hologram with controlledside lobes 200. Hologram with controlledside lobes 700 may be produced bymethod 100. Hologram with controlledside lobes 700 comprises initial set offringes 710, additional set offringes 720,first surface 731, andsecond surface 732. -
First surface 731 is oppositesecond surface 732.First surface 731 andsecond surface 732 each comprise a two-dimensional surface. Hologram with controlledside lobes 700 occupies the volume betweenfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732.First surface 731 andsecond surface 732 are separated bythickness 733 whereinthickness 733 comprises the shortest distance betweenfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732 at a given point on or within hologram with controlledside lobes 700.Thickness 733 may be less than ten micrometers, less than one hundred micrometers, or less than one millimeter. -
First surface 731 may comprise a curved surface;first surface 731 may be curved spherically or cylindrically around a focal point or focal line, respectively.Second surface 732 may comprise a curved surface;second surface 732 may be curved spherically or cylindrically around a focal point or focal line, respectively.First surface 731 andsecond surface 732 may comprise parallel surfaces. - Initial set of
fringes 710 is located within an internal volume of hologram with controlledside lobes 700. For the sake of clarity, initial set offringes 710 has been depicted as a series of lines, where the lines denote the spacing between fringes. A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that fringes may comprise local maxima (or minima) of either absorbance or refractive index, and these maxima (or minima) may not show sharp boundaries between regions of high (or low) absorbance or refractive index; however, the maxima (or minima) of either absorbance or refractive index demonstrate directionality and periodicity and may be reasonably depicted and interpreted as a repeating pattern of discrete lines. - Initial set of
fringes 710 comprisesinitial fringe phase 741,initial fringe spacing 751, and initialfringe slant angle 761.Initial fringe phase 741 is depicted as being measured from the lateral edge of hologram with controlledside lobes 700 to a particular fringe of initial set offringes 710 at a depth equidistant betweenfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732, however a person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that, due to the periodic nature of the fringes comprising initial set offringes 710,initial fringe phase 741 could be measured from any fixed point in or on hologram with controlledside lobes 700 to any fringe of initial set offringes 710. -
Initial fringe spacing 751 comprises the distance between one fringe comprising initial set offringes 710 and an immediately adjacent fringe comprising initial set offringes 710.Initial fringe spacing 751 may be measured parallel tofirst surface 731 and/orsecond surface 732. Initial fringe spacing 751 at least partially determines the wavelength or range of wavelengths of incident light that may be diffracted by initial set offringes 710; in other words, initial fringe spacing 751 at least partially determines the wavelength(s) of light that may be used as an object beam to play back the hologram which initial set offringes 710 comprises. - Initial
fringe slant angle 761 comprises the angle between the fringes comprising initial set offringes 710 and a line normal to at least one of:first surface 731 andsecond surface 732. In other words, if the fringes comprising initial set offringes 710 are parallel tofirst surface 731 then the fringes comprising initial set offringes 710 would have a slant angle of 90 degrees. If the laser light used to record initial set offringes 710 consists of plane waves then initialfringe slant angle 761 will be constant throughout hologram with controlledside lobes 700. If the laser light used to record initial set offringes 710 comprises spherical waves then initialfringe slant angle 761 will vary throughout hologram with controlledside lobes 700; however, the variation in slant angle caused by spherical waves is negligible with regard to controlling the distribution of Δn, and thereby controlling the sidelobes of hologram with controlledsidelobes 700, so long as the focal point of each spherical wave is located at a distance equal to at least 50%, at least 100%, or at least 200% of the largest lateral dimension of hologram with controlledside lobes 700. - Additional set of
fringes 720 is located within an internal volume of hologram with controlledside lobes 700. For the sake of clarity, additional set offringes 720 has been depicted as a series of lines, where the lines denote the angle, phase, and the spacing between fringes. Additional set offringes 720 comprisesnet phase shift 742,additional fringe spacing 752, and additionalfringe slant angle 762.Net phase shift 742 comprises the difference in phase between initial set offringes 710 and additional set offringes 720 at a depth equidistant betweenfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732.Net phase shift 742 is depicted as being measured between a particular fringe of additional set offringes 720 and a particular fringe of initial set offringes 710, however a person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that, due to the periodic nature of the fringes comprising additional set offringes 720,net phase shift 742 could be measured from any fringe of initial set offringes 710 to any fringe of additional set offringes 720.Additional fringe spacing 752 comprises the distance between one fringe comprising additional set offringes 720 and an immediately adjacent fringe comprising additional set offringes 720. -
Additional fringe spacing 752 may be measured parallel tofirst surface 731 and/orsecond surface 732. Additional fringe spacing 752 at least partially determines the wavelength or range of wavelengths of incident light that may be diffracted by additional set offringes 720; in other words, additional fringe spacing 752 at least partially determines the wavelength(s) of light that may be used as an object beam to play back the hologram which additional set offringes 720 comprises.Additional fringe spacing 752 is equal toinitial fringe spacing 751. - Additional
fringe slant angle 762 comprises the angle between the fringes comprising additional set offringes 720 and a line normal to at least one of:first surface 731 andsecond surface 732. If the laser light used to record additional set offringes 720 consists of plane waves then additionalfringe slant angle 762 will be constant throughout hologram with controlledside lobes 700. If the laser light used to record additional set offringes 720 comprises spherical waves then additionalfringe slant angle 762 will vary throughout hologram with controlledside lobes 700; however, the variation in slant angle caused by spherical waves is negligible with regard to controlling the distribution of Δn, and thereby controlling the sidelobes of hologram with controlledsidelobes 700, so long as the focal point of each spherical wave is located at a distance equal to at least 50%, at least 100%, or at least 200% of the largest lateral dimension of hologram with controlledside lobes 700. Additionalfringe slant angle 762 is not equal to initialfringe slant angle 761. - Initial set of
fringes 710 and additional set offringes 720 exhibit meta-interference. Portions of hologram with controlledside lobes 700 that exhibit constructive meta-interference between initial set offringes 710 and additional set offringes 720 possess higher Δn. Portions of hologram with controlledside lobes 700 that exhibit destructive meta-interference between initial set offringes 710 and additional set offringes 720 possess lower Δn. If Δn is least at depths closest tofirst surface 731 and/orsecond surface 732, and if Δn is greatest at a depth equidistant fromfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732, then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 will have side lobes with the least possible magnitude; in other words hologram with controlledside lobes 700 is apodized. If Δn at depths closest tofirst surface 731 and/orsecond surface 732 is less than 50% of Δn at a depth equidistant fromfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732 then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 is at least partially apodized and may exhibit side lobes with an intensity less than 25%, less than 10%, or less than one percent of the intensity of the primary peak. - If Δn is greatest at depths closest to
first surface 731 and/orsecond surface 732, and if Δn is least at a depth equidistant fromfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732, then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 will have side lobes with the greatest possible magnitude; in other words, hologram with controlledside lobes 700 is anti-apodized. Higher Δn atfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732 increases the magnitude of the side lobes, while higher Δn at a point equidistant betweenfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732 increases the magnitude of the primary peak. If Δn at a depth equidistant fromfirst surface 731 andsecond surface 732 is less than 50% of Δn at depths closest tofirst surface 731 and/orsecond surface 732 then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 is at least partially anti-apodized and will exhibit side lobes with an intensity at least 25% of, at least 50% of, or greater than the intensity of the primary peak. -
Net phase shift 742 may be expressed in units of radians, where a phase shift of 2π is equal to a phase shift of 0. Ifnet phase shift 742 is equal to 0, then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 will be apodized. Ifnet phase shift 742 is equal to π, then hologram with controlledside lobes 700 will be anti-apodized. A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that the position of highest Δn within hologram with controlledside lobes 700 depends onnet phase shift 742, and since the magnitude of the side lobes of hologram with controlledside lobes 700 depends on the position of highest Δn, the side lobes of hologram with controlledside lobes 700 may therefore be controlled by controllingnet phase shift 742. Control ofnet phase shift 742 may be achieved by controlling the angle and wavelength of the reference beams used to record initial set offringes 710 and additional set offringes 720. - Any increase in Δn as a function of depth within hologram with controlled
side lobes 700 will be a continuous increase if only two sets of fringes are present in hologram with controlledside lobes 700. Any decrease in Δn as a function of depth within hologram with controlledside lobes 700 will be a continuous decrease if only two sets of fringes are present in hologram with controlledside lobes 700. More complex variation in Δn as a function of depth within hologram with controlledside lobes 700 requires more than two sets of fringes within hologram with controlledside lobes 700. - A person of skill in the art of holography will appreciate that hologram with controlled
side lobes 700 may comprise more than one additional set of fringes; where each additional set of fringes comprises a respective additional fringe spacing (equal to the initial fringe spacing), additional slant angle, and net phase shift. Each additional set of fringes will also exhibit meta-interference with initial set offringes 710; hologram with controlledside lobes 700 would thereby possess a more complex distribution of Δn as a function of depth and greater possible control over the relative magnitude of the side lobes of hologram with controlledside lobes 700. - Hologram with controlled
side lobes 700 may comprise a wavelength-multiplexed hologram, where initial set offringes 710 comprises at least two wavelength-specific sub-sets of fringes and additional set offringes 720 comprises at least two wavelength-specific sub-sets of fringes. A wavelength-specific sub-set of fringes diffracts laser light with a range of wavelengths that is at least partially different from the range of wavelengths diffracted by each other wavelength-specific sub-set of fringes. Hologram with controlledside lobes 700 may comprise a red hologram, a green hologram, a blue hologram, and an infrared hologram, where each color of hologram corresponds to a respective initial wavelength-specific sub-set of initial and additional fringes. - The intensity of the side lobes of a hologram may be measured relative to the intensity of the primary peak of the hologram. Relative to the primary peak of the hologram, the intensity of the side lobes of the blue hologram, the green hologram, the red hologram, and the infrared hologram may be equal. Due to the large difference in wavelength between each color hologram, careful selection of wavelength and angle is required for each reference beam employed in the production of hologram with controlled
side lobes 700 to ensure that each color hologram has the same net phase shift when recorded on a recording substrate with a constant thickness. -

Cladding layer 818 surroundslight guide 810, in-coupler 811, and GRIN-outcoupler 812.Cladding layer 818 comprises a low index material, where cladding layer may comprise a material with a refractive index of 1.5, 1.2, or 1.0. A lower refractive index is more advantageous as this increases the field of view of the light guide when the light guide is used as a display. A non-exclusive example of a cladding material with a refractive index of 1.5 is a plastic material (PET, acrylic, Nylon, etc.). A non-exclusive example of a cladding material with a refractive index of 1.2 is a layer of silica sol-gel. A non-exclusive example of a cladding material with a refractive index of 1.0 is air, where a cladding layer comprising air typically includes additional material to provide structural support to the light guide. - In-
coupler 811 comprisesfirst surface 813 andthird surface 815. In-coupler 811 is physically coupled tolight guide 810 atfirst surface 813; in-coupler 811 is positioned and oriented to redirect light intolight guide 810. Out-coupler 812 comprisessecond surface 814 andfourth surface 816. Out-coupler 812 is physically coupled tolight guide 810 atsecond surface 814; out-coupler 812 is positioned and oriented to redirect light out oflight guide 810. - Beam of
light 820 impinges on in-coupler 811 withincident angle 823 and is redirected intolight guide 810 at an angle greater than the critical angle forlight guide 810. Beam oflight 820 is diffracted byincoupler 811 and is converted to guidedlight 821. Guided light 821 propagates throughlight guide 810 at an angle greater than the critical angle, bouncing off of the opposed surfaces oflight guide 810 due to total internal reflection (TIR). Upon reaching out-coupler 812, guidedlight 821 is redirected out oflight guide 810 to form redirected light 822; redirectedlight 822 is directed towards an eye of auser 813. -
Eyeglass lens 800 may further compriseexit pupil expander 817;exit pupil expander 817 may be physically coupled tolight guide 810.Exit pupil expander 817 may replicate guided light 821 to form additional beams of light, where the additional beams of light propagate to the outcoupler and may be redirected out oflight guide 810 towards an eye of auser 813, expanding the eyebox ofeyeglass lens 800 wheneyeglass lens 800 is utilized in a wearable heads-up display.Light guide 810 may advantageously comprise a high index material. - Each of: in-
coupler 811, out-coupler 812, and/orexit pupil expander 817, may comprise a hologram with controlled side lobes substantively similar to hologram with controlledside lobes 200.Eyeglass lens 800 may be similar in some ways toeyeglass lens 500.Eyeglass lens 800 may similar in some ways to eyeglass lens 630. - A person of skill in the art will appreciate that the various embodiments for side lobe control in holograms described herein may be applied in non-WHUD applications.
