Definitions
- This disclosure relates to social network events within a social network and, more particularly, to the sharing of media with non-users of the social network.
- the Internet currently allows for the free exchange of ideas and information in a manner that was unimaginable only a couple of decades ago.
- One such use for the Internet is as a communication medium, whether it is via one-on-one exchanges or multi-party exchanges. For example, two individuals may exchange private emails with each other. Alternatively, multiple people may participate on a public website in which they may post entries that are published for multiple people to read. Examples of such websites may include but are not limited to product/service review sites and topical blogs.
- social network may be used to refer to a group of technologies (e.g. Web-based and mobile technologies) that allow for users to engage in a quasi-real-time, interactive dialogue.
- Social networking websites have allowed people to interact and socialize in ways that were unimaginable ten years ago. For example, the use of such social networking websites has allowed for long lost friends to be reunited, long-distance friendships to be easily maintained, and information to be broadcast to groups of people.
- friends may share media content (e.g., videos and photographs) with each other. Unfortunately, a prerequisite to sharing such media content is often that any party participating in the sharing must be a member of the social network.
- a computer-implemented method includes defining an unrestricted web-based space on a computing device for sharing media content within a social network.
- the unrestricted web-based space is accessible by non-users of the social network and is associated with a social network event that is being attended by a first user of the social network.
- First media content is received from the first user.
- the first media content is chosen from the group consisting of: an audio file; a video file; an audio-video file; and a still photograph.
- the first media content is shared within the unrestricted web-based space.
- the first user is enabled to provide location information concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network.
- the non-user is enabled to view the first media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space.

Abstract
A method and computing system for defining an unrestricted web-based space on a computing device for sharing media content within a social network. The unrestricted web-based space is accessible by non-users of the social network. First media content is received from a first user of the social network. The first media content is shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user is enabled to provide location information concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network.
Description
- This disclosure relates to social network events within a social network and, more particularly, to the sharing of media with non-users of the social network.
- The Internet currently allows for the free exchange of ideas and information in a manner that was unimaginable only a couple of decades ago. One such use for the Internet is as a communication medium, whether it is via one-on-one exchanges or multi-party exchanges. For example, two individuals may exchange private emails with each other. Alternatively, multiple people may participate on a public website in which they may post entries that are published for multiple people to read. Examples of such websites may include but are not limited to product/service review sites and topical blogs.
- As is known in the art, the phrase social network may be used to refer to a group of technologies (e.g. Web-based and mobile technologies) that allow for users to engage in a quasi-real-time, interactive dialogue. Social networking websites have allowed people to interact and socialize in ways that were unimaginable ten years ago. For example, the use of such social networking websites has allowed for long lost friends to be reunited, long-distance friendships to be easily maintained, and information to be broadcast to groups of people. Further and through the use of such social networks, friends may share media content (e.g., videos and photographs) with each other. Unfortunately, a prerequisite to sharing such media content is often that any party participating in the sharing must be a member of the social network.
- In one implementation, a computer-implemented method includes defining an unrestricted web-based space on a computing device for sharing media content within a social network. The unrestricted web-based space is accessible by non-users of the social network and is associated with a social network event that is being attended by a first user of the social network. First media content is received from the first user. The first media content is chosen from the group consisting of: an audio file; a video file; an audio-video file; and a still photograph. The first media content is shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user is enabled to provide location information concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network. The non-user is enabled to view the first media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space.
- In another implementation, a computer-implemented method includes defining an unrestricted web-based space on a computing device for sharing media content within a social network. The unrestricted web-based space is accessible by non-users of the social network. First media content is received from a first user of the social network. The first media content is shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user is enabled to provide location information concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first media content may be chosen from the group consisting of: an audio file; a video file; an audio-video file; and a still photograph. The location information may be a URL. The non-user may be enabled to view the first media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space. Second media content may be received from the non-user. The second media content may be shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user may be enabled to view the second media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The second media content is chosen from the group consisting of: an audio file; a video file; an audio-video file; and a still photograph. The unrestricted web-based space may be associated with a social network event. The social network event may being attended by the first user
- In another implementation, a computing system including a processor and memory is configured to perform operations including defining an unrestricted web-based space on a computing device for sharing media content within a social network. The unrestricted web-based space is accessible by non-users of the social network. First media content is received from a first user of the social network. The first media content is shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user is enabled to provide location information concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The first media content may be chosen from the group consisting of: an audio file; a video file; an audio-video file; and a still photograph. The location information may be a URL. The non-user may be enabled to view the first media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space. Second media content may be received from the non-user. The second media content may be shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user may be enabled to view the second media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space. The second media content is chosen from the group consisting of: an audio file; a video file; an audio-video file; and a still photograph. The unrestricted web-based space may be associated with a social network event. The social network event may be being attended by the first user
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- People may use social networks to share photographs with each other. And when multiple people attend a social event defined within a social network, these people may each upload photographs concerning the social event to a shared photography pool that is accessible by all of the people who attended the social event. Unfortunately, such systems often require contributors to be members of the social network. This disclosure concerns a novel manner in which photographs within a social network may be shared with non-users of the social network. For example, a user of the social network may define an unrestricted web-based space for sharing media content with non-users of the social network. This unrestricted web-based space may be accessible by such non-users of the social network. Media content (e.g., audio files; video files; audio-video files; and still photographs) may be uploaded by the user and placed within the unrestricted web-based space for sharing with the non-users of the social network. The user may provide location information (e.g., in the form of a complex, non-indexed URL) concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network. Accordingly, the non-user of the social network may access the unrestricted web-based space and view the media content shared within the unrestricted web-based space by the user.
- In
FIGS. 1 & 2 , there is showndata sharing process 10.Data sharing process 10 may be implemented as a server-side process, a client-side process, or a hybrid server-side/client-side process. For example,data sharing process 10 may be implemented as a purely server-side process viadata sharing process 10 s. Alternatively,data sharing process 10 may be implemented as a purely client-side process via one or more of client-side application 10 c 1, client-side application 10 c 2, client-side application 10 c 3, and client-side application 10 c 4. Alternatively still,data sharing process 10 may be implemented as a hybrid server-side/client-side process viadata sharing process 10 s in combination with one or more of client-side application 10 c 1, client-side application 10 c 2, client-side application 10 c 3, and client-side application 10 c 4. Accordingly,data sharing process 10 as used in this disclosure may include any combination ofdata sharing process 10 s, client-side application 10 c 1, client-side application 10 c 2, client-side application 10 c 3, and client-side application 10 c 4. - As will be discussed below in greater detail,
data sharing process 10 may define 100 an unrestricted web-based space on a computing device for sharing media content within a social network. The unrestricted web-based space may be accessible by non-users of the social network. First media content may be received 102 from a first user of the social network. The first media content may be shared 104 within the unrestricted web-based space. The first user may be enabled 106 to provide location information concerning the unrestricted web-based space to a non-user of the social network. -
Data sharing process 10 s may be a server application and may reside on and may be executed by computingdevice 12, which may be connected to network 14 (e.g., the Internet or a local area network). Examples ofcomputing device 12 may include, but are not limited to: a personal computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a data-enabled cellular telephone, a notebook computer, a television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, a server computer, a series of server computers, a mini computer, a mainframe computer, or a dedicated network device. - The instruction sets and subroutines of
data sharing process 10 s, which may be stored onstorage device 16 coupled tocomputing device 12, may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory architectures (not shown) included withincomputing device 12. Examples ofstorage device 16 may include but are not limited to: a hard disk drive; a tape drive; an optical drive; a RAID device; a random access memory (RAM); a read-only memory (ROM); and all forms of flash memory storage devices. -
Network 14 may be connected to one or more secondary networks (e.g., network 18), examples of which may include but are not limited to: a local area network; a wide area network; or an intranet, for example. - Examples of client-side applications 10 c 1, 10 c 2, 10 c 3, 10 c 4 may include but are not limited to a web browser, a game console user interface, or a specialized application (e.g., an application running on e.g., the Android™ platform or the iPhone™ platform). The instruction sets and subroutines of client-side applications 10 c 1, 10 c 2, 10 c 3, 10 c 4, which may be stored on
storage devices electronic devices electronic devices storage devices - Examples of client
electronic devices cellular telephone 28,laptop computer 30, personaldigital assistant 32,personal computer 34, a notebook computer (not shown), a server computer (not shown), a gaming console (not shown), and a dedicated network device (not shown). Clientelectronic devices -
Users data sharing process 10 directly throughnetwork 14 or throughsecondary network 18. Further,data sharing process 10 may be connected to network 14 throughsecondary network 18, as illustrated withlink line 44. - The various client electronic devices (e.g., client
electronic devices cellular telephone 28 andlaptop computer 30 are shown wirelessly coupled tonetwork 14 viawireless communication channels 44, 46 (respectively) established between data-enabled,cellular telephone 28, laptop computer 30 (respectively) and cellular network/bridge 48, which is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14. Further, personaldigital assistant 32 is shown wirelessly coupled tonetwork 14 viawireless communication channel 50 established between personaldigital assistant 32 and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) 52, which is shown directly coupled tonetwork 14. Additionally,personal computer 34 is shown directly coupled tonetwork 18 via a hardwired network connection. -
WAP 52 may be, for example, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth device that is capable of establishingwireless communication channel 50 between personaldigital assistant 32 andWAP 52. As is known in the art, IEEE 802.11x specifications may use Ethernet protocol and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (i.e., CSMA/CA) for path sharing. The various 802.11x specifications may use phase-shift keying (i.e., PSK) modulation or complementary code keying (i.e., CCK) modulation, for example. As is known in the art, Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification that allows e.g., mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants to be interconnected using a short-range wireless connection. - As is known in the art, users of social networks (e.g., Google+™) may be able to schedule social network events, wherein a social network event is a group activity in which people get together for a specific purpose. Examples of such social network events may include but are not limited to: a group of friends getting together for drinks, several people going to a baseball game together, an end of summer party at a person's house, and a concert at a local arena. While the above discussion concerns Google+™, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure. For example,
data sharing process 10 may be included within or utilized by any social networking website. - Referring also to
FIG. 3A ,data sharing process 10 may be included within, executed within, or a portion of a social network (e.g., social network 150). The phrase social network may be used to refer to a group of technologies (e.g. web-based and mobile technologies) that allow for users to engage in a quasi-real-time, interactive dialogue. - For illustrative purposes, assume that
user 36 is planning on attending their daughter's softball game the following Saturday and would like to share photographs and videos from the game. Accordingly, data sharing process 10 (in conjunction with social network 150) may be configured to allowuser 36 to define/schedule a social network event for this softball game. For example,social network 150 may includegraphical user interface 152, which may be divided into a plurality of sections, such asmedia stream 154,weather 156, andnews 158. To schedule a social network event,user 36 may select e.g.,schedule event button 160 using onscreen pointer 162 (which is controllable via a mouse, not shown). - Upon
user 36 making this selection,data sharing process 10 may renderevent window 164 that may be configured to define a scheduled time/date/location/venue for the social network event and may allowuser 36 to identify invitee(s) for the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. -
Event window 164 may be configured to allowuser 36 to define a time/date/location/venue for the social network event. Accordingly,user 36 may enter the appropriate time (e.g., 9:00 a.m.)/date (e.g., 10-28-2012)/location (e.g., Mountain View, Calif.)/venue (e.g., RHS Softball Field) into the “Time”, “Date”, “Location” and “Venue” fields ofevent window 164. -
Event window 164 may further be configured to allowuser 36 to invite various types of individuals to the social network event. For example,event window 164 may be configured to identify members ofsocial network 150 that are friends with/connected to/in a circle withuser 36. For example, assume thatuser 36 is friends with Mary (user 38), Joe (user 40), and Cindy (user 42). - In the event that
user 36 wishes to invite any ofusers user 36 may check the appropriate check box next to the name of the user(s) that they wish to invite. - Additionally,
event window 164 may be configured to allowuser 36 to invite people that are not members ofsocial network 150. Accordingly,user 36 may populateemail field 166 with the email address(es) of people that that they wish to invite to join the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game but are currently not members ofsocial network 150. Additionally/alternatively,event window 164 may be further configured to allowuser 36 to invite people that are not members ofsocial network 150 via e.g., a phone number (i.e., in the form of a text message) or some other unique identifier (e.g., an ID on another network, a Twitter™ account, etc.). -
Event window 164 may includemessage field 168 that may allowuser 36 to define a text-based comment concerning the social network event. For example,user 36 may add the comment “Alyssa has a big game this day!” Accordingly, this text-based comment may be used as a descriptor for the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. - Further,
event window 164 may allowuser 36 to define whether non-users ofsocial network 150 may share (e.g., upload and download) media associated with the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. Accordingly, ifuser 36 wishes to allow for such non-user participation,user 36 may select check box 170 (via onscreen pointer 162). - Once the appropriate people are identified within
event window 164,user 36 may select (via onscreen pointer 162) the “create” button included withinevent window 164, thus creating the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game and sending out the appropriate invitations. - Referring also to
FIG. 3B and uponuser 36 selecting the “create” button,data sharing process 10 may generate an event webpage (e.g. event webpage 180) for the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. Further,data sharing process 10 may renderevent webpage 180 associated with the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game in response to a user (e.g. one or more ofusers event webpage 180.Event webpage 180 may include a plurality of sections, examples of which may include but are not limited toevent section 182,attendee section 184 andmedia content section 186. -
Event section 182 may be configured to provide visitors ofevent webpage 180 with information concerning the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. For example,event section 182 may include the original message defined withinmessage field 168, namely “Alyssa has a big game this day!” Further,event section 182 may define a time/date/location/venue for the social network event (e.g., 9:00 a.m. on 10-28-2012 in Mountain View, Calif. @ RHS Softball Field). Further,event section 182 may include direction link 188 that may allow a visitor toevent webpage 180 to obtain directions to the event venue (e.g. RHS Softball Field). -
Attendee section 184 may be configured to define the people who are attending the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. For example,attendee section 184 may be configured to provide a visitor toevent webpage 180 with a list that identifies the individuals who were invited to the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game and a list that identifies the individuals who have confirmed their attendance at the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. -
Media content section 186 may be configured to display media content that is associated with the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. Examples of such media content may include audio files (e.g., an audio recording of the singing of the National Anthem before the game); video files (e.g., a video recording of a play during the game); audio-video files (e.g., an audio-video recording the last inning of the game); and still photographs (e.g., photographs 190, 192, 194). - As discussed above, by selecting
checkbox 170 withinevent window 164,user 36 may define whether non-users ofsocial network 150 may share (e.g., upload and download) media associated with the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game. Accordingly, ifuser 36 selectscheckbox 170,data sharing process 10 define 100 an unrestricted web-based space (e.g., unrestricted web-based space 196) on a computing device (e.g., computing device 12) for sharing media content (e.g., photographs 190, 192, 194) withinsocial network 150. Unrestricted web-basedspace 196, which may be accessible by non-users of the social network, may be a directory within e.g., computing device 12 (or some other server/storage device) that is accessible viasocial network 150 and into which media may be copied for sharing purposes. Further, unrestricted web-basedspace 196 may be a non-indexed webpage that would not be located via a search engine. Accordingly, while unrestricted web-basedspace 196 is not a restricted area, unrestricted web-basedspace 196 may be a quasi-private space due to it being undiscoverable via search engines. - Assume for illustrative purposes that while attending the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game,
user 36 meets an attendee of the social network event (e.g. attendee 54) who was attending the softball game because their daughter is also on the softball team. However,attendee 54 is not a user ofsocial network 150. - Further, assume that during the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game,
user 36 is generating media content (e.g. photographs 190, 192, 194) and uploading the same tosocial network 150. Accordingly,data sharing process 10 may receive 102 first media content (e.g. photographs 190, 192, 194) fromuser 36 and may share 104 the first media content (e.g. photographs 190, 192, 194) within unrestricted web-basedspace 196. - Assume for illustrative purposes that during the course of the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game,
user 36 andattendee 54 begin to talk and decided they would like to share their photographs of the event. As discussed above, uponuser 36uploading photographs photographs space 196 and visible viamedia content section 186 ofevent webpage 180. -
Data sharing process 10 may enable 106user 36 to provide location information concerning unrestricted web-basedspace 196 to non-users of social network 150 (e.g. attendee 54). Accordingly, through the use of unrestricted web-basedspace 196, non-users ofsocial network 150 may be able to share media with users ofsocial network 150 without being required to joinsocial network 150. Providing the location information toattendee 54 may be accomplished in various ways such as “handshaking” clientelectronic devices 28 being used byuser 36 and the client electronic device (not shown) being used byattendee 54. This “handshake” may be achieved in multiple ways, examples of which may include but are not limited to clientelectronic device 28 IR beaming the pertinent information to the client electronic device (not shown) ofattendee 54; clientelectronic device 28 displaying a barcode (not shown) that may be scanned by the client electronic device (not shown) ofattendee 54; clientelectronic device 28 sending an e-mail/text message (not shown) to the client electronic device (not shown) ofattendee 54; or clientelectronic device 28 displaying information that may be manually typed into the client electronic device (not shown) ofattendee 54. Regardless of the type of handshake, the data provided toattendee 54 byuser 36 may contain a URL (or a shortened URL) that may directattendee 54 to unrestricted web-basedspace 196. - While the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game is described above as being created within
social network 150 prior to the occurrence of the event, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure as other configurations are possible and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure and the claims. For example, the social network event may be created in an ad-hoc fashion in response to the above-described handshake operation. - For example, assume that
user 36 is attending the social network event e.g., Aly's Softball Game and taking several photographs (e.g. photographs 190, 192, 194). Further, assume that prior to meetingattendee 54,user 36 did not intend to sharephotographs attendee 54,user 36 andattendee 54 decided to share their photos amongst each other. Accordingly,user 36 may initiate the above-described handshaking procedure, which may in turn result in: the defining 100 of unrestricted web-basedspace 196; the receiving 102 ofphotographs user 36, the sharing 104 ofphotographs space 196, anduser 36 being enabled 106 to provide location information toattendee 54 concerning unrestricted web-basedspace 196. -
Data sharing process 10 may also enable 108 the non-user (e.g. attendee 54) to view the first media content (e.g. photographs 190, 192, 194) shared within unrestricted web-basedspace 196. Accordingly,attendee 54 may visitevent webpage 180 and view photographs 190, 192, 194 that appear withinmedia content section 186 ofevent webpage 180 and are stored within unrestricted web-basedspace 196. - Additionally,
data sharing process 10 may be configured to receive 110 second media content (e.g. photograph 198) from non-users (e.g. attendee 54) ofsocial network 150. For example, assume thatattendee 54 is also taking photographs at the social network event and thatattendee 54 would like to sharephotograph 198 withuser 36. Accordingly,attendee 54 may uploadphotograph 198, which may be received 110 bydata sharing process 10. -
Data sharing process 10 may share 112 the second media content (e.g. photograph 198) within unrestricted web-basedspace 196, which may appear withinmedia content section 186 ofevent webpage 180. Further,data sharing process 10 may enable 114 the first user (e.g. user 36) to view the second media content (e.g. photograph 198) shared within unrestricted web-basedspace 196. Accordingly,user 36 may visitevent webpage 180 andview photograph 198 that appears withinmedia content section 186 ofevent webpage 180 and is stored within unrestricted web-basedspace 196. - Referring also to
FIG. 4 , there is shown a diagrammatic view ofcomputing system 12. Whilecomputing system 12 is shown in this figure, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configuration are possible.
