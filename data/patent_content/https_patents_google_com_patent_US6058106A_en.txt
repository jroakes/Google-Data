Definitions
- DECT Digital European Cordless Telephone
- PHS Personal Handyphone System
- micro-cellular systems have been suggested for in-home application and, at first glance, seem suitable with respect to the systems' integral cordless telephone function.
- the current frequency plans for DECT and PHS are only available regionally.
- rules governing the 24 GHz ISM the only band with worldwide availability, is not conducive to PHS or DECT protocols.
- PHS and DECT cannot withstand the bursted interference.
- these micro-cellular systems contain significant additional complexity to handle community or campus deployment providing for intercell hand-off and roaming capability.
- the systems are designed to tolerate multipath distortion present even in the systems' small micro-cell environment which is significantly larger than an in-home pico-cell.
- FIG. 10 is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of steps for a network protocol method in accordance with the present invention.
- the initiation request requests a predetermined number of blocks to be transferred from the WSPD to the WDPD.
- FIG. 7, numeral 700 is a block diagram of a WSPD in accordance with the present invention.
- the low complexity WSPD Upon sending or receiving an initiation request, initializing, and preparing N blocks of data, N a predetermined integer, for transmission, the low complexity WSPD efficiently accesses a radio resource in a wireless communication system and transmits the N blocks of data.
- the low complexity WSPD (702) includes a block assignment receiver unit (704) and an acknowledgment interpreter (706).
- the microwave oven interference will limit the achievable throughput in this system. Careful examination of the interference waveforms indicates that the microwave is not radiating power all of the time. Since the klystron is active only when the voltage of a half-wave rectified AC power input is greater than some value, interference is only present in a given 1 MHz channel for 40% or less of the time, with a periodic 60/50 Hz cycle. Depending on the center frequency of the channel, some interference patterns appear as two short spikes (1102) at the turn on or off points of the klystron. A spectrum analyzer screen capture shown in FIG. 11, numeral 1100, illustrates the interference modes that are commonly seen.
- the architecture of the In-Home RF Bus protocol is defined in terms of interfaces, devices, applications, and connections.
- the interfaces refer to the physical media over which the data is communicated.
- Devices define the end-points of the various interfaces.
- the applications furnish the services provided to registered peripherals. Connections carry the data between a registered peripheral and the serving application.
- Legacy peripherals cover all devices that have traditionally been wired to a computer such as printers, scanners, and laptops. These devices may be connected by an emulated wired interface carried over the A-Interface to the personal computer. This emulated interface is referred to a the L-Interface or Legacy-Interface.
- the L-interface may be a PCI, RS-232, ISA, or Parallel Port.
- the wired voice & data network represents a connection to the Public Switched Telephone Network, the Internet, a cable provider, or satellite network.
- Peripherals that wish to connect to the wired voice and data network must always go through an intermediate application. Two default applications are defined for this purpose, the POTS application and the PPP application.
- w c is the RF carrier frequency.
- the channel bit rate of 1.544 megabits per second corresponds to a symbol rate of 772 kilosymbols per second.
- the BA burst enables the dynamic allocation and duplexing features of the DTDMA/TDD channel, assigning the both the source and destination device at the beginning of each block transaction.
- the source and destination address fields may either specify an access point or peripheral enabling downlink (access point to peripheral), uplink (peripheral to access point), or peer-to-peer (peripheral to peripheral) transfers.
- the BA field contains general broadcast information to identify the system, the current transaction block, the current frame, and the RF channel of the next frame.
- the acknowledgment value, received from the destination peripheral in the previous frame is repeated as part of the BA field.
- the addresses, broadcast information, and acknowledgment fields are all protected by a 24-bit CRC. Furthermore these protected fields are preceded by differential encoding reference symbol (2-bits) and a synchronization word (32-bits). Table 2 defines the order and the content of the fields within the BA burst.
- Frequency hopping information is communicated through the 8 bit "FH Word" data element contained in every BA.
- a unit can read the current BA's FH Word to know which channel to hop to at the end of the current frame. This is essential before and during the registration process, because the unit is not synchronized with the base's FHP.
- the base uses the data packet that accompanies the Registration Acknowledge packet to download the entire FHP into the unit.
- the unit then does not have to read the BA field every frame to know where to hop to next, and can weather long periods of interference, such as might be expected as the unit goes in and out of range from the base.
- the unit can now power down and "sleep" for long periods of time, awakening on the correct frequency channel by advancing the index into the FHP by the number of frames of sleep.
- This description provides specifications necessary to the design of the RF and IF transceiver sections of the access point and peripheral. First, requirements of the access point and peripheral receivers are specified.
- the input third order intercept point of both the access point and peripheral receiver shall be greater than -16 dBm.
- the DA-TDMA system assigns each block on an individual basis and allows all blocks to be immediately acknowledged. Assignments are based on connections to applications where each connection corresponds to a unique physical layer address. Within these connections, acknowledgements are used to mitigate the interference caused by microwave ovens and other impediments.
- the individual blocks may be combined to form isochronous data streams from 1 to 992 kbps or asynchronous data packet up to 6141 octets long. Individual connections can be aggregated to form a full-duplex communications link which may be asymmetrical.
- a control connection is used to manage the origination and termination of both types of transfers. The control connection is used to manage system parameters such as hopping patterns, devices IDs, etc.
- a peripheral contending on the system will monitor the BA bursts until a control block is detected.
- An asynchronous connection transfer an a periodic data packet between a peripheral device and application.
- the most common data type transferred are PPP encapsulated IP datagrams.
- Each asynchronous connection is established during the registration process and is maintained for the duration a device is registered.
- the data packet is segmented by the source device into native payload blocks called asynchronous segments.
- the first segment is a control segment followed by the requisite number of data segment.
- Ninety-two octets of a data packet may be included in the control segment.
- Each subsequent data segment may carry 96 octets of the data.
- the final data segment will be padded will fill bits to form one complete block.
- the end of the data in the final segment is specified in the initial control segment's Pad-Octets and Pad-Bits fields. See the information on Control Connection Extended Header for the form at of the initial control segment.
- a peripheral in the isochronous mode may support multiple number of isochronous connections differentiated by unique sub-addresses.
- Each isochronous connection will specify a fixed number blocks to transfer per IW and the direction of the transfer. The number of blocks determines the data rate for the transfer with one block per IW forming the fundamental data rate 32 kbps.
- Super-rate and sub-rate connections are also possible.
- a super-rate connection is formed by transferring multiple blocks per IW giving a N ⁇ 32 kbps data-rate.
- Sub-rates are formed by transferring one block every M IWs giving a 32/M kbps data-rate.
- the access point should assign a block to the peripheral's control connection in the next IW.
- An access point with control data simply sends the information prior to the isochronous blocks.
- the connection may be terminated by either the peripheral or access point.
- the peripheral When terminated by the peripheral, the peripheral sends an asynchronous disconnect request to the access point.
- the access point responds with a disconnect order.
- the access point When terminated by the access point, the access point simply sends an unsolicited disconnect order.
- the access point is responsible for managing the systems resources and must enforce an admittance policy reserving bandwidth for retransmission's. When the capacity is exceeded, isochronous connections will be denied. The system's isochronous capacity is shared.
- Peripherals in either mode may receive messages, referred to as pages, during their scheduled IWs, referred to as both paging or polling intervals. All uplink and downlink messages during standby mode are addressed to the control connection.
- the DRX mode is intended to complement the asynchronous protocol by supporting units with varying data load and low delay requirements.
- the polled mode may be used to alleviate congestion by relegating all delay insensitive devices to infrequent polling.
- the polled mode may also be selected if the maximum delay must be bounded since a peripheral will have an opportunity to access the system every polling interval.
- the access point determines whether a peripheral is assigned to a DRX or polled mode in order to balance the system's performance for all peripherals.
- the access point may send data to other peripherals at its discretion.
- the peripheral will demodulate one block assignment, determine the message is for another user and return to low-power mode until the next paging interval.
- Control messages are carried within the 96-octet data field of the payload burst. Every block within a control message will use the 32-bit Control Connection Extended Header reducing the available octets in the data field to 92. The coding of these remaining octets are defined below:
- Application Initialization Request is used during service negotiation to initialize an application.
- the peripheral specifies which application it would like to connect to and identifies it capabilities to the application server.
- the format of the information element is in Table 31.
- the peripheral In order for a peripheral to acquire a new system and access service the peripheral must be able to synchronize to an access point, reject access points that are not its own, and finally identify the purchaser's access point as its own.
- the purchaser's access point and peripheral are assumed to share a PIN which is unique to the new peripheral.
- the access point and peripheral are assumed to also share a PSK.
- the method for inserting the PIN and PSK into the access point is left to the manufacturer's desecration.
- the peripheral If the peripheral is dissatisfied with any Application Assignment, it make send up a subsequent Service Set-Up containing alternative application settings. This process will continue until the peripheral receives a set of parameters it is satisfied with or chooses not subscribe to the services of an application. Having reached that point, the peripheral ends the negotiation process by sending a Service Negotiation Complete containing the Application IDs of the application it has chosen to subscribe too. Omitted Application IDs are assumed to have been rejected and therefore the access point may release any previously negotiated resources associated with the rejected applications.
