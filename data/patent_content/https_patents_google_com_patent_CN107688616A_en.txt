Embodiment
Fig. 1 is the block diagram according to the search system 100 of example embodiment.System 100 can be used for implementing to provide uniqueness
The search engine of a part for the true search result as ad hoc inquiry.Unique fact represents the fact that related to entity, but
Be when it is unique true be applied to big group when (for example, the certain types of entity), its be not usually it is interesting or
Related.Therefore, unique true expression unstructured properties, or, in other words, not for the entity class pattern in knowledge base
The attribute of formula.Searching from internet corpus and/or knowledge base will be described as providing to the explanation of the system 100 in Fig. 1
The inquiry that the search engine system of hitch fruit, the internet corpus and/or knowledge base are additionally in response to special entity provides only
It is special true.Other configurations and the application of described technology can be used.For example, unique fact can be used for marketing or other
Data mining task.In some embodiments, search engine can not provide the search from single corpus of documents
As a result knowledge base is searched in the case of, vice versa.
Search system 100 can include：Unique fact-finding system 110 and inquiry system 120.Unique fact-finding system
110 and inquiry system 120 can be the computing device for taking some distinct device forms, for example, standard server, one group so
Server or rack-mounted server system.In some embodiments, unique fact-finding system 110 and inquiry system
120 can be the individual system of shared component (such as, processor and memory).Furthermore it is possible to implement in personal computer
Unique fact-finding system 110 and inquiry system 120, for example, desktop computer or laptop computer.As retouched in fig. 12
Paint, unique fact-finding system 110 and inquiry system 120 can be the examples of computer equipment 1200.
Search system 100 can include knowledge base 190.The knowledge base 190 can store the fact that relevant with entity.One
In a little embodiments, knowledge base 190 can be datagram, in the datagram, entity is stored as into node and deposits the fact
Store up between entity or relation of the entity attributes-value between.Edge can have the edge of label and label can be with
Represent the fact that thousands of or hundreds thousand of individual different.As used herein, entity can refer to the physics of people, place or thing
The expression of embodiment or physical entity, for example, the other information of text or reference entity.For example, entity can be koala
Or refer to the physical embodiments of the abstract concept of koala.Knowledge base 190 can include allowing query processor to determine to be stored in
The index of entity and those entity attributes in knowledge base.Search system can also include the repositories of documents 195 that can search for.
For example, repositories of documents 195, which can include storage, there is the index of item (term) in a document or phrase and document
Content or the pointer for pointing to content.In some embodiments, document repositories 195 represent the text that can be obtained by internet
Shelves.
Repositories of documents 195 and knowledge base 190 can be stored in tangible computer readable storage device (for example, disk, sudden strain of a muscle
Fast memory, cache memory or its combination) on, the tangible computer readable storage device is configured as according to partly forever
Long or non-transitory form carrys out data storage.In some embodiments, can be by document repositories 195 and knowledge base 190
It is stored in the combination of various memories, and can be by one or both of document repositories 195 and knowledge base 190 point
Cloth is on one or more server.In some embodiments, document repositories 195 and knowledge base 190 can be stored
In the server that removes but can be accessed by system 100 from system 100.
Unique fact-finding system 110 can include being formed in a substrate and be configured as performing one or more machine
Either software, the burst of firmware or its combination of one or more processor 113 of device executable instruction.Unique fact-finding
System 110 can include：Operating system (not shown)；And it is configured as interim, permanent or semi-permanently data storage
One or more computer storage 114 (for example, main storage) or its combination.Memory can be included according to can be by
The form that processor 113 reads and/or performed carrys out any kind of storage device of storage information.Memory 114 can include：
Volatile memory, nonvolatile memory or its combination, and store and perform some behaviour when being performed by processor 113
The module of work.In other embodiments, module can be stored in External memory equipment (not shown) and be loaded into and deposited
In reservoir 114.Module (such as, unique true finger 115) can enable unique fact-finding system 110 identify and group
The uniqueness fact of unique true thesaurus 153 or the various entities in knowledge base 190 can be stored directly in by knitting (curate).
For example, unique true finger 115 can use triggering 150 to select document from repositories of documents as unique
True source.Triggering 150 can represent the document for including the fact that interesting, interesting or unique for identifying
Phrase.For example, triggering 150 can include：List of phrases, such as, " fun facts (the fact that interesting) " or " did you
Know (do you know) " or " you might not know (you may be unaware that) " etc..Phrase is one or more list
Word.Such phrase can represent either along with it is uncommon or unique the fact.In some embodiments, these are short
Language can be white list phrase, and trigger 150 phrases that can include piping off, such as, " fake (false) ",
" false (mistake) ", " propaganda (publicity) ", " lies (lie) ", " bad facts (the fact that bad) ", " myths
(mythology) " etc..This phrase to pipe off represents to be less likely to include reliable true content.In some embodiments
In, triggering these phrases in 150 and can use there is the fact that interesting or interesting to show as front training
The document of example and lack the fact that interesting/interesting either there is the fact that bad or mythical show as negative training
The pre-candidate set of the document of example, to carry out machine learning.Unique true finger 115 can be from the document as unique true source
Document is selected in thesaurus 195.Document is included in the inquiry in response to the triggering phrase including being included in white list when
When in document, unique true finger 115 can select document as unique true source from repositories of documents 195.So
In the case of, inquiry can be considered as to sensing document.Unique true finger 115 can be looked into using search record 155 to identify
Ask and respond document.When another document is included to during at least one link of document, unique true finger 115 can also be in the future
It is considered as unique true source from the document of document repositories 195, the link has the triggering that white list is included in one or more
The associated text of phrase.In other words, if the first document includes pointing to the anchor tag of the second document, and the anchor tag bag
Phrase " fun facts (the fact that interesting) " is included, then the second document can be considered as unique fact by unique true finger 115
Source.In this sense, document is pointed in link.
In some embodiments, when discovery is touched with pointing to the associated text that links of document including what is piped off
During any triggering phrase in hair phrase or when document is identified as in response to inquiry including the phrase to pipe off,
System can eliminate or remove the document as unique true source.In such embodiment, when with being included in white list
Triggering phrase in any triggering phrase inquiry or link rather than pipe off triggering phrase in it is any touch
When sending out phrase sensing document, document can be considered as unique true source by unique true finger 115.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can remove low-quality document from unique true source.
For example, unique true finger 115 can be using low page rank or the document including offensive content (for example, color
Feelings document) document is filtered out, so that such document is not considered as unique true source.As another example, unique thing
Real finger 115 can filter out be probably blog or forum document.As another example, unique true finger 115
Can be for example using fingerprint technique come according to low quality (and not being unique true source therefore) any polymerization of identification, repetition
Or plagiarization document.Such document only repeats the content of other documents and does not provide independent unique true source, and
And it can artificially distort the support to the fact.
Once unique true finger 115 recognizes the document as unique true source, unique true finger 115 can
To extract sentence from document.When extracting sentence, unique true finger 115 can be focused on the text of document.
Text is core, center or the pith of document and does not include any comment section, menu head, sidebar menu etc..Thing
Real finger 115 can perform semantic analysis to the sentence in the core in unique true source and be referred to identifying in sentence
Entity.Semantic analysis is the step in natural language processing.For example, specific free text document is given, and such as, webpage, reason
The semanteme of text in solution webpage can be related to the analysis of several types, such as, noun phrase segmentation, entity indicia and use
The reference for such technology analyzed that is known or developing later is decomposed.Sentence can directly refer to entity or can
To refer to entity via pronoun.In addition, identical sentence can be mentioned that more than one entity.For example, unique true finger 115
Can determine sentence " Moby Dick was written by Herman Melville (《Beluga》By Herman Mai Erwei
Written by you) " refer to entity《Beluga》(Moby Dick) and Herman Melville (Herman Melville) and more
Common solid, such as, Book and Author.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can generate entity-sentence pair, wherein, by sentence and quilt
It was found that each entity referred to by the sentence matches.In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can from entity-
Sentence centering excludes the entity less than topicality threshold value, for example, so that unique true finger 115 is not by entity and sentence
Pairing.The current events of entity-sentence pair can be determined for sentence during semantic analysis is carried out to source document or for document
Property score.Document topicality score presentation-entity is on the whole to the topicality of document.It is if sporocarp is the theme of document, then literary
Shelves topicality score will be very high, for example, being given a mark with the yardstick from 0 to 1, close to 1.0.In some embodiments, it is semantic important
Topicality of the property score presentation-entity to sentence.For example, source document can be relevant with cat, but sentence will can have with dog
The uniqueness fact of pass is compared with cat, for example, " a dog ' s sense of smell is 100x more sensitive
Than a cat ' s (100 times sensitiveer than the feel of cat of the smell of dog) ".Semantic importance score can be used for meeting topicality threshold
Value.Can based on document topicality score, semantic importance score or these combination come determine entity-sentence pair when
Thing score.The topicality threshold value that entity needs to meet can depend on the type of entity.For example, unique true finger 115
It can require to represent that the entity (such as, book, country, film) of wide class is (such as, more Australian than specific entity to meet
Or《Beluga》) higher topicality threshold value.In some embodiments, the system can include threshold value table 152 to consider not
Same threshold value.Threshold value table 152 can include the topicality threshold value of special entity.If entity be present in threshold value table 152, the reality
The threshold score of body must is fulfilled for or the threshold value more than the entity in threshold value table 152.Otherwise, unique true finger 115
The default threshold for being applied to do not have bar destination entity in threshold value table 152 can be used.In such a manner, the system can
Think the higher topicality threshold value of some entity setting ups, but relatively low default threshold is used to all other entity.Based on
In the embodiment that topicality is filtered to entity, unique true finger 115 is only with satisfaction or more than appropriate
Entity generation entity-sentence pair of the topicality score of topicality threshold value.In some embodiments, by entity-sentence to depositing
Storage is for example, in unique true thesaurus 153 or knowledge base 190 itself.Can together with additional information storage entity-sentence
It is right, such as, therefrom extract the topicality of the instruction of the source document (for example, URL of source document) of sentence and the entity of the sentence
Score.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can mark and alternatively filter out bad sentence.It is unique
True finger 115 will can be write poor bad sentence and/or to need the sentence of context to be considered as " bad ".Sentence may need field
Border, because the sentence uses pronoun, although unique true finger 115 may not be because of this in some embodiments
Sentence is considered as " bad " by sentence using pronoun to refer to the entity matched with it.When sentence is included as in the first clause
Etc. " later " or " then " during item, sentence may also need context.Unique true finger 115 can by such entity-
Sentence can keep entity-sentence pair to indicating or being denoted as " bad ".In some embodiments, unique fact is looked into
Look for device 115 can in storage entity-sentence to removing some prefixes from sentence before, for example, remove as " but " it is or " another
Item outside ".Such prefix may not be needed context, but may be nonsensical when being presented as Query Result.One
In a little embodiments, these sentences can be masked as " bad " by unique true finger 115, but this can reduce and be identified simultaneously
And it is rendered as the quantity of the uniqueness fact of search result.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 will likely can be expressed as tying in knowledge base 190
The true sentence of structureization filters out.For example, sentence (such as, " X with some pattern match can be removed from entity-sentence centering
Is friend with (X be ... friend) ", " X is married to (X with ... get married) " or " X was born
On (X is born in) ", wherein, X presentation-entity refers to) because these sentences are less likely to represent unique true.It is on the contrary, such
Sentence expression structuring is true.Pattern for identifying the sentence for being probably the structuring fact can be manual plan exhibition and will
It is stored as a part for system 100.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can via cluster and ranking come refine the entity of entity-
Sentence pair.Unique true finger 115 can by entity say be identical thing but the Sentence Clustering that is slightly different of mode
Together.Carry out cluster and enable a system to avoid to show the fact that repeat or almost repeat in search result, and make be
System can be accumulated between identical true sentence is expressed to be supported, this instruction true correctness and uniqueness.In some implementations
In mode, unique true finger 115 can by highlighting item by Sentence Clustering, wherein, each sentence in cluster has
Highlight equivalent (equivalent) set of item.Highlight item be in sentence be not off word (such as, " the ", " a ", " and ",
Or unique true finger 115 thinks unessential other words) any item.If first highlights item and another item that highlights exists
Progress lemmatization is identical entry afterwards (for example, it is phase after lemmatization is carried out to play " play " and play " playing "
With), if one is another synonym, or if two items are all numerals, then first highlight item and another highlight
Item is equivalent.Therefore, for the purpose clustered, " three " and " four " can equivalent highlight item.In some embodiment party
In formula, if value is both less than maximum, numeric item can be equivalent.If for example, two values both less than 100, item can
To be equivalent, if one or two values are above maximum (for example, 100), item is not equivalent.For to include
Two sentences in same cluster, must be in second sentence in each item highlighted in the set of item of first sentence
Highlighting has equivalent item in the set of item, vice versa.These clusters are considered as major clusters.In some embodiments, no
Need to carry out minimum requirement to the size of cluster.For example, major clusters can only include a sentence.In some embodiments
In, when the combination of sentences with carrying out self-supporting cluster, system can require minimal size.In such a system, for example, when branch
When holding cluster includes at least one sentence (or at least three sentences etc.), major clusters can include a sentence.
Unique true finger 115 can also identify the support cluster of one or more in major clusters.Support cluster
Include the sentence of the subset for highlighting item with the sentence in major clusters.Sentence can be in multiple support clusters, still
Sentence in cluster is supported can not be the representative sentence of major clusters.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can be to entity-sentence to carrying out ranking.It can combine
Cluster or carry out the ranking independently of cluster.Unique true finger 115 can calculate each in entity-sentence pair
The sentence score of sentence.In some embodiments, the score calculated can be had by not only being flagged as bad sentence.Sentence
Sub- score can be based on some factors.One of factor can be the topicality of the entity of source document.As discussed above, should
Document topicality score can be used for entity-sentence to filtering out, and the document can be stored to together with entity-sentence
Topicality score.Another factor can be the ranking (for example, Page Rank scores) in the source of sentence.In some embodiments,
Document topicality score can be multiplied by the ranking of source document with the confidence of computational entity-sentence pair by unique true finger 115
The factor.Another factor can be the length of sentence, for example, in terms of character or word.Length factor can be make it is too short or
The degradation factor that too long of sentence degrades.In some embodiments, for example, can be measured relative to central point it is too short or
It is oversize, such as, 140 characters or 20 words.The length distance central point of sentence is more remote, degrades higher.Another factor can
Be measure source document interesting business (fun quotient) promotive factor.E.g., including it is included in the triggering phrase of white list
Or be included in white list triggering phrase synonym source document importing link it is more, the promotive factor is higher.
Another factor can be the inverse document frequency score of sentence.Unique true finger 115 can be determined in sentence
Inverse document frequency (IDF) score of each item, and the highest IDF scores using any in sentence can be selected as sentence
The IDF scores of son.How rare IDF Score Lists aspect is in the corpus of document, therefore, the frequency occurred in corpus compared with
Low item has the IDF scores than very common Xiang Genggao.The IDF scores of sentence can be that low IDF scores represent to degrade
Degradation factor.In some embodiments, interest-degree factor evaluation entity-sentence centering can be directed to by external evaluation person (people)
One or more.The factor is subjective for estimator and represents promotive factor, is made us so that giving
The interest-degree score that uninterested sentence is zero.When providing the factor, the factor can be included in the score of sentence
And the factor representation promotive factor.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can be with one or more in connector with calculating
Sentence score.For example, sentence score can be product for calculating each factor in the factor of score or the factor it
With.In some embodiments, one or more in the factor can have the weight applied, so that calculating sentence
The factor, which counts, during sub- score is more than another factor.The definite combination of the factor must be consistent between sentence, but implement
Mode includes the various combinations of the factor as outlined above.
In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can deposit sentence score with entity-sentence to together with
Storage.In some embodiments, unique true finger 115 can carry out Response to selection using the score and be wanted in the inquiry to entity
The sentence of display.By in some of Sentence Clustering embodiments, unique true finger 115 can be using the score come from every
Selection represents sentence and/or carries out ranking to cluster in individual major clusters.For example, it can select with highest sentence score
Representative sentence of the sentence as major clusters in major clusters.In some embodiments, can be in response to looking into entity
Ask, sentence is represented to show according to the sentence score order successively decreased.In some embodiments, can show according to random sequence
Show and represent sentence, but sentence score can be used for influenceing the probability used in randomization.In some embodiments, the system
One represented in sentence can be randomly chosen and represent sentence to be shown in response to inquiry.
Unique true finger 115 can also carry out ranking by computing cluster score to major clusters.Cluster score
It can be the combination of the sentence score of the sentence in major clusters and in cluster is supported.The combination can be sentence score
Sum, but can also be some other combinations, such as, average value or product.In some embodiments, can be according to group
The mode of conjunction to carry out weight reduction to the sentence score of the sentence in cluster is supported.In some embodiments, unique thing
Real finger 115 can exclude the content that is polymerization or repeating in cluster before computing cluster score.For example, unique thing
Real finger 115 can determine to appear in sentence before or after the relatively low sentence of score in cluster whether with cluster
Divide higher sentence matching, unique true finger 115 can exclude the sentence from the calculating of cluster score.Unique true lookup
Cluster can be assigned and is stored in by device 115, for example, in unique true thesaurus 153, and the cluster of each cluster can be stored
Score.In some embodiments, the score is determined for which sentence shown.For example, the system can use generation
The cluster score rather than sentence score of table sentence determine to show which sentence and/or display represent the order of sentence.

Configuration be example arrangement, and embodiment can include unshowned other configurations.
Fig. 2 illustrates to be shown in response to being returned to asking the inquiry of the entity of the fact according to some embodiments
The example of the user interface 200 for the uniqueness fact returned.Inquiry system (such as, Fig. 1 inquiry system 120) can be generated for ringing
Inquiries of the Ying Yu from client 170 and show the information of user interface 200.In the figure 2 example, user, which have submitted, looks into
Ask 205-" koala fun facts (the fact that koala is interesting) ".Query processor (such as, Fig. 1 query processor 126)
It can determine that inquiry 305 is relevant with the entity koala in knowledge base and also includes triggering phrase, for example, being included in white list
Trigger phrase.This can be query processor from for example, unique true thesaurus 153 obtains the entity koala uniqueness fact
Instruction.Because inquiry 205 includes triggering phrase, query processor can not directly search knowledge base, because knowledge base is big
It is include not being that unique or particularly interesting structuring is true more.Unique fact can be returned and be used as scrollable list
210.In the scrollable list 210, the instruction in the source that each fact can include the fact that.The instruction can be directed to source document
Link.In some embodiments, the fact that as described above, in scrollable list 120 is the representative sentence from cluster.
In some embodiments, unique fact is shown according to random sequence, and in some embodiments, is obtained according to by sentence
Divide or the order of cluster score determination is unique true to show.In addition to unique true scrollable list 210, using normal
Search technique is advised, search result can include the lists of documents 215 in response to inquiry.Scrollable list 210 can appear in phase
The position highlighted for lists of documents 215.
Fig. 3 is illustrated according to the true use of the uniqueness for showing to return in response to the inquiry to entity of some embodiments
The example at family interface 300.Inquiry system (such as, Fig. 1 inquiry system 120) can be generated in response to from client
170 inquiry and show the information of user interface 300.In the example of fig. 3, user have submitted inquiry " koala ".Inquiry
Processor (such as, Fig. 1 query processor 126) can determine that inquiry is relevant with the entity koala in knowledge base.This can be
Query processor from knowledge base obtain with koala entities about the fact instruction.In addition to from the fact that knowledge base, look into
Asking processor can also be from for example, unique true thesaurus 153 obtains the uniqueness fact 310 of entity (if existing for entity
Words).In some embodiments, unique fact 310 can be randomly choosed.In some embodiments, unique fact 310 can be with
It is the representative sentence from cluster.In some apply mode, whenever search result is provided for inquiry, there is different unique things
It is real.The order of appearance can be it is random, either can sentence score or collection based on the sentence for showing highest scoring first
Group's score.In some embodiments, unique fact 310 can be displayed as a thing in multiple facts of scrollable list
It is real, such as, Fig. 2 list 210.The instruction in the source that unique fact 310 can include the fact that.The instruction can be directed to source document
Link.
Fig. 4 is illustrated according to the true use of the uniqueness for showing to return in response to the inquiry to entity of some embodiments
The example at family interface 400.Inquiry system (such as, Fig. 1 inquiry system 120) can be generated in response to from client
170 inquiry and show the information of user interface 400.In the example of fig. 4, user is in the feelings of no any triggering phrase
Inquiry 405 is have submitted under condition --- " koala " is in the case of no any triggering phrase.(such as, Fig. 1 is looked into query processor
Ask processor 126) it can determine that inquiry is relevant with the entity koala in knowledge base.This can be that query processor alternatively obtains
Take the true instruction of the uniqueness relevant with koala.Fig. 4 interface includes the lists of documents 415 in response to inquiry with its median surface
Fig. 2 interface is similar, but interface 400 only includes a unique fact 410 rather than scrollable list.It can be randomly chosen
Unique fact 410, so that when receiving the inquiry to entity koala every time, 410 change for the fact that display.As an alternative, may be used
To show the fact that different 410 since the fact that highest scoring.In some embodiments, the fact that display can be to represent
It is true.
Fig. 5 illustrates to be used in response to inquiring about identification, selecting and providing unique fact according to some embodiments
The flow chart of instantiation procedure 500.Implementation procedure 500 can be come by system (such as, Fig. 1 search system 100).Although in order to just
In discussion, process 500 is described for single entity, but system 100 can be simultaneously for many entity implementation procedures 500
Part.
Process 500 can be since unique fact of extraction entity (505).As shown in figure 6 in more detail, system
It is true that the uniqueness of multiple entities can once be extracted, because the true document for including referring to any entity of extraction is analyzed.
Each unique fact can be expressed as entity-sentence pair, wherein, extract sentence from the document for being identified as unique true source
Son.System then can be by the true cluster (510) of the uniqueness of entity.Cluster can be configured to be grouped sentence, so as to
So that the sentence for illustrating the identical thing relevant with entity is placed in same cluster.Fig. 7 illustrates a kind of sample cluster method.
System can also be to unique true progress ranking (515).Unique true ranking that carries out can be included：To each unique fact
(for example, each entity-sentence to) assigns sentence score also, if sentence is clustered, then the cluster for calculating each cluster obtains
Point.It is described in further detail for Fig. 8 to unique true progress ranking.The inquiry that system may also respond to entity provides one
It is individual or multiple unique true (520).For example, by including triggering phrase (for example, being stored in being included in Fig. 1 triggering 150
The triggering phrase of white list), inquiry can represent the true inquiry interested of uniqueness to entity.Such triggering phrase bag
Include：" fun facts (the fact that interesting) ", " did you know (do you know) ", " (your you might not know can
Can not know) ", " oddities (odd habit) " etc..Inquiry can also only identify entity.In some embodiments, in response to looking into
The quantity for the uniqueness fact ask and provided can depend on whether inquiry includes triggering phrase.
In process 500, step 505 to step 515 can periodically occur (for example, every night, every two weeks, weekly, often
Month etc.), as batch processing or processed offline.The entity that step 505 can use to step 515 generation in response to inquiry-
Sentence pair, for example, the part as step 520.Therefore, step 520 can still exist independently of step 505 to step 515
Perform at least one generation afterwards in step 505 to step 515.
Fig. 6 illustrates the flow according to the true instantiation procedure 600 of the uniqueness for being used to identify entity of some embodiments
Figure.A part of the implementation procedure 600 as Fig. 5 step 505 can be come by system (such as, Fig. 1 search system 100).Cross
Journey 600 identifies and checked unique true source document from corpus, and the reality to be recognized in unique true source document
Subset generation entity-sentence pair of body.Therefore, process 600 can be that multiple entities generate entity-sentence pair.Process 600 can be with
Low quality document is filtered out since repositories of documents (605).In some embodiments, document repositories are to interconnect
The document obtained on the net.Repositories of documents can include：Webpage, PDF document, the text of electrical form or word processing form
Shelves, image (can associated or image can be performed and recognized to identify in image with the text from image tag by image
Text in itself) etc..System can use various standards when identifying low quality document.In some embodiments, standard
The document ranking unrelated with inquiry, such as, page rank (PageRank) score can be included.Page Rank scores reflection has more
Few other document links can include other factors to the document.Low Page Rank scores can be low quality document
Instruction.Standard can also include classification.For example, the document for being classified as Pornograph can be considered as low quality document by system.
It is also possible to think that it is low-quality to be classified as blog or the document of forum.Blog and forum may be included than the fact more
More opinions, and it is less likely that there is the fact that reliable.System can also will be classified as polymerization or plagiarization document
It is considered as low quality.The content and other documents for being classified as polymerization or plagiarization document repeat.For example, website can be come
From the set of the news report of news agency.Such document can be considered as by system lacks original contents and therefore, is low
Quality.By system using identifying that another standard of low quality document can be blacklist.For example, can be by document or domain
Added to list, and any document (for example, especially identification ground or match with domain) in lists be considered as it is low
Quality.Can list as manual plan exhibition.System can ignore low-quality document, so that never treating them as
Unique true source.
System can select the document (the document be not low quality document) (610) associated with unique true triggering.Solely
Special true triggering can be instruction uniqueness or uncommon true phrase.For example, phrase " did you can be passed through
Know (do you know) " introduces the fact that interesting, so, " did you know (do you know) " can be triggering
Phrase.Other such triggering phrases include：" fun facts (the fact that interesting) ", " interesting facts (make us feeling
The fact that interest) " etc..The document associated with such triggering phrase is considered unique true source.The system can be with
Consider the document associated with triggering phrase in various manners.For example, in some embodiments, the document can be by
Pointed by link from other documents including triggering phrase.For example, if the first document, which has, points to the second document
Link and the link is associated with text " interesting fact relevant with koala " (for example, via anchor tag text or introducing
The sentence of link), then by the second document, associated and the second document is considered as unique true source with triggering phrase.With sensing
The associated text of the link of document be considered as than document in itself in text it is more reliable, but in some embodiments,
Text can come from document in itself.As another example, if document appears in the search result of the inquiry including triggering phrase
In, then it is document is associated with triggering.Inquiry and its search result can be stored in, for example, in anonymous search record.Cause
This, if pointing to document (for example, via inquire about or pass through link) including the text for triggering phrase, system can be by document
It is considered as unique true source.
In some embodiments, these triggering phrases can be included in the triggering phrase of white list and trigger phrase can
With including the triggering phrase to pipe off.For example, " interesting facts (the fact that interesting) " can be included in white name
Single triggering phrase and " lies (lie) " or " myths (mythology) " can be the triggering phrase to pipe off.At this
In the embodiment of sample, when the text including any triggering phrase for being included in white list points to document rather than including being included in black name
When any text of single triggering phrase points to document, document only can be considered as unique true source by system.Thus, for example, such as
Fruit particular document is associated with the inquiry of " koala fun facts (the fact that koala is interesting) ", but also with text
The link of " koala myths (koala is mythical) " is associated, then particular document can not be considered as unique true source by system.It is included in
The triggering phrase of white list and the triggering phrase to pipe off can be that manual plan is opened up.
The system can be from the core extraction sentence (615) of the document as unique true source.Core includes
The main contents of document, but not including that the part of annotation, advertisement, menu, sidebar etc..For being identified in core
The each sentence arrived, system can identify one or more entity (620) referred in sentence.These entities are to be present in
Therefore there is in knowledge base and the entity of the identifier from knowledge base.The system can be used known or found later
Entity refer to technology to identify entity.Using such technology, system can identify the pronoun used in sentence and name
Entity in word or noun phrase.In addition, system, which can be directed to specific term, identifies more than one entity.For example, in sentence
In son " cat urine glows under black light (cat urine lights under black light) ", it can recognize in sentence
Entity cat and animal and entity urine.
In some embodiments, system can be used based on document topicality score and/or semantic importance score
Topicality score is filtered (625) to the entity referred to.Document topicality score is the document that entity occurs with sentence
Function, and presentation-entity has much meanings to document on the whole.For example, if the source document of the sentence relevant with cat urine is
On cat, then entity cat will be relatively low by the document topicality score with high document topicality score and urine.However,
If document is on urine, urine entities are by with higher document topicality score.The system can also use semanteme
Importance score filters to entity, topicality of the semantic importance score presentation-entity to sentence.For example, source document
Can be relevant with cat, but sentence can compare the uniqueness fact relevant with dog with cat, for example, " a dog ' s
(smell of dog has a sharp sense of smell 100 to sense of smell is 100x more sensitive than a cat ' s than cat
Times) ".For the sentence, entity dog semantic importance score may be higher, but document topicality score may be relatively low.Can
To determine that the topicality of entity-sentence pair obtains based on document topicality score, semantic importance score or these combination
Point.In some embodiments, if document topicality score or semantic importance score meet threshold value, system can be true
Determine topicality score and meet threshold value.System can filter out the sentence with the topicality score that can not meet topicality threshold value
Any entity.Topicality threshold value can be type variable and depending on entity.For example, it is classified into the entity of classification
(for example, animal, country etc.) may must be fulfilled for the topicality threshold value higher than other entities.As another example, system can be with
Including the topicality table for the topicality threshold value for storing special entity.For example, it is .80's that topicality table, which can have topicality threshold value,
Entity animal entry and thing threshold value is 0.85 entity country another entry.In such embodiment, such as
Fruit is unidentified in topicality table to arrive entity, then system can use acquiescence topicality threshold value (for example .60).Therefore, topicality
Threshold value can be variable and depend on entity.Topicality score such as sporocarp is unsatisfactory for the topicality threshold value of the entity,
Then system can ignore the entity, i.e. not match itself and sentence.
Each sentence for extraction and each entity for being recognized in the sentence not being filtered (for example,
Due to failing to reach topicality threshold value), system can save as entity and sentence entity-sentence to (630).In some implementations
In mode, system can preserve other information with entity-sentence to together with, for example, the topicality score of entity and therefrom carrying
Take out the identifier of the source document of sentence.Other information can also be stored to together with sentence-entity.
System can continue with the document (635, yes) in thesaurus, to the true source document repeat step of other uniquenesses
610 to step 630, until having been processed by document (635, no).Then, process 600 terminates.By having identified that for entity
Unique fact is expressed as entity-sentence pair.In some embodiments, these pairings can be provided in response to search inquiry.
In some embodiments, system can perform additional treatments to cluster, and/or carry out ranking to pairing.
Fig. 7 illustrates to be used for the example mistake of the true Sentence Clustering of the uniqueness of presentation-entity according to some embodiments
The flow chart of journey 700.700 step 510 as Fig. 5 of implementation procedure can be come by system (such as, Fig. 1 search system 100)
A part.Process 700 is by Sentence Clustering, it is therefore an objective to will express identical true sentence in different ways and is grouped in one
Rise.Such cluster enables a system to avoid or minimized the uniqueness fact that display repeats and is capable of the optimal of select facts
Expression.However, in some embodiments, cluster is optional.Process 700 is discussed for single entity, but system can be with
To each entity implementation procedure 700 by entity-sentence to expression.
Process 700 can be since the bad sentence (705) of entity-sentence centering identification entity of entity.Bad sentence expression
Need context just meaningful sentence and the incorrect sentence of grammer.If the grammer of sentence is undesirable, system
May be by entity-sentence to being denoted as " bad ".Equally, if sentence needs outside context, system may be by entity-sentence pair
It is denoted as " bad ".It can be indicated using the field or sign that are stored with sentence-entity to together with.It is denoted as " bad "
Sentence can be used for supporting the fact that similar, but when selecting optimum expression, not take into account that the sentence.It is considered that including short
The sentence of language (such as, " later (later) " or " then (then) " in the first clause) needs outside context.
It is also possible to think the outside context of the sentence needs for including undecomposed pronoun.When the noun of pronominal reference includes
When in sentence, pronoun is decomposed in sentence, and therefore, there is no need to outside context.For example, sentence " The
Koala gave the kangaroo his banana (koala has given his banana to kangaroo) " include the pronoun decomposed
His, the noun koala that the pronominal reference is returned in sentence.The system not will be considered that such pronoun is undecomposed.In some realities
Apply in mode, the sentence (that is, the entity of entity-sentence centering) of unique pronominal reference entity can not also be considered as and do not divided by system
Solution.When in response to sentence as the query display to entity, such sentence need not outside context.
Similarly, it is believed that the sentence of the noun including being referred to by the other places of proper noun in a document needs outer
Portion's context.For example, " (Tom's hanks are in film by Tom Hanks played the lead in the movie for sentence
Play a leading role) " do not include pronoun, but when noun " movie (film) " is individually presented, noun " movie (film) " is not
Clearly.However, sentence " Sully opened last weekend and Tom Hanks played the lead in
The movie (Sully was shown last week, and Tom's hanks are played a leading role in film) " need not outside context, this be because
It is included in for " movie (film) " signified proper noun in sentence.Similarly, if by proper noun in a document other
The noun that place refers to is the topic entity of sentence (for example, " The movie set box-office records its
Opening weekend (box office receipts record it and shown at weekend) "), then sentence does not need outside context, because, when
When showing sentence in response to the inquiry (for example, Star Wars) to subject entity, it is not necessary to outside context.
In some embodiments, system can will be with such as " however (but) ", " also (going back) " or " in
The sentence that the phrases such as addition (in addition) " start is considered as need not outside context.In some embodiments, system can be from
Such phrase that can be as the prefix of the parenthesis in sentence or as parenthesis appearance is removed in sentence, and is not recognized
Outside context is needed for sentence.In such embodiment, sentence is not denoted as bad.In some embodiments, can be with
Sentence is identified as it is bad, as identification sentence in entity a part, for example, a part for the step 620 as Fig. 6.
System can also eliminate and the true sentence (710) matched of the structuring in knowledge base.Can be by such sentence
Remove completely from entity-sentence centering, rather than be only masked as " bad ".The sentence of true pattern match with structuring
By medelling and therefore unique fact is not indicated that, due to the fact that being common to some different entities.Pattern can
To be regular expressions, such as, " X is friends with (X be ... friend) " and " X was born on (X is born in) "
Or " X lives in/on (X is lived in) ".The fact that can be with knowledge based storehouse manual plan exhibition automatically generates mould
Formula.Sentence with a kind of pattern match in pattern can be filtered out so that the sentence be not used in clustered or
Ranking.In some embodiments, such pairing can be eliminated, as a part for the entity in identification sentence, for example, making
For a part for Fig. 6 step 620.
System can determine the set (715) for highlighting item of each sentence.Highlighting item does not include：Stop words is (such as,
" the ", " a ", " of ", verb form " to be " etc.) and refer to entity (for example, entity of entity-sentence pair) item.Will
Refer to except being included in by entity-sentence to the item of the entity in addition to the entity of expression in the set for highlighting item.System can be
The set generation for highlighting item highlights the lemma of item.The lemma represents the single version of the different modifications of item.For example, can be by plural number
Item changes into singulative, so that singulative is stored in the set for highlighting item.Same way, it is also possible to the word by verb
Deformation is converted to base form change, so that " revolves " and " revolved " is changed into the set for highlight item
“revolve”。
Then system can generate cluster (720) using item is highlighted.In some embodiments, system can generate master
Want cluster and support cluster.Major clusters can include the sentence with the equivalent set for highlighting item.Therefore, if highlighting item
Each item in set T has equivalent item in the second set S for highlight item, then highlights item set T and highlight the second collection of item
Close S to be equal, vice versa.When highlight an A with it is another highlight a B it is identical when, highlight an A and be equal with another B that highlights, highlight item
A is the synonym for highlighting a B, or highlights an A and highlight a B both numerical value.As referred in some embodiments above
Show, numerical value must be below a certain maximum.Cluster is supported to support major clusters.When the set for highlighting item of sentence is
During the subset of the set for highlighting item of major clusters, system can be put into sentence in the support cluster of major clusters.Sentence can
To appear in many support clusters, but may only appear in a major clusters.Not by the sentence in cluster is supported
It is considered as the optimum expression of the fact.The example that cluster is generation cluster is generated using item is highlighted as described above,
And embodiment can use other methods.Once by entity-sentence to being assigned to cluster, can be stored together with the pairing
Cluster Identifier (or multiple identifiers).Then, process 700 terminates.
Fig. 8 illustrates true according to the uniqueness for being used to score to sentence and selecting entity of some embodiments
The flow chart of the process 800 of optimum expression.The conduct of implementation procedure 800 can be come by system (such as, Fig. 1 search system 100)
A part for Fig. 5 step 515.Process 800 assigns score to each sentence of entity-sentence centering, it is therefore an objective to identifies entity
Obtain the fact that most interested either unique or interesting.In some embodiments, system can also be entered to cluster
Row scoring, and select by the optimum expression of the fact that collection group representation.Process 800 is discussed for single entity, but system
Can be to each entity implementation procedure 800 by entity-sentence to expression.
Process 800 can be started by calculating the sentence score of each sentence in entity-sentence pair of entity
(805).Sentence score can be the combination of the factor.One in the factor can be the topicality score of pairing, for example, being used as figure
A part for 6 process 600.In some embodiments, topicality score can be multiplied by the unrelated with inquiry of source document
Ranking, for example, therefrom extracting the page rank of the document of sentence.When source document is considered as into high quality document, this can be improved
The topicality score of entity-sentence pair.As discussed in figure 6, topicality score can be document topicality score, semantic weight
The combination of the property wanted score or these scores or other similar scores.Another factor can be length factor.Length factor

Table and be intended to exclude there is the fact that duplicate contents.For the ease of discussing, process 900 is discussed for single entity, still
System can be to each entity implementation procedure 900 by entity-sentence to expression.
Process 900 can be started (905) by the set for each unique term for representing sentence for determining to represent in sentence.
It could have been selected and represent sentence, for example, the part as process 800, or such as can be described above for step 810
As select to represent sentence.Unique term is the item of the inverse document frequency with higher than specified threshold.The threshold value ensures to be used for
The unique true item of identification is uncommon item.
System can start to select to represent sentence according to the reverse order of cluster score, so that selection comes from first
The representative sentence (910) of cluster with highest cluster score.Then, system can determine to represent sentence whether have with from
Any unique term (915) of the unique term matching of the representative sentence previously selected.For example, system can be by the unique term of sentence
(being recognized in step 905) is compared with the unique term of any sentence in unique true list of the entity.
If matching (915, no) with the unique term of sentence in lists without unique term, then this can be represented sentence by system
Added to list (920).If there is the sentence matched with the unique term of sentence in lists unique term (915,
Be) or by sentence be added to list after, system can be moved to next highest cluster score cluster (925,
It is) and to the representative sentence repeat step 910 in the cluster to step 925.The circulation continues, until having been processed by this
All clusters (925, no) of entity.System then can be with unique true list (930) of storage entity.Can be in response to such as

In knowledge base.Then, system can determine whether entity has any unique true (1010).In some embodiments
In, the fact that unique fact can be in unique true list.The fact is opened up by system plan to eliminate repetition and be in
Now each true optimal expression.In some embodiments, system can use entity-sentence pair.As sporocarp does not have
Entity-sentence is to (1010, no), then process 1000 terminates, and system can provide the search result from other sources.
As sporocarp has really, uniqueness is true (1010, yes), then in some embodiments, system can be by unique thing
Real order random-ising (1015).This can be optional, because in some embodiments, system can be according to the suitable of ranking
Sequence is presented true (for example, such as storage order in lists or according to sentence score).System can also determine that inquiry is
It is no to trigger (1020) including unique fact.Unique true triggering can be for selecting in phrase of the document as unique true source
One.Unique true triggering can also be selected from the single set of triggering phrase.Therefore, for selecting unique true source
Phrase can be different from asking the phrase of the inquiry of unique true or interesting fact for identifying.In some embodiments
In, these phrases can be the phrase in the white list of triggering phrase.If the certain triggering including as of inquiry (1020,
It is), then system can initiate multiple unique true presentations (1025) to entity in response to inquiry.For example, system can be in
A part of the whole true list of uniqueness now generated as process 900.In some embodiments, system can be initiated to present
The subset of unique true list.In some embodiments, system can initiate have highest sentence score to a number of
Entity-sentence pair presentation, although carrying out select facts not via certain type of plan exhibition (cluster and ranking) has display weight
Multiple true risk.If inquiry do not include it is unique true trigger (1020, no), then system can select one it is unique it is true with
It is included in search result (1030).The fact can be randomly chosen, or can be selected in sequence, for example, according to
They appear in the order in unique true list, or order according to sentence score etc..Therefore, whenever user is submitted to not
During the inquiry of the entity with triggering, system can show that different uniquenesses is true.Then, process 1000 terminates.
