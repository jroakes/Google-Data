- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .

- a prediction engine 120 can make predictions about user traffic for arbitrary time periods based on known traffic data for at least two time periods having different lengths. For example, as described in detail below, the prediction engine 120 can predict the number of entities (e.g., users, groups of users, etc.) who are likely to (or likely did) perform some user interaction, such as visiting a web site or clicking on a content item, to name two examples. For example, based on user traffic information that is known for seven-day and 28-day time periods, predictions can be made for future time periods less than seven days (e.g., three days), more than 28 days, or for time periods between seven and 28 days.
- entities e.g., users, groups of users, etc.
- predictions can be made for future time periods less than seven days (e.g., three days), more than 28 days, or for time periods between seven and 28 days.

- personal information e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- opt out features related to social networking systems for example, can allow the user to specify that the user's activity stream content is not to be used in ads, or to anonymize the information in some way.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example graph 200 for predicting data points.

- the graph 200 (or data associated with the graph 200 ) can be presented to a user (e.g., in a user interface) who can provide user input that is used to prompt the prediction engine 120 to predict data points for a location.
- user input can be provided by manipulating the graph 200 , such as by sliding points up and down or left and right.
- the user interface can accept user input or selection (e.g., on a graph) of a time period, e.g., by selection of a slider control or other control on the graph 200 , or by user input of a time period.
- application code e.g., the prediction engine 120
- the user interface can predict (e.g., using prediction functions described in this document) unique entities for that time period, and the information can be displayed using the graph and/or in a different way.
- the user can provide, using the user interface, a number of unique entities for a location, and the user interface can display a corresponding time period that is determined using the prediction functions.
- Example locations include sites (e.g., web sites), resources 105 (e.g., web pages), or any other online location accessible to the user over the network 102 .
- Example unique entities include unique users, unique households, unique cookies, unique browsers, unique email addresses, unique IP addresses, and so on.
- unique entities can reflect demographic information (e.g., that has been anonymized) including, for example, unique incomes, unique residents (e.g., users or residents of cities, states, or some other named or unnamed geographic area), unique employees (e.g., employee visitors to employers intranet sites), unique hair colors, unique shoe sizes, and so on.
- Determining unique entities that have interacted with a location can be done in various ways, e.g., by using cookies to track a user (e.g., anonymized in some way) or by using the IP address associated with a user device 106 .
- identification of a user can be based on user-supplied information, such as resulting from the user registering on a web site and providing a name and/or other personal information.
- curve-fitting does not require the generation of an actual graph.
- a prediction function can be applied that provides for an approximation of data points.
- other prediction methods are possible, such as regression functions or any other functions that can be used to approximate or predict values.
- more than two time periods can be used to generate prediction functions.
- other data points 212 a and 212 b on the graph 200 can be predicted for either an arbitrary amount of time or an arbitrary number of unique entities.
- the predictions can include predicting a corresponding amount of time or a number of unique entities given the other value.
- a value on the entity axis 204 can be predicted from a value on the time axis 202 , or vice versa.

- the amount of time 208 a e.g., a seven-day period.
- the prediction of entity traffic 216 a is based on data points 206 a and 206 b for longer seven-day and 28-day time periods, respectively.
- the data point 212 b for example, on the line 207 that is directly above an amount of time 214 b can be used to predict entity traffic 216 b , as shown by arrows 217 b .
- the amount of time 216 b e.g., 31 days
- the amount of time 208 b e.g., a 28-day period
- the entity traffic 216 b is a predicted amount of entity traffic for a 31-day period.
- the prediction is based on the same data points 206 a and 206 b for seven-day and 28-day time periods, respectively.
- the same technique can be used to predict other values, including values represented by data points between data points 206 a and 206 b.
- the graph 200 can represent a process (similar to the previously described examples) for using a function to predict traffic data as follows. First data is received that is indicative of first traffic data for a mediaplan during a first time span. Second data is received that is indicative of second traffic data for the mediaplan during a second time span. The first and second traffic data represent numbers of unique entities that have interacted with a location during, respectively, the first and second time spans. A function is derived from the received first and second data and one of an arbitrary number of unique entities or an arbitrary third time span to predict third traffic data representing a number of unique entities interacting with the location during the third time span.
- the function that is used can depend on the length of the arbitrary third time span. For example, when the arbitrary third time span does not exceed the first and second time spans, the function uses an exponential that includes a difference of dot products using natural logs of combinations of the first, second and arbitrary third time spans and the first and second traffic data, divided by a difference of natural logs of the first and second time spans. Otherwise, the function uses a difference of dot products using combinations of the first, second and arbitrary third time spans and the first and second traffic data, divided by a difference of the first and second time spans.
- the first and second data can represent measured or estimated points on a graph of time versus unique entities that have interacted with a location, where the graph includes axes in a logarithmic scale, as described above.
- the graph can be presented in a user interface in which a user input of a value corresponding to one of the axes is used to predict a value corresponding to the other one of the axes.
- the first data can be estimated data. In some implementations, the first data can be measured data.
- the method can further comprise using the function to estimate a number of unique entities that have interacted with the location for a past arbitrary time period. In some implementations, the method can further comprise using function to predict a number of unique entities that will interact with the location in a future arbitrary time period. In some implementations, the method can further comprise using the function to estimate a time period in which an arbitrary number of unique entities interacted with the location.
- the unique entities can be selected from the group comprising unique users, unique households, unique cookies, unique browsers, unique email addresses, and unique IP addresses.
- the unique entities that have interacted can be determined by cookies. In some implementations, the unique entities that have interacted can be determined by IP addresses. In some implementations, the unique entities can be users that have performed an action at or in association with the location.
- the third data can include predicting an amount of time required to accumulate a predetermined number of unique entities. In some implementations, predicting the third data can include predicting a number of unique entities given a predetermined amount of time.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for predicting traffic data for a mediaplan.
- the process 300 can be performed, for example, by the prediction engine 120 .
- FIGS. 1 and 2 are used to provide examples for steps of the process 300 .
- First traffic data is determined for a mediaplan during a first time span ( 302 ).
- the first traffic data that is determined can include the amount of time 208 a (e.g., seven days) and the number of entities 210 a that have interacted with a location during the amount of time 208 a.
- identifying the first and second traffic data can include retrieving the first and second traffic data from the traffic data 124 .
- the prediction engine 120 can obtain the first and second traffic data in other ways, e.g., as user-supplied inputs to the prediction engine 120 .
- An arbitrary time span is identified over which it is desired to determine predicted traffic data ( 306 ).
- an advertiser who is creating or updating an advertising campaign may want to predict entity traffic (e.g., user visits to a particular web site) for a particular arbitrary time period (e.g., the amount of time 214 a , or three days).
- the advertiser may want to predict entity traffic 216 a based on the amount of time 214 a (e.g., three days).
- the values 214 a and 216 a are represented by the data point 212 a , and the location of the data point 212 a on the line 207 is what can be used to predict entity traffic 216 a.
- a line through the two points is determined ( 310 ). For example, the line 207 that intersects both data points 206 a and 206 b is determined.
- a point of intersection that corresponds to the arbitrary time span is located on the line, where a value of unique entities at the point of intersection corresponds to the predicted traffic over the arbitrary time span ( 312 ).
- the data point 212 a is the point of intersection on the line 207 that is directly above (and corresponds to) the amount of time 214 a .
- the data point 212 a predicts the entity traffic 216 a that represents unique entities (e.g., users, audience members, etc.) for the amount of time 214 a (e.g., three days).
- the point of intersection can be determined by the prediction engine 120 , e.g., using formulas from the prediction models 126 , as will described in detail below.
- the process 300 can be used to identify first traffic data from second traffic data, or second traffic data from first traffic data, e.g., depending on the prediction needs of the requestor (e.g., advertiser). For example, once the line 207 is determined, the amount of time 214 c can be predicted (or estimated) based on entity traffic 216 c . This is in addition to determining entity traffic (e.g., entity traffic 216 b ) based on an amount of time (e.g., amount of time 214 b ), as described in the previous example.
- entity traffic e.g., entity traffic 216 b
- an amount of time e.g., amount of time 214 b
- an arbitrary entity traffic amount (e.g., entity traffic 216 c ) can be identified ( 324 ). Then, formulas (1) or (2) or similar formulas can be used to predict corresponding time spans (e.g., the amount of time 214 c ) based on the arbitrary entity traffic (e.g., entity traffic 216 c ).
- a request is received from a user device.
- the request is to predict traffic data for a mediaplan.
- the traffic data is predicted using two measured or estimated data points for unique entities that have interacted with a location (e.g., a resource or a site) including traffic data that corresponds to two different time periods.
- the two different time periods are substantially different in length.
- the predicted traffic data is provided to the user device for display in a user interface.
- the two different time periods are one week and one month, respectively.
- the unique entities that have interacted with the location are determined by cookies.
- the unique entities that have interacted with the location are determined by IP addresses.
- the unique entities are users that have performed an action at, or in association with, the location.
