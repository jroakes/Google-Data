- the technology includes systems and methods for sharing inline media commentary with members or users of a network (e.g., a social network or any network (single or integrated) configured to facilitate viewing of media).
- a user may add commentary (e.g., text, audio, video, link, etc.) to live or recorded media (e.g., video, audio, text, etc.).
- the commentary may then be shared with members of an online community, for example, a social network, for consumption.
- the commentary application may be built into or configured within a media player, or configured to be external to the media player.
- a user A may watch a motion picture (“movie”), add commentary to it, at specific points to label a particularly interesting portion or entity in the movie and may share it with user B.
- a notification about the commentary by user A is generated and provided to user B (e.g., a friend or associate of user A).
- User B may view the commentary on a network (by which user B is connected to user A, for example, a social network).
- the commentary may include a “clip” featuring the particularly interesting portion or entity in the movie.
- An entity in video-based media may be a specific actor, a subject, an object, a location, audio content, a scene in the media.
- An entity in audio-based media may be audio content and a scene.
- An entity in text-based media may be a portion of certain text.
- User B may concur with User A and decide to watch the movie at a later time when he or she is free. While watching the movie, User B may view user A's commentary, and may respond with his or her own thoughts or comments. This technology simulates an experience for users who may watch a movie with others, even if at a different time and place.
- the system may consist of a large collection of media (e.g., recorded media) that can be consumed by users.
- Users may embed, add, attach, or link commentary or provide labels at chosen points of play, positions or objects within a piece or item of media, for example, indicating a person (e.g., who may be either static or moving or indicated in three-dimensional form).
- the positions or objects may be any physical entities that are static or moving in time.
- a particular user may want to comment on an actor's wardrobe in each scene in a movie.
- the user may then select members of a social network with whom to share the specific comments (e.g., friends or acquaintances). Notifications may be generated and transmitted for display on a computing or communication device used by users.
- notifications may be processed in several ways.
- notifications may be received from users when they post commentary.
- notifications may be received when the commentary is added.
- notifications may be provided via software mechanisms including by email, by instant messaging, by social network operating software, by operating software for display of a notification on a user's home screen on the computing or communication device.
- the user may also select the method of notification (e.g., by email directly to friends, by broadcast to friends' social network stream, or simply by tagging in the media).
- users may have the option to be notified when they reach particular embedded commentary and choose to view the commentary.
- users may also “opt” to receive immediate notifications of new commentary by email or instant messaging and be able to immediately view the commentary along with the corresponding media segment.
- a user may respond to existing commentary.
- the system may then become a framework for discussions among friends about specific media. This system may also be a means for amateur and professional media reviewers to easily comment on specifics in media and to provide “a study guide” for other consumers.
- the system allows users to respond to commentary. For example, a user posts commentary that states that he sees a ghost in the video and another user responds that the ghost is just someone in a bed sheet. Also, the system may send a notification to users (e.g., via email, instant messaging, social stream, video tag, etc.) when commentary is posted to the media.
- the commentary may be written comments, but may also take other forms such as visual media (e.g., photos and video), URLs, URLs to media clips, clips from media (e.g., links to start and endpoints), a graphic overlay on top of the (visual) media, a modified version of the media, or an overdubbing of the media audio such as a substitution of dialogue.
- visual media e.g., photos and video
- URLs e.g., photos and video
- URLs to media clips e.g., links to start and endpoints
- clips from media e.g., links to start and endpoints
- a graphic overlay on top of the (visual) media e.g., links to start and endpoints
- an overdubbing of the media audio such as a substitution of dialogue.
- Media commentary may include a comment or label that may be attached “inline” to the media.
- a video comment may be included for a particular number of frames or while the video is paused.
- a comment can be a text comment that may be included in the media.
- a user creates a text that states “This is my favorite part” and may be displayed on a video during a specific scene.
- a comment may be an image that may be included in a video, or text.
- a user may notice (in a video or a magazine article) that an actor has undergone plastic surgery and may embed pre-surgery photos of this actor.
- a user may “paste” his face over an actor in a video.
- a comment can be an audio clip that may be included in the media.
- a comment can be a video clip that may be included in the media.
- a user may embed a homemade video parody of a particular scene.
- a comment can be a web link that may be included in the media.
- a user may embed a web link to an online service, selling merchandise related to the current media. All such commentary may be static, attached to an actor as they move in a scene or multiple scenes, or attached to a particular statement, a set of statements, or a song, using metadata extracted by face or speech recognition.
- the metadata may be created by manual or automatic operations including face recognition, speech recognition, audio recognition, optical character recognition, computer vision, image processing, video processing, natural language understanding, and machine learning.
- the commentary interface may be built into the media viewer.
- a user may initiate commentary by executing a pause to the media and selecting a virtual button. The user may then add information (e.g., title, body, attachments, etc.) to the commentary. The user may then determine a period of time the commentary persists in the media (e.g., the length of a scene).
- a user may compose audio and visual commentary using recording devices and edit applications that merge their commentary with the media. The user finally selects the audience of the comment and broadcasts it. Upon finalizing the commentary, the user may view the media with the commentary.
- the commentary interface may be external to the media viewer.
- This interface may be designed for “heavy” users who may wish to comment widely about their knowledge of various media sources.
- the user selects the media and jumps to the point of play that is of interest.
- the interface may be the same as the previous interface once the point of play is reached.
- the commentary is added, the interface would return to an interface for selecting media.
- a user may select media from a directory combined with a search box.
- the interface component for jumping to the point of play of interest may take many forms.
- the interface may be a standard DVD (digital video disc) scene gallery that would allow the user to jump to a set of pre-defined scenes in the movie and then search linearly to a point of play of the selected scenes.
- the user may search for scenes that combine various actors and/or dialog. Such a search would use metadata extracted by face recognition and/or speech recognition. This metadata would only have to be extracted once and attached to the media thereafter.
- the system may present the commentary to consumers in a number of ways. For example, if the media is a video, the commentary may be displayed while the original video continues to play, particularly, if the commentary is some modification of the video, for example audio/visual modification of the video.
- the original video may also be paused and the commentary may be displayed in place of the original content or side by side with it.
- the commentary may also be displayed on an external device, for example, a tablet, mobile phone, or a remote control.

Abstract
The present disclosure includes systems and methods for creating and sharing inline commentary relating to media within an online community, for example, a social network. The inline commentary can be one or more types of media, for example, text, audio, image, video, URL link, etc. In some implementations, the systems and methods either receive media that is live or pre-recorded, permit viewing by users and receive selective added commentary by users inline. The systems and methods are configured to send one or more notifications regarding the commentary. In some implementations, the systems and methods are configured to receive responses by other users to the initial commentary provided by a particular user.
Description
- The present disclosure relates to technology for creating and sharing inline media commentary between users of online communities or services, for example, social networks.
- The popularity of commenting on online media has grown dramatically over the recent years. Users may add personal or shared media to an online server for consumption by an online community. Currently, users comment on media via text, which is separate from the media and flows along a distinct channel. It is difficult to add various types of commentary media to online media inline and share this commentary with other users, especially select users consuming the media that are connected in a network.
- In one innovative aspect, the present disclosure of the technology includes a system comprising: a processor and a memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to: receive media for viewing by a plurality of users of a network, wherein the media includes at least one of live media and pre-recorded media; receive commentary added by one or more of the plurality of users to the media, at a point, wherein the point is at least one of a group of 1) a selected play-point within the media, 2) a portion within the media, and 3) an object within the media; store the media and the commentary; selectively share the commentary with one or more users within the network who are selected by a particular user; enable viewing of the commentary by the one or the more users with whom the commentary is shared; and receive a comment on the commentary including at least one of a group of 1) text, 2) a photograph, 3) video, 4) audio, 5) a link to other content, and 6) insertion of text and modification to any visual-based, audio-based, and text-based component of the media.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the present disclosure includes a method, using one or more computing devices for: receiving media for viewing by a plurality of users of a network wherein the media includes at least one of live media and pre-recorded media; receiving commentary added by one or more users to the media at a point, wherein the point includes at least one of a group of 1) a selected play-point within the media, 2) a portion of the media, and 3) an object within the media; storing the media and the commentary; selectively sharing the commentary with one or more users within the network who are selected by a particular user; enable viewing of the commentary by the one or the more users with whom the commentary is shared; and receiving at least one comment on the commentary including at least one of a group of 1) text, 2) a photograph, 3) video, 4) audio, 5) a link to other content, and 6) insertion of text and modification to any visual-based, audio-based, and text-based component of the media.
- Other implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the action of the methods, encoded, on computer storage devices.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features in the system, including instructions stored in the memory that cause the system to further: i) process notifications to select users of the network, on the commentary added to the media, wherein the notifications are processed in at least one of the following ways: receive from users of the network when the users post commentary; send the notifications when the commentary is added; provide the notifications for display on a plurality of computing and communication devices; and provide the notifications via a software mechanism including at least one of a group of email, instant messaging, social network software, software for display on a home screen of a computing or communication device; ii) link commentary to particular entities specified by metadata within the media, wherein the media is at least one of video, audio, and text, and an entity in the video includes at least one of a group of 1) a specific actor, 2) a subject, 3) an object, 4) a location, 5) audio content, and 6) a scene in the media, and an entity in the audio including audio content and a scene, and an entity in the text including a portion of the text; iii) wherein the metadata is created by at least one of manual and automatic operations, and the automatic operations include at least one of 1) face recognition, 2) speech recognition, 3) audio recognition, 4) optical character recognition, 5) computer vision, 6) image processing, 7) video processing, 8) natural language understanding, and 9) machine learning; iv) wherein the media is at least one of video, audio, or text; v) select and share portions of the media with the commentary with the one or more users within the network who are selected by a particular user; vi) indicate restrictions on sharing specific portions of the media; indicate restrictions on at least one of 1) a length, 2) extent, and 3) duration of the media designated for sharing; indicate restrictions on viewing of a total amount of portions of the media by the one or more users after it is selected for sharing by the particular user; maintain a record of user consumption history on shared media; vii) restrict an amount of media for free consumption by a user that is selected for sharing by the particular user; and viii) restrict an amount of media for consumption by a specific user that is selected for sharing by the particular user; ix) enable viewing of the media by a particular user with other select users in the network; and x) enable the users of the network to provide rating relating to the commentary added to the media and enabling viewing of the ratings by the users.
- For instance, the operations further include one or more of: i) processing notifications to select users of the network, on the commentary added to the media, wherein the notifications are processed in at least one of the following ways: receiving notifications from users of the network when the users post commentary; sending the notifications when the commentary is added; providing the notifications for display on a plurality of computing and communication devices; providing the notifications via a software mechanism including at least one of a group of email, instant messaging, social network software, software for display on a home screen of a computing or communication device; ii) linking commentary to particular entities specified by metadata within the media, wherein the media is at least one of 1) video, 2) audio, and 3) text, and an entity in the video includes at least one of a group of 1) a specific actor, 2) a subject, 3) an object, 4) a location, 5) audio content, and 6) a scene in the media, and an entity in the audio includes audio content and a scene, and an entity in the text includes a portion of the text; iii) wherein the metadata is created by at least one of manual and automatic operations, and the automatic operations include at least one of 1) face recognition, 2) speech recognition, 3) audio recognition, 4) optical character recognition, 5) computer vision, 6) image processing, 7) video processing, 8) natural language understanding, and 9) machine learning; iv) wherein the media is at least one of video, audio, or text; v) selecting and sharing portions of the media with the commentary with the one or more users within the network who are selected by a particular user; vi) indicating restrictions on sharing specific portions of the media; indicating restrictions on at least one of a length, extent, and duration of the media designated for sharing; vii) indicating restrictions on viewing of a total amount of portions of the media by the one or more users after it is selected for sharing by the particular user; maintaining a record of user consumption history on shared media; viii) restricting an amount of media for free consumption by a user that is selected for sharing by the particular user; ix) restricting an amount of media for consumption by a specific user that is selected for sharing by the particular user; x) enabling viewing of the media by a particular user with other select users in the network; and enabling the users of the network to provide rating relating to the commentary added to the media and enabling viewing of the ratings by the users.
- The systems and methods disclosed below are advantageous in a number of respects. With the ongoing trends and growth in communications over a network, for example, social network communication, it may be beneficial to generate a system for commenting inline on various types of media within an online community. The systems and methods provide ways for adding commentary at certain play points on the online media and sharing the commentary with one or more select users of the online community.
- The present disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

FIG. 18 is a graphic representation of an example user interface for displaying a video during a video conference. - In some implementations, the technology includes systems and methods for sharing inline media commentary with members or users of a network (e.g., a social network or any network (single or integrated) configured to facilitate viewing of media). For example, a user may add commentary (e.g., text, audio, video, link, etc.) to live or recorded media (e.g., video, audio, text, etc.). The commentary may then be shared with members of an online community, for example, a social network, for consumption. The commentary application may be built into or configured within a media player, or configured to be external to the media player.
- As one example, a user A may watch a motion picture (“movie”), add commentary to it, at specific points to label a particularly interesting portion or entity in the movie and may share it with user B. A notification about the commentary by user A is generated and provided to user B (e.g., a friend or associate of user A). User B may view the commentary on a network (by which user B is connected to user A, for example, a social network). The commentary may include a “clip” featuring the particularly interesting portion or entity in the movie. An entity in video-based media may be a specific actor, a subject, an object, a location, audio content, a scene in the media. An entity in audio-based media may be audio content and a scene. An entity in text-based media may be a portion of certain text. User B may concur with User A and decide to watch the movie at a later time when he or she is free. While watching the movie, User B may view user A's commentary, and may respond with his or her own thoughts or comments. This technology simulates an experience for users who may watch a movie with others, even if at a different time and place.
- In some implementations, the system may consist of a large collection of media (e.g., recorded media) that can be consumed by users. Users may embed, add, attach, or link commentary or provide labels at chosen points of play, positions or objects within a piece or item of media, for example, indicating a person (e.g., who may be either static or moving or indicated in three-dimensional form). The positions or objects may be any physical entities that are static or moving in time. As an example, a particular user may want to comment on an actor's wardrobe in each scene in a movie. The user may then select members of a social network with whom to share the specific comments (e.g., friends or acquaintances). Notifications may be generated and transmitted for display on a computing or communication device used by users. In some instances, the notifications may be processed in several ways. In some implementations, notifications may be received from users when they post commentary. In some implementations, notifications may be received when the commentary is added. In some implementations, notifications may be provided via software mechanisms including by email, by instant messaging, by social network operating software, by operating software for display of a notification on a user's home screen on the computing or communication device.
- The user may also select the method of notification (e.g., by email directly to friends, by broadcast to friends' social network stream, or simply by tagging in the media). During the consumption of media, users may have the option to be notified when they reach particular embedded commentary and choose to view the commentary. In certain situations, users may also “opt” to receive immediate notifications of new commentary by email or instant messaging and be able to immediately view the commentary along with the corresponding media segment. In some instance, if desired, a user may respond to existing commentary. The system may then become a framework for discussions among friends about specific media. This system may also be a means for amateur and professional media reviewers to easily comment on specifics in media and to provide “a study guide” for other consumers.
- In some implementations, the system allows users to respond to commentary. For example, a user posts commentary that states that he sees a ghost in the video and another user responds that the ghost is just someone in a bed sheet. Also, the system may send a notification to users (e.g., via email, instant messaging, social stream, video tag, etc.) when commentary is posted to the media.
- In some implementations, the commentary may be written comments, but may also take other forms such as visual media (e.g., photos and video), URLs, URLs to media clips, clips from media (e.g., links to start and endpoints), a graphic overlay on top of the (visual) media, a modified version of the media, or an overdubbing of the media audio such as a substitution of dialogue. This broader view of “commentary” differentiates this disclosure from existing systems for sharing written commentary.
- Media commentary may include a comment or label that may be attached “inline” to the media. For example, a video comment may be included for a particular number of frames or while the video is paused. A comment can be a text comment that may be included in the media. For instance, a user creates a text that states “This is my favorite part” and may be displayed on a video during a specific scene. A comment may be an image that may be included in a video, or text. For example, a user may notice (in a video or a magazine article) that an actor has undergone plastic surgery and may embed pre-surgery photos of this actor. As another example, a user may “paste” his face over an actor in a video. As yet another example, a user may send a clip of a funny scene from a movie to their friends. A comment can be an audio clip that may be included in the media. For example, a user may substitute his dialog for what is there, by overdubbing the voices of the actors in a particular scene. A comment can be a video clip that may be included in the media. For example, a user may embed a homemade video parody of a particular scene. A comment can be a web link that may be included in the media. For example, a user may embed a web link to an online service, selling merchandise related to the current media. All such commentary may be static, attached to an actor as they move in a scene or multiple scenes, or attached to a particular statement, a set of statements, or a song, using metadata extracted by face or speech recognition.
- The metadata may be created by manual or automatic operations including face recognition, speech recognition, audio recognition, optical character recognition, computer vision, image processing, video processing, natural language understanding, and machine learning.
- In addition, in some implementations, the commentary interface may be built into the media viewer. In some implementations, in this interface, a user may initiate commentary by executing a pause to the media and selecting a virtual button. The user may then add information (e.g., title, body, attachments, etc.) to the commentary. The user may then determine a period of time the commentary persists in the media (e.g., the length of a scene). A user may compose audio and visual commentary using recording devices and edit applications that merge their commentary with the media. The user finally selects the audience of the comment and broadcasts it. Upon finalizing the commentary, the user may view the media with the commentary.
- In other implementations, the commentary interface may be external to the media viewer. This interface may be designed for “heavy” users who may wish to comment widely about their knowledge of various media sources. In this interface, the user selects the media and jumps to the point of play that is of interest. In some implementations, the interface may be the same as the previous interface once the point of play is reached. After the commentary is added, the interface would return to an interface for selecting media. A user may select media from a directory combined with a search box. The interface component for jumping to the point of play of interest may take many forms. For example, if the media is a video, the interface may be a standard DVD (digital video disc) scene gallery that would allow the user to jump to a set of pre-defined scenes in the movie and then search linearly to a point of play of the selected scenes. In a more advanced interface, the user may search for scenes that combine various actors and/or dialog. Such a search would use metadata extracted by face recognition and/or speech recognition. This metadata would only have to be extracted once and attached to the media thereafter.
- The system may present the commentary to consumers in a number of ways. For example, if the media is a video, the commentary may be displayed while the original video continues to play, particularly, if the commentary is some modification of the video, for example audio/visual modification of the video. The original video may also be paused and the commentary may be displayed in place of the original content or side by side with it. The commentary may also be displayed on an external device, for example, a tablet, mobile phone, or a remote control.

FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram illustrating some implementations of systems for creating and sharing inline media commentary with an online community, for example, social networks. Thesystem 100 illustrated inFIG. 1 provides system architecture (distributed or other) for creating and sharing inline media commentary containing one or more types of additional media (e.g., text, image, video, audio, URL (uniform resource locator), etc.). Thesystem 100 includes one or moresocial network servers users 125 a through 125 n, to connect to one of thesocial network servers network 105. Although only two user devices 115 a through 115 n are illustrated, one ormore user devices 115 n may be used by one ormore users 125 n. - Moreover, while the present disclosure is described below primarily in the context of providing a framework for inline media commentary, the present disclosure may be applicable to other situations where commentary for a purpose that is not related to a social network, may be desired. For ease of understanding and brevity, the present disclosure is described in reference to creating and sharing inline media commentary within a social network.
- The user devices 115 a through 115 n in
FIG. 1 are illustrated simply as one example. AlthoughFIG. 1 illustrates only two devices, the present disclosure applies to a system architecture having one or more user devices 115, therefore, one ormore user devices 115 n may be used. Furthermore, while only onenetwork 105 is illustrated as coupled to the user devices 115 a through 115 n, the social network servers, 102 a-102 n, theprofile server 130, theweb server 132, andthird party servers 134 a through 134 n, in practice, one ormore networks 105 may be connected to these entities. In addition, although only twothird party servers 134 a through 134 n are shown, thesystem 100 may include one or morethird party servers 134 n. - In some implementations, the
social network server 102 a may be coupled to thenetwork 105 via asignal line 110. Thesocial network server 102 a includes asocial network application 104, which includes the software routines and instructions to operate thesocial network server 102 a and its functions and operations. Although only onesocial network server 102 a is described here, persons of ordinary skill in the art should recognize that multiple servers may be present, as illustrated bysocial network servers 102 b through 102 n, each with functionality similar to thesocial network server 102 a or different. - In some implementations, the
social network server 102 a may be coupled to thenetwork 105 via asignal line 110. Thesocial network server 102 a includes asocial network application 104, which includes the software routines and instructions to operate thesocial network server 102 a and its functions and operations. Although only onesocial network server 102 a is described here, multiple servers may be present, as illustrated bysocial network servers 102 b through 102 n, each with functionality similar tosocial network server 102 a or different. - The term “social network” as used here includes, but is not limited to, a type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature or link. The common feature includes relationships/connections, e.g., friendship, family, work, a similar interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, for example those included in the
system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form thesocial graph 108. - The term “social graph” as used here includes, but is not limited to, a set of online relationships between users, for example provided by one or more social networking systems, for example the
social network system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form asocial graph 108. In some examples, thesocial graph 108 may reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related to one another. - The
social network server 102 a and thesocial network application 104 as illustrated are representative of a single social network. Each of the plurality ofsocial network servers network 105, each having its own server, application, and social graph. For example, a first social network hosted on asocial network server 102 a may be directed to business networking, a second on asocial network server 102 b directed to or centered on academics, a third on a social network server 102 c (not separately shown) directed to local business, a fourth on a social network server 102 d (not separately shown) directed to dating, and yet others on social network server (102 n) directed to other general interests or perhaps a specific focus. - A
profile server 130 is illustrated as a stand-alone server inFIG. 1 . In other implementations of thesystem 100, all or part of theprofile server 130 may be part of thesocial network server 102 a. Theprofile server 130 may be connected to thenetwork 105 via aline 131. Theprofile server 130 has profiles for the users that belong to a particularsocial network 102 a-102 n. One or morethird party servers 134 a through 134 n are connected to thenetwork 105, viasignal line 135. Aweb server 132 may be connected, vialine 133, to thenetwork 105. - The
social network server 102 a includes a media-commentary application 106 a, to which user devices 115 a through 115 n are coupled via thenetwork 105. In particular, user devices 115 a through 115 n may be coupled, viasignal lines 114 a through 114 n, to thenetwork 105. Theuser 125 a interacts via the user device 115 a to access the media-commentary application 106 to either create, share, and/or view media commentary within a social network. The media-commentary application 106 or certain components of it may be stored in a distributed architecture in one or more of thesocial network server 102, thethird party server 134, and the user device 115. In some implementations, the media-commentary application 106 may be included, either partially or entirely, in one or more of thesocial network server 102, thethird party server 134, and the user device 115. - The user devices 115 a through 115 n may be a computing device, for example, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile email device, a portable game player, a portable music player, a television with one or more processors embedded in the television or coupled to it, or an electronic device capable of accessing a network.
- The
network 105 may be of conventional type, wired or wireless, and may have a number of configurations for example a star configuration, token ring configuration, or other configurations. Furthermore, thenetwork 105 may comprise a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN, e.g., the Internet), and/or another interconnected data path across which one or more devices may communicate. - In some implementations, the
network 105 may be a peer-to-peer network. Thenetwork 105 may also be coupled to or include portions of one or more telecommunications networks for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. - In some instances, the
network 105 includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data for example via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, etc. - In some implementations, the social network servers, 102 a-102 n, the
profile server 130, theweb server 132, and thethird party servers 134 a through 134 n are hardware servers including a processor, memory, and network communication capabilities. One or more of theusers 125 a through 125 n access one or more of thesocial network servers 102 a through 102 n, via browsers in their user devices and via theweb server 132. - As one example, in some implementations of the system, information of particular users (125 a through 125 n) of a
social network 102 a through 102 n may be retrieved from thesocial graph 108. It should be noted that information that is retrieved for particular users is only upon obtaining the necessary permissions from the users, in order to protect user privacy and sensitive information of the users. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating some implementations of asocial network server 102 a through 102 n and athird party server 134 a through 134 n, the system including a media-commentary application 106 a. InFIG. 2 , like reference numerals have been used to reference like components with the same or similar functionality that has been described above with reference toFIG. 1 . Since those components have been described above that description is not repeated here. The system generally includes one or more processors, although only oneprocessor 235 is illustrated inFIG. 2 . The processor may be coupled, via abus 220, tomemory 237 anddata storage 239, which stores commentary information, received from the other sources identified above. In some instances, thedata storage 239 may be a database organized by the social network. In some instances, the media-commentary application 106 may be stored in thememory 237. - A
user 125 a, via a user device 115 a, may either create, share, and/or view media commentary within a social network, viacommunication unit 241. In some implementations, the user device may be communicatively coupled to adisplay 243 to display information to the user. The media-commentary application social network server 102 a (through 102 n), or, in a separate server, for example, in the third party server 134 (FIG. 1 ). The user device 115 a communicates with thesocial network server 102 a using thecommunication unit 241, viasignal line 110. - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , like reference numerals have been used to reference like components with the same or similar functionality that has been described above with reference toFIGS. 1 and 2 . Since those components have been described above that description is not repeated here. An implementation of the media-commentary application 106, indicated inFIG. 3 byreference numeral 300, includes various applications or engines that are programmed to perform the functionalities described here. A user-interface module 301 may be coupled to abus 320 to communicate with one or more components of the media-commentary application 106. By way of example, aparticular user 125 a communicates via a user device 115 a, to display commentary in a user interface. A media module 303 receives or plays media (e.g., live, broadcast, or pre-recorded) web media to one or more online communities, for example a social network. Apermission module 305 determines permissions for maintaining user privacy. Acommentary module 307 attaches commentary to the broadcast media. Amedia addition module 309 adds the different types of media to the commentary. Asharing module 311 provides the commentary to an online community, for example, a social network. Aresponse module 313 adds responses to existing commentary. A media-clip-selection module 315 selects a media clip from an online media source. A content-restriction module 317 restricts the content available to be selected as a clip. A metadata-determination module 319 determines metadata associated with media. A face-detection module 321 detects facial features from images and/or videos. A face-similarity-detection module 323 determines facial similarities between one or more face recognition results. A media-conference module 325 begins and maintains media conferences between one or more users. A media-playback module 327 plays media clips during a media conference between one or more users. - The media-
commentary application 106 includes applications or engines that communicate over thesoftware communication mechanism 320.Software communication mechanism 320 may be an object bus (for example CORBA), direct socket communication (for example TCP/IP sockets) among software modules, remote procedure calls, UDP broadcasts and receipts, HTTP connections, function or procedure calls, etc. Further, the communication could be secure (SSH, HTTPS, etc.). The software communication may be implemented on underlying hardware, for example a network, the Internet, a bus 220 (FIG. 2 ), a combination thereof, etc. - The user-
interface module 301 may be software including routines for generating a user interface. In some implementations, the user-interface module 301 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating a user interface for displaying media commentary. In other implementations, the user-interface module 301 can be stored in thememory 237 of thesocial network server 102 and/or thethird party server 134 and can be accessible and executable by theprocessor 235.

interface module 301 creates a user interface for displaying media commentary on an online community, for example, a social network. In some implementations, the user-interface module 301 receives commentary information and displays the commentary on the web media. In other implementations, the user-interface module 301 displays other information relating to web media and/or commentary. For example, the user-interface module 301 may display a user interface for selecting a particular media clip from the media, for selecting and sharing metadata associated with the media, for setting restrictions to the sharing of the media, for commenting within written media (i.e., text), for providing notifications, for displaying media conference chats, etc. Restrictions may include indicating restrictions on sharing specific portions of the media, restrictions on a length, extent, or duration of the media designated for sharing, restrictions on viewing of a total amount of portions of the media after it is selected for sharing, and restrictions on an amount of media for consumption by a user that is selected for sharing. In addition, the user-interface module may be configured to maintain a record of a user consumption history and receive ratings from users on commentary and enable viewing of the rating by other users. The user-interface will be described in more detail with reference toFIGS. 8-18 . - The media module 303 may be software including routines for either receiving live media, media that is broadcast, or pre-recorded media. In some implementations, the media module 303 can be a set of instructions executable by the
processor 235 to provide the functionality described below for either receiving live media, media that is broadcast or pre-recorded media that is provided online within a social network. In other implementations, the media module 303 can be stored in thememory 237 of thesocial network server 102 and/or thethird party server 134 and can be accessible and executable by theprocessor 235. In either implementation, the media module 303 can be adapted for cooperation and communication with theprocessor 235, thecommunication unit 241,data storage 239 and other components of thesocial network server 102 and/or thethird party server 134 via thebus 220. - The media module 303 receives either live media, media that is broadcast or pre-recorded media for viewing by one or more users of an online community, for example, a social network. In some implementations, the media module 303 hosts media via an online service. For example, the media module 303 may receive for viewing one or more videos, audio clips, text, etc., by the users of a social network or other integrated networks. As another example, the media module 303 may broadcast media to users of a social network or other integrated networks. As yet another example, the media module 303 may provide pre-recorded media for viewing by users of a social network or other integrated networks.
- The
permission module 305 may be software including routines for determining user permissions. In some implementations, thepermission module 305 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for determining user permissions to maintain user privacy. In other implementations, thepermission module 305 can be stored in thememory 237 of thesocial network server 102 and/or thethird party server 134 and can be accessible and executable by theprocessor 235. In either implementation, thepermission module 305 can be adapted for cooperation and communication with theprocessor 235, thecommunication unit 241,data storage 239 and other components of the social-network server 102 and/or the third-party server 134 via thebus 220. - The
permission module 305 determines visibility levels of various types of content while maintaining each user's privacy. In some implementations, thepermission module 305 determines the visibility of media hosted by the broadcast module 303. For example, thepermission module 305 determines permissions for viewing media by determining user information. In other implementations, thepermission module 305 determines permissions for viewing commentary. For example, one or more users (e.g., a group in a social network) may have permission (e.g., given by the commentary creator) to view commentary created by a particular user. For another example, the permission to view commentary may be based on one or more age of the user, social relationship to the user, content of the commentary, number of shares, popularity of the commentary, etc. - The
commentary module 307 may be software including routines for generating commentary. In some implementations, thecommentary module 307 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for generating one or more types of media commentary.

commentary module 307 creates and adds different types of media commentary to be attached to broadcast media. In some implementations, thecommentary module 307 specifies a period of time to display commentary, receives media from themedia addition module 309, attaches the media to the commentary, and saves the commentary for viewing by other users of the online community. - In some implementations,
commentary module 307 enables commenting within content for written media (e.g., books, magazines, newspapers). These comments may be associated with specific words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or longer blocks of text. The comments may also be associated with photographs, drawings, figures, or other pictures in the document. The comments may be made visible to other users when the content is viewed. Comments may be shared among users connected by a social network. Comments may be displayed to users via a social network, or in some cases users may be directly notified of comments via email, instant messaging, or some other active notifications mechanism. In some implementations, commentators may have explicit control over who sees their comments. Users may also have explicit control to selectively view or hide comments or commentators that are available to them. - In some implementations, users may comment on other users' comments and therefore start an online conversation. Online “conversations” may take many interesting forms. For example, readers may directly comment on articles in newspapers and magazines. A teacher/scholar/expert/critic may provide interpretations, explanations, examples, etc. about various items in a document. In some implementations, an “annotated” version of a document may be offered for purchase differently than the source document. For example book clubs, a class of students, and other formal groups may discuss a specific book. Co-authors may use this mechanism as a means of collaboration. This mechanism may encourage serendipitous conversations among users across the social network and other online communities.
- In some implementations, a comment may be shared along with a clip (i.e., a portion) of the source document and perhaps knowledge or metadata associated with the document. Also, commentary in written documents may be used beyond written commentary. For example, users may attach photos to specific points in the text (e.g., a photo of Central Park attached to a written description of the park). In general, commentary may be other sorts of pictures, video, audio, URLs, etc.
- In some implementations, users' comments may include links (e.g., URLs) to other conversations or to other play-points in the media or in other media sources.
- In some implementations, users may reference other user comments or arbitrary play-points. For example, a user may start a comment by asking for an explanation of a conversation between two characters in a movie. Another user may respond with a comment that includes a link to an earlier play point which provides the context for understanding this conversation. Similarly, if this question had already been answered by existing users' comments, someone may want to respond with a link to this existing comment thread. It would also be useful to be able to link into existing comments, via a URL or some other form of link that may be included in an email, chat, or social network stream.
- The media-
addition module 309 may be software including routines for adding media to commentary. In some implementations, the media-addition module 309 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for adding one or more media elements to media commentary.

response module 313 responds to users' commentary. This implementation creates an interface for users to converse between each other using different types of commentary. In some implementations, theresponse module 313 receives one or more commentaries from one or more users in response to the first commentary. For example, a first user posts commentary on a video stating the type of car that is in the scene. Then another user posts a response commentary revealing that the first user is wrong and the car is actually a different type. - The media-clip-
selection module 315 may be software including routines for selecting media clips. In some implementations, the media-clip-selection module 315 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for selecting a media clip from an online media source.

restriction module 317 restricts the content (e.g., media clips) that is shared between users. The content-restriction module 317 indicates restrictions on sharing specific scenes (e.g., the climax in a movie) and other restrictions (e.g., max length of clip, etc.). In some instances, the content-restriction module 317 restricts the number of previews a user may view of a specific piece of media by maintaining record of the user's preview consumption history. - In some implementations, the content-
restriction module 317 restricts users from sharing arbitrary parts of media. In some implementations, the content-restriction module 317 restricts users from sharing any part of a particular portion of media. In some instances, the content-restriction module 317 receives a maximum amount of content that a given user can consume via ‘clips’ from the content owner (e.g., the content creator). For example, if there are hundreds of clips available in the system, a user may only consume as many clips as will be allowed (by the owner) to keep their consumption under the owner specified limit. - In some embodiments, the content-
restriction module 317 receives information from the owners of the media to block certain parts of their media from ever being shared. This will allow them to block the climax of a movie and/or book, such that it does not spoil the experience for potential customers. - The metadata-
determination module 319 may be software including routines for determining metadata. In some implementations, the metadata-determination module 319 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for determining metadata associated with media.
