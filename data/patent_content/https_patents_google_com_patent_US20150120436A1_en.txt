- IP internet protocol
- the location estimation may include a location set having multiple locations, and each location of the location set is associated with a probability that the user is located in the respective location.
- the multilocation pCTR for an advertisement and a location set is determined from the single location pCTR for each location of the location set.
- the single location pCTR for an advertisement is a function of a search query, the advertisement, a context, the location, or a combination thereof. Additionally, the single location pCTR is determined from data obtained from historical click-through rates for similar search queries, advertisements, contexts, and locations. For a location set having locations and probabilities, the multilocation pCTR for a location set and advertisement is determined from a sum of each single location pCTR for each location of the location set multiplied by the associated probability.

- the multilocation pCTR may increase advertiser participation and competition in the advertisement auction by attracting advertisers from multiple locations, thereby increasing bids and the amount paid for each advertisement.
- the advertisements are selected based on the auction bids (block 416 ). For example, the highest bid results in selection of an advertisement for a first advertisement slot on a webpage, the second-highest bid results in selection of an advertisement for a second advertisement slot on a webpage, and so on.
- the advertisement auction may be for a single advertisement slot on a webpage.
- the advertisement auction may be a second price auction such that the amount paid by the winner of the auction equals the second-highest bid price.
- the advertisements are provided for display in advertisement slots with search results responsive to the search query. For example, the selected advertisements are transmitted over a network with the search results to a client computer and displayed as a webpage in a browser, or in other formats and in other applications.

The drawings may not be to scale. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but to the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
- As discussed in more detail below, provided in some embodiments are systems and methods for determining a multilocation predicted click-through rate (pCTR) for advertisements. The multilocation pCTR is used to select and rank advertisements for advertisement auctions presented to potential advertisers. The multilocation pCTR is based on an estimation of a user's location, such as by internet protocol (IP) address geolocation. The location estimation may include a location set having multiple locations, and each location of the location set is associated with a probability that the user is located in the respective location.
- The multilocation pCTR for an advertisement and a location set is determined from the single location pCTR for each location of the location set. The single location pCTR for an advertisement is a function of a search query, the advertisement, a context, the location, or a combination thereof. Additionally, the single location pCTR is determined from data obtained from historical click-through rates for similar search queries, advertisements, contexts, and locations. For a location set having locations and probabilities, the multilocation pCTR for a location set and advertisement is determined from a sum of each single location pCTR for each location of the location set multiplied by the associated probability. The multilocation pCTR values for advertisements are then used to select and rank advertisements in an advertisement auction. For example, advertisements having a higher multilocation pCTR may be more desirable to potential advertisers and are therefore subject to higher bids at an advertisement auction.
- Additionally, in some embodiments, the multilocation pCTR is combined with advertisement eligibility criteria. The advertisement eligibility criteria may include advertiser restrictions or other criteria. For example, advertisements selected at auction are selected based on a comparison between a location restriction and the highest probable location of the location set. In other embodiments, a location restriction is compared to multiple locations of the location set, such that any location of the location set that meets the location restrictions may result in an eligible advertisement.
-
FIG. 1 schematically illustrates asystem 100 for determining a multilocation pCTR in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , thesystem 100 includes aclient computer 102 and auser 104 of theclient computer 102. Thesystem 100 also includes anetwork 106, alocation system 108, and anadvertisement system 110. Theclient computer 102,location system 108, andadvertisement system 110 may communicate with each other over thenetwork 106. For example, theclient computer 102 may transmit data to and receive data from thelocation system 108, and theadvertisement system 110. In some embodiments, theclient computer 102 may include thick-clients, thin-clients, or both. Theclient computer 102 may include, for example, smartphones, tablet computers, laptop computers, desktop computers, etc. In some embodiments, thesystem 100 includesmultiple client computers 102. Additionally, some embodiments include a proxy, gateway, or other component located between theclient computer 102 and other components of thesystem 100. For example, a router or mobile proxy computer may be located between theclient computer 102 and thenetwork 106. In other embodiments, theclient computer 102 may access thenetwork 106, thelocation system 108, or other components of thesystem 100 via a service provided by another entity. - The
network 106 includes any element or system that facilitates communications between the components ofsystem 100. Thenetwork 106 may include an electronic communication network and may include any suitable network, such as the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular communications network or any other suitable network, and may be a wireless or wired network. Thenetwork 106 may facilitate data exchange by way of packet switching using the Internet Protocol (IP).Network 106 may facilitate wired and/or wireless connectivity and communication. Thenetwork 106 may include a single network or combination of networks (e.g., the Internet and a cellular communications network as understood by those skilled in the art) that facilitate communication between the components ofsystem 100. In some embodiments, the components of thesystem 100 are each associated with a given IP. The IP address may include an IPv4 IP address, an IPv6 IP address or the like. - The location-based
system 108 and theadvertisement system 110 may each be implemented on a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Such servers include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. The servers include, for example, computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. Such configurations may use thenetwork 106 for communication or may communicate over other networks - The
location system 108 includes alocation processing module 112 that determine the geographical location of a component of thesystem 100, such as by geolocation based on a token 114 (e.g., one or more tokens) received from theclient computer 102, information associated with a user of theclient computer 102, information associated with theclient computer 102, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, thelocation system 108 provides geolocation of components based on IP addresses associated with the components (referred to as “IP address geolocation”). For example, thelocation system 108 obtains, accesses, and processes IP addresses and geolocation data corresponding to the IP addresses to generate a mapping of IP addresses to real-world physical/geolocations (e.g., geographic coordinates, a physical address, zip-code, city, state, country, continent, time zone or the like). Upon receiving request for geolocation data associated with a given IP address, the location system provides a geolocation associated with the IP address based on the mapping. In some embodiments, thelocation system 108 accesses other systems to determine the location of a component. For example, thelocation system 108 may access a WHOIS service to determine the registrant of an IP address or a database of mapped IP addresses. In some embodiments, IP addresses and geolocation data are collected from requests received from access devices. - In other embodiments, the
location processing module 112 geolocates the client computer based on historical behavior associated with theclient computer 102 or theuser 104 of theclient computer 102, such as searches, map views, business lookups, ads or web pages viewed, navigation systems, travel planning, locations mentioned in email, social network posts, and other communications, locations from photo or video imagery, geo-tagged data files such as images, purchases, payment system transactions, etc. In yet other embodiments, the location processing module geolocates the client computer based on user preferences, such as locations (e.g., businesses) identified by user selections (e.g., bookmarks, “likes”, “+1's”, etc.) or otherwise distinguished locations, such as businesses or other addresses stored in a user's address book. Moreover, any combination of the location estimation techniques may be used. In some embodiments, thesystem 100 includes additional location systems that determine the location of theclient computer 102 using global-positioning system (GPS) estimates, assisted-GPS (A-GPS) estimates, cellular tower location estimates, or other location estimation techniques. - Using geolocation, the
location system 108 determines a location set 116 from the token 114. Additionally, as described above, thelocation system 108 determines the location of theclient computer 102 from additional locatingdata 118, such as historical behavior associated with theclient computer 102 or theuser 104. As shown inFIG. 1 , the location set includesmultiple locations 120. In some embodiments, thelocations 120 are hierarchical such that a location at a level encompasses the hierarchical locations at lower levels. Thelocations 120 in the location set 116 includes, for example, a postal code, an official or colloquial neighborhood, a colloquial region, a city, a metropolitan area, an advertising region, a political district, a state, a province, a county, a parish, a country, or any other geographical area or combination thereof. Additionally, the determination of eachlocation 120 includes an associatedprobability 122. The probability for a location indicates the likelihood that the geolocation estimation is accurate, i.e., that theclient computer 102 is within the geographical region specified by the location. Thelocations 116 include, for example, a first location L1 and associated probability P1, a second location L2 and associated probability P2, and a third location L3 and associated probability P3. - The
advertisement system 110 selects and provides advertisements based on requests provided from theclient computer 102, such as asearch query 124. As shown inFIG. 1 , thesearch query 124 is transmitted over thenetwork 106 and received by theadvertisement system 110. Theadvertisement system 110 determines amultilocation pCTR 126 for a given advertisement based on the location set 116. As described further below, themultilocation pCTR 126 is determined from single location pCTR's 128 for eachlocation 120 of the location set 116. Eachsingle location pCTR 128 for a given advertisement is determined as a function of thequery 124, acontext 130, theadvertisement 132, and a location received from the location set 116. As described further below inFIG. 2 , the single location pCTR's 128 are determined from data obtained from historical click-through rates for similar search queries, advertisements, contexts, and locations. The context may include a location context and other information, such as user demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.), environmental conditions (e.g., time of day, holiday such as Christmas or Thanksgiving, etc.), or any other suitable information or combination thereof. - After determining the
multilocation pCTR 126 for an advertisement, the advertisement is selected for anadvertisement auction 134. In some embodiments, themultilocation pCTR 126 is used to rank advertisements in theadvertisement auction 134. Potential advertisers may bid on the advertisements in theadvertisement auction 134, and advertisements are selected based on the bids. Next, selectedadvertisements 136 from theadvertisement auction 134 are provided over thenetwork 106 to theclient computer 102. For example, a webpage may be generated having the selected advertisements with search results responsive to thesearch query 124, and the generated webpage may be transmitted over thenetwork 106 for display on theclient computer 102. In some embodiments, theadvertisement system 110 includes or communicates with a webserver for serving webpages. -
FIG. 2 depicts the determination of amultilocation pCTR 200 for anadvertisement 202 in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As described above, themultilocation pCTR 200 for anadvertisement 202 is determined for a location set 204 having locations 206 (e.g., L1, L2, L3 . . . Ln) and associated probabilities 208 (e.g., P1, P2, P3 . . . Pn). Themultilocation pCTR 200 is determined based on single location pCTR's for eachlocation 206 of the location set 204. In some embodiments, the multilocation pCTR for an advertisement A and a location set LS is determined according to the following equation: -
pCTR(Q, A, C, LS)=pCTR(Q, A, C, L1)* P1+pCTR(Q, A, C, L2)*P2+pCTR(Q, A, C, L3)*P3+ . . . +pCTR(Q, A, C, Ln)*Pn -
- LS is the location set;
- Q is the search query;
- A is the advertisement;
- C is the context;
- Ln is an nth location of the location set LS;
- Pn is an nth probability associated with the nth location;
- pCTR(Q,A,C,LS) is the multilocation pCTR for a location set LS;
- pCTR(Q,A,C,Ln) is the single location pCTR for an nth location of the location set LS;
- As shown in
FIG. 2 , in some embodiments the determination of a single location pCTR is based on historical click-through rate (CTR)data 210 for verified locations. For example, the historical CTR data is accumulated for relatively accurate location estimates having a single location, such as global positioning system (GPS) estimates or assisted GPS (A-GPS) estimates, Wi-Fi network location estimates, cell tower location estimates, and the like. - The single location pCTR for each
location 206 of the location set 204 is obtained from thehistorical CTR data 210. As described above, the single location pCTR is a function of a query, a context, an advertisement, and a location. Thus, as shown inFIG. 2 , the pCTR for theadvertisement 202 and a location are obtained from aquery 212, acontext 214, and thelocation 206 from the location set 204. The historical CTR data for similar parameters are used to obtain the single location pCTR for each location, e.g.,single location pCTR 216 for location L1,single location pCTR 218 for location L2,single location pCTR 220 for location L3, up tosingle location pCTR 222 for location Ln. Once the single location pCTR's are obtained, themultilocation pCTR 200 is determined from the single location pCTR's 216, 218, 220, and 222 and the associated probabilities 208 (e.g., P1, P2, P3 . . . Pn) by using Equation 1 described above. -
FIG. 3 depicts aprocess 300 for estimating a user's location and determining a multilocation pCTR in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 300 are implemented as executable computer code instructions stored on one or more non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium, such as described below inFIG. 5 , and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a computer programmed to execute the code. Initially, a search query 304 is received from a client computer (block 302). Next, a token (e.g., one or more tokens), such as an IP address, associated with the client computer is obtained (block 306). As noted above, the location of the client computer is estimated based on the token and other information (block 308), such though IP address geolocation. As also described above, the location of the client computer is estimated by alocation system 310 that provides alocation set 312. - The location set 312 includes a list of locations and associated probabilities that indicate the likelihood that the client computer is located within each location of the location set 314. For example, as shown in
FIG. 3 , the location set 312 includes locations 314 (e.g., locations L1, L2, L3 . . . Ln) and associated probabilities 316 (e.g., probabilities P1, P2, P3 . . . Pn). Next,eligible advertisements 320 based on the location, user information, the query, and other criteria or combination thereof are determined (block 318). For each advertisement, the multilocation pCTR is determined (block 322). As described above inFIG. 2 and in Equation 1, the multilocation pCTR is determined from the single location pCTR's 324 for each location. The determination of multilocation pCTR's then processes the next advertisement (block 326) until all advertisements have a determined multilocation pCTR value. -
FIG. 4 depicts aprocess 400 for using multilocation pCTR values 402 in advertisement auctions in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 400 are implemented as executable computer code instructions stored on one or more non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium, such as described below inFIG. 5 , and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a computer programmed to execute the code. The inputs to theprocess 400 includesadvertisements 404, the associated multilocation pCTR values 402, and the location set 406 corresponding to the location of the user initiating the request that generated potential advertising. In some embodiments, additional selection criteria for selecting the advertisements to be auctioned are obtained (block 408). The additional selection criteria are based on advertiser restrictions on locations. For example, an advertiser restricts certain advertisements from being eligible for certain locations. - Next, the advertisements meeting the additional selection criteria are selected for the auction (block 410). In some embodiments, the selection is based a single location of the location set or multiple locations of the location set. For example, in some embodiments, if an advertiser places location restrictions on an advertisement, the location restrictions are compared to the highest probable location of the location set, i.e., the location associated with the highest probability. In other embodiments, the location restrictions are compared to multiple locations of the location set, such that any location of the location set that meets the location restrictions may result in selection of an advertisement.
- Next, advertisements are selected, ranked, or both based on the multilocation pCTR values (block 412). In some embodiments, the multilocation pCTR for each advertisement is compared to a threshold, such that advertisements having a multilocation pCTR above the threshold are selected for an auction. Additionally, in some embodiments the multilocation pCTR values are used to rank advertisements, such as for providing a ranking at an auction. After selecting advertisements, the advertisements and multilocation pCTR's are provided to an advertisement auction (block 414). The advertisement auction enables advertisers to place bids on advertisements and advertisement slots (corresponding to advertisement placement on a webpage). Additionally, the multilocation pCTR may also be provided to the auction to enable advertisers to evaluate the effectiveness of an advertisement for an estimate user's location (as determined by the location set). In some auctions, the multilocation pCTR for an advertisement is used in the calculation of the price of the advertisement. For example, the price of an advertisement may be calculated as a function of an advertiser's bid and the multilocation pCTR for the advertisement. Advantageously, the multilocation pCTR may increase advertiser participation and competition in the advertisement auction by attracting advertisers from multiple locations, thereby increasing bids and the amount paid for each advertisement.
- After the auction, the advertisements are selected based on the auction bids (block 416). For example, the highest bid results in selection of an advertisement for a first advertisement slot on a webpage, the second-highest bid results in selection of an advertisement for a second advertisement slot on a webpage, and so on. In other embodiments, the advertisement auction may be for a single advertisement slot on a webpage. The advertisement auction may be a second price auction such that the amount paid by the winner of the auction equals the second-highest bid price. After selection, the advertisements are provided for display in advertisement slots with search results responsive to the search query. For example, the selected advertisements are transmitted over a network with the search results to a client computer and displayed as a webpage in a browser, or in other formats and in other applications.
