- the roadway includes solid lane line 510 , broken lane lines 520 and 540 , double lane lines 530 , and lanes 550 and 560 .
- each data point may include an intensity value indicative of the reflectivity of the object from which the light was received by the laser as well as location information.
- highly reflective surfaces such as lane markers would be associated with an intensity value which is greater than less reflective surfaces such as blacktop, cement, or other roadway surfaces.
- darker objects black, navy blue, brown, etc. which absorb more light would be associated with a much lower intensity value than lighter colored objects which would reflect more light (white, cream, silver, etc.).
- the water may decrease the intensity value.
- the intensity values may be scaled, for example, from 0-250, where 0 is very dark to and 250 very bright. Thus, more reflective, brighter surfaces may be associated with intensity values closer to 250, while less reflective, darker surfaces may be associated with intensity values closer to 0.
- the laser scan data may be received and processed by computer 110 (or computer 320 ) to generate geographic location coordinates.
- These geographic location coordinates may include GPS latitude and longitude coordinates (x,y) with an elevation component (z), or may be associated with other coordinate systems.
- the result of this processing is a set of data point.
- Each data point of this set may include an intensity value indicative of the reflectivity of the object from which the light was received by the laser as well as location information: (x,y,z).
- FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary image 600 of vehicle 101 approaching an intersection.
- the image was generated from laser scan data collected by the vehicle's lasers for a single 360 degree scan of the vehicle's surroundings, for example, using the data points of all of the beams of the collecting laser(s).
- the white lines represent how the laser “sees” its surroundings.
- the data points may indicate the shape and three-dimensional (3D) location (x,y,z) of other items in the vehicle's surroundings.
- the laser scan data may indicate the outline, shape and distance from vehicle 101 of various objects such as people 610 , vehicles 620 , and curb 630 .
- the computer 110 may also detect indications of weather conditions which may affect computer 110 's ability to safely control vehicle 101 (“road weather conditions”). These road weather conditions may include conditions such as wet or icy conditions, snowy conditions, foggy conditions, etc.
- computer 110 may detect indications of wet roadway conditions.
- the computer may examine the average intensity of the laser data points for a roadway and compare this to a threshold to identify an indication of whether the roadway is wet. For example, as noted above, the water covering wet or icy areas of the roadway may decrease the intensity of the roadway.
- a wet roadway may have average intensity values that are somewhat lower that of dry roadways (such as cement, blacktop, brick, etc.) as well as other expected roadway features such as lane markers, etc. that appear in the map information.
- all of the laser data points and intensity values associated with or within the roadway or some portion of the roadway may be examined.
- the vehicle may examine data points associate with an area directly in front of the vehicle in the vehicle's lane, all lanes which move traffic in the same general direction as the vehicle's current lane, all data points within the roadway associated with the field of view of the vehicle's laser or lasers, etc. If some percentage of the examined laser data points have intensity values below a certain threshold value, the computer may determine that the roadway is wet.
- the roadway is very dark.
- a lower intensity value may indicate a high probability that the roadway is wet.
- Other thresholds and percentages may also be used, for example, based on the expected intensity or the composition of the roadway.
- the threshold value used for blacktop may be lower than the threshold value used for cement or brick roadways.
- Flow diagram 700 of FIG. 7 is an example of how computer 110 may use the average intensity of the roadway as well as a threshold value to identify an indication that the roadway is wet.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 710 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location and intensity information.
- computer 110 determines an average intensity from the received laser data. This average intensity is compared to a threshold value for the roadway at block 730 . When the average intensity is below the threshold value, the computer then identifies an indication that the roadway is wet at block 740 .
- the computer may examine variations in the intensity of the roadway to identify an indication of whether the roadway is wet.
- computer 110 may compute the standard deviation or distribution of intensity values along a portion of the roadway.
- the distribution of intensity values may be close to a Gaussian model centered around an expected intensity value for a dry roadway. For example, no matter where the roadway is located, in dry conditions, the intensity values would be expected to cluster around similar values. If the distribution of the intensity values has shifted from close to that expected for dry conditions towards a lower intensity, the computer may determine that the roadway is darker. This may indicate that the roadway is wet, for example, if the roadway includes wet areas of the roadway such as puddles or wet tire tracks.
- FIG. 8 is one example of roadway 500 having various indicators of wet conditions.
- lane 550 includes some puddles 810 and 812 from a previous or present rainfall. After another vehicle has driven through these puddles, the vehicle may leave behind wet tire tracks 820 .
- FIG. 9A depicts an example of processed laser data points from the example of FIG. 8 compared to the detailed map information for roadway 500 of FIG. 4 .
- features 910 , 912 , and 920 represent the general location of the laser data points for puddles 810 , 812 , and tracks 820 , respectively.
- graph 960 depicts an example of a distribution 965 of intensity values for expected for dry conditions.
- Graph 970 depicts and example of a distribution 975 for the intensity values in an examples such as FIG. 9A .
- the distribution has shifted (in the direction of arrow 980 ) towards 0 or the darker end of the intensity scale.
- computer 110 may use this shift to determine that the roadway is wet, or at least includes some wet areas.
- Flow diagram 1000 of FIG. 10 is an example of how computer 110 may use variations in the intensity of the roadway to identify an indication that the roadway is wet.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 1010 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location and intensity information.
- computer 110 processes the laser data to identify a distribution of intensity values for the roadway. This distribution of intensity values is then compared to an expected distribution of intensity values for the roadway under dry weather conditions at block 1030 . When the distribution of intensity values has shifted from the expected distribution of intensity values for the roadway under dry weather conditions towards a darker end of an intensity scale, the computer then identifies an indication that the roadway is wet at block 1040 .
- the computer may identify an indication that the roadway is wet by detecting whether water is being kicked up by a vehicle's tires. For example, when the roadway surface is so wet that the water is being kicked up by the tires of the autonomous vehicle, the computer 110 may detect random laser points behind the wheels. In this regard, computer 110 may detect a cloud or clouds 1110 , 1112 of random data points directly behind the rear tires 1120 and/or bumper 1130 of vehicle 101 as shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B . As a consequence of the moving water, the location and number of the data points within the clouds may constantly be changing.
- a cloud of data points from water would not have a definitive structure, whereas a portion of solid object, such as the rear end of a vehicle, would be associated with data points defining a much clearer surface. Similar data point clouds may also be observed behind other vehicles. Such observations may indicate that it is raining or the ground is really wet.
- Flow diagram 1200 of FIG. 12 is an example of how computer 110 may examine clouds of laser data points to identify an indication that the roadway is wet.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 1210 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location information.
- computer 110 examines the laser data to identify a changing cloud of data points which does not indicate a particular structure. These data points may also be associated with vehicle 101 or another moving object detected in the roadway.
- the computer identifies an indication that the roadway is wet at block 1230 .
- the location of the laser data points may be used by computer 110 to identify an indication that the roadway is wet. For example, when a roadway is very wet, such as where there is a deep puddle, the water may have a glassy appearance. In this regard, some of the water may act as a mirror reflecting laser light while some of the laser light may travel through the water and be reflected by the roadway surface. As shown in the example of FIG. 13 , the laser light may hit the wet roadway surface and return a laser data point cloud 1310 in the area of a puddle. Some of these laser data points may appear above or below the ground 1320 . Thus, computer 110 may observe objects both above and below the expected roadway surface.
- distance thresholds 1330 and 1340 may be used to identify a cloud of data points associated with dry roadway surface from a cloud associated with a puddle of water.
- the cloud of data points 1310 of FIG. 13 includes data points both above threshold 1330 and below threshold 1340 , the data points may be associated with a puddle.
- Computer 110 may use such an indication to determine that the roadway is wet.
- Flow diagram 1400 of FIG. 14 is another example of how computer 110 may use clouds of laser data points to identify an indication that the roadway is wet.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 1410 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location information.
- computer 110 identifies a cloud of laser data points proximate to the expected surface of the roadway (as determined from the detailed map 136 ).
- the laser data points of the cloud are compared to a first threshold value located above the expected surface of the roadway and a second threshold value located below the expected surface of the roadway at block 1430 .
- the computer identifies an indication that the roadway is wet at block 1440 .
- computer 110 may also identify indications of snowy conditions such as when the roadway is at least partially snow covered. For example, because of its color and reflectivity snow may have a higher intensity that than of the surface of the roadway.
- the distribution of intensity values may be close to a Gaussian model centered around an expected intensity value for a dry (non snow-covered) roadway. For example, no matter where the roadway is located, in dry conditions, the intensity values would be expected to cluster around similar values. Thus, if the distribution of the intensity values has shifted from close to that expected for dry conditions towards a higher intensity, the computer may determine that the roadway is brighter. This may indicate that the roadway is at least partially snow covered.
- FIG. 15 is an example of roadway 500 having snowy conditions.
- roadway 500 is lightly covered in some areas 1510 , 1512 with snow and/or ice.
- graph 1560 depicts an example of a distribution 1565 of intensity values for expected for dry conditions, for example, when the roadway is not partially snow covered.
- Graph 1570 depicts and example of a distribution 1575 for the intensity values in an example such as FIG. 15A .
- the distribution has shifted (in the direction of arrow 1580 ) towards 250 or the brighter end of the intensity scale.
- computer 110 may use this shift to determine that the roadway is snowy, or at least includes some snow covered areas.
- Flow diagram 1600 of FIG. 60 is an example of how computer 110 may use variations in the intensity of the roadway to identify an indication that the roadway is at least partially snow covered.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 1610 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location and intensity information.
- computer 110 processes the laser data to identify a distribution of intensity values for the roadway. This distribution of intensity values is then compared to an expected distribution of intensity values for the roadway under dry weather conditions at block 1630 . When the distribution of intensity values has shifted from the expected distribution of intensity values for the roadway under dry weather conditions towards a darker end of an intensity scale, the computer then identifies an indication that the roadway is at least partially snow covered at block 1640 .
- computer 110 may use the average intensity of the roadway to identify an indication of that the roadway is at least partially snow covered. For example, as shown in FIG. 17 , the entire roadway 500 is covered in snow and/or ice 1710 . As these surface coverings may be more reflective than the surface of the roadway, the snow or ice may cause the laser intensity data collected from the roadway at least a threshold higher than the surface roadway or that expected from the detailed map information. Again this threshold value may be based on the composition of the surface of the roadway (blacktop, cement, brick, etc.). For example, if the average intensity of the roadway is at least a threshold value or number of standard deviations greater than the expected intensity of the roadway (or that type of roadway), this information may be indicate that the roadway has a covering of snow or ice.
- Flow diagram 1800 of FIG. 18 is an example of how computer 110 may use the average intensity of the roadway as well as a threshold value to identify an indication that the roadway is at least partially snow covered.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 1810 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location and intensity information.
- computer 110 determines an average intensity from the received laser data. This average intensity is compared to a threshold value for the roadway at block 1830 . When the average intensity is greater the threshold value, the computer then identifies an indication that the roadway is at least partially snow covered at block 1840 .
- computer 110 may use the average intensity of the world, in other words, areas including as well as outside of the roadway, to identify an indication of snowy conditions.
- snow can collect beyond the bounds of the roadway before doing so on the roadway itself.
- snow on the ground outside of the roadway may also be lighter, brighter, and more highly reflective than the roadway, shoulder, curbs, sidewalks, etc.
- the highly reflective, white snow may cause the laser intensity data collected from these areas to be significantly higher than expected from the detailed map information.
- the average intensity of the world outside of the roadway is at least some threshold value or number of standard deviations greater than the expected intensity as defined in the detailed map information, this may indicate that the world has at least some snow covering which is likely to also collect (or has already begun collecting) on the roadway.
- Flow diagram 1900 of FIG. 19 is an example of how computer 110 may use the average intensity of the roadway as well as a threshold value to identify an indication that the roadway is wet.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as well as an area outside of the bounds of the roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 1910 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location and intensity information.
- computer 110 determines an average intensity of an area outside the bounds of the roadway from the received laser data. This average intensity is compared to a threshold value expected from the area (for example, from the detailed map 136 ) at block 1930 . When the average intensity is greater the threshold value, the computer then identifies an indication of snowy conditions at block 1940 .
- the computer 100 may also examine the elevation or height of the roadway as well as a threshold value to identify indications of road weather conditions. For example, if the elevation of the surface of the roadway is detected to be above that expected from the detailed map 136 , this may indicate the accumulation of snow or flood waters on the roadway.
- computer 110 may use data provided or generated by the various vehicle's sensors, including the lasers, radar, sonar, multiple cameras, etc., for an area of the roadway to determine the location of the roadway surface. This information may then be compared to the elevation expected at that particular area of roadway from the detailed map information. If the average height of the roadway is at least some threshold value or number of standard deviations above the expected elevation, this may indicate that the roadway is flooded or has a covering of accumulated snow.
- FIG. 20 is an example of this difference in elevation.
- Surface 2010 represents the expected elevation or location of the ground surface for a section of roadway 500 .
- Surface 2020 represents a threshold elevation or location above which would be indicative of a road weather condition.
- Data points 2032 are a three dimensional projection of the location of the roadway determined from one or more of the laser, sonar, radar, camera data.
- Surface 2030 represents the average detected surface of the section of roadway 500 . In this example, the average detected elevation or location of the road surface of the second of roadway 500 is greater than the threshold value surface 2020 . Accordingly, the example of FIG. 20 indicates that the roadway is flooded or has a covering of accumulated snow.
- Flow diagram 2100 of FIG. 21 is an example of how computer 110 may use the average elevation of the roadway as well as a threshold value to identify an indication that the roadway is snow covered or wet.
- computer 110 receives laser data collected for a roadway as a vehicle is driven along the roadway at block 2110 .
- the laser data includes a plurality of laser data points having location information.
- computer 110 determines an average elevation of the roadway from the received laser data.
- the computer access detailed map information to identify an expected elevation of the roadway. This average intensity is compared to a threshold value above the expected elevation of the roadway at block 2140 . When the average intensity is below the threshold value, the computer then identifies an indication that the roadway is wet at block 2150 .
- computer 110 may also detect indications of other road weather conditions such as fog. For example, radar sensors of the vehicle may penetrate fog very well, but the laser light may not. If computer 110 observes laser obstacles at a certain distance for some threshold period of time, but no radar targets, the computer 110 may identify an indication that the roadway is foggy.
- fog For example, radar sensors of the vehicle may penetrate fog very well, but the laser light may not. If computer 110 observes laser obstacles at a certain distance for some threshold period of time, but no radar targets, the computer 110 may identify an indication that the roadway is foggy.
- the computer 110 may rely on camera information to identify road weather conditions such as wet or snowy road conditions. For example, variations in the brightness, the brightness of the roadway, and the brightness of the world may also be determined from camera images. Similar to the examples described above with regard to the laser intensity data, images captured by cameras 320 - 21 may be processed to determine if the brightness or reflectivity of the roadway captured by the camera is some threshold value or number of standard deviations greater than that expected from the detailed map information. If so, these camera images may indicate that the roadway is wet, icy, snowy etc. In another example, camera images may be used to determine whether the tires of other vehicles with range of vehicle 101 's cameras are kicking up water. If so, these camera images may indicate that the roadway is wet.
- information from other sensors may also be used by the computer 110 to identify indications of road weather conditions.
- the precipitation sensors may provide computer 110 with current information about precipitation, for example, by identifying amount of reflected light received at the photodetector or some other indicator of the detected amount of precipitation.
- data from one or more precipitation sensors may also be used to identify an indication of a road weather condition such as current precipitation.
- the brightness, intensity, elevation, and current precipitation information may also be combined with weather information received from computer 320 .
- the received weather information may be used to identify a road weather condition, for example, if it has just precipitated or is currently precipitating in the area where the vehicle 101 is driving (or will soon be driving), computer 110 may determine that the roadway is likely to be wet, icy, etc.
- computer 110 may send and receive information with computer 320 .
- computer 320 may provide computer 110 with precipitation, cloud, and/or temperature information in the form of reports, radar information, forecasts, etc. This information may be received periodically, for example, every few minutes, hours, or as needed, or may be provided to computer 110 upon request.
- computer 110 may transmit a request including information about the current location of vehicle 101 over a network to computer 320 .
- computer 320 may provide computer 110 with the relevant weather related information for the current location of the vehicle 101 .
- computer 110 may simply send the aforementioned requests periodically.
- computer 320 may broadcast information to autonomous vehicles within certain geographic areas as it becomes pertinent. This may be especially useful where the weather related information is providing severe weather warnings, etc.
- the various identified indications of road weather conditions may be processed as a set of inputs by computer 110 in order to estimate the driving conditions of the roadway along which the vehicle is traveling.
- a Bayesian estimate may be used to determine the current state of the roadway surface.
- the vehicle may determine whether it is currently or has just been precipitating (raining, sleeting, snowing, etc.) and how this weather is affecting the conditions of the roadway (puddles, wet, icy, snow covered, mixed, etc.).
- This estimate may then be used by computer 110 to make various driving decisions. For example, if a road weather condition exists, the computer 110 may use the estimate to make more informed determinations for safe maneuvering of vehicle 101 . For example, computer 110 may continue to navigate vehicle 110 , but also increase the distances between vehicle 101 and other objects on the roadway, slow vehicle 101 down, leave the particular roadway, or move to a particular lane. For example, computer 101 may move to a center lane or side lane that is expected to be less affected by the road weather conditions. In another example, under certain driving features may be disabled or altered. For example, if it is raining, the vehicle's lane changing and passing capabilities may be disabled. Similarly, if it is raining or snowing, the braking profiles may be adjusted, such as to apply the brakes periodically to keep them active.
- the computer 110 may send an alert to the driver.
- the alert may request the driver take control of the vehicle 101 .
- the alert may be an aural signal, a visual signal, a haptic or tactile and/or any other signal that gets the attention of the driver.
- the alert may also request that the driver take control of the vehicle.
- the computer 110 may receive input from the driver.
- the driver may take control of the vehicle 101 by turning the steering wheel, applying the brake, applying the accelerator, pressing an emergency shut-off, etc. If the computer 110 does not receive input (or sufficient input) from the driver, the computer 110 may navigate the vehicle 101 to the side of the road (i.e., pull the vehicle over), reduce the speed of the vehicle 101 , or bring the vehicle 101 to a complete stop.
- Flow diagram 2200 of FIG. 22 provides an example of some of the steps performed by computer 110 as described above. It will be understood that the steps discussed herein are merely an example; the steps may occur in a different order, steps may be added, and steps may be omitted.
- laser scan data including data points collected along a roadway is received at block 2202 .
- the laser scan data may include data points indicating the location and intensity of objects, roadway features, etc. in the laser's surroundings including the roadway, and in some examples, the world beyond the boundaries of the roadway. This information is used to identify one or more road weather conditions at block 2204 (see, for example, the flow diagrams of FIGS.
- images captured from a camera are received. Like the laser data, the images may include information about the camera's surroundings including the roadway. The images are then used to identify an indication of road weather conditions at block 2208 . Data from a precipitation sensor is received at block 2210 , and used to identify an indication of road weather conditions at block 2212 .
- weather related information is received from a server over a network. Again, the weather related information is used to identify an indication of road weather conditions at block 2216 . The identified indications are then used to estimate the driving conditions of the roadway at block 2218 . The estimate is used to make a driving decision as described above at block 2220 .
