- the scoring platform 202 may be operable to determine, calculate, update and/or manage personal and universal scores for current digital content promotions.
- the personal score for each of the current digital content promotions may be calculated based on the contents (e.g. PDMIs 142 ) of a personal digital media library, such as, for example, the PDML 140 .
- the scoring platform 202 may be operable to receive and/or process requests from the PS 120 to determine a personal and/or a universal score of a current promotion.
- the scoring platform 202 may identify the digital content (e.g., the DMIs 132 from the Digital Media Library 130 ) corresponding to the current digital content promotion.
- the scoring platform 202 may compare the PDMIs 142 from the PDML 140 with the DMIs 132 corresponding to the current digital content promotion.
- the scoring platform may determine a personal score for the current promotion based on the comparison for the PDMIs 142 with the DMIs 132 corresponding to the current promotion (promotional DMIs).
- the personal score may be based on, for example, how closely the PDMIs 142 correspond to the promotional DMIs, using for example a correlations scoring, as described with respect to the Digital Media Library 130 depicted in FIG. 1 .
- the personal score may also be based on, for example, a size of a group of PDMIs 142 corresponding to the promotional DMIs. For example, when the promotional DMIs correspond to a certain genre and most of the PDMIs 142 also corresponds to the same or a closely related genre the personal score for the current promotion may be very high.
- the scoring platform 202 may perform a mapping of the PDMIs 142 of the PDML 140 onto DMIs 132 of the Digital Media Library 130 to obtain mapped DMIs 132 . The scoring platform may then compare the mapped DMIs with the promotional DMIs (such as the promotional DMIs described above). The scoring platform may be operable to determine the PDMIs 142 from the PDML 140 and may compare each of the PDMIs 142 with DMIs 132 from the Digital Media Database 130 . For example, the scoring platform may determine that PDMI_ 1 corresponds to a DMI_ 35 , PDMI_ 2 corresponds to DMI_ 356 etc.
- the mapping may be performed using a variety of comparison algorithms, such as, for example, metadata information text comparisons, and/or audio/video sampling comparisons.
- the scoring platform may then determine a correlations score assigned to each of the promotional DMIs with respect to each of the mapped DMIs.
- the scoring platform 202 may request the correlations score from the Digital Media Database 130 which stores, manages and/or updates such correlations scores as described with respect to FIG. 1 .
- the scoring platform 202 may receive a request to re-score a current digital content promotion based on user interactions with the current digital content promotion.
- the request to re-score may be received from, for example, the serving platform 203 , the PS 120 and/or the electronic device 110 .
- the user may interact with the current digital content promotion by clicking and/or otherwise selecting the current digital content promotion, by purchasing and/or playing digital content associated with the current digital content promotion.
- the scoring platform 202 may adjust the personal score of the current digital content promotion so as to reflect the user interaction.
- the personal score may be adjusted up or down depending on the type of user interactions. If for example, the user purchased content associated with the current digital content promotion, the personal score for that particular current digital content promotion may be adjusted down and in result may, for example, not be presented to the user in the future.
- the scoring platform 202 may identify the digital content (e.g., the DMIs 132 from the Digital Media Library 130 ) corresponding to the current digital content promotion.
- the scoring platform 202 may determine the universal score based on, for example, popularity, play and/or purchase history and/or user interactions with the digital content and/or the current digital content promotion corresponding to the digital content.
- the universal score may be high for a promotion corresponding to digital content that is a part of a relatively large number of personal digital media libraries determined from, for example, the plurality of personal digital media libraries 231 .
- the universal score may be based on how many times a particular current promotion has been interacted with and/or how many digital content purchases resulted from such interactions.
- the personal and/or the universal score may be determined in isolation for individual digital content promotions and/or relative to other digital content promotions.
- the personal and/or the universal score may be determined for each digital content promotion individually based on one or more criteria as described in the present disclosure.
- the personal and/or universal score may be determined relative to other digital content promotions.
- a subset of digital content promotions may be chosen and the personal and/or universal score for each of the promotions in the subset may be determined so as to obtain a ranking of the promotions in the subset relative with each other. For example, if the subset comprises Promotions 1-5, the result reflecting an ordering from the highest to the lowest ranking promotion might be, for example as follows: Promotion 4, 2, 3, 5, 1.
- the ranking may be based on the personal score alone, on the universal score alone and/or on an aggregate score (personal and universal score for each of the promotions).
- the ranking may also be based on one of the personal and the universal score for some promotions and/or an aggregate score for other promotions.
- Promotions 4, 2, 3 may have, respectively, the first, second and third highest personal score and Promotions 5 and 1 may have the fourth highest personal score.
- Promotion 5 may have a higher universal score than Promotion 1 and hence a higher aggregate score than Promotion 1.
- the aggregate score may be used to determine the ranking of Promotion 1 with respect to Promotion 5, so as to obtain an overall ranking of the promotions from highest to lowest scoring to be as follows: Promotion 4, 2, 3, 5, 1.
- the scoring platform 202 may exclude certain current digital content promotions from scoring, based on, for example, pre-defined promotion criteria associated with the current digital content promotions.
