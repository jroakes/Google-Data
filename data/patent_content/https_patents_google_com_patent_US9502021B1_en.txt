- FIG. 9 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing device arranged for spatially selecting acoustic sources using an adaptive post processor according to one or more embodiments described herein.
- beamformers aim to select acoustic sources that are spatially distinct.
- the beamformer's spatial selectivity is poor, and with a large number of microphones robustness to deviations in the source locations is often difficult to achieve.
- using many microphones generally results in very narrow peaks in the angular response (so if the angle is wrong, the performance is all wrong), and using few microphones results in very low performance (e.g., inaudible improvement). If using techniques that optimize some criterion, then performance with few microphones can be good, but again robustness is a problem (e.g., enormous gains result for spatial signal components that are implicitly assumed not to be present).
- each postfilter provides an optimal real gain in the squared-error sense for each time-frequency bin for a particular acoustic scenario.
- the postfilters may be based on knowledge of a spatial covariance matrix of the desired source, a spatial covariance matrix of the interfering sources, and microphone signals in some neighborhood of the time-frequency bin.
- the spatial covariance matrices characterize the acoustic scenario.
- the postfilters that are optimal for each scenario in an applicable set of desired-source and interference scenarios may then be used to render a combined postprocessor that can consist of a cascade of postfilters or an adaptively selected postfilter.
- a combined postprocessor that can consist of a cascade of postfilters or an adaptively selected postfilter.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure have numerous real-world applications. At least one reason for this is because the beamformer/postfilter system described herein has a more favorable performance versus robustness versus hardware complexity trade-off than existing beamformers have. Instead, the beamformer/postfilter provides excellent performance in real-world circumstances, and it does so at a low hardware cost.
- the methods and systems may be implemented in computing devices (e.g., laptop computers, desktop computers, etc.) to remove interfering audio sources in the background from the user sitting in front of the device and, for example, speaking into a microphone built into the device.
- computing devices e.g., laptop computers, desktop computers, etc.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example 100 of such an application, where a user 120 is positioned in front of at least one audio capture device 110 (e.g., microphone) and there are interfering audio sources 130 in the background.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure may be used in mobile devices (e.g., mobile telephones, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs)) and in various systems designed to control devices by means of speech recognition.
- mobile devices e.g., mobile telephones, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs)
- PDAs personal digital assistants
- Beamforming is a well-established technique for enhancing audio sources that use multiple microphones.
- the basic approach to beamforming is a linear setup where each microphone signal is filtered with a linear filter and the results are summed.
- the aim under such existing approaches is that the filtered signals add coherently for a source signal originating from a preferred location and cancel for interfering signals originating from other locations. While the performance of such linear beamformers may be good in simulated scenarios, their performance is often unsatisfactory in real-world scenarios.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to use a less constrained paradigm to obtain good and robust beamforming performance.
- the signal may first be decomposed into coefficients representing time-frequency bins.
- a condition may then be imposed that the signal in a particular time-frequency bin arrives from either the desired source or from one or more interfering sources. If the incoming signal satisfies this condition, then a “gate” operator may be used to reduce interference to zero and allow the desired signal through.
- the optimal gate operator may be implemented as an adaptive scalar multiplicative gain.
- the goal is then to compute the optimal gain according to some criterion.
- the squared error of the desired source may be used as the criterion.
- a gate operator can be optimized for a particular hypothesized scenario and observation. It should be noted that it is beneficial to consider a set of possible scenarios, assuming they are sufficiently similar, rather than just one scenario. It is possible to create a better gate operator by combining the effect of the operators for each scenario.
- Each scenario can be separated into a desired-source scenario and an interferer scenario.
- the method and system of the present disclosure simply selects the most open gate from the possible desired-source scenarios and the most closed gate from the interferer scenarios. As will be further described below, the order of these two selection operations generally is of minor importance, but can be chosen for best performance for a particular application.
- the postfilter of the present disclosure applies a particular gain to each of the coefficients of a suitable basis or frame (e.g., a generalized basis) expansion of the signals.
- a suitable basis or frame e.g., a generalized basis
- the Gabor transform is an example of such a representation.
- the gains may be thought of as resulting from a belief about the proportion of the desired source and interfering sources in the particular coefficient. The belief is based on the spatial correlation of the coefficients representing the microphone signals. Coefficients characterizing time-frequency components for which the desired signal is believed to dominate are provided with a high gain. Coefficients that are believed to describe interfering sources receive a low gain.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to estimate, from a set of microphone signals, a desired source signal.
- this estimate may be obtained (e.g., generated, determined, derived, calculated, etc.) with a conventional beamformer followed by an adaptive postfilter that multiplies each time-frequency bin with an optimal real-valued gain.
- a discrete-time formulation is used and the symbol i ⁇ Z is used as the time index.
- subscripts are used to label the time samples.
- the samples utilized in the following description are those of a time-frequency representation for a particular frequency channel.
- the microphone observations form an M-dimensional complex stochastic vector process Y.
- the notation Y is short for ⁇ Y i ⁇ i ⁇ z .
- the realization of a time sample of the microphone vector is written as y i ⁇ C M .
- the realization of the desired source signal is denoted by ⁇ i ⁇ C. While the signal ⁇ i is the realization of a random process, the goal is to estimate the realization ⁇ i , and thus the corresponding random variable is not used. However, the microphone signals and the interfering signals are considered as random processes.
- R _ ⁇ 1 ⁇ R ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ R ⁇ . ( 2 )
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example high-level process 200 for selecting a desired-source scenario and an interference scenario for the purpose of masking the interference of a desired-source signal.
- the details of blocks 205 - 215 in the example process 200 will be further described in the following.
- d n label the n'th scenario for the desired source
- u m label the m'th interference scenario.
- ⁇ (y i ,d n ,u m ,d n ′,u m ′) denote the distortion in the desired source signal that occurs if the observation is y i
- the actual scenario pair is (d n ,u m )
- beamformer is optimized for the pair (d n ′,u n ′).
- the expected distortion can be written as
- ⁇ ⁇ ( y i ) ⁇ n , n ′ , m , m ′ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( y i , d n , u m , d n ′ , u m ′ ) ⁇ p ⁇ ( d n ′
- y i ,d n ) is the probability that was optimized for scenario d n′ when the actual scenario is d n
- y i ,u m ) is the probability that was optimized for u m′ when u m occurred, both with observation y i . It is most straightforward to make these decisions determin
- equation (6) corresponds to a concatenation of the postfilters corresponding to different interference scenarios. While equations (5) and (6) describe effective methods, they are not guaranteed to be optimal. However, the description that follows illustrates that the postfilter of the present disclosure provides state-of-the-art performance.
- the desired source signal may be considered to be a signal ⁇ i generated coherently over a region characterized by the aperture function ⁇ n : R 3 ⁇ R, where n labels the scenario.
- the aperture function ⁇ n is naturally modeled as a Dirac delta function.
- the interferer is described by a signal density s im : R 3 ⁇ R that is the realization of the random field S im (x), where m labels the scenario.
- the following description omits the scenario labels m and n.
- y i ⁇ 3 ⁇ h ⁇ ( x ) ⁇ s i ⁇ ( x ) ⁇ d x + ⁇ 3 ⁇ h ⁇ ( x ) ⁇ f ⁇ ( x ) ⁇ d x ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ i . ( 7 )
- h: R 3 ⁇ C M is the microphone vector response to a sound impulse at a particular location in space and x ⁇ R 3 is spatial location.
- equation (7) is a good approximation if the signals are frequency channels of a Gabor frame representation, assuming the Gabor frame has a resolution selected to make the difference between linear and circular convolution for computing acoustic responses negligible. This implies that the frame functions must have sufficiently large support. The following will not make explicit the dependencies on the center-frequencies of the channels.
- ⁇ may be considered to be time-invariant, but naturally it usually is adapted to the scenario.
- the postprocessor in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein applies a postfilter gain g i ⁇ R to the output of the beamformer.
- the estimate of the desired source signal is the random variable
- the aim is to determine g i *, the gain g i that minimizes a suitable criterion, given only knowledge of the observed microphone vector signal y, the aperture ⁇ of the desired source, and the variance density of S i (x).
- the gain is to be optimized over a suitable time (and frequency) window operator, which is associated with a time-dependent averaging operator A i .
- the operator A i can be, for example, an averaging over a window of designated length (e.g., it can generally be expected that an averaging over 20 milliseconds (ms) will be a good estimator for the estimation of a speech signal).
- g i * argmin g ⁇ E [ A i ⁇ [ ⁇ w H ⁇ h ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ - g ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 2 ] ] , ( 10 )
- E is the (ensemble) expectation over the random interfering field S i (x)
- h ⁇ ⁇ h(x) ⁇ (x)dx is used to simplify notation.
- E does not average over the desired source signal ⁇ i ; it averages only over the contexts ⁇ i . It should also be noted that no stationarity assumptions are made.
- the accuracy of the present approach can be improved if the ensemble averaging is not essential, that is if A i [ ⁇ R 3 h H (x)s(x)dx] ⁇ 0. Equation (11) may be simplified to
- 2 ]R ⁇ E[A i [ ⁇ Y p Y p H ⁇ p ⁇ Z ]] (16)
- the index i will be dropped from R ⁇ and R M . If it is assumed that the observations are of the form of equation (16), then equation (12) can be rewritten as
- one of the objectives is to compute the optimal real gain g i *, using equation (17). While the values of A i [
- the matrices and R ⁇ are known from a model of the spatial scenario, and the observations provide an estimate of the matrix R M .
- R M ⁇ A i [ ⁇ y p y p H ⁇ p ⁇ Z ].
- This estimate for R M may not be completely accurate.
- the window should be such that A i [ ⁇ R 3 h H (x)s(x)dx] ⁇ 0 and the effect of ensemble averaging on R ⁇ should be small. This is most easily satisfied by distributed interferers and by a window corresponding to an operator A i that involves substantial averaging.
- ⁇ A i ⁇ [ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 2 ] ⁇ ⁇ R ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ R ⁇ ( 21 ) that represents the signal-power fraction of the beamformer output that is contributed by the desired source.
- equation (22) is a generic relationship that is valid if the observed covariance matrix R M is a combination of the interference covariance matrix R ⁇ and the desired-source covariance matrix R ⁇ . In a real-world environment this is generally an approximation.
- Equations (21) and (17) give the following:
- ⁇ R _ ⁇ ⁇ w ⁇ R _ ⁇ ⁇ M is shared by the numerator and denominator. It is small in the direction of the beam and relatively large (but generally less than 1) in other directions.
- ⁇ R M ⁇ w ⁇ 1 and ⁇ R ⁇ ⁇ M are independently of the current signal.
- g* for a signal from the desired source location.
- ⁇ R M ⁇ w ⁇ 1 which reduces the numerator and results in a reduction of g*.
- This result is strengthened by the denominator: ⁇ R M ⁇ w ⁇ 1 results in an increase of the denominator.
- the above description provides an example method for finding the optimal gain g* which, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, may include the following: determine R ⁇ and R ⁇ from the scenario, measure R M , set ⁇ , and use equation (24) to compute the gain.
- the following description addresses several natural specifications for the matrices R ⁇ and R ⁇ .
- h ⁇ ( x ) e - j ⁇ ⁇ k ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ 4 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ x ⁇ ( 25 )
- k is the wavenumber (the wavenumber is
- k 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ f c
- ⁇ frequency in Hz
- c the speed of sound; it is a normalized frequency that can be interpreted as the number of radians per unit length (or the number of waves per unit length multiplied by 2 ⁇ )).
- Specific scenarios may be derived from this basic form of h(x) and the linearity of the wave equations.
- the far-field linear array case may be considered.
- equation (25) can be approximated by a plane wave.
- ⁇ be the angle away from broadside arrival on the array of the source.
- the gain of the transfer function can be absorbed into the power of the source.
- h ⁇ ( ⁇ ) 1 M ⁇ [ 1 , e - j ⁇ ⁇ kd ⁇ ⁇ sin ⁇ ( ⁇ ) , ... ⁇ , e - j ⁇ ⁇ Mkd ⁇ ⁇ sin ⁇ ( ⁇ ) ] T . ( 26 )
- the following describes specific example scenarios for the desired-source spatial covariance matrix and the interferer spatial covariance matrix.
- h(x ⁇ ) takes the form
- the present example considers the probability of the angular location of the desired source to be uniform in the interval ⁇ [ ⁇ c,c].
- the spatial covariance matrix is, for l ⁇ m,
- h(x ⁇ ) takes the form
- h ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ) 1 M ⁇ [ 1 , e - j ⁇ ⁇ kd ⁇ ⁇ sin ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ) , ... ⁇ , e - j ⁇ ⁇ Mkd ⁇ ⁇ sin ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ) ] T . ( 30 )
- equation (31) is generally needed to make the right-hand side of the equation vanish for ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ′.
- this is not consistent with the estimation of R M in a practical system, which is subjected only by the operator A i . Therefore, in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, in implementations of the methods and systems described herein the following stronger assumption may be made: A i [S ( ⁇ ⁇ ) S ( ⁇ ⁇ ′)] ⁇ S 2 ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ′), (32) It should be understood by those skilled in the art that, in some practical conditions, equation (32) may not be satisfied.
- the example scenario described above may be extended to allow a gap in the background interference.
- the derivation may be readily extended to the desired source being located anywhere.
- ⁇ 2 ⁇ ( ⁇ ⁇ ) ⁇ 0 , ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ [ 0 , b ) ⁇ ( ⁇ - b , 2 ⁇ ⁇ ] ⁇ S 2 , ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ [ b , 2 ⁇ ⁇ - b ] ( 34 ) where it is noted that ⁇ 2 : R ⁇ R is a periodic function with period 2 ⁇ .
- the matrix may be forced to be positive semi-definite by, for example, reducing the rank of the matrix by zeroing negative eigenvalues in a spectral decomposition.
- the interferes described above may be combined:
- R ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ S 2 M ⁇ J 0 ⁇ ( ( m - l ) ⁇ kd ) + ( 1 - ⁇ ) ⁇ h ⁇ ( x ⁇ ) ⁇ h ⁇ ( x ⁇ ) H , ⁇ ⁇ [ 0 , 1 ] , ( 38 ) where ⁇ is set to a value suitable for the scenario.
- equation (7) holds only for narrow-band systems.
- signals may first be converted to a time-frequency representation and then the theory described above may be applied to each frequency channel separately. In this manner, the problem is solved for each frequency band separately without exploiting knowledge of events in nearby frequencies bands.
- the behavior of the solution procedure may depend significantly on the frequency of the channel.
- the basic behavior of the beamformer (equation (8), described above) can be affected by frequency.
- equation (24) may also be dependent on frequency.
- Equation (24) The frequency dependency of equation (24) can be countered by the usage of equations (5) and (6). Thus, by using multiple desired-source scenarios the beamwidth can be widened.
- any of the following three structures may be used under such circumstances:
- the spatial covariance at a particular frequency may be averaged with the spatial covariance (or the gain directly) at a set of integer multiples of that frequency;
- the gain may be replaced with the average gain for a higher frequency band.
- the following describes some example results that may be obtained through experimentation. It should be understood that although the following provides example performance results in the context of a far-field implementation of the system with known desired and interferer locations for artificial data, using a delay-sum preprocessor, the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to this particular context or implementation. While the following description illustrates that excellent performance can be achieved with only a small number (e.g., two) of microphones, and also that the performance is robust, similar levels of performance may also be achieved using the methods and systems of the present disclosure in various other contexts and/or scenarios.
- a small number e.g., two
- the beamformer is a delay-sum pre-processor. It should be noted that the delay-sum beamformer may be omitted (and thus the selection of a single microphone signal is used as preprocessor) with only a minor impact on performance.
- example data is created by combining two utterances of about eight seconds in length spoken by different persons, and sampled at 16 kHz. As described above, two microphones are employed.
- the data involves a scenario where the desired talker is positioned straight ahead of (e.g., straight in front of) the microphones, and one interfering talker is positioned at 45 degrees ( ⁇ /4 radians) in relation to the position of the desired talker with respect to the microphones.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to achieve similar performance with numerous other configurations (e.g., positioning) of the desired talker and the interfering talker with respect to the microphones, in addition to the example configuration described above.
- the model is informed about the location of the desired and interfering talkers.
- example data is obtained by sweeping a white-noise point source in 3.2 seconds over 360 degrees around the two-microphone beamformer.
- One interferer scenario is a combination of the uniform noise scenario and the point source scenario at 45 degrees.
- the second interferer scenario is a combination of the uniform noise scenario and the point source scenario at ⁇ 45 degrees.
- Nine desired-source scenarios are set up to construct a beam. The masking function is shown with a single postfilter and with the concatenated postfilters.
- FIG. 3 illustrates performance results for the two-microphone beamformer of the present example.
- the bottom two plots, 315 and 320 show the input signals to the first and second microphones, respectively.
- the second plot 310 from the top shows the clean desired signal. It can be seen that the microphone signals are contaminated with the speech of the second talker, who is speaking at similar loudness as the desired talker.
- the top plot 305 shows the extracted signal (e.g., estimate of the desired signal extracted from the first and second microphone inputs shown in plots 315 and 320 , respectively). Visual inspection of the extracted signal 305 indicates that the interfering talker is largely removed from the signal.
- FIGS. 4-6 show corresponding sub-segments of the signals illustrated in FIG. 3 and described above.
- FIG. 4 is a time-frequency representation plot 400 of the clean desired signal
- FIG. 5 is a time-frequency representation plot 500 of the mix of the two signals (e.g., the combined signals from the first and second microphones) as observed in one of the microphones (it should be noted that a similar observation is made in the other of the two microphones)
- FIG. 6 is a time-frequency representation plot 600 showing the output of the beamformer (e.g., the recovered signal) described above with respect to the present example.
- Plots 400 , 500 , and 600 illustrate that the desired signal is recovered with only slight contamination at the onsets.
- the nonlinear beamforming postprocessor (and corresponding nonlinear beamforming post-processing method) of the present disclosure is able to remove interfering signals where, for example, the spatial covariance matrices of the desired source and the interfering sources are known. It is understandable that this result can be obtained for situations where, in each time-frequency bin, either the desired source or the interfering source dominates. Such situations occur frequently in the real world.
- FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate the effect of the concatenation of multiple filters, in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein.
- the signal is a point source rotating over a full 360 degrees (2 ⁇ radians) in 3.2 seconds.
- FIG. 7 is a graphical representation 700 showing an example response for the case of a single scenario with modeled desired source at 0 degrees and a modeled interferer that is an equal mix of a uniform interferer and a point interferer at 1.5 radians on the right. It may be observed that the beam is narrow and rejection is particularly poor between 3.5 and 5.5 radians.
- FIG. 8 is a graphical representation 800 showing an example response for the case where two model interferer scenarios (one scenario as before (e.g., described above with respect to FIG. 7 ), and the other its reflection around zero degrees) and nine model desired-source scenarios, with beams pointing from ⁇ 0.3 to 0.3 radians, are considered.
- the postfilters are cascaded as described above with respect to equation (6).

- the gain below 200 Hz is obtained by averaging the gain from 200 to 400 Hz.
- Comparison of the single-scenario case in FIG. 7 and the multi-scenario case in FIG. 8 illustrates that the multi-scenario setup can simultaneously widen the beam and increase suppression.
- FIG. 8 shows that the multi-scenario system is able to remove interferers in a broad range of angles. In other words, the system performs well even for unknown interferer scenarios.
- results illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8 indicate that the strategy of equation (6) or equation (5) is not necessarily guaranteed to always improve performance, and therefore, in practice, it is useful to consider different scenario configurations to obtain optimal performance.
- the methods and systems of the present disclosure provide an optimal post-processor that consists of a selection of one postfilter from a set of postfilters, or a cascade of postfilters, where each postfilter is optimal for a particular scenario.
- Each postfilter individually is based on optimizing the gain for each time-frequency bin based on knowledge of the spatial covariance matrices of the desired source and of the interfering sources.
- the hypothetical results described above illustrate that with only two microphones the beamforming method and system of the present disclosure can remove an unknown interfering source signal over a range of unknown locations. While some existing approaches attempt to achieve similar results, such existing approaches do not perform well in practice: their performance is obtained by providing extremely high gain for signals that were implicitly assumed not to exist, but are present in practice. In contrast, the methods and systems of the present disclosure are robust in their performance: their performance degrades gracefully with decreasing accuracy of the specified locations of desired and interfering sources.

Abstract
Description
∥R β∥α={νH R βν,ν=argmaxw w H R α w,w H w=1} (1)
and the following is written:
where p(dn′|yi,dn) is the probability that was optimized for scenario dn′ when the actual scenario is dn and p(um′|yi,um) is the probability that was optimized for um′ when um occurred, both with observation yi. It is most straightforward to make these decisions deterministically, which means that the conditional probabilities are indicator functions that take the
η(y i ,d n ,u m ,d n ′,u m′)≧η(y i ,d n ,u m ,d n ,u m) (4)
and that one of the goals for the method and system of the present disclosure is to minimize p(dn′|yi,dn) for n′ ≠n and minimize p(um′|yi,um) for m′ ≠m. In other words, the method and system aims to identify the scenarios correctly.
where the operation order in this instance was chosen to favor suppression. In a different situation it may be appropriate to favor transparency, which would reverse the order shown in equation (5) above.
If there is only one desired-source scenario, then equation (6) corresponds to a concatenation of the postfilters corresponding to different interference scenarios. While equations (5) and (6) describe effective methods, they are not guaranteed to be optimal. However, the description that follows illustrates that the postfilter of the present disclosure provides state-of-the-art performance.
where h: R3→CM is the microphone vector response to a sound impulse at a particular location in space and xεR3 is spatial location.
φi=ωH y i, (8)
where φi is the estimate of the desired signal ξi. It should be noted that, generally, the relative scaling of φ and ξ is less important for the purpose of beamforming. In the present context ω may be considered to be time-invariant, but naturally it usually is adapted to the scenario.
where E is the (ensemble) expectation over the random interfering field Si(x), and where the definition hξ=∫h(x)ƒ(x)dx is used to simplify notation. It should be noted that E does not average over the desired source signal ξi; it averages only over the contexts ξi. It should also be noted that no stationarity assumptions are made.
Let a window be selected such that E[Ai[ξ∫R
where the following definitions were used:
and
A i[|ψ|2 ]=E[A i [∫∫S(x)S(x′)dxdx′]]
=A i [∫∫E[S(x)S(x′)]dxdx′] (15)
R M,i =A i[|ξ|2 ]R ξ +A i[|ψ|2 ]R ψ
=E[A i [{Y p Y p H}pεZ]] (16)
In the following, the index i will be dropped from Rψ and RM. If it is assumed that the observations are of the form of equation (16), then equation (12) can be rewritten as
R M ≈A i [{y p y p H}pεZ]. (18)
This estimate for RM may not be completely accurate. For example, the window should be such that Ai[ξ∫R
ωH R
where the notation of equation (1) is used and additionally, for the case that w is a vector, ∥
that represents the signal-power fraction of the beamformer output that is contributed by the desired source.
It is important to note that equation (22) is a generic relationship that is valid if the observed covariance matrix RM is a combination of the interference covariance matrix Rψ and the desired-source covariance matrix Rξ. In a real-world environment this is generally an approximation.
is shared by the numerator and denominator. It is small in the direction of the beam and relatively large (but generally less than 1) in other directions. For a local signal yi arriving from a location near the desired source, ∥
where α is a suitably selected constant (e.g., advantageously selected as α=0.999). It is noted that for scenarios where the interferer dominates, the min operator limits generally only in the numerator, whereas in scenarios where the desired source dominates, both the numerator and denominator are limited by the min operators.
where k is the wavenumber (the wavenumber is
where ƒ is frequency in Hz, and c is the speed of sound; it is a normalized frequency that can be interpreted as the number of radians per unit length (or the number of waves per unit length multiplied by 2π)). Specific scenarios may be derived from this basic form of h(x) and the linearity of the wave equations.
The assumptions for the estimation of RM are reasonable in this case.
where the approximation sin(θξ)≈θξ is made for small θξ. For m=l, the following is given (without the need for approximation):
E[A i [S(θψ)S(θψ′)]]=σS 2δ(θψ−θψ′). (31)
where S(θ) is the signal at an angle θ, and σS 2 is an angular density of the variance of the source, which may be assumed to be time-invariant.
A i [S(θψ)S(θψ′)]≈σS 2δ(θψ−θψ′), (32)
It should be understood by those skilled in the art that, in some practical conditions, equation (32) may not be satisfied.
which uses that the integral is a zero-order Bessel function of the first kind, denoted by J0.
where it is noted that ν2: R→R is a periodic function with period 2π.
For sufficiently small b, the approximation sin(θψ)=θψ can be made. This results in, for l≠m:
and for l=m, this gives (without the need for approximation):
It should be noted that the same or similar procedure as described above may be used for gaps in ν2 for other intervals on [0, 2π]. However, in the present example, second-order approximations should be used, and the resulting covariance matrix is Hermitian, but, in general, not real.
where β is set to a value suitable for the scenario.
