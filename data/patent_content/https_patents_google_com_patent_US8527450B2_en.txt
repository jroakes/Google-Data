- a plurality of clients 102 a ⁇ d may receive and send short messages, such as Tweets, using various short messaging servers, e.g., short messaging server 114 for tweets, via network 104 .
- Short messaging servers e.g., short messaging server 114 for tweets
- Messaging applications may be implemented on any number of servers although only one message server 114 is illustrated for clarity and simplification of the description.
- Each server e.g., 114
- some users may subscribe through the messaging server 114 to a particular messaging account that is managed by another user, such as a business entity.
- the subscribing users then receive short messages from the business entity and participate in short messaging sessions with such business entity. For instance, as detailed below the business entity can send tweets regarding business announcements, events, promotional sales, etc.
- the network may take any suitable form, such as a wide area network or Internet and/or one or more local area networks (LAN's).
- the network 104 may include any suitable number and type of devices, e.g., routers and switches, for forwarding requests from each client to a particular server application, forwarding application results back to the requesting clients, or forwarding data between various servers.

- TCP/IP-based networks e.g., Rate Control Protocol or RCP, Transport Control Protocol or TCP, Fast TCP, Stream-based TCP/IP or STCP, eXplicit Control Protocol or XCP, etc.
- telecommunications networks wireless networks, mobile networks, etc.
- the computer program instructions with which embodiments of the invention are implemented may be stored in any type of computer-readable media, and may be executed according to a variety of computing models including a client/server model, a peer-to-peer model, on a stand-alone computing device, or according to a distributed computing model in which various of the functionalities described herein may be affected or employed at different locations.
- a messaging server may take any suitable form for providing short messaging services.
- a messaging server implements a communication application, such as Twitter, instant messaging, social networking, blogging, etc.
- a communication application generally allows a user (human or automated entity) to communicate with one or more other users via a communication device (e.g., telephones, persona digital assistants or PDA's, computers, etc.) via one or more networks (e.g., 104 ) and retain user message information, for example, in database 115 .
- a communication device e.g., telephones, persona digital assistants or PDA's, computers, etc.
- networks e.g., 104
- Embodiments of the present invention may be employed with respect to message data obtained from messaging server applications or generated from any messaging application, such as general communications applications that include Yahoo! Email, Yahoo! IM, Facebook, etc.
- a messaging server may implement a mechanism for retaining message information, e.g., in database 115 , and/or streaming such message information (e.g., in a Twitter firehose) to various application users for implementing the message/tweet analysis and use techniques described herein.
- Embodiments of the present invention may include business message analyzer 106 for analyzing and identifying business messages, such as tweets.
- the business message analyzer may be implemented within another application server, such as a message server 114 or on one or more separate servers, such as the illustrated business message analyzer system 106 .
- a business message analyzer can be configured to analyze various messages for a particular business (or other type of promoting entity) and automatically classify such messages.
- the business message analyzer system 106 may access one or more analysis databases, e.g., database 110 , for storing representational information regarding messages, message semantic features, classification information, feature vectors, class lexicons, topic models, statistics regarding messages and classification, etc.
- Mechanisms for analyzing business messages/tweets can be implemented in any suitable manner.
- a supervised machine learning approach may be utilized to automatically classify business messages.
- the identification of tweets from a given class is generally treated as a supervised classification problem and a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) machine learning framework may be used to solve it so as to derive/learn a lexicon for each class of messages/tweets.
- GBDT Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
- One GBDT framework is described by Friedman, J. H. Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine, The Annals of Statistics 29, 5 (2001), 1189-1232, which document is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- any other machine learning framework can be used, such as Support Vector Machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ ⁇ cjlin/libsvm/).
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure 200 for analyzing and classifying business messages in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- a set of business accounts may be provided in operation 202 .
- particular twitter accounts may be manually defined by users or automatically defined as businesses.
- a dictionary of business names may be provided or extracted from Wikipedia or Yahoo! Local and this business dictionary may then be used to identify business accounts in the Twitter firehose (all tweets, all the time) by matching Twitter account names or URL's (Universal Resource Locator) with names in the provided business dictionary. Any other suitable techniques may be used to identify business message/Twitter accounts.
- a small sample of messages from such business accounts is then provided in operation 204 .
- the small sample may then be manually classified in operation 206 .
- 50 messages may be manually classified as belonging to a “deals” class, while other messages are classified as other types of classes.
- FIG. 3 includes a table of example classes and subclasses into which a sample of business tweets were manually divided in one example approach using one example taxonomy derived manually. It was found that a large proportion of this initial sample of messages could be defined as belonging to an “announcement” class.
- An announcement can generally include messages that relate to the business product or service, but can also include current events. For example, announcements may include news updates regarding the particular business.
- the announcement class can be further subdivided into subclasses, such as events, deals/coupon/sale, product release, schedule, job openings, or other (as illustrated in FIG. 3 ).
- announcement messages may be exclusive to the particular subscribing users, e.g., subscribers to the business's Twitter feed, or a repetition or reformatting of other types of announcement that are made by the business using other forms of media, e.g., television, newspapers, etc.
- Engagement type messages Another type of class that was found to be prevalent in business tweets was engagement type messages, in which a business interacts with one or more customers. Engagement messages may be directed to all subscribers, such as when conducting surveys or polls or enticing participation in contests (perhaps to entice more followers). Engagement messages may also be directed towards specific customers (e.g., customer service conversations, general discussions, feedback/retweet). Subclasses may include survey/poll, contest, customer service, general discuss, retweeting of feedback, appreciation, or trouble shooting tips from customers to other customers. Other classes may include a “content or links” class and a “brand awareness” class.
- a message/tweet can be described by a collection of lexical and semantic features, such as tokens (e.g., unigrams, bigrams), and a lexicon can correlate these features with the class of the tweet. Said in another way, a class of tweets may have particular high frequency tokens in common.
- the initial lexicon for a particular class is formed from the top percentage (e.g., top most k unigrams and bigrams from each particular class) of most frequently used tokens.
- each class lexicon will contain a set of most common phrases or tokens that are likely to be present in the messages for the particular class.
- the set of phrases may be expanded by using a larger sample for each class.
- the larger sample of messages may be taken from the entire set of known business accounts, which may include 10's of thousands of tweets/messages. If the number of messages is too large to be analyzed (e.g., by a current topic model software package), the number of messages may be first reduced.
- the messages from the entire set of known business accounts are ranked for each class as most likely to belong to the particular class in operation 209 . This process can take the form of a simple, na ⁇ ve ranking that seeks to find clear examples of messages in each class. The ranking derived from the final classification results can then replace and complete the initial na ⁇ ve ranking.
- L is the initial lexicon
- t i ⁇ L
- score(t i ) is the % of tweet tokens which appear in L (although any other suitable scoring metric may be used). Based on these scores, the top m % of ranked tweets may then be retained. Any suitable value for m may be utilized, e.g., the top 30% of tweets for each class may be used.
- a topic model (or any other suitable clustering algorithm) may then be utilized on the top ranked messages for each class to expand the lexicon for such class in operation 210 .
- a topic model for the top ranked messages can be built by running a LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) package.
- LDA Topic Dirichlet Allocation
- One suitable LDA package is described in the paper by A. Smola and S. Narayanamurthy, An Architecture for parallel Topic Models, Proceedings of VLDB, 2010, which paper is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- One suitable LDA package is “Ida: Collapsed Gibbs sampling methods for topic models”, available from Jonathan Chang of Princeton University (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ida/).
- a topic model is configured to cluster the messages into specific topics. All topics T which contain one of a few high-precision triggers for class C can then be retained and the corresponding topic terms can be added to the lexicon L. For example, messages that relate to airline deals will be in one cluster, while messages that relate to computer deals will be in another cluster. Other messages, which are not related to deals, will reside in other clusters. For each cluster, the topic model will put together a description for the topic, using the clustered message tokens. As a result, some clusters will contain tokens from the initial lexicon, while other clusters will not. For example, the topic “airline deals” may include the phrases “% off”, “marked down”, etc.
- the initial lexicon for the “deals” class may contain the phrase “% off”, but not the phrase “marked down.”
- the topic model is configured to generate topic descriptions that are all related to the particular topic (e.g., airline deals)
- the clusters that contain seed tokens from the initial lexicon of a particular class can be assumed to contain other lexicon terms that also relate to the particular class. Accordingly, non-seed tokens from a cluster that also contains seed tokens for a particular class can also be added to the initial lexicon for such class.
- the phrase “marked down” can also be added to the “deals” lexicon.
- a junk lexicon which contains stop words and low-information words (e.g. “lol”, “omg”, etc.), can also be generated and then used to filter out particular tweet content from the classification analysis as further described below.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a training process 400 for generating a classification model in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Although the following steps are described as being implemented with respect to each class, the entire training process would likely be implemented on one class at a time.
- a training set for each class may be provided in operation 402 .
- the training set would include messages belonging to the particular class and messages that do not belong to the particular class.
- 200 positive and 200 negative messages are used. Any suitable number of class and non-class messages may be used.
- the ratio of positive and negative messages may correspond to a manual analysis of a large set of messages. For example, if the announcement message class typically makes up 13 percent of total messages, a training set may include 130 announcement messages and 870 non-announcement messages.
- a feature vector may then be determined for each class in operation 404 .
- the feature vector may be formed from any suitable quantifiable or describable characteristics of the message.
- a same set of features may be used for each class.
- the particular feature vector for a particular class may be determined experimentally as the set of characteristics that are most determinative of class. That is, feature characteristics may be selected that correspond to the message being in a particular class or subclass. For example, one characteristic may be the percentage or number of class lexicon tokens that are present in the message.
- messages that contain pronouns have been found to correspond to particular classes, such as the events class.
- FIG. 5 is an example list 500 of top five features for the deals and events classes in accordance with one example implementation.
- Top features may include tweet/message level features, such as percentage of tweet tokens from a class lexicon, percentage of tweet tokens from the Junk lexicon, percentage of tokens which are URLs, percentage of numeric tokens, tweet length, percentage of tokens that are pronouns, etc. These examples can be generally used for deals and events classes, while other features may be utilized for other class types.
- a model may then be trained based on the feature vectors of the training set in operation 406 .
- Training can involve exhaustively examining a wide range of feature weights and values and picking a set that maximizes accuracy and recall (or a combination of both called F-measure). In one example in which only accuracy is maximized, the model can be adjusted until about 75-80% accuracy is achieved.
- the model can then be used to classify new messages and optionally use such classification results in operations 214 .
- new tweets may be issued by a particular business account to one or more subscribers to the business account's Twitter feed.
- a classification model may be used for each new message in real time or at any suitable time on a set of new messages based on any suitable criteria.
- use of a classification model may be triggered after a particular number of tweets/messages are sent with respect to a particular business account, after a predefined period in which one or more tweets have been sent, etc.
- tweets may be collected and retained for each business account until after the classification process is implemented on them.
- the new message may be sent to other users based on the new message's class. For example, announcement or event messages may be sent to users who may be interested in the particular business.
- FIG. 6 contains a table 600 of examples of classes of topics obtained from a plurality of message tweets. Some topics can be seen to be related to the business domain (e.g., Food, Drink). Other general-interest topics, such as holidays and celebrations, important political or sports events, were also found. Such topics reflect the way in which businesses adapt their communication based on the broader societal preoccupations and could potentially be used for better organizing and recommending business account content.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a typical computer system that, when appropriately configured or designed, can serve as a messaging or message analysis system.
- the computer system 700 includes any number of processors 702 (also referred to as central processing units, or CPUs) that are coupled to storage devices including primary storage 706 (typically a random access memory, or RAM), primary storage 704 (typically a read only memory, or ROM).
- processors 702 may be of various types including microcontrollers and microprocessors such as programmable devices (e.g., CPLDs and FPGAs) and unprogrammable devices such as gate array ASICs or general-purpose microprocessors.
- primary storage 704 acts to transfer data and instructions uni-directionally to the CPU and primary storage 706 is used typically to transfer data and instructions in a bi-directional manner. Both of these primary storage devices may include any suitable computer-readable media such as those described herein.
- a mass storage device 708 is also coupled bi-directionally to CPU 702 and provides additional data storage capacity and may include any of the computer-readable media described herein. Mass storage device 708 may be used to store programs, data and the like and is typically a secondary storage medium such as a hard disk. It will be appreciated that the information retained within the mass storage device 708 , may, in appropriate cases, be incorporated in standard fashion as part of primary storage 706 as virtual memory.
- a specific mass storage device such as a CD-ROM 714 may also pass data uni-directionally to the CPU.
- CPU 702 is also coupled to an interface 710 that connects to one or more input/output devices such as such as video monitors, track balls, mice, keyboards, microphones, touch-sensitive displays, transducer card readers, magnetic or paper tape readers, tablets, styluses, voice or handwriting recognizers, or other well-known input devices such as, of course, other computers.
- CPU 702 optionally may be coupled to an external device such as a database or a computer or telecommunications network using an external connection as shown generally at 712 . With such a connection, it is contemplated that the CPU might receive information from the network, or might output information to the network in the course of performing the method steps described herein.
- the system may employ one or more memories or memory modules configured to store data, program instructions for the general-purpose processing operations and/or the inventive techniques described herein.
- the program instructions may control the operation of an operating system and/or one or more applications, for example.
- the memory or memories may also be configured to store representational information regarding one or more of the following: account or subscription information, messages, message semantic features, classification information, feature vectors, class lexicons, topic models, statistics regarding messages and classification, etc.
- machine-readable media that include program instructions, state information, etc. for performing various operations described herein.
