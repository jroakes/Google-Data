Definitions
- the subject matter of this application is generally related to online advertising.
- content items of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query.
- the query can include one or more search terms, and the search engine can identify and, optionally, rank the content items based on the search terms in the query and present the content items to the user (e.g., according to the rank).
- This query can also be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user.
- advertisement syndication Another form of online advertising is advertisement syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners.
- third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image advertisements on web pages that have content related to the advertisement. Because the users are likely interested in the particular content on the publisher webpage, they are also likely to be interested in the product or service featured in the advertisement. Accordingly, such targeted advertisement placement can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- Advertisers can bid for placements based upon how much the advertiser values the placement. In some examples, the advertiser can bid based upon impressions of the advertisement. In such examples, the advertiser is charged whenever the advertisement is served. In other examples, the advertise can bid based upon a click-through for the advertisement. In such examples, the advertiser is charged only when a user clicks on the advertisement after the advertisement is served to the user.
- Methods for target bid adjustment can include: identifying a candidate advertisement, the candidate advertisement being a candidate for participating in an auction of a current advertising slot, the candidate advertisement being associated with an advertiser and a target bid; receiving a predicted performance metric for the advertisement in the current advertising slot; comparing the predicted performance metric for the advertisement in the current advertising slot to a baseline predicted performance metric of the candidate advertisement; adjusting the target bid associated with the advertisement based upon the comparison of the predicted performance metric and the baseline predicted performance metric; and submitting the adjusted target bid to the auction.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding methods, apparatus, and computer program products.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an implementation of an online advertising environment.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example implementation of an advertisement server shown in FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an implementation of a bid adjustment process.
- FIG. 4 is block diagram of an example computer system.
- Bids for advertisements can be adjusted based upon a predicted performance of the advertisement in a current advertisement placement being auctioned relative to a baseline predicted performance of the advertisement over a set of past auctions or placements.
- the predicted performance for example, can include a predicted conversion rate, a predicted click-through rate, or a predicted revenue or profit margin, among many others.
- the set of past auctions or placements for example, can be selected based upon other auctions in which the advertisement was a candidate for participation in the auction, placements in which the advertisement received an impression, placements in which the advertisement received a click, or placements in which the advertisement received a conversion, among many others.
- the bid can be adjusted up or down depending upon the comparison between the predicted performance and the baseline predicted performance.
- the adjusted bid can be submitted to the impending auction for the current advertisement placement.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an implementation of an online advertising system 100 .
- one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement (“ad”) information in an advertising management system 104 .
- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads may also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 may submit requests for ads to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- Other entities such as users 108 and the advertisers 102 , can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or click-through related to an ad has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , the system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , the system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 .
- a publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to an ad server in the system 104 .
- the ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 .
- This combined content and ads can be sent to the user 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the ad server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In some implementations, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then forwarded to the user 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the search service can transmit information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered back to the system 104 .
- the advertising management system 104 can serve publishers 106 , such as content servers and search services.
- the system 104 permits serving of ads targeted to documents served by content servers.
- a network or inter-network may include an ad server serving targeted ads in response to requests from a search service with ad spots for sale.
- the search service crawls much or all of the content.
- Some of this content will include ad spots (also referred to as “inventory”) available.
- one or more content servers may include one or more documents.
- Documents may include web pages, email, content, embedded information (e.g., embedded media), meta-information and machine executable instructions, and ad spots available.
- the ads inserted into ad spots in a document can vary each time the document is served or, alternatively, can have a static association with a given document.
- the system 104 includes an adjustable bidding system which predicts or estimates a performance metric for a given ad placement for an advertisement using performance prediction engine.
- the system 104 includes a bid adjustment system used to adjust bid associated with an advertisement and specified by the advertiser 102 to account for the potential that a current advertising slot provides a better opportunity for the advertiser 102 than other opportunities.
- the advertising management system includes an ad server 120 operable to serve advertisements to publishers 106 through a search engine interface 130 or through an ads for content interface 140 .
- Advertisements for the search engine interface 130 can be identified, for example, based upon the search terms entered by the user 108 .
- Advertisements for the ads for content interface 140 can be identified, for example, based upon an analysis of the content of the publisher 106 web page and a comparison to keywords or concepts associated with the advertisements.
- the advertising management system 104 can include an advertisement data store 150 and a campaign data store 160 . Advertisements and associated usage data can be stored as advertisement data in an advertisement data store 150 .
- an advertiser 102 can further manage the serving of advertisement by specifying an advertising campaign.
- the advertising campaign can be stored in campaign data in a campaign data store 160 that can, for example, specify advertising budgets for advertisements, when, where and under what conditions particular advertisements may be served for presentation, etc.
- a computer company may design an advertising campaign for a new laptop computer that is scheduled to be released in several weeks.
- the advertising campaign may have a budget of $500,000, and may have 30 different advertisements that are to be served for presentation during the month of November.
- Such data defining the advertisement campaign can be stored in the campaign data 160 .
- the advertisement server 120 can be coupled to a performance tracking data store 170 .
- the advertisement server 120 can send performance tracking data identifying how well the advertisement is performing to the performance tracking data store 170 . Identification of how well the ad is performing can be based on a performance metric.
- the performance metric can be defined, for example, in terms of the number of times the advertisement has been served, the number of times the advertisement has been selected (e.g., a click-through rate), the number of conversions that have been recorded, the average profit or revenue associated with an impression or selection of the advertisement, survey information about the advertisement from those viewers that have received the advertisement, or predicted performance scores for each participation in an auction, among others.
- a performance prediction system 180 can use the performance tracking data from the performance tracking data store 170 to predict performance of an advertisement in a given slot.
- the predicted performance information for example, can be used by the ad server 120 to adjust a bid associated with an advertisement.
- the ad server 120 can adjust the bid associated with an advertisement based upon comparing a predicted performance metric for the advertisement with a baseline predicted performance metric for the advertisement.
- the predicted performance metric can be any of a selection of the advertisement (e.g., a click-through), a conversion (e.g., sale) associated with an impression, or revenue or profit generated as a result of the impression, among many others.
- the baseline predicted performance metric can be identified by identifying a control set.
- the control set for example, can be a set of previous action data for a set of auctions for which the advertisement was a candidate advertisement, a set of auctions for which the advertisement received an impression, a set of impressions which resulted in the advertisement being selected (e.g., clicked) by a user, a set of impressions which resulted in a conversion, etc.
- the ad server 120 can average predicted performance metrics for each of the auctions in the control set to identify the baseline predicted performance. For example, if the predicted performance metric is predicted conversion rate (pCVR), the baseline predicted performance metric can be identified as:
- Baseline ⁇ ⁇ predicted ⁇ ⁇ performance pCVR 1 + pCVR 2 + ... ⁇ ⁇ pCVR N N
- pCVR n corresponds to the predicted conversion rate for the nth member of the control set
- N corresponds to the cardinality of the control set.
- the predicted performance metric is predicted conversion rate
- the pCVR for A 1 is 30%
- the pCVR for A 2 is 5%
- the pCVR for A 3 is 10%
- the predicted conversion rate can be replaced by the appropriate predicted performance metric.
- the ad server 120 can compare the predicted performance metric of a candidate advertisement for a current advertisement placement associated with an impending auction to the baseline predicted performance metric. Based upon the comparison, the ad server 120 can adjust the bid associated with the advertisement.
- the comparison can include dividing the predicted performance metric for the current placement by the baseline predicted performance metric. In such implementations, any error introduced by a performance prediction component is canceled out because the same error can be assumed to be present in both the predicted performance metric for advertisement in the current advertising slot and the baseline predicted performance metric for the advertisement.
- the result of dividing the predicted performance metric by the baseline predicted performance metric can identify an adjustment ratio. In those implementations using predicted conversion rates as the predicted performance metric, the adjustment ratio can be identified by the equation:
- Adjustment ⁇ ⁇ Ratio pCVR current pCVR baseline
- pCVR current is the predicted conversion rate for the current advertising slot
- pCVR baseline is the an average predicted conversion rate for the advertisement over a control set. For example, if predicted conversion rate for a current advertising slot is 15% and a baseline predicted conversion rate for the current advertising slot is 10%, the adjustment ratio can be identified as 15%/10%, or 1.5.
- the adjustment ratio can be used to adjust the bid associated with the candidate advertisement.
- the bid can be multiplied by the adjustment ratio to derive an adjusted bid, which can be submitted to the impending auction.
- the baseline predicted performance metric can be continuously updated.
- the ad server 120 can serve a portion of the requests (e.g., 5%, 15%, 25%, 50%, etc.) for which an advertisement qualifies as a candidate advertisement without adjusting the bid.
- the portion of the requests which are served without adjusting the bid can be identified as the control set.
- the portion of requests allocated to the control set can be dynamically adjusted. For example, when an advertisement is new and there does not exist enough tracking data to provide an adequate sampling for the control set, the ad server 120 can allocate an increased percentage of traffic (e.g., 50%) to the control set. After a predetermined period of time, for example, or number of impressions (or other metric), the percentage of traffic allocated to the control set can be reduced by the ad server 120 . In another example, if an advertisement does not accumulate enough tracking data, the percentage of traffic allocated to the control group can remain high.
- an advertisement does not accumulate enough tracking data
- the percentage of traffic allocated to the control group can remain high.
- control set can be replaced by a sliding window identifying a specified number of previous auctions preceding the current auction.
- a specified number of previous auctions can be used to update the baseline predicted performance metric.
- the ad server 120 can throttle the adjustment of the target bid. In other implementations, if the average price paid by the advertiser 102 exceeds the target bid by a threshold amount, the ad server 120 can throttle the adjustment of the target bid. Throttling the adjustment of the target bid can reduce the average price paid by the advertiser 102 for a placement, click-through, conversion, etc. to the target bid.
- throttling of the adjusted target bid can be done by identifying a maximum adjusted bid above which the target bid cannot be adjusted.
- the maximum adjusted bid can be set based upon the target bid. For example, the target bid may be raised by a percentage (e.g., 20%) to identify the maximum adjusted bid. In other examples, the maximum adjusted bid may be the target bid itself.
- throttling of the adjusted bid can be accomplished by allocating a larger portion of the requests for the candidate advertisement to the control set. Allocation of a larger portion of the bids to the control set can provide a maximum bid as the target bid for a larger percentage of the auctions for which the advertisement is a candidate, and thereby lowering the average price paid for the advertisement.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example implementation of an ad server 120 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the ad server 120 can include an ad server interface 200 , a candidate advertisement identification component 210 , a bid adjustment component 220 and an auction component 230 .
- the ad server interface 200 can receive advertisement requests from one or more of the search engine interface 130 or the ads for content interface 140 . Receipt of an advertisement request signals an impending auction for a current advertisement slot on the requesting web page or search engine page.
- the impending auction can be based upon any auction paradigms including, for example, a cost per impression metric (e.g., cost per mille (CPM) or cost per action (e.g., cost per click (CPC), cost per conversion, etc.) paradigm.
- a cost per impression metric e.g., cost per mille (CPM) or cost per action (e.g., cost per click (CPC), cost per conversion, etc.
- CPM cost per mille
- CPC cost per click
- conversion cost per conversion
- the candidate advertisement identification component 210 can identify a candidate advertisement for the request.
- the candidate advertisement can be identified, for example, based upon search terms included in a search query or based upon content of a requesting web page.
- candidate advertisements can also be identified based upon preferences of publishers for types of advertisements or preferences of advertisers for types of slots.
- the candidate advertisement identification component 210 can retrieve advertisement information from the ad data store 150 and/or campaign information from the campaign data store 160 in order to facilitate identification of candidate advertisements.
- a bid adjustment component 220 can adjust the target bid based upon information from the performance prediction system 180 .
- enablement of target bid adjustment can be based upon an advertiser enabling performance tracking.
- enablement of target bid adjustment can be based upon explicit instruction from the advertiser to enable target bid adjustment (e.g., based upon input received through an advertiser interface to the ad server 120 ).
- bid adjustment can be based upon comparison of a predicted performance metric (e.g., predicted click-through rate, predicted conversion rate, predicted revenue, predicted profit margin, etc.) to a baseline predicted performance metric.
- a predicted performance metric e.g., predicted click-through rate, predicted conversion rate, predicted revenue, predicted profit margin, etc.
- the predicted conversion rate for the advertisement in the slot being auctioned can be compared to a baseline predicted conversion rate for the advertisement across a sampling of auctions.
- the sampling of auctions can be identified, for example, by allocating a portion of auctions for which the advertisement is a candidate advertisement to a control set.
- the control set can be limited to those auctions where the candidate advertisement registered an impression, a click-through, a conversion, or any other measurable action.
- the baseline predicted performance metric can be an average of the predicted performance metrics for each of the auctions/placements identified by the control set.
- the comparison of the predicted performance metric for the current advertisement placement with the baseline predicted performance metric can include dividing the predicted performance metric for the current advertisement placement by the baseline predicted performance metric. For example, if the average predicted conversion rate for the candidate advertisement in the auctions/placements in the control group is 10% and the predicted conversion rate for the candidate advertisement in the impending auction/current placement is 5%, an adjustment ratio of 1/2 can be identified (e.g., 5%/10%). A bid associated with the candidate advertisement can thereby be scaled by the adjustment ratio. Thus, if the target bid for the candidate advertisement is $1.00 on CPC basis, the adjusted bid is the target bid multiplied by the adjustment ratio, or $0.50 on a CPC basis (e.g., $1.00 ⁇ 1/2).
- the bid adjustment component 220 can throttle the adjusted bid based upon an average price paid exceeding the target bid or an average price paid exceeding the target bid by a threshold margin. For example, if the target bid is $1.00, and the average price paid is $1.35, future adjusted bids can be modified to reduce the average price paid toward the target bid. In some implementations, throttling of the adjusted bid can reduce the average price paid while maintaining a bias for the advertisement towards placements in which the bid is expected to be more successful (e.g., based upon the comparison the predicted performance metric to the baseline predicted performance metric).
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an implementation of a bid adjustment process.
- candidate advertisements can be identified for the auction.
- Candidate advertisements can be identified, for example, by a candidate advertisement identification component (e.g., candidate advertisement identification component 210 of FIG. 2 ).
- candidate advertisements can be identified based upon search terms received from a search engine.
- candidate advertisements can be identified based upon analysis of the content of a web page requesting the advertisement. The analysis of the web page can occur in real-time or offline when the publisher engages an ad server to supply future advertisements for the publisher. In examples where the analysis of a web page occurs offline, the ad server can supply a snippet to the publisher for insertion into the web page.
- the snippets upon execution by a browser can cause the browser to send a request for an advertisement along with an identification, identifying the web page.
- the ad server can use the identification to retrieve the previous analysis of the web page.
- Candidate advertisements can then be selected based upon the retrieved web page analysis.
- candidate advertisements can be further identified based preferences of the publisher and/or advertiser.
- a predicted performance is received.
- the predicted performance can be received, for example, by a bid adjustment component (e.g., bid adjustment component 220 of FIG. 2 ) from a performance prediction system (e.g., performance prediction system 180 of FIGS. 1 and 2 ).
- the performance of the advertisement is predicted with respect to the current placement (e.g., the placement for which the ad server received an advertisement request).
- the predicted performance of the advertisement can be based upon past performance of the advertisement in similar slots (e.g., on the same web page, for the same search query, at the same time of day, for similar users, for similar content or concepts, etc.).
- the received predicted performance is compared to a baseline predicted performance.
- the received predicted performance can be compared to the baseline predicted performance, for example, by a bid adjustment component (e.g., bid adjustment component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- the baseline predicted performance can be compiled from a control set of placements for which the same advertisement was a candidate.
- the control set of placements in some examples, can be identified as a portion of placements for which the advertisement is a candidate advertisement which do not adjust the target bid. In various examples, the control set can be limited to those placements that did not use an adjusted target bid and which registered a click-through, conversion or other activity with respect to the advertisement.
- the comparison of the predicted performance to the baseline predicted performance can include dividing the predicted performance by the baseline predicted performance to derive an adjustment ratio.
- Other forms of comparison and or adjustment can be used, including, for example, logarithmic functions.
- Logarithmic functions can provide an asymptotic relationship between the adjusted bid and the target bid, thereby inhibiting the adjustment of the target bid beyond the asymptote specified by the function.
- a target bid can be adjusted.
- the target bid can be adjusted, for example, by a bid adjustment component (e.g., bid adjustment component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- the adjustment ratio can be used to adjust the target bid specified by the advertiser.
- the adjustment ratio can be multiplied by the target bid to identify an adjusted bid.
- the adjusted bid can be throttled to reduce the average price paid by the advertiser for placement of the advertisement.
- the bid adjustment system can continue to bias the placements in favor of more favorable placements by applying a discount to all adjusted bids, rather than only those adjusted bids which exceed the target bid, or some other mechanism.
- the adjusted bid is submitted to an auction.
- the adjusted bid can be submitted to an auction, for example, by a bid adjustment component (e.g., bid adjustment component 220 of FIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an auction component (e.g., auction component 230 of FIG. 2 ).
- the auction component can determine whether or not the advertisement qualifies for placement based upon the adjusted bid. If an advertisement qualifies for placement, the advertisement can be communicated to the publisher or search engine through an ad server interface.
- the predicted performance metric can be replaced by past performance. For example, if tracking data indicates that an advertisement, on average, has a conversion rate of 5%, the baseline predicted performance metric can be identified as 5%. Similarly, if the tracking data indicates that the advertisement has previously had an 8% conversion rate in this particular slot (or in similar slots on similar properties), an adjustment ratio of 1.6 can be derived.

Abstract
Description
Where pCVRn corresponds to the predicted conversion rate for the nth member of the control set, and N corresponds to the cardinality of the control set. Thus, for example, if the control set covers three auctions {A1, A2, A3}, the predicted performance metric is predicted conversion rate, and the pCVR for A1 is 30%, the pCVR for A2 is 5%, and the pCVR for A3 is 10%, the baseline predicted performance metric can be identified as 15% ((pCVRA1+pCVRA2+pCVRA3)/3=(30%+5%+10%)/3=15%). In those examples using a different predicted performance metric, the predicted conversion rate can be replaced by the appropriate predicted performance metric.
Where pCVRcurrent is the predicted conversion rate for the current advertising slot, and pCVRbaseline is the an average predicted conversion rate for the advertisement over a control set. For example, if predicted conversion rate for a current advertising slot is 15% and a baseline predicted conversion rate for the current advertising slot is 10%, the adjustment ratio can be identified as 15%/10%, or 1.5. The adjustment ratio can be used to adjust the bid associated with the candidate advertisement. In some implementations, the bid can be multiplied by the adjustment ratio to derive an adjusted bid, which can be submitted to the impending auction.
