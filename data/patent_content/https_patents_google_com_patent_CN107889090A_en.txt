Inter-network shape network partition manages tune-up data
Fig. 9 illustrates the mesh network 100 when the segmentation or division of mesh network 100 have occurred and that.For example, router
One in 102 may lose electric power, cause the segmentation of mesh network 100, this hinder mesh network 100 a subregion or
Section is communicated with another subregion.On the other hand, radio interference may cause mesh network in mesh network 100
Communication is blocked in a part for 100 segmentation.When mesh network 100 is divided into two network segment 902 and 904, network segment 904
It will be that section 904 selects leader, and the tuner of the section 904 different from the tuner of section 902 can also be received.In these sections
Any one or two network credentials can be updated during segmentation.
Mesh network 100 can clearly and reliably be divided into the section of two fundamental differences, have when between two subregions
The section of two fundamental differences is fully functional network when having connectivity.Subregion can continue to be completely contained in continuous zoning
Any unfinished communication and it can continue to the rotation of normal key.Two mesh network subregion (originally single mesh networks
100 part) can independently it merge when the connectivity between two subregions is resumed.
If debugging certificate changes during segmentation in network segment 902, when in network segment 902 and network segment 904
Between when recovering connectivity, debugging certificate changes the device that will be transmitted in network segment 904.In other words, implement at some
In example, debugging certificate is updated to recently introduced certificate.However, if both network segment 902 and network segment 904 are to different
Tuner is authorized, and new and different debugging certificate is received during segmentation, then may be more difficult to determine recently
Certificate.
Debugging certificate will most in the solution by previous segment but between any two mesh network section that merges now
The device that the tune-up data collection closely changed is traveled in mesh network 100.Change if existed in section 902, user thinks
He or she is changing the debugging certificate on whole mesh network 100, but due to division, is only effectively changing in section 902
Certificate.Time point at some later, section 902 and section 904 merge.Because after the original certificate in section 904 is immediately following segmentation
Keep constant, and the certificate in section 902 is changed, so the section through merging assumes that new authentication is established in section 902 during segmentation
On.If the change to the debugging certificate in section 904 during segmentation be present, the change made to section 904 is transmitted to conjunction
And the device in section 902 afterwards.
In the case of the debugging certificate that two users change during segmentation in corresponding two sections 902 and 904, this two
Individual user respectively identifies oneself them and is changing debugging certificate on whole mesh network 100.However, the because quilt of mesh network 100
Segmentation, so can be established as Networked E-Journals by two users person itself and changing the card of the debugging on their corresponding network segments
Book.Time point at some later, section 902 and section 904 merge, but may be unaware which leader from two sections
The leader of the mesh network through merging will be surpassed.The leader surpassed may not have the pair of the debugging certificate changed recently
This.Because debugging certificate is changed independently in two sections, the section of the debugging certificate with recent renewal is preferential.
In order to determine which of two network credentials are nearest, tune-up data collection include timestamp information and for
Solves the debugging certificate of the difference between debugging certificate when mesh network merges.Timestamp information causes in mesh network 100
Node can determine the recent renewal to the debugging certificate in any section, and make the debugging in the device in mesh network 100
Data set and the debugging Cert sync of recent renewal.
Timestamp information includes timestamp and the timestamp is traceable to coordinated universal time (UTC) or mesh network
The instruction of relative time reference in 100.For example, if debugging apparatus 210 is such as to be able to access that network time (such as uses
NTP (NTP), the access to time for being provided by cellular network, from global positioning system (GPS) receiver
Timing information etc.) smart phone or computer device, then the timestamp be traceable to UTC.It is unrestricted as example,
Timestamp is traceable to UTC, and timestamp is in units of being traceable to the second in known epoch (for example, with certainlyTime starts
Since 2-15Second it is unit) express.When timestamp is UTC traceable times, instruction (such as U positions) is provided to indicate
The timestamp is traceable to UTC.
If debugging apparatus 210 is the embedded system that can not access the UTC traceable times of such as the machine tuner,
Then timestamp includes relative time values.Relative time values are the preceding values by using the timestamp such as provided by leader 216
And the increment of clock ticktack is added to previous time stamp and thinks that updated tune-up data collection generation time is stabbed to determine.Make
Unrestricted for example, it can be submicrosecond time ticking 15 derived from the 32kHz clocks of the machine tuner that the time is ticking
Represent.When timestamp is relative time, instruction (such as U positions) is set to the value of zero, to indicate that the timestamp is expressed as
Relative time.The increment of the timestamp of relative time allows the change to tune-up data to be detected.When subregion merges, if
It is relative time that one in debug time stamp, which is traceable to UTC and second, then the tune-up data with the traceable timestamps of UTC
Higher priority will be given.
If timestamp is identical between the debugging certificate individually updated during segmentation, alternative means can
With the connection being used between turn-off time stamp.In certain embodiments, can perform lexicographic compare (for example, memcmp) with
Determine which certificate be closer to.In some embodiments it is possible to priority ranking is carried out to network segment so that will be in the time
The change to the debugging certificate on a network segment is used in the case of connection between stamp.For example, there is border router 202
Network segment can be considered as limit priority section so that if network segment 902 and 904 is respectively received including identical time stamp
Debugging certificate change, then will use network segment 902 in the case of the same time timestamp value that the tune-up data of two sections is concentrated
Change in change.
