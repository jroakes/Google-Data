Definitions
- FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram of a computing environment 100 according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a buyer 102 , a seller 104 , and a broker 106 connected by a network 108 .
- the processor 202 may be any general-purpose processor such as an INTEL x86, SUN MICROSYSTEMS SPARC, or POWERPC compatible-CPU.
- the storage device 208 is, in one embodiment, a hard disk drive but can also be any other device capable of storing data, such as a writeable compact disk (CD) or DVD, or a solid-state memory device.
- the memory 206 may be, for example, firmware, read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), and/or RAM, and holds instructions and data used by the processor 202 .
- the pointing device 214 may be a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with the keyboard 210 to input data into the computer system 200 .
- the graphics adapter 212 displays images and other information on the display 218 .
- the network adapter 216 couples the computer system 200 to the network 108 .
- the pricing and payment rules 416 specify the fees associated with accessing the content from the seller 104 .
- the fees can be based on a frequency of access, based on a time period of access, based on the types and/or amount of content accessed, and/or any other factors.
- the pricing rules 416 can specify that a buyer is charged 0.1 cent per access to a particular piece of content.
- the pricing rules 416 can specify that a buyer is charged $5/week to access all content from the seller 104 .
- Those of skill in the art will recognize that many variations of pricing are possible.
- the broker 106 includes a content indexing module 428 that indexes the content available from the sellers 104 .
- the content indexing module 428 uses the authorization and/or authentication information provided by the sellers 104 to log into the sellers and access the content available there.
- the content indexing module 428 indexes the content by keyword and/or other criteria that allow the content to be quickly identified and/or retrieved in response to a query for which the content is responsive.
- a crawler module 430 within the content indexing module 428 methodologically identifies the content at the seller 104 by following links within the content to other content that in turn has additional links. By following the links, the crawler module 430 can identify all (or at least the linked-to subset) of the content available from the seller 104 .
- the broker 106 includes a content proxy module for delivering content to the buyers 102 .
- the content proxy module 436 evaluates the information and rules in the buyer access module 420 to determine whether the buyer is entitled to receive the content. If the buyer 102 is entitled to receive the content, the content proxy module 436 provides the content to the buyer.
- the broker 106 includes a refund module 442 that allows buyers 102 to obtain refunds for content they have purchased.
- the refund module 442 includes logic specifying if and/or when a buyer 102 is entitled to a refund.
- the logic can specify that refunds are not available for certain content, that refunds are available within a certain time period of purchase, refunds are available before the occurrence of a certain event (e.g., before the buyer's credit card is charged) etc.
- the logic within the refund module 442 is determined by the content rules in the content rules module 412 .
- the refund logic is set by the broker 106 .
