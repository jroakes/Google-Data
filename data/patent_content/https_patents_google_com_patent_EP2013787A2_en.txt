- the term “subscribed link” is used to refer to a mechanism by which the user can indicate that he or she is interested in receiving a particular category of search results.
- the category of search results is usually based on some query pattern, as described in more detail below.
- the term “subscribed” refers to the fact that the user can freely opt in or out of the search results category, in effect turning on or off the subscription.
- the search results category can be provided to all users.
- the search results category can be provided to some users based on some criteria (such as browser platform, OS platform, geographical location, search history, demographics, website visitation history, or the like).
- those users for which the criteria apply can be auto-subscribed to certain links.
- users are free to opt out after they have been auto- subscribed; in other embodiments, they may not have the freedom to do so.
- the term "specialized result" refers to any result that is generated by the patterned query/ response mechanism described herein, whether or not the initiating link is a subscribed link.
- FIG. 7 there is shown an example of a system 700 for practicing the present invention.
- One skilled in the art will recognize that the architecture shown in Fig. 7 and described herein is presented for illustrative purposes only, and that the present invention can be practiced with other architectures as well.
- FIG. 8 there is shown an example of a method for practicing the present invention according to one embodiment.
- the present invention is implemented using a data server or collection of data servers 701. These servers store knowledge base data and query/ result specification files submitted by various content providers. The format and function of these specification files are described in further detail below.
- client 750 Using client 750, a logged-in user enters 802 a query at a search website
- the user's query 703 is sent 803 to a front-end server 704.
- the front-end server 704 passes 804 the request 815 to one or more trust servers 705, which perform the following steps:
- the trust server 705 retrieves 805 a list 706 of the content providers which the user "trusts" enough that specialized results from them should be presented to the user. This includes all explicit, direct subscription decisions the user has made. In one embodiment, it may also include indirect trust relations and/ or experimental recommendations. List 706 includes provider feed URLs so that the data for subscribed links can be obtained from the appropriate source. [0029] For each provider in the list 706, the trust server 705 sends 806 a request 707 to the appropriate data server 701 to get specialized results for that content provider for the query 703. Data servers 701 can be sharded according to well known techniques.
- Specialized results 708 are returned 807 to trust server 705, which renders 808 the results in an HTML form and sends the HTML-rendered results 709 to front-end server 704.
- this rendering is performed by a component external to trust server 705.
- the rendering may be performed by a Tenderer (not shown) implemented as a library linked into the trust server 705; alternatively, it can be implemented as a call-out to a server, such as for example a Google Gadgets server, in order to support close integration with an API such as the Google Gadgets API.
- the Tenderer handles decisions such as, for example, what to display if the total number of specialized results 708 returned is too large to fit them all in the available display space.
- the results need not be formatted in HTML, but that any other format can be used.
- the rendered results 709 are provided to the front-end server 704, they are relayed 809 to search site 702 for drop-in display by search site 702 (possibly along with other search results).
- Search site 702 generates 810 a results page and transmits it to a browser running at the client 750.
- the client browser displays 811 the results for the user.
- the specialized rendered results 709 can be displayed in a visually distinct manner (such as within a shaded box) so as to distinguish them from ordinary search results; alternatively, no special visual distinction can be made.
- Each individual data server 701 when it receives a call to provide specialized results for a given query and provider, processes the query according to the list of specialized results for that provider, extract appropriate knowledge base elements.
- the data server 701 formats the results according to the output templates specified by the provider.
- the subscriber/ provider server 710 allows users to subscribe to and unsubscribe from specialized results offered by particular content providers, and also allows providers to upload the locations of XML files defining their specialized results.
- Feed crawl server 711 handles loading of actual XML data files from content providers' websites, based on a list 712 of provider feed URLs received from subscriber/ provider server 710.
- the feed crawl server 711 converts XML into an internal protobuffer format used by the data servers 701.
- the feed crawl server 711 validates the data and sends updates 713 to data server 701 shards when the data changes.
- Load requests 720 are generated when a data server 701 receives a request for subscribed links from a provider it does not have in its memory.
- the data server 701 sends the load request 720 to the feed crawl server 711 so that the feed crawl server 711 will fetch the data for that provider.
- each data server 701 supports the following operations:
- [0037] Process a query for a given set of providers, retrieving all specialized results that match the query.
- [0038] Update data by reading the latest specifications and/ or knowledge base data for a provider from the feed crawl server 711 or a local data file, and optionally add and/ or delete some specified objects.
- the front-end server 704 has the following responsibilities with respect to the data server 701 shards it controls:
- [0040] Keep track of the per-provider sharding and forward specialized data requests on to the appropriate data server 701 shards when a user makes a query. [0041] - Forward update data requests to the appropriate data server 701 shards when a provider modifies specifications or knowledge base data. [0042] - Search site 702 receives 801 a query from a user.
- API for Generating and Displaying Specialized Search Results the present invention is implemented as an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows third parties to specify parameters for displaying specialized information in response to particular queries.
- the parameters may be provided, for example, in the form of an XML file.
- the content provider defines one or more ResultS- pecs tags.
- a ResultSpec tag contains a Query tag and a Response tag.
- the Query tag provides a general trigger pattern of queries that will cause the content provider's results to be obtained and displayed.
- the Response tag provides a template for the display of the content provider's results when the trigger pattern is satisfied.
- the ResultSpec tag can also have an id attribute to uniquely identify the ResultSpec. In one embodiment, every ResultSpec has an id attribute. [0047] For example, the following specification would display a "Hello
- the ResultSpec tag has an id of InfoMatch.
- the Query tag specifies that the result will display in response to one specific query, namely "subscribed links". On any other query, the result will not display.
- Each Output tag has a name attribute that specifies the place where that particular part of the output will appear in the displayed result.
- the output named title will be the anchor text for a title link; the more uri output gives the URL which that link points to; and the texti , te ⁇ t2 , te ⁇ t3 outputs define three lines of body text.
- the specialized search result 102 is shown in a highlighted box 103 which distinguishes specialized result 102 from other results 106.
- the words "Subscribed Link" 101 in the upper right corner of the result 102 indicate that users must subscribe in order to see this specialized result 102. In one embodiment, a user must subscribe in order to indicate that he or she would like that content provider's specialized results to appear on his or her result pages; in another embodiment, there is no requirement for the user to subscribe.
- Edit link 104 allows the user to edit his or her list of subscribed links.
- Remove link 105 allows the user to remove the subscribed link that produced specialized result 102.
- Fig. 9 there is shown a flowchart depicting an example of the user's experience in interacting with the system of the present invention according to one embodiment.
- the user configures search results to include specialized results as follows. First, the user signs on 901 with a login and password, so that he or she can be identified. In one embodiment, cookies can be used to store login information (including password if desired) on the user's machine so that manual login is not needed for each session. The user then visits 902 a web page that includes a directory of "subscribed links" that users can add to their search results. The user selects 903 an entry in the directory (by clicking on it) to subscribe to one of the subscribed links.
- users can be automatically subscribed to certain subscribed links (categories of query results) based on any desired criteria.
- the user is taken 904 to a profile page.
- he or she can specify 905 additional parameters and options, and can confirm that he or she wants to subscribe.
- the Query item in the XML file defines the set of queries for which the specialized results will appear.
- the pattern is very restrictive: it will only trigger on a single particular query.
- the content provider could write a separate ResultSpec for each individual query that is to trigger a specialized result.
- the content provider can use types in the Query item and attributes in constructing the corresponding Response. The types refer to DataObjects, which are discussed below.
- DataObjects in the Query are denoted by type names enclosed in brackets.
- type names are case-sensitive.
- the content provider can refer to attributes of the extracted DataObjects, which are numbered starting from 0. These attribute references are also enclosed in brackets and are also case-sensitive.
- the type attribute is the type used in brackets in the Query field of the ResultSpec.
- Every DataObject has at least one QueryName; the more QueryNames a DataObject has, the more alternative ways there are to refer to it in queries.
- Attribute names include fuiiname, abbrev, and ma ⁇ _speed_iimit, all used in the Response from the example above.
- the DataObject is uniquely identified by its id attribute.
- every DataObject and every ResultSpec has its own unique id.
- the specialized search result 102 is shown in response to query 107.
- a result similar to Fig. 2 will be shown when the user searches on either "speed limit on 101" or "speed limit on US 101", because both of "101" and "US 101" will match the Highway object that was defined.
- the content provider can define more DataObjects of type Highway, and does not have to add anything more to the ResultSpec.
- the specialized result 102 in Fig. 2 is generated as follows. Query 107
- the content provider adds a top-level Results tag.
- the content provider can also add an Author info tag giving some information about the author of the specification or of the content provider.
- the following is an example of a complete file:
- a standard result format includes a title link and up to three lines of body text.
- all HTML tags in the Output specification are automatically formatted accordingly.
- output lines exceeding a character length limit are automatically clipped.
- the content provider can also include additional links in the body of the result, if desired.
- the content provider can specify a link for each line by adding more Outputs to the Response.
- the names of the Outputs are linki , iink2 , iink3 (for the links' anchor text) and urii , uri2 , uri3 (for the links' URLs).
- the number 1, 2, or 3 controls which line of the body text the link(s) will appear on. For example, to provide just one link in the body, but on the third line, then the Output names associated with that link should be iink3 , uri3.
- the content provider can specify links for some of the lines, leave some plaintext-only, or omit the plaintext entirely from a line leaving only the link. [0069] By default the body links will appear to the left of the text on each line.
- the content provider can set the format attribute of the Response tag to answer_right. So for example:
- Subscribed Links the form actually allows the content provider to specify more than one URL. If more than one is specified, the Subscribed Links will trigger based on the combined data from all the specified URLs. This can be useful, for example, if it desired to reuse lists of DataObjects created by others.
- the first file can be made publicly available so that other content providers can use the existing list of DataObjects of type Highway. Using brackets and backslashes
- bracket characters [] are used to set off types of extracted elements in Queries and attributes of extracted elements in Responses. If the content provider wishes to include these characters in the output or Query pattern, he or she can do so by prefixing the character with ⁇ (backslash). Special Object Types
- a number of common object types are available for use in Query patterns. By using one of these object types, the content provider avoids the need to provide his or her own DataObjects. Examples of such common object types include, without limitation: [0076] Cities. The element specification [City] will match names of cities and towns in North America, given by city name with state or (for larger cities) by city name alone. So for example:
- fuiiname the fullname of the city, with state/ province; e.g. "San Francisco, California"
- zipcode a zipcode in the city.
- Regular expression matches In one embodiment, the system of the present invention supports Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCREs) according to a standard format.
- the content provider can specify a regular expression to match in a query by prefixing it with "RE:”.
- the attributes of the resultant object are the match groups of the regular expression; they are named "grO", "grl”, and so on. So for example:
- Fig. 4 there is shown an example of a results screen 300 including a specialized search result 102 generated based on a regular expression, wherein query 107 matched the regular expression.
- Dates The element types "date”, “timeofday”, and “timerange” will match, respectively, dates, times of day, and time ranges in US-English format. So for example:
- the content provider may specify additional elements to be obtained, given those already found.
- the content provider adds an Extract tag to the ResultSpec that gives type name and an extraction specification.
- the extraction specification uses attributes of already-extracted elements in the same way that a Response does to construct a string, and then matches that string against the QueryNames of objects of the given type.
- the content provider can include as many additional extracted objects as he or she wishes, and each one can use the attributes of all previous ones in constructing its extraction specification.
- a Validate tag works much like an Extract tag: it uses two strings, the source and destination, which are populated using attributes of extracted elements. These two strings are then compared and the Response will display only if they are equal. [0090] For example:
- Attribute of a DataObject be, not a string literal, but a reference to another DataOb- ject.
- the content provider can specify this by setting the Attribute's value equal to the ID of the DataObject to be referred to, and using multilevel attribute references (multiple attribute names separated by periods) in the Response accordingly. For example:
- the present invention is also able to analyze query
- the 107 and suggest alternative queries to the user. This can be implemented, for example, by comparing the entered query 107 with an index of results terms and selecting likely alternative query forms that (a) are similar to the entered query 107 and (b) would yield higher numbers of results if entered.
- the alternative queries are presented as a clickable link that the user can activate if he or she is not satisfied with the displayed specialized links and regular links.
- users can be automatically subscribed to a search results category based on some criteria (such as browser platform, OS platform, geographical location, search history, demographics, website visitation history, or the like).
- criteria such as browser platform, OS platform, geographical location, search history, demographics, website visitation history, or the like.
- those users for which the criteria apply can be auto-subscribed to certain links. For example, a user who tends to search for information at automotive sites can be automatically subscribed to a search results category related to automobiles.
- users are free to opt out after they have been auto- subscribed; in other embodiments, they may not have the freedom to do so. Testing and Troubleshooting Subscribed Links
- the result specified by this ResultSpec will display when a specific user (such as the content provider him or herself) logs in to his or her Google Account and does a search matching the Query, but not when any other user who has added that content provider's Subscribed Links does searches. [0099] In one embodiment, to ensure fairness, any given ResultSpec is only allowed a certain fixed amount of calculation time per query. Specification language
- the present invention is implemented using a number of datacenters.
- Each datacenter has a full complement of servers including data server 701 shards, supporting front-end servers 704 and Prose trust servers, at least one feed crawler, and at least one front end server.
- Latency penalty is controlled by sending queries for specialized results at the very beginning of the query cycle, even before spell correction and query rewriting, since only the raw query is required.
- sharding of specialized data is performed by content provider, since each content provider has a distinct set of knowledge base data that to be accessed when matching queries for that provider's specialized results.
- Two sets of data server 701 shards are provided: one for specialized results provided by the operator of the system or by trusted third parties, and the other for general, untrusted content providers.
- Sharding is distinct from replication here; each shard, handling a certain set of providers, is replicated at least twofold for load-balancing and fault-tolerance purposes; and trusted shards may need a different (presumably higher) degree of replication than untrusted shards.
- Assigning a content provider can be done simply by modding the provider's ID by the number of shards of its type (trusted or untrusted). This should work fine going forward for untrusted providers, as random distribution of IDs will ensure a good "spread" of providers across shards, and each provider's data size will be limited.
- special sharding rules are implemented, as some providers may need to submit so much data that they will crowd other providers out of their shards.
- multiple provider IDs are provided for some providers whose data sizes are so large as to require them to be split across multiple machines.
- old provider data from memory is deleted in order to fit in new data in response to queries; shards flush providers from memory on a least-recently-used basis.
- the system may stop allowing new untrusted providers until more machines are available.
- a request for specialized results consists of a query 107 and a set of content providers. For each content provider listed, the query is matched against all trigger patterns for that content provider. For this purpose a structure is maintained called a OneboxSet for each content provider.
- the system makes reference to the knowledge base objects that content provider has defined; thus the knowledge base structure (called a KB) is divided into KBSegments, each KBSegment representing the objects defined by one content provider.
- ObjectMatcher corresponds to a particular type of conceptual object; its Match routine decides whether a given string has a prefix matching an object of that type, and if so, outputs a MatchedObject.
- MatchedObjects are essentially attribute name-value maps; to use an attribute of an object in constructing the results of a triggering query, MatchedObject::GetAttribute is called.
- LiteralKeywordMatcher checks that a string has a prefix literally equal to some given keyword or keyphrase.
- the one likely to be most commonly used is KBObjectMatcher, which operates by looking up tokenized prefixes of a query in a hash table of knowledge base objects. Special-purpose matchers are provided for regular expressions and for dates and times.
- a hash table is created for each provide.
- the keys of the hash table are the literal prefixes of the corresponding trigger patterns. For example, for the trigger pattern "flights from [City] to [City]", the literal prefix is "flights from”. Then, when matching a query against a provider's set of trigger patterns, the system of the present invention considers those whose literal prefix matches a prefix of the query. Accessing the feed crawl server 711
- the feed crawl server 711 uses a standard web crawling mechanism to crawl the XML files that content providers specify as the locations of their data; parse these files; and if the parse is successful, place the resulting data in its in-memory LRU (least-recently-used) cache.
- the feed crawler gets its crawling jobs in three ways. First, when a data server 701 shard receives a GetProseOneboxes request demanding data from a content provider it does not have in its memory, it issues a load request. Second, when a provider submits a new XML file location for specialized data, the feed crawler reloads that provider's data into its in-memory cache. Third, the feed crawler periodically polls providers' XML files for updates, broadcasting UpdateOneboxData requests when it detects new data; the polling schedule is determined by how often the provider has gotten into the cache previously.
- the data server 701 shards function as a first-level cache, and the feed crawler's memory as a second-level cache, for the data ultimately stored on the content providers' websites in XML format.
- a query to a data server 701 shard will only return specialized results if the specialized data for the specified content provider is in the data server 701 shard's memory at the time of the query.
- the data server 701 issues a load request for content provider data it does not have, it will not wait for the load to happen before trying to return specialized results for the query that provoked the load request.
- a user may occasionally fail to get specialized results if he or she happens to be the first person to submit a query.
- the present invention is implemented in such a manner as to counter certain security threats. Examples of such threats include::
- the system of the present invention escapes all output strings from untrusted providers completely. Lengths of output strings are limited, so as to prevent excessive space consumption on the page as well as overflow attacks. These limitations may be relaxed or eliminated for more trusted providers, as long as they go through a review process in which their initial specifications and data are scrutinized.
- the data server 701 shards are subject to timeouts: after a certain number of milliseconds processing a given query, a shard will just stop and return whatever results it has for that query. Likewise, after a certain number of milliseconds waiting for data server 701 shards to return results from a GetProseOneboxes request, the front-end server 704 simply aggregates whatever results it has gotten so far and passes these back to the requester.
- a sharding policy is put into place as described above, to ensure that specialized results which have been promoted to show all users, or which come from more highly trusted providers, are on separate shards from those carrying completely untrusted providers' data. In this manner, their processing times for trusted providers are not affected by possible bad behavior of untrusted providers. Also, in one embodiment, if queries to a provider's data time out too often, that provider is deactivated for at least some period of time so as to allow other providers' data to trigger. Also, in one embodiment, fairness policies are enforced on the feed crawler end so that no one provider can take up too much update traffic. [0119] As to issue (3), in one embodiment content providers can track most subscriptions to their specialized search results.
- a further line of defense against all issues above is that all untrusted content provider search results can be set up as opt-in. Users take positive action to subscribe to them, i.e. trust their providers, before they can be displayed. Furthermore, users can easily unsubscribe from content providers they find give them bad results, and can report spam, deception, copyright violations, and the like.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored on a computer readable medium that can be accessed by the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
