Definitions
- This specification relates to presenting data with search results.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, such as image files, audio files, video files, and web pages.
- a search system can identif resources in response to queries submitted by users and provide information about the resources in a manner that is useful to the users. The users then navigate through (e.g., click on) the search results to acquire information of interest to the users.
- Users of search systems are often searching for information regarding a specific entity. For example, users may want to learn about a singer that they just heard on the radio.
- the user would initiate a search for the singer and select from a list of search results determined to be relevant to the singer.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of obtaining search results that are responsive to a received query; identifying a factual entit referenced by the query;
- identifying content for display in a knowledge panel for the factual entity the content including at least one content item obtained from a first resource and at least one second content item obtained from a second resource different than the first resource; and providing data that causes the identified search results and the knowledge panel to be presented on a search results page, the knowledge panel presenting the identified content in a knowledge panel area along side at least a portion of the search results.
- the content can include at least two of an image for the factual entity, a title for the factual entity, or a fact regarding the factual entity.
- the knowledge panel area can consume a larger area than each of the search resul ts.
- identifying content for display in the knowledge panel for the factual entity can include selecting the content for the knowledge panel based on a ranking of content for the factual entity, the ranking being based on user search events related to the factual entity.
- the knowledge panel can include an interactive user interface object. Aspects can further include receiving information specifying an interaction with the interactive user interface object and providing data that causes additional content to be presented within the knowledge panel. The additional content can be selected based on the interaction.
- aspects can further include determining that the received query is associated with multiple distinct meanings and identifying content related to each of the distinct meanings.
- the knowledge panel can include content for two or more of the distinct meanings.
- aspects can further include identifying a type of entity for the factual entity
- Identifying content for display in the knowledge panel for the factual entity can include identifying types of content items specified by the knowledge panel template.
- the factual entity can include a person.
- the knowledge panel can include a placeholder for each of an image of the person, a description of the person, and at least one fact about the person.
- the factual entity can include a place.
- the knowledge panel can include a placeholder for each of an image depicting a map associated with the place, a description of the place, and at least one fact about the place.
- a knowledge panel is presented with search results (or other pages) to provide data regarding particular entities that have been identified as relevant to a search query. Presenting the knowledge panel with the search results reduces the number of web pages users hav e to vi sit in order to obtain factual informa tion for which the users are searching, thereby reducing the time required for the users to find information that satisfies their informational needs.
- Knowledge panel templates developed for particular types of entities enable content relevant to the entities to be displayed to users.
- Knowledge panels can improve users' search experiences, in particular for queries directed to learning, browsing, or discover ⁇ ' .
- the knowledge panel supplies users with basic factual information or a summary of information about a particular entity referenced in a search query.
- Knowledge panels can assist users in navigating to related content in a seamless and natural way.
- Knowledge panels can supply new content that may not otherwise be encountered by a user without selecting several search results.
- Knowledge panels can also help users obtain information faster than they would if the users were required to click through multiple search results to obtain the information.

- a system can provide one or more knowledge panels in response to a received search query
- a knowledge panel is a user interface element that provides information or other content related to a particular entity referenced by a search query, such as a person, place, country, landmark, animal, historical event, organization, business, sports team, sporting event, movie, song, album, game, work of art, or any other entity.
- a knowledge panel provides a summary of information for the entity.
- a knowledge panel for a singer may include the name of the singer, an image of the singer, a description of the singer, one or more facts about the singer, and content that identifies songs and albums recorded by the singer. Other types of information and content can also be presented in the knowledge panel.
- the content of a knowledge panel may include content published or otherwise provided by multiple resources, such as multiple web pages.
- a knowledge panel for a landmark may include an image of the landmark that has been published on a first web page that is hosted by a first publisher.
- the knowledge panel may also include a set of facts about the landmark that have been published on a second web page published by a second publisher different from the first publisher.
- a knowledge panel may be presented inline or adjacent to other search results for a received query or in place of the other search results. For example, standard search results that provide a link to resources deemed to he responsive to the search query may be presented on one side of a search results page and a knowledge panel may be presented on the other side of the search results page.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a search system 120 provides search services.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102, e.g., a local area network (L AN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them, connects web sites 104, user devices 106, and the search system 120.
- the network 102 can be accessed over a wired and/or a wireless communications link.
- mobile computing devices such as smartphones can utilize a cellular network to access the network.
- the environment 100 may include millions of web sites 104 and user devices 106.
- a web site 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, e.g., scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each web site 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web site.
- a resource 105 is data provided over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address, e.g., a uniform resource locator.
- Resources 105 that can be provided by a web site 104 include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few .
- the resources 105 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds and may include embedded information, e.g., meta information and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions, e.g., scripts.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102.
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile computing devices, e.g., smartphones and/or tablet computing devices, that can send and receive data over the network 102.
- mobile computing device refers to a user device that is configured to communicate over a mobile communications network.
- a smartphone i.e., a phone that is enabled to communicate over the Internet
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
- the search system 120 identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided on web sites 104. Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 are stored in a search index 122,
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 109 to the search system 120.
- the search system 120 accesses the search index 122 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to, e.g., have at least a minimum specified relevance score for, the search query 109.
- the search system 120 identifies the resources 105, generates search results 111 that identify the resources 105, and returns the search results 1 1 1 to the user devices 106.
- a search result 111 is data generated by the search system 120 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource 105.
- An example search result 111 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extrac ted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Data for the search queries 109 submitted during user sessions are stored in a data store, such as the historical data store 124.
- the search system 110 can store received search queries in the historical data store 124.
- Selection data specifying actions taken in response to search results 111 provided in response to each search query 109 are also stored in the historical data store 124, for example, by the search system 120. These actions can include whether a search result 111 was selected (e.g., clicked or hovered over with a pointer).
- the selection data can also include, for each selection of a search result 1 1 1 , data identifying the search query 109 for which the search result 1 11 was provided.
- the example environment 100 also includes a knowledge panel apparatus 130 communicably coupled to the search system 120 (e.g., directly coupled or coupled over a network such as network 102).
- the search system 120 can interact with the knowledge panel apparatus 130 to determine whether to provide a knowledge panel 113 with search results 1 11 for a search quer 109. If it is determined that a knowledge panel 113 should be provided, the knowledge panel apparatus 130 can generate the knowledge panel 113 and provide the generated knowledge panel 113 to the search system 120, which in turn provides search results 111 and a knowledge panel 113 to the user device 106 that submitted the search query 109.
- a knowledge panel 113 is typically provided for queries that have been determined to reference a particular entity, such as a person, place, country, landmark, animal, historical event, organization, business, sports team, sporting event, movie, song, album, game, work of art, or any other entity.
- a knowledge panel 1 13 for a particular entity includes content related to the particular entity

- a knowledge panel 113 for a nation may include a map of the nation, the flag of the nation, the official language of the nation, and/or other facts and content related to the nation.
- a knowledge panel 113 is much larger and consumes more area of a search interface than standard search results 11 1.
- the knowledge panel 1 13 m ay span the length of three or more standard search results 111 to accommodate the content items in the knowledge panel 113 and to draw attention to the knowledge panel 113.
- a knowledge panel 1 13 is displayed in a knowledge panel area.
- the knowledge panel area may be presented with or alongside to a search results area that presents search results 1 1 1.
- the knowledge panel area consumes a larger area than the area consumed by two or more of the search results presented in the search results area.
- the knowledge panel apparatus 130 includes or is communicably coupled to one or more data storage units that include a content items store 132 and a knowledge panel templates store 134.
- the content items store 132 stores content items that can be inserted into a knowledge panel.
- the content items are discrete units of content and can be in the form of text, images, videos, graphics, audio, tables, or other types of content.
- the content items store 132 includes an index of entities and data identifying content items relevant to the entities.
- the index may include data identifying a title for an entity, one or more images relevant to the entity, a description of the entity, one or more facts about the entity, one or more videos relevant to the entity, upcoming events related to the entity, content from a social networking page associated with the entity, and other information or types or categories of content that have been deemed relevant to the entity.
- the content items for each entity can come from disparate sources and/or disparate publishers.
- content items for a particular entity can be obtained from several different web pages or other resources that are each hosted by different publishers.
- the content items for a particular actor may include images of the actor received from several different sources and these images can be included in the same knowledge panel that is provided in response to a query that references the particular actor.
- an image of a person may be obtained from an official site for the person, and a set of facts and/or description for the person may be obtained from an online encyclopedia.
- the knowledge panel apparatus 130 identifies content items for each of a set of entities by crawling the Internet for content related to the entity.
- the knowledge panel apparatus 130 can also determine which of the obtained content items to provide with a knowledge panel 113 for the entity. For example, some of the content items may be more relevant to the entity or more appropriate for the knowledge panel 113 than other content items. As an example, an image of a person's face may be more appropriate for a knowledge panel 113 than an image of the person taken from a long distance.
- the type or categories of content provided in a knowledge panel 1 13 may be determined based on the particular entity or the type of entity referenced by the knowledge panel 113.
- a knowledge panel 113 for a person may include an image of the person, facts about the person, and references to any public works produced by the person.
- a knowledge panel 113 for a landmark may include images of the landmark, facts about the landmark, and travel information, such as a map, for a person to travel to the landmark.
- the categories of content that are included in a knowledge panel 113 can also vary based on the particular entity. For example, a person that has acted in movies and that has also recorded one or more albums may include references to both types of works,
- a knowledge panel template may specify the content for a knowledge panel 113, as described in more detail below.
- each knowledge panel 113 can be configured to provide a recognizable and consistent user interface for users.
- each knowledge panel 113 can have one or more standard types of content items.
- the standard types of content items can include a title, an image, a description, and one or more facts about the entity for which the knowledge panel 113 is provided.
- the title for a knowledge panel 113 is the name of the entity or an alias of the entity.
- the title for a knowledge panel 1 13 provided for a person can be the name of the person.
- the title for a knowledge panel 113 provided for a country can be the name of the country.
- the title may also be different than the search query 109.
- a search query 109 may reference an alias or a shortened version of a celebrity's name, while the title for the knowledge panel 113 may include the celebrity's full legal name. In this way, the title provides confirmation of what the knowledge panel 1 13 references.
- the description for the knowledge panel 113 can provide an adequate explanation of what the entity is, such as a summary of the entity, without going into so much detail to distract from the search interface (or other page) in which the knowledge panel 113 is presented.
- Candidate descriptions can be obtained from a variety of places, such as prefixes of text from trusted encyclopedia articles or top ranking web pages.
- the image for a knowledge panel 1 13 can be an image representative of the entity for which the knowledge panel 1 13 is generated. This image may vary based on the type of entity and the entity itself. For example, an image for a country may include a map of the country, while an image for a person may include a representative image of the person.
- the image for a knowledge panel 1 13 may be selected by taking a top ranking image from search results for the entity of the knowledge panel 1 13. For example, a web search directed to images can be performed for an entity and the top ranking image may be selected for the search results for inclusion in knowledge panels 1 13 for the entity.
- the set of facts that are presented in a knowledge panel 1 13 may be determined based on the type of entity and/or the entity itself. For example, certain facts may be preferred for actors, and a different set of facts may be preferred for singers. Also, certain facts may be relevant to certain entities within an entity type, while not being relevant to other entities within the entity type. For example, a knowledge panel 113 for an actor that has won many awards may include a listing of the awards in the set of facts. However, a listing of awards may be omitted for an actor that has not yet won any awards.
- the set of facts that are presented for a particular entity may be based on previously received search queries 109 that referenced the particular entity. For example, if a significant number, e.g., at least a threshold number, of previously received search queries 109 have referenced a person's height, then the person's height may be included in the set of facts that are presented in a knowledge panel for that person.
- the facts for an entity can be ranked based on the number of the previously received search queries that have been deemed to be requesting information about the entity and that have been deemed to be requesting information about that fact.
- Each of the standard types of content items can consistently be located in a same portion of the knowledge panel 1 13 to provide a consistent user interface across knowledge panels 113 for different types of entities. For example, an image may be located near the top left corner of the knowledge panel 1 13 and die description and facts may be located to the right of the image. If a content item for one of the types of content items is not available for an entity , then that type of content item may be replaced with another type of content item. For example, if an entity does not have an available image, one or more facts may be presented in the knowledge panel in place of an image. Note that the standard types of content items referenced throughout this document are provided abo ve for purpose of example, and that other types of content items can be selected as standard content items.
- the knowledge panel templates store 134 stores knowledge panel templates that can be populated with content items to generate a knowledge panel 1 13.
- a knowledge panel template specifies types of content items to include in die knowledge panel 113 and includes placeholders for content items of the specified type.
- a knowledge panel template may include placeholders for a title, one or more images, a description, a set of facts, and/or other types of content items.
- the knowledge panel templates store 134 can include one or more templates for each of a set of entity types.

- a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PD A), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few.
- a portable storage device e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive
- devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include ail forms of noil- volatile memory, media and memory de vices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices;
- magnetic disks e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
- the processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web bro wser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user ca interact with an implementation of the subjec t matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network.
- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer- to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer- to-peer networks.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device), Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
- embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment, Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination, Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
