Description
Technical field
The embodiment consistent with principle of the present invention relates generally to query processing, more specifically, relates to search query refinement is provided.
Background technology
Although the late period sixties 20th century is traced back in the Internet, the individual calculates and the wide usability and the degree of recognition of the network interconnection have caused in the explosive increase of information sharing technical elements and unprecedented development.Particularly, WWW (" Web ") has made the accessibility generation great variety of worldwide audient to the unnumbered quantity of information of the electronic form stored, comprise written, oral (audio frequency) and visual (image and video) information, the both has filing and real-time form.In brief, Web provides desktop access to the unlimited in fact information bank of nearly all language in world wide to the user that each connected.
Search engine constantly increases and fast-developing along with Web uses, so that the user can find and retrieve relevant web content in mode effectively and timely.Along with the quantity and the type of web content constantly increases, the complexity and the accuracy of search engine also improve.Usually, search engine response makes great efforts to provide the result of E.B.B. in search inquiry.Yet, determine that quality is difficult, because the correlativity of the web content of being retrieved is intrinsic subjectivity and interest, knowledge and attitude that depend on the user.
The employed existing method of search engine be based on search query word with mate from the word of Web page index.More advanced method is for example used the importance of determining the web content retrieved based on the analysis of structure of hyperlinks.
Typical search query scenario (scenario) begins with the natural language problem of submitting to search engine or the independent word that is generally keyword form.Search engine contrast is used to describe potentially the data knowledge storehouse of the information characteristics of searchable web content and carries out search, and the identification candidate web pages.Search often can be returned thousands of and even millions of results, thereby most of search engine typically only carries out rank or scoring to most promising result's subclass.Then, usually best webpage is presented to the user with web content title, hyperlink and such as the form of other descriptive information of the text extract of choosing from webpage.
Provide the literal and implicit scope institute that the Search Results of high-quality may searched inquiry self complicated.The search inquiry of structure clumsy (poor-framed) may be ambiguous or too general or too detailed and can not produce response and high-quality Search Results.For example, the word in search inquiry may be ambiguous on the level of grammer or semanteme.But grammer is fuzzy may to be carelessness homonym and the result that causes has wherein specified to have identical pronunciation and may have identical spelling the wrong word of the implication different with this word physical meaning.For example, word " bear " can be represented maybe can refer to a kind of animal or not wear the clothes.Semantic ambiguity may be the result that unsuitable context causes.For example, word " jaguar " can refer to a version or a kind of car mark of a kind of animal, Macintosh operating system.Similarly, too general search terms causes excessively wide in range Search Results, and too narrow search terms causes Search Results excessively restriction and non-response.
Therefore, need a kind of method of offering suggestions for search query refinement, this method occurs in solution ambiguous or excessive general or excessively detailed in the search inquiry of suitable framework.Preferably, such method will provide the search inquiry of refining, when this search inquiry of refining is published, cause Search Results closely related with the actual subject that lies under the intention of initial search inquiry, and provide with notional independent and clearly implication be reflected as the suggestion of potential search terms.
Summary of the invention
According to an implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, a kind of method can comprise: the Query Information that identification comprises at least with formerly result data is relevant and the data query formerly of classification information; Determine whether Query Information is the synonym of classification information; And if determine that Query Information is the synonym of classification information, then in searching request subsequently, use this Query Information and classification information.
According to another implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, a kind of system can comprise: whether interior data query and the categorical data of Search Results is the synon device of classification to be used to determine to be included in formerly; And if determine that data query and categorical data are the classification synonyms, then be used for data query is incorporated into the device of the searching request subsequently that is associated with categorical data.
According to another implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, a kind of equipment can comprise: be used to discern the logic that comprises at least one inquiry of being associated with searching request formerly, history log data that classification is right; Be used to determine that the inquiry inquiry, classification centering is the logic of name query or classification inquiry; And when determining that inquiry is the classification inquiry, be used for determining whether inquiry is the synon logic of classification.
According to another implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, a kind of method can comprise: receive search inquiry from client; Come the recognition result classification based on the search inquiry that is received; The classification synonym of the classification as a result that identification is discerned; And based on classification as a result and the classification synonym execution result search discerned.

Be used to discern synon exemplary processes
Fig. 5 is the process flow diagram that is used to discern synon example procedure in the implementation consistent with principle of the present invention.As above-mentioned concise and to the point description, the user search queries that is received can comprise many words or phrase, and the part of these words or phrase may have based on the suitable many synonyms of the whole context of inquiry.For example, in an implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, the search inquiry that is received can relate to the search to the information of local enterprise or businessman.Typically, the search inquiry of this form comprises title and/or classification information.In addition, such search inquiry can also comprise the positional information of certain form, the geographic area of defining such as the predefined position that is associated with the user, by shown map or be included in positional information in the search inquiry self that is received.Although mainly described local search information, in other embodiment, can search for " document " or information other mark or that classified in a similar fashion at this.For example, product information or price search can cause retrieving or discern product based on predefined product category.
An accepted method carrying out Local Search is typically to come the information that can search for is tabulated and stored based on title, position and classification.In many examples, provide such information by the source of including such as local yellow pages or business listing register.Because the information of including can comprise the information (for example classification information) that is not from the enterprise name collection, so can carry out the search of enhancing.Regrettably, the classification information of being distributed may be restricted to a specific word or phrase or even several specific word or phrase.For example, possible all restaurants (eatery) are incorporated under " restaurant (restaurant) " classification, and search inquiry may comprise word " restaurant (diner) ".The pure grammer of use search inquiry is carried out association search and can not be recognized that in some instances " restaurant " is the suitable synonym in " restaurant ".Therefore, association search will not comprise restaurant category but will search for " restaurant " specially when carrying out search.
According to principle of the present invention, the search inquiry that can refine and be received by query refinement software 430 is to comprise based on enhancing or the additional classification of search inquiry/result combinations formerly.Turn to Fig. 5, can begin to handle (action 500) by identification " good " or relevant " tlv triple (triple) " from historical search and result's daily record.As used in this, term " tlv triple " can be defined as usually and comprise and represent the data of Query Result formerly.More specifically, " tlv triple " can comprise: 1.) query terms; 2.) result business name; And 3.) result business category.In addition, whether be that the definite of " good " can be based on any suitable factor about " tlv triple " discerned.
In an implementation consistent, " good " tlv triple is identified as the tlv triple that those receive predefined action thereon with principle of the present invention.For example, in an one exemplary embodiment, except that providing to client 210 information that comprises business listing, server 220-240 can also provide with each and include relevant additional information or function, includes linking of the website that is associated or the like such as the route guiding of driving, Email Links, sensing and this.In such implementation, good tlv triple can be identified as and include the tlv triple that is associated, described including relates to the predefined user action that client 210 sends to server 220-240.In a certain embodiments, user action can be the link of clicking the route guiding that is used to drive.
Should be noted that many including of storing may have a plurality of enterprise names and a plurality of classification associated therewith.Therefore, the route guiding of driving is clicked (or other " well " indicates) and can be drawn a plurality of inquiry-titles-classification tlv triple.For example, the inquiry that is received " bar (bar) " can be with specific " ' Joe ' s Bar and Grill (tall bar and barbecue) that includes " be complementary with two classifications: " bar (bar) " and " taverns (public house) ".In this example, can examine and know two independent inquiry-titles-classification tlv triple: 1.) (bar, ' Joe ' sBar and Grill, bars (bar, tall bar and barbecue, the bar)), and 2.) (bar, ' Joe ' s Bar and Grill, taverns (bar, tall bar and barbecue, the public house)).How suppose to exist good " tlv triple " of these two of including, problem then occurred the tlv triple counting.In an implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, each of above-mentioned tlv triple can be regarded as having 0.5 counting (rather than 1.0).Similarly, inquiry therein causes in the example of three tlv triple that are identified, and each tlv triple can be regarded as 0.333 counting.That is, the single weight (1.0) of including is distributed evenly in a plurality of tlv triple that are associated with it.By this way, the summation of whole data set (dataset) correctly is accumulated as the result who knows that examines.
In case recognize good tlv triple, the inquiry that is associated with this good tlv triple can be classified as " name query " or " classification inquiry " (action 502).As defined in this, " name query " comprises and the relevant query terms of enterprise name (for example " China Taste Buffet (Chinese local flavor buffet) "), and " classification inquiry " comprises and the relevant query terms of potential enterprise sort (for example " Chinese restaurant (Chinese style restaurant) ").By described two kinds of query types are distinguished, prevented that the classification of having discerned is assigned to the synonym of name query.
According to an implementation consistent, can make determining of name query/classification inquiry based on the degree of " title entropy (the name entropy) " that be associated with each inquiry of discerning or " name perplexity (nameperplexity) " with principle of the present invention.For this target, the name perplexity of each inquiry can be represented by following expression formula:
e
H (title | inquiry),
Wherein H (title | inquiry) is the conditional name entropy of enterprise name, the given inquiry of estimating from the result that selects action 500.The title entropy can be defined by following expression formula:
Wherein P (title | the inquiry) inquiry that has been given and the probability of the title returned.
In other words, can be based on determining that with the quantity of inquiring about paired enterprise name inquiry comprises the possibility of enterprise name.Those paired inquiries of few and enterprise name are regarded as classification and inquire about (for example lower name perplexity), and are regarded as having higher name perplexity with paired those inquiries of how different titles.Should be appreciated that the notion of introducing entropy is the weight that is used for illustrating between the frequent title of using and seldom using.
In case in action 500 and 502, determine respectively the inquiry discerned be good inquiry be again the classification inquiry, determine then whether classification as a result and the inquiry of being discerned should be regarded as synonym (action 504).For example, based on the definite of initial " well " of in action 500, including and moving the higher name perplexity discerned in 502 (promptly for the classification of inquiry-result _ title-as a result, many enterprise names can be paired with this inquiry), can determine that classification " Restaurants-Chinese (restaurant-China) " is the classification synonym of inquiry " Chinese Restaurants (Chinese style restaurant) ".Determine that if make this then the classification of being discerned can be designated as the classification synonym (action 504) of associated query terms, thereby guaranteeing that the search subsequently that is associated with this inquiry will additionally be called relates to such other search.
Regrettably, only check by moving 500 and 502 inquiries of transmitting the probability of query/category hyponym (hyponym) can not be described.Know as known, hyponym is the word that its implication is represented subordinate or subclass.For example, the Penances is American hyponym.Turn back to current problem, the inquiry of knowing " Chinese Restaurant " of examining can be the hyponym in classification " Restaurant (restaurant) ", because Chinese Restaurant is the subclass of classification " Restaurant ".Since the inquiry of back, classification to relate to comprise rather than of equal value (for example, Chinese Restaurant is a type of Restaurant, but its non-equivalence is in " Restaurant "), it should not be used as the synonym of classification " Restaurant ".
Fig. 6 be used for comprise and inquiry of equal value, classification between the process flow diagram of the exemplary processes distinguished.In order making containing type inquiry, refusal that classification is right to be become convenient, to have calculated for the inquiry of being discerned, F-that classification is right and measured (F-measure) (action 600).As defined in this, each right F-measures and can be defined as inquiring about, classification is to as hyponym or the right possibility of containing type, and described inquiry, classification are to being used as the synonym refusal.This kind calculating can be represented by following expression formula:
In above-mentioned expression formula, P (inquiry, classification) expression classification and both synon each other joint probabilities of inquiry.P (inquiry, classification) and P (classification, inquiry) value can get by following estimation: the counting that will be wherein be found in together and be proved to be the instance number that receives divided by desirable user action for the counting of the instance number of the classification of " well " and query terms by being associated with desirable user action (for example, the selection that the route guiding of driving is linked).
The value of P (inquiry) can be got by following estimation: will be wherein query terms cause the counting of the instance number that the counting of instance number of the execution of desirable user action receives divided by desirable user action.Similarly, the value of P (classification) can be got by following estimation: classification that will wherein be discerned causes the counting of the instance number that the counting of instance number of the execution of desirable user action receives divided by desirable user behavior.
In addition, P (inquiry | classification) can be defined as the probability of the inquiry of given classification and P (classification | inquiry), and wherein P (classification | inquiry) is the probability of the classification of given inquiry.It is defined as P (inquiry | classification)=P (inquiry, classification)/P (classification) and P (classification | inquiry)=P (inquiry, classification)/P (inquiry), and uses previously estimation partly to estimate.In the term of general statistics:
Yet, under the situation of inquiry and class probability, call rate (recall) and be P (classification | inquiry), accurate rate (precision) is P (inquiry | classification), and F-measures and equals P (inquiry, classification)/(a*P (classification))+(1-a) * P (inquiry)), subsequently above-mentioned definition being updated to general F-measures in the formula and simplifies.In this case, term " calls rate " and " accurate rate " tests about following retrieval: for given inquiry and classification, return as the response of this inquiry, with all results of that classification coupling.
By selection, can set up accurate rate and call suitable balance between the rate the value of constant " a ".Determined that value in about scope of 0.7 to 0.9 provides accurate rate and calls suitable compromise between the rate, be included in possibility in the classification synonym of being discerned accurately to eliminate or to reduce hyponym.In an exemplary implementation, the value of " a " is 0.85.
Measure in case determined selected inquiry, the F-that classification is right, then definite then F-that is calculated measures whether satisfy predefined standard (action 602).If satisfy, then being considered in the inquiry of inquiry, classification centering and classification is synonym (action 604).If do not satisfy, then described inquiry and classification are not considered synonym, and abandon considering to be somebody's turn to do to (action 606).
In an exemplary implementation, the F-standard of measurement can comprise and be used for determining to have those inquiries of higher or bigger F-measurement value, any suitable mode that classification is right for given inquiry.For example, for given inquiry, can determine only to have inquiry that the highest F-measures, classification to being considered synonym each other.Alternatively, for given inquiry, can be with the inquiry of predefined maximum quantity, classification to considered synonyms.In another implementation, can determine maximum F-measurement value, and for given inquiry, can will reach all inquiries, classification of the predetermined percentage (for example 50%) of this value to considered synonyms.In another implementation, can determine the F-measurement value of minimum essential requirement, and for given inquiry, can will meet or exceed those inquiries, classification of this value to being identified as synonym.
In another exemplary implementation, the F-measurement value can be with combined such as the other factors of name perplexity, classification complexity and enquiry frequency.For example, in order to be considered synonym, inquiry, classification are to being required to have at least 25 name perplexity, having at least 50 classification complexity, at least 1/1,000,000 enquiry frequency and must having not only greater than 0.03 but also greater than peaked 50% F-measurement value of measured F-measurement value.
After synonym is determined, determine whether then to continue to handle other inquiry, classification to (action 608).If continue, then process turns back to that next inquiry is handled in action 600, classification is right.If do not have other inquiry, classification to being continued to handle, then process stops.
In an implementation consistent with principle of the present invention, can synonym is one or more to being delivered to " device of labelling (labeller) ", be used for subsequently the synonym of being inferred being carried out manual review.By this way, can cover carry out actual user searches before examination otherwise can be by the inaccurate potentially synonym of aforesaid various tests.
Fig. 7 shows the process flow diagram of exemplary processes that is used to carry out the search that the user starts according to principle of the present invention.At first, under user's indication, receive search inquiry (action 700) from client 210.As mentioned above, according to principle of the present invention, in an exemplary implementation, search inquiry can comprise and location or the relevant many words of identification local business information.In alternative implementation, can be with location or the identification of search query to the information of other type, the information of described other type such as price fixing and descriptor, text message, medium (for example song, image, video or the like) information based on webpage.
No matter the type of institute's information requested how, the search engine 225 on server 220 can then be discerned the one or more classifications (action 702) that are associated with the institute information requested.The mode of wherein discerning initial category is outside scope of the present invention and will describe in detail at this.Yet,, can discern the definite classification synonym (action 704) of process that uses Fig. 5 and 6 with that in case discerned initial category.The classification synonym that uses query terms, the initial classification of determining or a plurality of classification and discern in the mode of above-mentioned detailed description, then then can generate Search Results (action 706) and can send it to client 210, be used for showing to sending requesting users at last.
In an exemplary implementation, except the query terms that is received, can use aforesaid mode and information is included in the classification synonym special search discerned.For example, can be to comprise the classification synonym of being discerned " physician-common practice " with search revision about " doctor ".In an implementation, can carry out logic to such word or (OR) computing.In the example that provides, consequent inquiry will comprise " doctor OREXACTCATEGORYMATCH (accurately classification coupling) (physician-common practice) ", and wherein EXACTCATEGORYMATCH guarantees each word of being included in the defined classification synonym finding in the classification of discerning in the information of including.By this way, avoided by the confusion that causes with the associated part classification of including coupling (for example physician-obstetrician).
By using historical search information to come infer category synonyms, can provide the Search Results of enhancing.More specifically, by the good Search Results of identification, accurately infer category synonyms from search formerly.Use the synonym of being inferred has increased provides possibility from desirable result to the user in the Search Results after being provided at.
