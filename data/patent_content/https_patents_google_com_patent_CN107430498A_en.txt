Exemplary method
Fig. 3 illustrates the first image that can be used for the given position to form combination picture.Ad-hoc location can be accessed
Image.The image can be inputted by user to be received or is retrieved from the storage system of such as storage system 150.Such image
Landscape, terrestrial reference, building, room or any other object can be included.For example, as figure 3 illustrates, ad-hoc location
Image 310 can include monument 312, river 314, horizon 316 and tree 318.Image can be associated with other information,
Image identifier, timestamp including shoot the attitude information of angle of the image, picture format (JPEG, TIFF etc.) and
Positional information.Positional information can include GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATION or latitude and longitude coordinates.
Image that is receiving or retrieving can be handled to identify visual signature in the picture.Vision is special
Sign can include the arrangement of line, shape, pattern etc. and those lines, shape and pattern in the images.Image can be with spy
The index of sign is associated, and the index of this feature is divided the visual signature in the image based on type in the picture and layout
Class.In the example of fig. 3, the edge and side, the path in river 314 of restriction monument 312 can be identified on image 310
Shape, the layout in horizon 316 and set 318 shape and texture visual signature.
By comparing the visual signature of the visual signature identified in the first image and the image of storage, can retrieve has
Multiple second images of visual field more broader than the first image.In this respect, can be by least one in the image of storage system 150
It is considered as panoramic picture.Image in storage system 150 can also be associated with information, such as positional information and visual signature
Index.The visual signature of panorama can be analyzed for the similitude of the visual signature with image.If storage system 150
The visual signature of given image matches to a certain extent with those visual signatures of the first image, then can be by the given image
It is included in multiple second images retrieved from storage system.
As shown in Fig. 4 A, 4B and 4C, from storage system 150 retrieve multiple panoramas 420,440 and 460 using as
For the second image of the first image 310, the plurality of panorama 420,440 and 460 also include monument, river, horizon and
The view of tree.Although panorama 420,440 and 460 includes the feature similar to image 310, they are really at many aspects
It is all different from image 310.One of them is except that panorama 420,440 and 460 is included in its broader visual field
Object not to be covered in the more narrow visual field of one image 310.For example, the tree 430 shown in panorama 420 and tree 432 are in image 310
In do not occur.Moreover, the posture and orientation of panorama 420,440 and 460 are different from the posture and orientation of the first image 310, so as to
Cause layout and the orientation of object also different.By way of example, the river 424 from panorama 420 is significantly approximately perpendicular to ground
Horizontal line 426, it is different from the river 314 on diagonal.
Positional information can be also used for by the selection of multiple second images narrow down to storage system with the first image
Image in certain geographic proximity of position.Can be with monumental position or neighbouring position to the He of the first image 310
Panorama 420,440 and 460 all carries out GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATION.Can be to visual signature come the selection to similar image based on position
Carried out before or after being compared.Thus, in this example, analysis based on positional information and to the feature in image
Combination, it can select and retrieve at least panorama 420,440 and 460 using the second image as the first image 310.
In addition or as an alternative, one or more index of visual signature can be used for comparing the first image and storage is
The image of system 150.Can be directed to key feature search index with retrieve the subset of the image of storage system for the first image
Compared in further detail.As another alternative, the certain number of pixel of the image of storage system can be retrieved,
The image of the pixel including storage system with the first image and the part matched close to surrounding.If for example, storage system
Given image is the panorama from specified point across 360 ° of visuals field, then can retrieve including with the specific pixel with the first images match
Centered on around 180 ° of pixel, rather than whole panorama.
Can be by the first image and each second image pair in multiple second images with visual signature similar enough
It is accurate.This can be by converting the first image with the visual signature of image visual signature phase corresponding with the second image
Match to realize.By way of example, shown in Fig. 5, the first image 310 has been placed in (here in order to clearly shown in broken lines)
In panorama 440 (the second image), visual signature is most as by the visual signature of the first image and panorama 440 in the panorama
It is aligned goodly.Monument, river and the tree of first image 310 are with the souvenir of some little deviations and difference substantially with panorama 440
Upright stone tablet, river and tree are overlapping.
Alignment can consist of：Translate the first image, the first image of rotation, the first image of scaling, the first figure of change
The focal length of picture, homography is applied to the first image, similarity transformation is performed to the first image, performs some its to the first image
Its 2D or 3D conversion or some combinations that these processes are carried out relative to the second image.3D conversion can be by by first
Image procossing is the 2D planes composition to float in the 3 d space, therefore can make scalloping in the 3 d space to be most preferably adapted to
The second image behind the image.First image is aligned to the mathematic(al) manipulation that can also include calculating image with the second image.
The calculating can repeatedly occur or occur by the stage, so as to improve the alignment by calculating each time.In other words, increment type
Conversion can become smaller by the iteration each time of calculating.Aligned instructions can be generated based on the conversion calculated.
, can be with for each smaller-larger image to (for example, each combination of the first image and corresponding second image)
Alignment score value is calculated based on the quality of alignment.If, should in some visual signature misregistrations of smaller-larger image pair
To alignment score value will be less than with smaller-larger image pair of visual signature being more closely aligned with.
As previously mentioned, the feature of misregistration is probably as caused by larger posture or orientation difference.For example,
Because relative to the layout in the river in panorama 420 and 460 with the significant difference of the first image 310, image 310 with it is complete
The alignment score value of alignment between scape 420 and 460 is likely lower than the alignment of the alignment between the first image 310 and panorama 440
Score value.If the alignment score value of smaller-larger image pair is all unsatisfactory for specific threshold, it is compound can to show that instruction can not create
The message of image.
If one or more alignment score value meet threshold value, can use with highest alignment score value it is smaller-compared with
Big image is to generating combination picture.Fig. 6 shows the example of final combination picture 600, wherein the first image 310 is in the second figure
As being in the aligned position in the first image in (being panorama 440 here).
One or more style options can be added to combination picture.Some examples of option include：Fusion first
Vertical throwing shade (drop shadow) on the second image of image and the second image including the first image, the first image will be surround
Framework or frame be included in the second image and by a certain degree of transparency added to the first image to cause the second figure
As in section below visible.As shown in fig. 6, frame is added to around the first image 310.In addition, fusion
First image and bigger image can include：Extract foreground object in the picture and melted by using any number of
These foreground objects are spliced in the bigger image by conjunction method.
In addition or as an alternative, combination picture can also include：On described position the fact, the fact is being clicked on
It is shown during the specific region of image；Or for the navigation feature in combination picture or adjacent intra-image navigation.
After combination picture is generated, the image of establishment can be sent to client computing device for showing or depositing
