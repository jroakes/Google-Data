Abstract
A motion manifold system analyzes a set of videos, thus identifying image patches within those videos corresponding to regions of interest and identifying patch trajectories by tracking the movement of the regions over time in the videos. Based on the patch identification and tracking, the system produces a motion manifold data structure that captures the way in which the same semantic region can have different visual representations over time. The motion manifold can then be applied to determine the semantic similarity between different patches, or between higher-level constructs such as images or video segments, including detecting semantic similarity between patches or other constructs that are visually dissimilar.

The video set 117 that video depots 116 content suppliers 130 submit to.Video depots 116 can comprise the video 117 of any number, such as ten hundreds of or hundreds of millions of.Each video in video 117 have make it be different from unique video identifier of each other video in other video, for example, such as any alternate manner of text title (, string " a91qrx8 "), integer or unique name video.Can with various containers (container), such as AVI, MP4 or MOV encapsulate video 117 and can use Video Codec, H.264 etc. such as MPEG-2, MPEG-4, video 117 is encoded.Except their audio-visual content, video 117 can also have has uploaded the associated metadata 117A that the content provider 130 of video provides, for example text meta-data, such as title, description and/or label.
Video share service 100 also comprises the content of analyzing in video 117 and creates the motion stream shape module 119 of motion stream graphic data structure, the mode that this motion stream graphic data structures capture identity logic object may visually change in time.More specifically, motion stream shape module 119 Span Continuous frame of video are followed the tracks of movement and the change of " segment ", " segment " be with picture frame in significant region semantically, such as entire object (for example, eyes) or view data corresponding to its indivedual somes point of canthus (for example).
For example, consider the video of people's face, this video illustrates people's eyes and mouth.The visual appearance of eyes and character can change in the process of video-frequency band, such as amplifying along with camera and dwindling and become slightly larger or less or from closure state (, eyelid covers eyes) change over open configuration, and the position of eyes may be shaken and change across picture frame along with camera.Therefore the region that, represents eyes not only may change position (for example,, because people rotates his or his head) and may change size (for example, due to people nictation).Similarly, the shape of mouth and size are along with people changes at any time speaking.With the segment of the view data that means eyes and mouth of zone association such as such, its size and position are tracked across frame.As another example, consider the video that cat jumps.Here same, the size and shape in the region associated with cat changes rapidly within the duration of video.It should be noted that segment need to be corresponding to inevitable discrete or complete object, such as segment can be only corresponding to the parts of face, cat etc., or can be corresponding to event, such as the blast in film video.
Across the time, the figure set of blocks of the tracking corresponding with identical semantic region is called as " track ".Fig. 2 diagram is for the concept of the time dependent track in region.Example video 117 comprises many frames 210, has described the subset of these frames in Fig. 2.Track 220 represents along with special object changes position, size and shape and shows the set of the logic region of this special object in the process of video-frequency band, and therefore can be visualized as the volume that there is spatial dimension (for example, profile) and there is time range in frame plane in the successive frame of some.Particularly, track comprises a plurality of segments corresponding with object, all ten segments as shown in Figure 2.In the 220A of segment shown in first, region is smaller, obviously wider and be arranged in the upper left side of its frame than its height.Along with video progress, by the 7th frame, segment 220B has become higher and has kept same widths and in its frame, than segment 220A, be positioned at more right side and some is lower.That segment 220C shown in last has become is even higher, therefore approach circular and more move down in frame.Should understand Fig. 2 completely for the object of example.As a rule, track will for example have the duration larger than ten frames.
Follow the tracks of to allow observe the different visual appearances that same object adopts in time, such as cat station with sit between the various positions, chameleon that adopt can employing when keeping static shades of colour or the various shapes of balloon shooting.Then the motion stream shape module 119 of Fig. 1 is divided into groups to visually similar segment and is formed the motion stream graphic data structure of catching the time transformation of observing.Therefore, motion is flowed shape and is represented for identity logic region, and how segment can change its outward appearance in time.Can be by different pieces of information structure, such as figure and/or the replacing representation of figure, such as matrix, represent motion stream shape.Then, can apply the Semantic Similarity of the more complicated image structure (such as complete image or video-frequency band) that motion stream shape quantizes each segment or comprise segment.
Although be depicted as the part of video share service 100 in Fig. 1, in certain embodiments, motion stream shape module 119 can be separated from video share service.For example, motion stream shape module 119 can be positioned at away from the place of video share service 100 and addressable via network 140, and can be by the different tissue manipulation of organizing from operation video share service.More generally, can be in any system of depots of video that storage is provided or for this System Implementation motion stream shape module 119.
Fig. 3 diagram is according to the various parts of the motion stream shape module 119 of an embodiment.In this embodiment, motion stream shape module 119 comprises that identification is by the graphic blocks identifying module 305 of each tracked segment.As noted above, segment represent video image, in interested region semantically.Graphic blocks identifying module 305 can with various algorithms of different identify with by segment corresponding to the various types of objects that are identified.
In certain embodiments, segment is corresponding to object logic as a whole, such as human eye.In such embodiments, by Object Segmentation technology, such as adaptive background subtraction, utilize the room and time of clustering algorithm to cut apart or other algorithm well known by persons skilled in the art carrys out the segment of identifying object.In one embodiment, use Mean-shift algorithm, this Mean-shift algorithm uses cluster in the single frame of video.Based in the cutting apart of Mean-shift algorithm, such as by each pixel transitions of image being become respective value, such as color value, Grad, texture measured value etc. convert frame to mark (token).Then window is positioned around data equably, and calculates barycenter for each window, i.e. the average position of the data value in this window, and each window is centered at around this point again.Repeat this process until window convergence finds local center.Then by converge to identical point window traversal data gathering together, thereby produce the set in separate picture region.
In other embodiments, segment is corresponding to the each point of larger object, such as the inner eye corner of eyes.Apply in certain embodiments such as the such technology of Harris's point of interest operator to find angle point and follow the tracks of them across frame in video.
Motion stream shape module 119 also comprises the characteristic extracting module 310 that characterizes the character pair set of this segment for the segment derivation of each identification.In one embodiment, feature is stored as the vector value of the visual appearance of describing segment.Visual appearance feature can for example comprise the feature using Gauss Laplce (LoG) or yardstick invariant features conversion (SIFT) feature extractor and sample, in hsv color space, use color harmony saturation degree and color histogram, motion rigidity characteristic, the textural characteristics calculating or the edge feature that uses the edge detecting by Canny edge detector.The visual signature of other type is by known to those skilled in the art and also can be used, such as the feature descriptor that comprises GLOH (gradient position and directed histogram), LESH (shape histogram based on local energy), HOG (directed histogram of gradients) or SURF (acceleration robust features) feature.
Motion stream shape module 119 also comprises the track identification module 315 of following the tracks of the different segments corresponding from each interested visual zone in various interested visual zone.(interested region is below called as " semantic region ".) for example, motion stream shape module 119 can be followed the tracks of the region of in video, people's eyes being described the whole continuous part (people is present in scene during this continuous part) of video in, thus identifying eyes wherein has different outward appearances, such as opening, closure or a plurality of regions of the different frame of closure etc. partly.By Span Continuous frame, follow the tracks of semantic region, track identification module 315 can determine that different visual appearances but represent identical semantic region.
If those skilled in the art are by known, can in different embodiment, realize and following the tracks of by different way.For example, can with track algorithm, such as profile via the density propagation algorithm of having ready conditions follow the tracks of, based on kernel to image tracing etc. follow the tracks of complex object, such as eyes.In addition, in certain embodiments, without carrying out and follow the tracks of across every frame, but in fact can (for example) according to fixed intervals, such as every five frames or the rate travel of observing based in given video and tracking is carried out at the interval of the variable frame length of dynamic calculation.
Track identification module 315 represents the track of identification by structure track depots 350, this track depots comprises tuple p=<r, v, t, l, the set of f>, the time dependent concrete segment p of these element group representations.In this embodiment, r represents the segment unique identifier of corresponding image-region with it, v presentation video region is present in the unique identifier of video wherein, the persond eixis that t is illustrated in the time being identified for corresponding region r segment in video v (for example accords with, the numbering of identification frames or At All Other Times unit), l represents that region in the residing frame corresponding with t of segment (for example, if region is a single point, be x, y coordinate, if or region means the 2 dimensional region of object, for definition, delimit two such coordinates of rectangle, or the pixel list (or quoting list) corresponding with the region of arbitrary shape in frame), and the eigenvector that f representation feature extraction module 310 extracts from segment.Each track has its unique identifier t-id.For specific region r
1concrete track then by the set expression of all segment tuples, r=r wherein
1.In addition, because each segment is corresponding to single track, so each segment p can also be associated with its corresponding track t-id.If those skilled in the art are by known, without using mode described above, but can in different embodiment, represent by different way track.
Particular track existed without the whole duration that is positioned at video wherein at it.For example, in the situation that track represents the eyes of particular person, track only exists for the continuous part of video, this people is shown during this continuous part in video and during this continuous part people's eyes visible.
Recognize that track depots 350 can be described in very a large amount of (for example, millions of) the different tracks that exist in different video and exist during the different part of those videos.
In one embodiment, motion stream shape module 119 also comprises figure creation module 320, and this figure creation module represents the data of track depots 350 with the form of dendrogram 361, and this dendrogram more explicitly is illustrated in the visual transition between the different segments of given trace.Each node in the drawings represents the cluster of similar features vector f, and each eigenvector is associated with indivedual segments.Figure creation module 320 used clustering algorithms, such as k mean cluster or the cluster based on being communicated with, according to visual similarity, the eigenvector f of segment is carried out to cluster.Each cluster is node in figure, the segment that therefore represents to have very similar outward appearance and regardless of the particular track under them.Therefore, a specific cluster can represent different tracks and region video, corresponding with the eyes that open from any number, and another cluster can represent same different tracks and region video, corresponding with closed eyes from any number.
Whether figure creation module 320 then identification jointly there are---the different visual state that represent identical semantic region---from the different segments of different cluster node and in Figure 36 1, forms limit between node to reflect those visual transition in same trajectories.For example, in one embodiment, the set of figure creation module 320 unique track t-id corresponding to segment in cluster associated with each cluster node.Then figure creation module checks each cluster c
iand for each associated track t-id
iidentify in its associated track set, also there is t-id
ieach other cluster c
j.Therefore, if the data in track depots 350 are indicated specific cluster c
1(corresponding to the eyes that open) and particular track t-id
1associated and different cluster c
2(corresponding to closed eyes) also with track t-id
1association, figure creation module 320 can be at cluster node c
1with c
2between create limit.In this example, the following fact is reflected on this limit:, although the eyes that open are different with closed the two visual appearance of eyes, all represent identity logic object: people's eyes.Alternatively, image creation module 320 can be only creates limit with abundant frequency, while jointly occurring in track such as the specific threshold number percent of particular threshold number object number of times or time being observed the segment corresponding with cluster node between those cluster node.
In one embodiment, motion stream shape module 119 also comprises matrix creation module 325, and this matrix creation module is expressed as dendrogram 361 in the cluster matrix 362 that can be employed more efficiently when comparing the Semantic Similarity of two different segments.Particularly, cluster matrix 362 is symmetrical N x N matrixes, and wherein N is the number of the different cluster node in Figure 36 1.Each element in matrix has following value, certain similarity degree between the segment of cluster node corresponding to the row and column with this value of this value representation (or equivalently, difference).For example, this value can be expressed in the not Weighted Shortest Path Problem footpath distance between corresponding node, in Figure 36 1, this not Weighted Shortest Path Problem footpath apart from the difference degree representing between the segment of cluster node.Alternatively, can reformulate the value of expression difference to express similarity, and the larger similarity degree of larger value representation.In one embodiment, can directly create cluster matrix 362 from cluster node, and not create dendrogram 361.
As a simple examples of the relation between dendrogram 361 and cluster matrix 362, suppose that figure has seven cluster node A-G that arrange as described in Fig. 3 A, these seven cluster node represent visually seven clusters of similar segment eigenvector.Matrix creation module 325 can create the corresponding cluster matrix 362 as in Fig. 3 B, wherein matrix value be illustrated in shortest path between corresponding node distance (for example, limit number), such as the distance 3 between cluster node A and G.In the example of Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B, suppose that limit has value or cost 1; Yet can replace (for example) use the number of the matching track between the cluster connecting or percentage recently opposite side be weighted to express similarity degree.
Recognizing that motion stream graphic data structure 360 can be implemented by different way in different embodiment, and the two is only a kind of mode for doing like this to create dendrogram 361 and cluster matrix 362.For example, can implement motion stream graphic data structure 360 and first not pre-create dendrogram 362 by direct establishment cluster matrix 362.In addition, if cluster matrix 362,---used---can with different modes, such as row or column vector represent.
Therefore, the module 305-325 of motion stream shape module 119 analyzes the video 117 of video depots 116 and creates motion stream graphic data structure 360, the mode that this motion stream graphic data structures capture identity logic object can visually change in time.Still the Semantic Similarity that application motion stream graphic data structure 360 quantizes from the visual element of image or video, these visual elements comprise not yet video depots 116 in, therefore previous not as the part of the action of module 305-325 and those analyzed new videos.
Therefore, motion stream shape module 119 also comprises similarity determination module 330, and this similarity determination module quantizes at different visual elements, such as indivedual segments of image or video, image as a whole and/or the Semantic Similarity between video or video-frequency band.This visual element as the image of a part wherein or video without previously as the part of the action of module 305-355 and analyzed mistake.
The basic comparative type that similarity determination module 330 is carried out is two segments of comparison, and---or being their character pair vector of comparison more accurately---usingd and quantized the identical semantic region of their presentation videos or as the probability of the part of this semantic region.Then can with segment as described below relatively realize more complicated comparative pattern, such as image relatively or the comparison of video-frequency band.
In order to continue previous example, the in the situation that of segment comparison, segment that should be corresponding at the eyes with opening and with segment corresponding to closed eyes between there is strong Semantic Similarity degree (if not visual similarity), suppose that they are all corresponding to identical semantic object (that is, eyes).That is to say, even if segment may be visually very dissimilar, but they remain the part of same trajectories, and therefore represent identical semantic region.
Particularly, in one embodiment, the similarity between the second segment that the first segment that similarity determination module 330 represents the character pair vector x at it and its character pair vector y represent is calculated as the weighted sum of the value in cluster matrix 362.Because segment can be from the visual element in video depots 116 not---or the time being at least created motion stream shape 360 not the visual element in video depots---so they are not may be not corresponding ideally with any segment in the segment of storing in the segment cluster at dendrogram 361.(in contrast, if x and cluster c
1correspondence and y and cluster c ideally
2corresponding ideally, can be by reading the c that is expert at
1with row c
2value calculate simply the similarity degree between x and y, or read equivalently the c that is expert at
2with row c
1value because matrix 362 is symmetrical.) therefore, replace and only to read the single value of matrix 362, thereby calculate all matrix-valued weighted sums reflection x and y can be in certain degree corresponding to each cluster of the cluster centering representing in matrix to such fact.
More specifically, visually relatively for each cluster node of the eigenvector x of the first segment and the cluster node of dendrogram 361 with for each cluster node c
idetermine x and c
ibetween similarity degree ψ
i.Determine similarly y and each cluster node c
ibetween similarity degree ω
i.Then, pass through ψ
iand ω
ithe row c of product to matrix 362
iwith row c
jvalue be weighted, thereby represent the following fact:, the matrix value right for specific cluster is only applicable to the semanteme of x and y in the similar degree of the x corresponding cluster right to this with y.These computings can be expressed more compactly by following equation:
Sim(x,y)＝Σ
i,j[(M
ij)*(ψ
iω
j)]
Wherein Sim () is similarity function, and M is matrix 362, and i and j are the row and column index of matrix, ψ
ithe degree that x represents cluster node i, and ω
jit is the degree that y represents cluster node j.(larger with represent larger similarity degree, if the therefore value of cluster matrix 362 sign difference degree, first they are converted to be expressed as the corresponding similarity degree before similarity determination module 330 calculates weighted sums.)
As example more specifically, look back Fig. 4 B, suppose that cluster node A means the segment cluster of the eyes that open and the segment cluster that cluster node B means closed eyes.If x represents that eigenvector and the y of the eyes that open of cluster node A are the eigenvectors that represent ideally the closed eyes of cluster node B ideally, can determine simply by reading in the matrix entries of row A, row B (or being listed as equivalently B, row A) the accurate similarity of x and y.Yet, because the x for cluster node A represents and expresses possibility not ideal for the y of cluster node B, so similarity of (and between y and all other cluster node) between (and between x and all other cluster node) and y and B between calculating x and A, and for each matrix element, calculate the product of the value of x similarity, y similarity and homography element, and result is sued for peace.Therefore, for example weighted sum corresponding to the first row of the matrix A with Fig. 4 B is calculated as:
(M
A,A*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,A))+(M
A,B*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,B))+(M
A,C*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,C))+(M
A,D*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,D))+(M
A,E*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,E))+(M
A,F*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,F))+(M
A,G*Sim(x,A)*Sim(y,G))
M wherein
i,jrepresent to be expert at i (corresponding to cluster c
i) and be listed as j (corresponding to cluster c
j) matrix value, and Sim (v, Cl) is illustrated in the degree of the visual similarity between vector v and cluster Cl.For the similarity of other row, will calculate in the same manner and be added with total similarity similarly.
In one embodiment, the degree of the visual similarity of eigenvector and cluster node is by relatively calculating the barycenter of the eigenvector in this eigenvector and cluster.For example, in order to calculate similarity, can compare the dot product of cluster barycenter vector eigenvector and suitably normalized and.
