By way of introduction, the subject matter of this disclosure relates to an application programming interface (API) for accessing, by a third party application, a content server via a network to receive information identifying content items, provided by the content server, that are related to a content item identified by the third party application and a user identified by the third party application. In general, an API is the interface implemented by an application which allows other applications to communicate with it. An API defines a language and message format used by an application program to communicate with the operating system or some other control program such as a database management system (DBMS) or communications protocol. The language and messaging format of a system's API can be made available to third party applications to enable the third party applications to interface with the system and employ the various operating systems, information databases, and/or control programs provided by the system.
The subject disclosure relates to an API that allows third party applications to interface with a content provider via a network (e.g., the Internet) to exploit various features and functionalities provided by the content provider. In particular, the subject API defines a mechanism via which third party applications can request, from the content provider, information identifying and/or describing content items related to a another content item and a specific user. The API is configured to receive, interpret, and process such requests (also referred to herein as API calls) and direct the content provider to generate the information using information, services, and applications associated with the content provider. The API can further return the generated list and/or description of content items to the application or entity associated with the request.
In an aspect, an API associated with a content provider receives an API call from a third party application for information identifying content items related to another content item and personalized to the preferences of a specific user. In association with the API call, the API ingests an identifier for a content element (e.g., a video identifier) and a unique user identifier. The API processes the API call and returns to the third party application, a set of content element identifiers and metadata for the associated content elements based on the content element identifier and the unique user identifier. In an aspect, the unique user identifier is embodied in a token which represents the unique pairing of the third party application (e.g., via a third party application identifier) and the user's unique identifier.
When processing the API call, the API employs a server side (associated with the content provider) look up table to map the token to the unique user identifier to identify the user represented by the identifier as known to the content provider. After the user is identified, information related to the user can be retrieved (e.g., preference information, historical data regarding user interaction with the content provider, demographic information, etc.) and employed to generated a personalized list of related content. For example a set of content items can be identified that are related to the content item represented by the content identifier. This set of content items can then be filtered to remove content items the user has previously accessed. The set of content items can further be adapted to promote content items that the users sharing similar characteristics of the user have accessed or endorsed.
In one or more aspects, a system is provided that includes an ingestion component configured to receive a request from an entity for content related to a content item and a user identity. The request has a content identifier representative of the content item and a token. A request processing component of the system is configured to access a database associated with the system and identify the content item and the user identity using the content identifier and the token, wherein the database has information associating the token with the user identity and information associating the content identifier with the content item. In response to identification of the content item and the user identity, the request processing component directs a recommendation engine associated with the system to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity. Information identifying the content related to the content item and the user identity is then transmitted back to the entity.
In another aspect, a method is disclosed that includes receiving at an API associated with a system, a request for content related to a content item provided by the system and a user identity, the request comprising a content identifier representative of the content item and a token comprising a user identifier representative of the user identity. The method further includes, accessing by the API, a database associated with the system comprising information associating the token with the user identifier and information associating the content identifier with the content item, identifying by the API, the content item and the user identity using the information in the database. Further, in response to the identifying the content item and the user identity, the method includes directing, by the API, a recommendation engine associated with the system to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity, and sending by the API, a response to the request comprising information identifying the content related to the content item and the user identity to an entity associated with the request.
Still in yet another aspect, provided is a tangible computer-readable storage medium comprising computer-readable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing system to perform various operations. These operations include, receiving by a system via a network, a request for content related to a content item provided by the system and a user identity, the request comprising a content identifier representative of the content item and a token comprising information representative of the user identity. These operations further include, accessing a database associated with the system comprising information associating the token with the user identity and information associating the content identifier with the content item, identifying the content item and the user identity using the information in the database, in response to the identifying the content item and the user identity, directing a recommendation engine associated with the system to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity, and sending via the network, a response to the request comprising information identifying the content related to the content item and the user identity.
Referring now to the drawings, with reference initially to FIG. 1 , presented is a diagram of an example system 100 for using an API to provide, by a content provider, information to a third party application identifying content items, provided by the content provider, related to a content item and a user identified by the third party application, in accordance with aspects and embodiments described herein. Aspects of systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable components embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines. Such components, when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described.
As used herein, the term content item refers to any suitable data object that can be linked to and accessed or otherwise shared via a network and includes but is not limited to: documents, articles, messages, webpages, programs, applications, and media items. In an aspect, a content item includes a data object that can be identified by a URL. The term media content or media item can include but is not limited to: video, live video, animations, video advertisements, music, music videos, sound files, pictures, and thumbnails. In some aspects, the term media content or media item includes a collection of media items, such as a playlist including several videos or songs or a channel.
A channel can be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic or theme. A channel can be associated with a curator who can perform management actions on the channel. Management actions may include, for example, adding media items to the channel, removing media items from the channel, defining subscription requirements for the channel, defining presentation attributes for channel content, defining access attributes for channel content, etc. The channel content can be digital content uploaded to the internet-based content platform by a channel curator and/or digital content selected by a channel curator from the content available on the Internet-based content platform. A channel curator can be a professional content provider (e.g., a professional content creator, a professional content distributor, a content rental service, a television (TV) service, etc.) or an amateur individual. Channel content can include professional content (e.g., movie clips, TV clips, music videos, educational videos) and/or amateur content (e.g., video blogging, short original videos, etc.). Users, other than the curator of the channel, can subscribe to one or more channels in which they are interested.
In an exemplary embodiment, content provider 108 includes a streaming media provider configured to provide streamed media to client devices (e.g., client device 102) over a network 106. The media can be stored in memory associated with the media provider (e.g., memory 122) and/or at various servers employed by the media provider and accessed by client devices using a networked platform (e.g., a website platform, a cellular application) employed by the media provider. For example, the media provider can provide and present media content to a user via a website that can be accessed by a client device using a browser. In another example, the media provider can provide and present media to a user via a mobile/cellular application provided on a client device (e.g., where client device is a smartphone or the like).
In association with providing content to users via a network (e.g., streaming media where content provider is a media provider), content provider 108 can have access to rich information about the respective users of content provider 108. This rich information can be employed by content provider 108 (and more particularly server platform 118 discussed supra) to identify personalized content recommendations for the respective users. For example, the users can establish accounts or profiles with the content provider 108 and associate information related to their particular content preferences (e.g., type of content, genera of content, length of content, source of content, language of content, or other characteristics of the content) with their respective profiles. User profiles can also provide other information about a specific user, either provided by the user or learned by the content provider 108, and associated with the user's profile or identity. For example, where content provider 108 is a streaming media provider, a user's profile can provide a variety of personalized information about the user, including but not limited to: demographic information, historical data regarding user interaction with the media provider and media provided by media provider (e.g., video watch history, media sharing history, information indicating media endorsed or subscribed to by the user, information indicating media commented on my the user, information indicating media favorited by the user, etc.), user location information, user context information, and social affiliations of the user (e.g., relationships between the user and other users).
As used in this disclosure, the terms “content consumer” or “user” refer to a person, entity, system, or combination thereof that employs system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure) using a client device 102. The one or more networks 106 via which one or more components of system 100 can connect can include wired and wireless networks, including but not limited to, a WAN (e.g., the Internet or a cellular network), a local area network (LAN) or a personal area network (PAN). For example, device 102 can communicate with content provider 108 and API component 110, (and vice versa) using virtually any desired wired or wireless technology, including, for example, cellular, WAN, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Wi-Max, WLAN, and etc. In an aspect, one or more components of system 100 are configured to interact via disparate networks.
In an aspect, recommendation engine 120 can access user information database 124 to retrieve information associating user identities with personalized information for the respective user identities that can be used by recommendation engine 120 to identify subsets of content items provided by content provider 108 that are personalized to the respective user identities. For example, user information database 124 can store account or profile information for users of content provider 108 that have established accounts or profiles with content provider. The respective profile information of the various users can also be associated with historical user data regarding user activity at content provider and/or with content items provided by content provider, including links to content items provided by content provider at external sources. For example, where content provider 108 is a media provider, respective user profiles can be associated with watch history information that includes historical data regarding respective videos the users watched, when they were watched, where they were watched, etc.
In an aspect, API component 110 is a server-side web API. When used in the context of web development, an API is typically defined as a set of hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an extensible markup language (XML) or JavaScript object notation (JSON) format. For example, application 104 can accesses API component using HTTP requests like GET or POST. API component 110 can processes these requests and transfer data stored by content provider 108 back and forth between application 104 and content provider 108 over the wire in the form of data feeds. The data feeds are simply structured lists that contain the data. Historically, the primary feed format has been AtomPub XML, but JSON and other formats can be employed. However, it should be appreciated that API component 110 can be configured to receive and process API calls in a variety of formats and programming languages.
For example, using the unique identifiers, request processing component 114 can employ information stored at content provider 108 (e.g., a look up table in memory 122) that relates the respective identifiers to a known content item and a known user identity. According to this example, server platform 118 can include user information database 124 that stores information relating user identifiers to respective user identities (e.g., respective user names, user profiles, user accounts). In an aspect, the user information database 124 (and/or another data store accessible to content provider 108) can further associate personalized user information (e.g., preferences, demographics, watch history, social relationships) with the respective user identities. Server platform 118 can also include content information database 126 that includes information associating content item identifiers with the respective content items represented by the content identifiers. In an aspect, the content information database 126 can also associate a variety of metadata and descriptive information with the respective content items.
After identifying the content item and the user identity using the respective identifiers, request processing component 114 can direct recommendation engine 120 to perform a query for content items related to the identified content item and user identity. For example, recommendation engine 120 can employ various algorithms (e.g., stored in memory) that filters content items provided by content provider 108 to identify a subset (e.g., one or more) of the content items based on similarities of the respective subset of content items to the content item identified in the API call and based on unique characteristics associated with the user identity (e.g., learned or inferred preferences, demographics, social affiliations, history of interaction with content provider, etc.). Recommendation engine 120 and/or request processing component 114 can further generate a personalized related content request response that includes information identifying the subset of content items and/or metadata associated with the respective content items. Communication component 116 can further send or transmit the personalized related content request response back to the requesting application 104.
In an aspect, the user identifier provided in a personalized related content request/API call is represented in a unique token. Information identifying the token and relating the token to a specific user identity can further be stored in a data store (e.g., user information database 124 or another data store) accessible to server platform 118. According to this aspect, the request processing component 114 can employ the token received in the API call and the information stored or accessible to server platform 118 relating the token to the user identity to identify the user identity associated with the API call. Request processing component 114 can then direct recommendation engine 120 to identify content related to the content item and the user identity in response to identification of the user identity associated with the received token (e.g., based on matching of the token received with the API request and the information identifying the token stored by content provider 108).
According to this aspect, the token can represent a unique pairing between the user identity and the application 104 or entity from which the personalized related content request was received. Thus the token cannot be shared or employed by another entity or application to perform the same personalized related content request (e.g., wherein same refers to same as a function of the type of request and the content item and user identity associated with the request). For example, the token can also include or represent an application identifier that identifies the application or entity from which a request was received. In an aspect, request processing component 114 is configured to direct recommendation engine 120 to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity in response to a determination, based on the application/entity identifier, that the application/entity has been authorized to receive the information. This authorization information can be associated with the information identifying the token stored at content provider 108 or disassociated with the information identifying the token.
In addition to an application/entity identifier, request processing component 114 can also require proof of a secret key with a received API call. This can ensure that the application/entity identifier associated with the API call is not being fraudulently employed by another entity. According to this aspect, request processing component 114 can be configured to direct recommendation engine 120 to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity associated with the API call in response to a determination that the entity has been authorized to receive the information based on verification of the secret key by the content provider 108. This security can ensure restricted access of various third party applications to the subject API component 110 functionality and to protect against denial of service or distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.
In another aspect, the token provided in a personalized related content request received by ingestion component 112 can include session information associating the token with a session between the application/entity from which the request was received and content provider that has been authorized by the user identity. Thus the same token cannot be employed by another session between the application/entity and the content provider. According to this aspect, the request processing component 114 can be configured to direct recommendation engine 120 to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity in response to a determination, based on the entity identifier and session information represented by and/or included in the token, that the entity has been authorized to receive the information.
Content items identified by a content item identifier in association with a personalized related content API request can vary based on the content provider. For example, the content item could include a picture, an article, a merchandise item or a video. In an aspect, where the content provider is a media provider, the content identifier can include an identifier for a video, a channel or a playlist. According to this aspect, a personalized related content API request would include a video identifier, a channel identifier, or a playlist identifier, respectively, and a unique user identifier. For example, where API component 110 receives a video identifier and a user identifier, API component can return information identifying videos that are related to the video identifier and that account for characteristics (e.g., preferences, watch history, etc.) of the user represented by the user identifier. In another example, where API component 110 receives a channel identifier and a user identifier, API component 110 can return information identifying videos that are provided on the channel represented by the channel identifier and that account for characteristics (e.g., preferences, watch history, etc.) of the user represented by the user identifier. In yet another example, where API component 110 receives a playlist identifier and a user identifier, API component 110 can return information identifying videos that included in the playlist represented by the playlist identifier and that account for characteristics (e.g., preferences, watch history, etc.) of the user represented by the user identifier.
In an aspect, request processing component 114 can direct recommendation engine 120 to identity content items related to a content item identified in a personalized related content request that are of the same type as the content item identified in the personalized related content request. For example, if the content item identified in a personalized related content request is a picture, request processing component 114 can direct recommendation engine 120 to identify other pictures related to the picture. However, in another aspect, request processing component 114 can direct recommendation engine 120 to identity content items related to a content item identified in a personalized related content request that are of various types. For example, if the content item identified in a personal related content request is a video, request processing component 114 can direct recommendation engine to identify related videos, related playlists, and/or related channels.
In an aspect, in addition to a content item identifier and a unique user identifier, a personalized related API call/request can include information defining other parameters for which to filter the requested related content. For example, the API call can request that information related to a content item and user identity be ranked based on popularity of the respective content items. According to this example, the API call can include a ranking parameter and a factor for which to base the ranking. In another example, the API call can request a specified number of content items to be identified in response to the request. For example, the API call can request the top X (where X is a number) content items most related to the content item identifier and user identifier.
In an aspect, when personalizing this set of content item for the user identified in the API request, recommendation engine 120 can further examine the viewing history of the user and identify a group of other users with similar viewing histories. Recommendation engine 120 can compare the similar viewing histories of the respective users and identify a subset of content items that are most viewed and/or most commonly viewed by the respective users having similar viewing histories. This subset of content items can then be normalized to remove content items the user has already viewed. The subset of content items can also be ranked or ordered as a function of absolute (with respect to a large heterogeneous sample population) or relative (with respect to a grouped subset of the large heterogeneous sample population) popularity of the respective content items.
At 212, in response to identification of the user identity using the received token and the content item, API component 110 can direct a recommendation engine at the server platform 118 to run a query for content items related to the identified content item and user identity associated with the PRC API request. At 214, the server platform 118 can run the query and identify a subset of content items for recommending based on a relationship between the subset of content items and the content item and a relationship between the subset of the content items and the user identity (e.g., as determined or inferred using one or more algorithms employed by the recommendation engine). At 216, the recommendation engine of the server platform 118 can return the query results to the API component 110. At 218, the API component 110 can generate a PRC API request response based on the query results. For example, the API component 110 can generate a data feed (e.g., in XML or JSON) with information identifying the content items included in the query results. At 220, the API component 110 can send the PRC API request response back to the third party application 104.
Upon receipt of the user authorization information and application and application ID, security component 302 can verify the user and generate a token for the application that can be employed by the application 104 to issue a personalized related content request on behalf of the user. In an aspect, the token can include a unique string of characters (e.g., letters, numbers, and symbols) that represents the unique pairing between the application and the verified and authorized user. The token can also represent information that defines access parameters of the third party application (e.g., with respect to session time, what information the application is granted access to, etc.). Thus in an aspect, the token can only be employed by the application 104 in accordance with the access parameters represented by the token. For example, another third party application cannot use the token to issue a personalized related content request on behalf of the user. In another example, the third party application 104 can only user the token for the authorized session represented by the token between the application and the content provider 108.
A 414 the third party application 104 formats a PRC API request that includes the access token and a content item ID. At 416, the third party application 104 sends the PRC API request to API component 110. At 418, the API component 110 receives the PRC API request. The API component 110 can further analyze the request to determine whether the request is formatted properly for processing by API component 110. For example, the API component 110 can determine whether the request includes a content ID and a token. In an aspect, based in part on the presence of the content ID and the token, the API component can interpret the request as a PRC request. At 420 the API component 110 can look up the token in the memory associated with the content server platform 118. For example, the API component 110 can find the token in the memory where it is associated with the information identifying the user identity and an identification of the third party application. Thus at 422, using the received token, API component 110 can determine the identity of a user associated with the PRC request. API component 110 can also identify the content item associated with the PRC request based on the content ID.
At 424, in response to identification of the user identity using the received token and the content item, API component 110 can direct a recommendation engine at the server platform 118 to run a query for content items related to the identified content item and user identity associated with the PRC API request. At 426, the server platform 118 can run the query and identify a subset of content items for recommending based on a relationship between the subset of content items and the content item and a relationship between the subset of the content items and the user identity (e.g., as determined or inferred using one or more algorithms employed by the recommendation engine). At 428, the recommendation engine of the server platform 118 can return the query results to the API component 110. At 430, the API component 110 can generate a PRC API request response based on the query results. For example, the API component 110 can generate a data feed (e.g., in XML or JSON) with information identifying the content items included in the query results. At 432, the API component 110 can send the PRC API request response back to the third party application 104.
In view of the example systems and/or devices described herein, example methods that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter can be further appreciated with reference to flowcharts in FIGS. 5-7 . For purposes of simplicity of explanation, example methods disclosed herein are presented and described as a series of acts; however, it is to be understood and appreciated that the disclosed subject matter is not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, a method disclosed herein could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, interaction diagram(s) may represent methods in accordance with the disclosed subject matter when disparate entities enact disparate portions of the methods. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a method in accordance with the subject specification. It should be further appreciated that the methods disclosed throughout the subject specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computers for execution by a processor or for storage in a memory.
At 508, in response to the identifying the content item and the user identity, a recommendation engine associated with the system is directed (e.g., by request processing component 114) to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity. For example, where the content item identified in the request is a video, the recommendation engine can identify other videos related to the video and the user, and/or other channels or playlists having content related to the video and the user. For example, the recommendation engine can identify a set of media items related to the content item using various screening techniques (e.g., by identifying other media items accessed or endorsed by other users that accessed the video, by identifying other media items having related content to the video, by identifying other videos sharing similar features associated with the video, by identifying other videos associated with a similar genera of the video, etc.).
The recommendation engine can further filter this set of media items based on criteria associated with the user identity (e.g., user watch history, user preferences, user demographics, user social affiliations, etc.). For example, the recommendation can identify other users sharing similar preferences as the user and identify media items included in the set which the other users have accessed or endorsed. In another example, the recommendation engine can identify videos included in the set which are associated with channels, artists, or genres the user tends to prefer (e.g., based on user profile information and/or user watch history). At 510, a response to the request having information identifying the content related to the content item and the user identity is sent back to the requesting entity (e.g., using communication component 116).
At 608 another request is received by a system (e.g., via API component 110) for content related to a content item provided by the system and the user identity. The request includes at least a content identifier representative of the content item and the token. At 610 the database is accessed and the content item and the user identity are identified using the token and the information in the database. At 612, in response to the identifying the content item and the user identity, a recommendation engine associated with the system is directed (e.g., by request processing component 114) to identify the content related to the content item and the user identity. At 614, a response to the request having information identifying the content related to the content item and the user identity is sent back to the requesting entity (e.g., using communication component 116).

Rather, it should be understood that some of the process blocks can be executed in a variety of orders, not all of which may be explicitly illustrated in this disclosure.
With reference to FIG. 8 , a suitable environment 800 for implementing various aspects of the claimed subject matter includes a computer 802. The computer 802 includes a processing unit 804, a system memory 806, a codec 805, and a system bus 808. The system bus 808 couples system components including, but not limited to, the system memory 806 to the processing unit 804.

The system memory 806 includes volatile memory 810 and non-volatile memory 812. The basic input/output system (BIOS), containing the basic routines to transfer information between elements within the computer 802, such as during start-up, is stored in non-volatile memory 812. In addition, according to present innovations, codec 805 may include at least one of an encoder or decoder, wherein the at least one of an encoder or decoder may consist of hardware, a combination of hardware and software, or software. Although, codec 805 is depicted as a separate component, codec 805 may be contained within non-volatile memory 812. By way of illustration, and not limitation, non-volatile memory 812 can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), or flash memory. Volatile memory 810 includes random access memory (RAM), which acts as external cache memory. According to present aspects, the volatile memory may store the write operation retry logic (not shown in FIG. 8 ) and the like.

To facilitate connection of the disk storage devices 814 to the system bus 808, a removable or non-removable interface is typically used, such as interface 816.
It is to be appreciated that FIG. 8 describes software that acts as an intermediary between users and the basic computer resources described in the suitable operating environment 800. Such software includes an operating system 818. Operating system 818, which can be stored on disk storage 814, acts to control and allocate resources of the computer system 802. Applications 820 take advantage of the management of resources by operating system 818 through program modules 824, and program data 826, such as the boot/shutdown transaction table and the like, stored either in system memory 806 or on disk storage 814. It is to be appreciated that the claimed subject matter can be implemented with various operating systems or combinations of operating systems.
A user enters commands or information into the computer 802 through input device(s) 828.
