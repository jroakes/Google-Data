Definitions
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for content to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include advertisement slots defined in the web page or for presentation with a web page, in which advertisements can be presented.
- advertisers provide their resources across multiple languages, but do not have an advertising campaign associated with the resources for each individual language.
- This specification describes technologies relating identifying languages missing from advertising campaigns.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a technique, in which the technique encompasses determining a first webpage that includes content in a first language where the first webpage is a landing page associated with an advertising campaign of a content sponsor, determining a second webpage that includes the content in a different second language where the second webpage is not a landing page in the advertising campaign, evaluating, using one or more processors, one or more criteria in order to make a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage, and identifying a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage based at least in part on the evaluating.
- a tool includes one or more processors and memory that are configured to interact to perform operations including: determining a first webpage that includes content in a first language where the first webpage is a landing page associated with an advertising campaign of a content sponsor, determining a second webpage that includes the content in a different second language where the second webpage is not a landing page in the advertising campaign, evaluating, using one or more processors, one or more criteria in order to make a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage, and identifying a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage based at least in part on the evaluating.
- the subject matter described in this specification relates to instructions, encoded on a computer-readable medium, in which the instructions, when executed, cause data processing apparatus to perform operations including: determining a first webpage that includes content in a first language where the first webpage is a landing page associated with an advertising campaign of a content sponsor, determining a second webpage that includes the content in a different second language where the second webpage is not a landing page in the advertising campaign, evaluating, using one or more processors, one or more criteria in order to make a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage, and identifying a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage based at least in part on the evaluating.
- the criteria are selected from a group consisting of criteria related to a performance of the first webpage or the performance of the advertising campaign.
- determining the first and second webpages includes identifying a translated document pair.
- Each translated document pair can include a first document containing the content in one language and a second document containing the content in a different language.
- Identifying the translated document pair can include filtering a collection of translated documents based on the content to provide the translated document pair.
- filtering the collection of translated documents can be further based on one or more domains associated with the content.
- filtering the collection of translated document pairs can be further based on a level of spending by an entity on advertising the content.
- filtering the collection of translated document pairs can be based on user interaction data associated with the content.
- identifying the translated document pair can include filtering a collection of translated document pairs based on a customer identification associated with the content sponsor to provide the translated document pair.
- identifying the translated document pair includes filtering a collection of translated document pairs can be based on one or more domains associated with the content sponsor to provide the translated document pair.
- the one or more domains can include one or more URLs associated with the content sponsor.
- a technique in another aspect, includes determining a first content item that includes content in a first language where the content item includes a landing page associated with an entity, determining a second different content item that includes the content in a different second language where the second content item does not include a landing page associated with the entity, evaluating one or more criteria in order to make a recommendation to include the second different content item as a landing page, and identifying a recommendation to include the second different content item based on the evaluating.
- the subject matter described in this specification relates to a computer-implemented technique that includes receiving a collection of webpage pairs, each pair including a first webpage containing common content in a first language and including a second webpage containing the common content in a second different language, at least one webpage in each pair corresponding to a translation from a source webpage, filtering the collection of webpage pairs to identify one or more pairs associated with a content sponsor, determining that a first webpage in an identified pair is a landing page for an advertisement associated with an advertising campaign of the content sponsor, determining that a second webpage in the identified pair is not a landing page in the advertising campaign, evaluating one or more criteria in order to make a recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage, and providing the recommendation for expanding the advertising campaign to include the second webpage based at least in part on the evaluating.
- evaluating one or more criteria includes evaluating a performance of the first webpage.
- evaluating one or more criteria includes evaluating a performance of the advertising campaign.
- evaluating one or more criteria includes evaluating a quantity of translated webpages associated with the content sponsor.
- evaluating one or more criteria includes evaluating a level of advertising financing activity associated with the content sponsor.
- determining that a second different webpage in the identified pair is not a landing page in the advertising campaign includes crosschecking an address of the second webpage with addresses of webpage links incorporated into one or more advertisements of the advertising campaign or crosschecking the second webpage with a website that contains landing pages associated with the advertising campaign.
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which an advertisement management tool manages advertising services.
- FIG. IB is a block diagram of example web page.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example routine 200 for identifying languages in which an advertiser does not currently advertise.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example routine 300 for identifying web pages that contain the same content.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram of an example computer tool.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification relates to computer-implemented techniques of identifying online content for which it may be desirable to expand a content (e.g., advertising) campaign into one or more different languages.
- the techniques disclosed can include, for example, obtaining or providing a collection of translated pairs of web pages and, from that collection, identifying a number of translated web pages associated with a particular content sponsor (e.g., advertiser) as well as the languages in which those web pages are translated.
- the translated web pages then are cross-referenced against websites that host landing pages for content campaigns. Based on results from cross-referencing, one or more languages are identified in which the content sponsor is not currently participating.
- a proposal then may be provided to the content sponsor to provide content in the one or more identified languages.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a content management tool 110 (e.g., an internet advertisement management tool) manages content delivery services.
- the environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104a-140c, devices 106, content management tool 110, and advertisers 108.
- Content management tool 110 includes language identification engine 120, content database 130, and mutually translated document pair database 140. Although shown as part of a single tool 110, each of the language identification engine 120, content database 130, and mutually translated document pair database 140 can include a data processing apparatus that is a separate standalone tool.
- a website 104 can include one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website can include a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that contains text, images, multimedia content, and/or programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104a-104c can be maintained by a publisher/content provider, which includes an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the corresponding website 104.
- a resource 105 includes any suitable data that can be provided over the network 102.
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105.
- Resources include web pages, such as HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video and feed sources, among others.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 includes an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102.
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 and for viewing and interacting with web resources 105.
- a user device can request resources 105 from a website 104.
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106.
- the data representing resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- the resources 105 can include web pages that are landing pages for an advertisement.
- a landing page includes a web page that appears when a potential customer, operating a user device 106, selects an advertisement in a separate referring resource 105, such as a web page or pop-up window, in the separate referring resource 105.
- the advertisement can be selected, for example, by clicking on an advertising link displaying text or an image.
- the landing page will usually display additional information, such as text or images, which is relevant to a particular product or service identified in the advertising link.
- a user selection of an advertisement can initiate a request for presentation of a web page that is provided by (or for) the content sponsor 108.
- the landing page can include options that allow a potential customer to enter purchasing information, such as contact information or credit card information, which allows the customer to place a purchase order for the particular product or service or to request additional information.
- purchasing information such as contact information or credit card information
- the landing page can be located on the same domain or a different domain as the referring web page.
- the content (e.g. advertisements) included in the referring resource 105 are selected and placed in the resource 105, such as a webpage, by content management tool 110.
- the content can be selected based on characteristics of the resource 105 and/or based on information included in a request for content that is received by the content management tool 110.
- content management tool 110 can select and place eligible advertisements in a webpage if the advertisement has characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots in a website.
- characteristics can include, for example, keywords and site targeted advertisement campaigns.
- the content management tool 110 can select and place content in a web page or other resource 105.
- the content is placed in response to a search query.
- the search query can be accompanied by a request for additional content (e.g., an advertisement) to be provided with the search results or with a resource 105 obtained in response to the query.
- the request for additional content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page. An example of such characteristics includes key words included in the search query that can be used to facilitate identification of content that are relevant to the resource or search query.
- Content management tool 110 selects content having characteristics matching the characteristics of the slots and identified as relevant to the specified resource keywords or search query and presents those selected content items to the user through the resource 105 or web page that displays the search results.
- Content can be provided over the network 102 to the content management tool 110 by content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers).
- a content sponsor includes, among other things, any person, group of persons or business that seeks to market, sell, or advertise content, such as products for sale or consumption.
- content sponsors 108 submit to the content management tool 110 campaign parameters (e.g., targeting keywords and corresponding bids) that are used to control the distribution and placement of content in one or more resources 105.
- Campaign parameters are parameters of a content distribution campaign that are used to control content distribution in response to content requests and/or search queries.
- campaign parameters can include targeting keywords and corresponding bids, geographic, psychographic or demographic targeting criteria, linguistic targeting, as well as other parameters corresponding to a set of content items.
- a campaign can include a set of one or more content items and corresponding campaign parameters that are grouped together into a same unit. For example, content such as advertisements for sporting equipment can be grouped together into a campaign. Within a campaign, subsets of the content items can be grouped into "ad groups.” For example, an ad group in the above-referenced sports equipment campaign can include a set of advertisements for baseball equipment.
- content sponsors 108 can access the content management tool 110 to monitor performance of the content items that are distributed by the content management tool.
- a content sponsor can access campaign performance reports that identify how many times a content item, such as an advertisement, has been presented in a resource 105 (e.g., impressions), how many times a user has interacted with the content item (e.g., clicks), and how many times the desired transaction (e.g., a sale of a product identified in an advertisement) occurs subsequent to a selection (e.g., conversion).
- a content item such as an advertisement
- each content sponsor 108 can be stored in the content database 130.
- each content sponsor 108 may be associated with separate customer identification (ID).
- the client ID then can be associated with one or more campaigns.
- a content sponsor 108 makes payments to the content management tool 110 in exchange for placement of content by the content management tool.
- the payment information such as amount, frequency, and the details of each content request, also can be stored in the content database 130.
- Other information about the sponsors including, but not limited to, the name, contact information, web addresses, number of campaigns, and campaign parameters associated with the campaigns also can be stored in the content database 130.
- content sponsors 108 conduct business and/or offer web pages in more than one language.
- a content sponsor 108 may publish multiple websites 104a-104c, where each website pertains to the sponsor's business and includes web pages in a different corresponding language.
- website 104a can include web pages where resources 105, such as text, are presented in the German language.
- websites 104b and 104c can include web pages that present resources 105 in the Mandarin Chinese and English languages, respectively.
- Each of the websites 104a-104c can be associated with a particular sponsor on a same domain or on a different domain.
- an individual website can include web pages in multiple languages as opposed to a single language.
- the content sponsor 108 establishes a campaign for at least one of the websites 104a- 104c or for one or more web pages in at least one of the websites 104a- 104c. That is, a content sponsor 108 prepares a set of content items and corresponding campaign parameters that pertain to one or more websites or one or more web pages within a website, and provides the content and/or campaign parameters to the content management tool 1 10. The content management tool 1 10 then incorporates either the content item provided by the sponsor or a link into other web pages or resources 105 based on the campaign parameters. When a user selects the presented content item, for example by clicking on a link associated with an advertisement, the user is redirected (107) to a landing page where the landing page corresponds to a web page hosted by one of the websites 104a-104c.
- FIG. IB is a schematic of an example website 104 maintained by a content provider, where the website 104 includes web page 105a in which content 103 (e.g., text, images, video, audio) is presented in a first language (English).
- the website 104 also includes a second web page 105b that includes identical content as in web page 105 a, except that the content 103 is now presented in a second different language (German).
- the first web page 105a serves as a landing page in an advertising campaign.
- a third web page 113 which may or may not be located on website 104, includes an advertisement 117 that, when selected by a user (e.g., by clicking on the advertisement 1 17), re-directs (1 19) the user back to web page 105a.
- Such re-direction can include, for example, opening a new window in the user's Internet browser that displays the web page 105 a or, alternatively, changing the web page currently displayed by the user's Internet browser.
- the web page 105b does not serve as a landing page in an advertising campaign, e.g., there are no advertisements or links in other web pages that re-direct a user's browser to web page 105b. Without advertisements re-directing users to the web page 105b, the content provider may lose out on opportunities to market the content 103 to an audience that consumes information in the second language.
- the content sponsor 108 can then make a decision as to whether to expand their content (e.g., advertising) into the additional languages by expanding an existing campaign to include the identified language or by creating a brand new campaign targeting the identified language.
- the web page 105a which presents content 103 in English
- the web page 105b which presents the same content 103 in German
- the German language can be identified to the content sponsor as a language in which the content sponsor may wish to expand a pre-existing advertising campaign.
- the language may be identified to the content sponsor as a suggested language for a new advertising campaign.
- One possible approach is to identify the number of languages present on a content sponsor's (e.g., advertiser's) website. Although this approach can be used to identify the number of languages for a particular website, the approach is unable to determine correctly in which of those languages the sponsor is marketing their business. For example, an advertiser may host websites on multiple domains (e.g., example_domain.com, example_domain.de, example domain.co.kr). In addition, the identification of multiple languages on a website may not be a strong indicator of business activity. Accordingly, such identification does not provide additional information to the sponsor that can be used to determine whether to expand or establish an advertising campaign into other languages.
- a content sponsor's e.g., advertiser's
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example routine 200 for identifying languages in which a content sponsor, such as an advertiser or business, does not currently promote its content.
- the information obtained in the routine 200 can be used to provide the publisher or manager of a website a recommendation on whether to expand the content of the website into additional languages and/or to establish additional advertising links to web pages within the website.
- the routine can be used to provide a recommendation to an advertiser or business on whether to expand/establish an advertising campaign into languages in which the
- routine 200 is described below with reference to advertising content from a website, the routine 200 can also be used for other language identification purposes.
- the routine 200 can be implemented, for example, by the content management tool 110 of FIG. 1.
- the content management tool 1 10 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of the routine 200.
- a computer readable medium can include instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform the actions of the routine 200.
- the routine 200 includes determining a first webpage that includes content in a first language where the first webpage includes a landing page associated with a campaign of a content sponsor (202). Examples of content can include text, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources.
- the routine 200 further includes determining a second different webpage that includes the content in a different second language where the second webpage is not a landing page in the campaign (204).
- One or more criteria are evaluated in order to make a recommendation for expanding the campaign to include the second different webpage (206).
- a recommendation is identified for expanding the campaign to include the second different webpage based at least in part on the evaluation (208). Expanding the campaign can include, for example, including the address of the second different web page as a link in an advertisement such that the second different web page becomes a landing page associated with an advertising campaign.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example routine of identifying web pages that contain the same content, where the content is presented in a different corresponding language on each respective page.
- the routine 300 can be implemented, for example, by the language identification engine 120 of FIG. 1.
- a collection of mutually translated pairs of web pages is provided (302). In some implementations, the collection can include documents other than web pages.
- a mutually translated pair of web pages is a pair of web pages in which each web page in the pair includes content that can be considered to correspond to a translation of content in the other web page in the pair or a translation of content from a common source web page.
- a collection of translated pairs of web pages includes multiple web pages containing content in a first language, where one or more of the documents have been translated from a different language.
- the web pages in the collection are arranged in pairs, where each pair includes a first web page that has been translated (e.g., using a machine translation tool) into the same language as the second web page in the pair and where the first web page includes substantially the same content as the second web page.
- the first web page (prior to translation to the same language as the second web page) and the second web page are thus identified as a pair of mutually translated web pages. That is, each web page in a pair can be considered to correspond to a translation of the other web page in the pair.
- the collection of web pages can include one or more web page pairs, in which each pair includes a first web page in a first language and a second web page in a second different language, each web page containing content that corresponds to a translation of content in the other web page or content in a common source web page.
- the web pages can be obtained from multiple sources and/or multiple different networks including, for example, news articles, blog posts, and websites, among others.
- the collection of mutually translated pairs of web pages can be stored in the mutually translated document pair database 140.
- the collection is filtered to identify those pairs of web pages that are associated with a particular content sponsor (304), such as an advertiser.
- a particular content sponsor such as an advertiser.
- an advertiser is associated with a particular domain.
- the collection of mutually translated pairs of web pages then is filtered to remove all web pages that are not available or present on the specified domain. For example, any web pages not included under the domain www, example domain.com would be filtered out of the search.
- a content sponsor is associated with more than one domain. In those cases, the collection of mutually translated pairs may be filtered to include just pairs of mutually translated web pages across multiple specified domains.
- the collection of a pair of mutually translated web pages may include a first web page associated with an advertiser, where the first web page resides on a German domain (e.g., www. example domain. de), and a second web page associated with the advertiser, where the second web page corresponds to an English translation of the first web page and resides on a Canadian domain (e.g., www, example domain.ea).
- the collection of mutually translated pairs may be filtered to also include those mutually translated web pages that differ in more than the top level domain.
- a pair of mutually translated web pages may include a first web page associated with a first domain (e.g., www.example_domain.com) and a second corresponding translated web page associated with a second different domain (e.g., www example domairi2.com) where both the first and second domain are associated with the same content sponsor.
- a first domain e.g., www.example_domain.com
- a second corresponding translated web page associated with a second different domain
- filtering does not need to be restricted by domain. Rather, in some implementations, any level of a uniform resource locator (URL) address can be used to identify pairs of mutually translated web pages associated with the path specified by the URL address. For example, the collection of documents can be filtered to identify all web pages within the collection that are available under a specified path (e.g., URL) address.
- URL uniform resource locator
- the collection can be filtered based on the content itself instead of the domains associated with the entity.
- a first web page associated with a sponsor's successful campaign is available in a first language (e.g., English).
- the sponsor may be interested in expanding the campaign to include landing pages which correspond to versions of the first website, but in one or more different languages.
- the collection of mutually translated web pages is filtered based on a portion or all of the first web page. Such filtering can be achieved using, for example, text based comparisons. Accordingly, translated versions of the first web page containing similar or identical content can be identified.
- each pair of web pages is analyzed to determine whether the second webpage in the pair (e.g., the translated version of the first web page in the pair) includes a landing page in a specified campaign (306).
- the content sponsor e.g., an advertiser
- the advertisements and associated address information can be stored, for example, in a database of the content management tool 110. If no match is found, the translated web page does not correspond to a landing page for the content item.
- the translated web page is identified as a landing page for that particular content item.
- both documents in the pair correspond to a landing page and the sponsor is already advertising in the translated language. Pairs of mutually translated web pages, in which both documents are landing pages for a specified advertisement, can then be filtered out/discarded from the collection.
- the content management tool 110 crosschecks the translated web page in a pair with a website that contains landing pages for an AdGroup of an advertising campaign. For example, the content management tool 110 checks to see whether the address of the translated web page is hosted on the domain of the website that contains landing pages for a particular AdGroup of a campaign. If the address is not hosted on the specified website, the translated web page does not correspond to a landing page in the campaign. Conversely, in some implementations, if the address is hosted on the website, the translated web page can be identified as a landing page that is already a part of the campaign. In some instances, however, a translated webpage may be located on a domain that hosts landing pages for an existing campaign, where the translated webpage does not correspond to a landing page. In those situations, the translated webpage can be cross-checked with landing page addresses stored by the content management tool.
- the content management tool can identify for the advertiser or other user the number and/or type of distinct languages currently employed by the advertiser in websites but not targeted by the advertiser. For example, for a first web page that corresponds to a landing page in a first language (e.g., English), the content management tool 110 may identify one or more other additional web pages, each of which corresponds to a translation of the first web page in a different language (e.g., Russian, Spanish, Mandarin).
- a first language e.g., English
- the content management tool 110 may identify one or more other additional web pages, each of which corresponds to a translation of the first web page in a different language (e.g., Russian, Spanish, Mandarin).
- the one or more translated versions of the first web page are then evaluated, as explained above, to determine whether they are already a part of a campaign (e.g., if the additional web pages correspond to landing pages in an advertising campaign). If any of the one or more additional web pages is not currently part of a campaign, the content management tool identifies the particular type and/or number of languages for the web pages that are not associated with the campaign.
- the languages of web pages that do not correspond to a landing page can be identified to the sponsor or other user in a recommendation.
- recommendation can be provided in various forms including, for example, in an oral conversation between an operator of the content management tool and the sponsor or through electronic communication, such as e-mail to the advertiser, in which the e-mail includes information pertaining to suggested languages for expanding a current campaign.
- e-mails can be generated manually by a user or automated by the content management tool.
- the criteria that are evaluated to make a recommendation can include criteria related to a performance of the first webpage in a mutually translated pair (e.g., the web page that is currently a landing page for an advertisement).
- criteria relating to performance of the first web page includes the number of times an address for the first web page has been included/displayed as a link in an advertisement, the number of times a user has selected an advertisement (e.g., clicks) for which the first web page includes a landing page, and/or the number of times a desired transaction (e.g., a sale of a product identified in the advertisement) occurs subsequent to a user selection of an advertisement.
- advertisement for which the first web page includes a landing page e.g., conversion
- conversion e.g., conversion
- the recommendation may include a suggestion for expanding an advertising campaign to also include the second web page of the mutually translated pair as a landing page for an advertisement.
- Performance of the first webpage can be measured based on user interaction data associated with the first webpage.
- user interaction data can include, for example, a number of page views of the first web page.
- the collection of mutually translated web pages may be filtered based on a minimum number of page views, such that web pages that present information in the first language and that have page views which exceed the minimum number are maintained in the collection.
- other web pages that present information in the first language and which do not exceed the minimum number of page views can be filtered from the collection.
- Data that is relevant to the performance of the first web page can be stored, for example, in the content database 130.
- the criteria that are evaluated may relate to the performance a campaign with which the first web page in the mutually translated pair is associated (where the first web page includes a landing page in the campaign).
- Such criteria can include the number of times a user interacts with a content item in the campaign and/or the number of times a desired transaction occurs subsequent to a user selection of any content item in the campaign.
- Metrics that can be evaluated to determine the performance of a campaign include, among other things, total revenue associated with the campaign, advertiser revenue, revenue associated with the campaign over a specified period of time, or how often content associated with the campaign is displayed.
- the collection of mutually translated web pages may be filtered such that web pages which present information in the first language and which are associated with an advertising campaign that exceeds specified revenue over a period of one month are maintained in the collection.
- other web pages that present information in the first language and which are not associated with advertising campaigns that exceed the specified revenue can be filtered from the collection.
- Other metrics for evaluating the performance of a campaign include number of clicks on an advertisement, cost per click, number of clicks per impressions (e.g., the clicks through rate), the number of conversions and/or the conversion rate, the cost per conversion, a spend versus budget ratio, the number of people reached, the average frequency with which a user sees a particular advertisement, and/or the cost per thousand impressions.
- Other metrics for filtering can include, for example, landing page quality, presence or not of an e-commerce cart, whether a website is a secure website (e.g., an https site), the page rank of the website, or whether the website is an analytics enabled website.
- a secure website e.g., an https site
- recommendations to expand a campaign are restricted to web pages from websites that are sufficiently multi-lingual. That is to say, a content sponsor may have relatively few of its web pages translated into one or more different languages.
- the quality of the recommendation can be enhanced so as to provide recommendations to content sponsors that are more likely to be interested in expanding their campaigns.
- the collection of mutually translated web pages can be further filtered to discard web pages obtained from websites where there is no translation for less than a specified number or percentage of pages in the website (e.g., less than about 80% of the website, less than about 70% of the website, less than about 60% of the website, or less than about 50% of the website). Other percentages may be used instead.
- the specified website may be identified as sufficiently multi-lingual. Subsequent recommendations for expanding a campaign then can include recommendations to add web pages from the multi-lingual website to the campaign.
- the collection of mutually translated web pages can be further filtered to discard web pages obtained from multiple different websites associated with a particular entity (or entities) where there is no translation for less than a specified number or percentage of pages across the multiple websites.
- a recommendation to expand a campaign can be restricted to identifying languages for which a specified quantity (e.g., a minimum number or percentage) of web pages of a website have been translated.
- a website can include a portion of web pages that are translated into a first language. If the percentage of web pages on the web site translated into the first language is less than a specified amount (e.g., less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, or less than about 10%), the first language is not identified in the recommendation as a language into which the sponsor may wish to expand the campaign.
- the recommendation may suggest expanding the campaign into the first language.
- the recommendation can be based on a percentage or number of web pages that are translated into a different language across multiple web sites.
- the recommendations can be directed towards currently active sponsors. That is to say, a recommendation to expand a campaign can be limited to web pages of sponsors that are either actively investing in a campaign or have recently been investing in a campaign. Such content sponsors are, in some implementations, more likely to consider expanding a present campaign than those that are not currently devoting resources to a particular campaign.
- the collection of mutually translated web pages can be filtered to discard web pages associated with a particular content sponsor (e.g., an advertiser) that has not financed an advertisement over a specified period of time (e.g., no spending on advertisements in at least 1 week, no spending on advertisements in at least 2 weeks, or no spending on advertisements in at least 4 weeks).
- Web pages associated with content sponsors that have financed an advertisement or advertising campaign within the specified time period may be retained.
- web pages can be identified as associated with a particular content sponsor based on a web domain or URL, among other techniques of identification.
- Information as to a content sponsor's spending on one or more campaigns can be contained in the content database 130.
- a recommendation to expand a campaign can be limited to web pages based on a level of spending of a sponsor. For example, the collection of mutually translated web pages can be filtered to discard web pages associated with sponsors that have spent less than a specified amount (e.g., less than about $1000, less than about $10,000, or less than about $50,000) on an campaign. The specified amount of spending can be defined for a set period of time (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, or 4 weeks).
- recommendations to expand campaigns can be limited to web pages associated with sponsors that have established multiple campaigns. Sponsors associated multiple campaigns may, in some implementations, have greater resources available for sponsoring content and thus be more inclined to expand current campaigns.
