Description
- This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/589,527, filed Jan. 5, 2015, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- This disclosure relates generally to media content, and more specifically, to replacing an item included in media content.
- Media content (e.g., user-generated media content, etc.) often times includes a song. In certain instances, it may be desirable to remove and/or change a song included in media content. One option to remove a song from media content is to mute the song. However, muting a song included in media content can diminish quality of the media content. Therefore, another option is to replace a song included media content with a different song. However, conventional techniques for replacing a song included media content with a different song often requires a user to select the different song from a list of hundreds of thousands of songs. Furthermore, it is often difficult and/or time consuming to replace a song included in media content with a similar song.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification, nor delineate any scope of the particular implementations of the specification or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
- In accordance with an implementation, a system includes an identification component, a matching component and a replacement component. The identification component identifies at least a portion of an item in a media file. The matching component determines a replacement item from a set of candidate items based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with the item and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. The replacement component replaces the item in the media file with at least a portion of the replacement item.
- Additionally, a non-limiting implementation provides for identifying at least a portion of an item included in a media file, determining a level of perceptual difference between the item and a previously determined item, selecting the previously determined item as a replacement item in response to a determination that the level of perceptual difference meets or exceeds a threshold level, and replacing the item included in the media file with the replacement item.
- In accordance with another implementation, a non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising computer-executable instructions, that in response to execution, cause a computing system to perform operations, comprising: identifying at least a portion of an audio item in a media file, determining a set of replacement audio items from a set of previously determined audio items based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with the audio item and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of previously determined audio items, and replacing the audio item in the media file with a replacement audio item from the set of replacement audio items.
- The following description and the annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It should be understood, however, that certain aspects of this disclosure may be practiced without these specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate describing one or more aspects.
- Many conventional service providers allow users to upload media content (e.g., audio and/or video content) to a server (e.g., a media content server). The media content can then be delivered (e.g., streamed) to other users. Often times, uploaded media content (e.g., user-uploaded media content, user-generated media content, etc.) is associated with more than one type of media content (e.g., one or more songs selected by a user can be embedded in a video). The service providers typically provide the network infrastructure for the users, but very little else. Therefore, these service providers have very limited control over what media content is being uploaded and/or streamed by users, such as, e.g., copyrighted media content. Current copyright protection schemes compare uploaded media content to an index of validated and protected content. A copyright holder can upload the copyrighted media content as a reference. Additionally, the copyright holder can set a policy for dealing with matches (e.g., media content uploaded by a user that matches the copyrighted media content). If a match is made, a copyright claim is generated against the uploaded media content. For example, a media file (e.g., a video file) uploaded to a server (e.g., a media content server) by a user can include copyrighted media content (e.g., one or more copyrighted songs). Depending on the policy set by the copyright holder, the copyrighted media content may therefore need to be removed from the media file.
- As such, in certain instances, it may be desirable to remove and/or change audio content (e.g., a song, a copyrighted song, etc.) included in media content. One conventional solution for removing audio content from a media file includes muting the audio content. However, muting audio content included in media content can diminish quality of the media content. An alternate solution includes replacing the audio content included in the media file with different audio content. However, conventional techniques for replacing audio content included media content with different audio content often requires a user to select the different audio content from a list of numerous audio content options. Moreover, it is often difficult and/or time consuming to replace audio content included in media content with similar audio content.
- To that end, techniques for replacing an item included in media content are presented. For example, an item (e.g., audio content) included in a media file can be replaced with another item (e.g., other audio content). The item included in the media file can be, for example, audio content that meets a defined criteria (e.g., audio content included in the media file that is associated with a copyright claim, etc.). The other item can be, for example, audio content that does not meet the defined criteria (e.g., audio content that is not associated with a copyright claim, audio content associated with a grant to utilize the audio content in the media file, etc.). In an aspect, the other item can be determined based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics (e.g., timbre, tempo, dynamics, harmony and/or other perceptual characteristics) associated with audio content of the item and perceptual characteristics (e.g., timbre, tempo, dynamics, harmony and/or other perceptual characteristics) associated with audio content of the other item. In one example, frequency coefficient information (e.g., Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) information) and/or auditory imagery information (e.g., Stabilized Auditory Image (SAI) information) can be employed to determine the other item.
- Referring initially to
FIG. 1 , there is illustrated anexample system 100 that replaces an item (e.g., audio content) in media content with another item (e.g., other audio content), according to an aspect of the subject disclosure. In one example, thesystem 100 can be implemented on or in connection with at least one server (e.g., at least one server that hosts and/or modifies user-uploaded media content). Thesystem 100 can be employed by various systems, such as, but not limited to media content systems, media sharing systems, media editing systems, media recommendation systems, content management systems, network systems, computer network systems, communication systems, router systems, server systems, high availability server systems (e.g., Telecom server systems), Web server systems, file server systems, media server systems, media content server systems, disk array systems, powered insertion board systems, cloud-based systems, and the like. - Specifically, the
system 100 can provide a media modification feature with an identification feature (e.g., identification component 104), a matching feature (e.g., matching component 106) and a replacement feature (e.g., replacement component 108) that can be utilized in and/or in connection with, for example, a media application (e.g., a media sharing application, a media recommendation application, etc.). The identification feature can identify at least a portion of an item in a media file. The matching feature can determine a replacement item from a set of candidate items based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with the item and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. The replacement feature can replace the item in the media file with at least a portion of the replacement item. - In particular, the
system 100 can include amedia modification component 102. InFIG. 1 , themedia modification component 102 includes anidentification component 104, amatching component 106 and areplacement component 108. Aspects of the systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable component(s) embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines. Such component(s), when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described.System 100 can includememory 112 for storing computer executable components and instructions.System 100 can further include aprocessor 110 to facilitate operation of the instructions (e.g., computer executable components and instructions) bysystem 100. - The media modification 102 (e.g., the identification component 104) can receive a media file (e.g., MEDIA FILE shown in
FIG. 1 ). In one example, the media file can be associated with and/or stored on at least one server (e.g., a remote server, a media content server, etc.) prior to being received by the media modification 102 (e.g., the identification component 104). In another example, a user device can transmit (e.g., directly transmit or indirectly transmit) the media file to the media modification 102 (e.g., the identification component 104). The media file can be, for example, an uploaded media file (e.g., a media file uploaded to a media sharing platform, a media file uploaded to at least one server, etc.). A user device can include a computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device, a handheld device, a cellular phone (e.g., a smartphone), a tablet, an interactive television, an internet-connected television, a set-top box, a streaming media device, a wearable computing device, a camera, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an electronic reader (e-reader), a portable computing device, a gaming device, another type of media capable device, etc. The media file can include one or more types of media content. For example, the media file can include video (e.g., a video file, a video clip, a video sample, etc.) and/or audio (e.g., an audio file, an audio clip, an audio sample, a music file, a music clip, a music sample, a song, etc.). It is to be appreciated that the media file can be in any recognizable media file format (e.g., video file format and/or audio file format), codec compression format, etc. - The
identification component 104 can identify at least a portion of an item (e.g., audio content, an audio item, etc.) in the media file. For example, theidentification component 104 can identify at least a portion of a song associated with and/or included in the media file. The item can be embedded in the media file. The item can be, in one example, an item that meets certain criteria with respect to a content claim (e.g., a copyright claim). For example, the item can be associated with a content claim that limits use of the item (e.g., the item can be copyrighted content, the item can be a copyrighted song, etc.). - In certain implementations, the item can be identified by the
identification component 104 based at least in part on a previously identified partial segment of the item. Theidentification component 104 can store and/or access, for example, a library of identified items (e.g., previously identified items, previously determined items, etc.). Therefore, the library can be implemented as a cross-reference to identify the item. The library can be stored, for example, on a server in communication with theidentification component 104. It is to be appreciated that theidentification component 104 can employ one or more audio fingerprint techniques and/or one or more hashing schemes to identify the item. In an aspect, theidentification component 104 can identify each item included in the media file and/or compare each item included in the media file to an index of claimed items (e.g., validated and protected items). For example, the identification component can identify each song included in a video file and/or compare each song included in the video file to an index of claimed songs (e.g., copyrighted songs). - The
matching component 106 can determine a replacement item from a set of candidate items (e.g., a set of candidate audio content, a set of candidate audio items, a set of previously determined items, etc.). For example, the set of candidate items can be stored in acandidate item database 114 associated with themedia modification component 102. The set of candidate items can be, for example, items that are not associated with a copyright claim (e.g., candidate items associated with a grant to utilize the candidate items in the media file). Thematching component 106 can determine the replacement item from the set of candidate items based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with the item and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. Perceptual characteristics can be associated with content (e.g., audio content) of the item. Perceptual characteristics associated with the item can include, but is not limited to, timbre characteristics associated with the item (e.g., timbre of audio content of the item), tempo characteristics associated with the item (e.g., tempo of audio content of the item), harmonic characteristics associated with the item (e.g., harmony of audio content of the item), dynamic characteristics associated with the item (e.g., dynamics of audio content of the item) and/or other elements associated with audio content of the item. Similarly, corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items can include, but is not limited to, timbre characteristics associated with the set of candidate items (e.g., timbre of audio content of the set of candidate items), tempo characteristics associated with the set of candidate items (e.g., tempo of audio content of the set of candidate items), harmonic characteristics associated with the set of candidate items (e.g., harmony of audio content of the set of candidate items), dynamic characteristics associated with the set of candidate items (e.g., dynamics of audio content of the set of candidate items) and/or other elements associated with audio content of the set of candidate items. - For example, timbre characteristics associated with the item (e.g., timbre of audio content of the item) can be compared to timbre characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., timbre of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Additionally or alternatively, tempo characteristics associated with the item (e.g., tempo of audio content of the item) can be compared to tempo characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., tempo of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Additionally or alternatively, harmonic characteristics associated with the item (e.g., harmony of audio content of the item) can be compared to harmonic characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., harmony of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Additionally or alternatively, dynamic characteristics associated with the item (e.g., dynamics of audio content of the item) can be compared to dynamic characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., dynamics of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Accordingly, the
matching component 106 can compare the item to each candidate item in the set of candidate items based on perceptual characteristics. In an aspect, thematching component 106 can determine the replacement item from the set of candidate items based on a weighted average of at least a first perceptual characteristic (e.g., timbre characteristics, etc.) and a second perceptual characteristic (e.g., tempo characteristics, etc.) associated with the item and a candidate item from the set of candidate items. - To facilitate determining a replacement item from a set of candidate items, the
matching component 106 can extract and/or determine frequency coefficients associated with audio content of the item. For example, thematching component 106 can extract and/or determine Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) associated with audio content of the item. The MFCCs can be associated with amplitudes of a spectrum (e.g., an audio spectrum) derived, for example, based on at least a Fourier transform applied to audio content of the item and/or pitch comparisons of the audio content of the item determined based on the Fourier transform. Thematching component 106 can also extract and/or determine other frequency coefficients associated with audio content of the set of candidate items. For example, thematching component 106 can extract and/or determine other MFCCs associated with audio content of the set of candidate items. The other MFCCs can be associated with amplitudes of a spectrum (e.g., an audio spectrum) derived, for example, based on at least a Fourier transform applied to audio content of the set of candidate items and/or pitch comparisons of the audio content of the set of candidate items determined based on the Fourier transform. Therefore, thematching component 106 can additionally or alternatively determine the replacement item from the set of candidate items based on a comparison between frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCC information) associated with the item and other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCC information) associated with the set of candidate items. - Additionally or alternatively, the
matching component 106 can extract and/or determine auditory imagery associated with audio content of the item. For example, thematching component 106 can extract and/or determine a Stabilized Auditory Image (SAI) and/or SAI features associated with audio content of the item. The SAI and/or SAI features can be generated based on strobe points and/or a strobed temporal integration process associated with audio content of the item. Thematching component 106 can also extract and/or determine other auditory imagery associated with audio content of each candidate item from the set of candidate items. For example, thematching component 106 can extract and/or determine another SAI and/or other SAI features associated with audio content of each candidate item from the set of candidate items. The other SAI and/or other SAI features can be generated based on strobe points and/or a strobed temporal integration process associated with audio content of each candidate item from the set of candidate items. Thematching component 106 can therefore additionally or alternatively determine the replacement item from the set of candidate items based on a comparison between auditory imagery information associated with the item and other auditory imagery information associated with the set of candidate items. In an aspect, thematching component 106 can determine the replacement item from the set of candidate items based on a weighted average of frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCC information) and auditory imagery information (e.g., SAI information) associated with the item and each candidate item from the set of candidate items. Accordingly, scoring of frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCC information) and auditory imagery information (e.g., SAI information) can be employed to determine the replacement item from the set of candidate items. - In a non-limiting example, the
matching component 106 can pair the item included in the media file to each candidate item included in the set of candidate items. Thematching component 106 can also determine at least first perceptual characteristics (e.g., timbre characteristics, etc.) and second characteristics (e.g., tempo characteristics, etc.) associated with the item included in the media file, as well as other first perceptual characteristics (e.g., timbre characteristics, etc.) and other second characteristics (e.g., tempo characteristics, etc.) associated with each candidate item included in the set of candidate items. For each pair associated with the item and a candidate item from the set of candidate items, thematching component 106 can compute a first distance between the first perceptual characteristics and the other first perceptual characteristics. Additionally, for each pair associated with the item and a candidate item from the set of candidate items, thematching component 106 can compute a second distance between the second perceptual characteristics and the other second perceptual characteristics. Then, thematching component 106 can determine a similarity distance by combining the first distance and the second distance. In one example, the similarity distance can be a weighted average of the first distance and the second distance (e.g., the first distance can be combined with a weighted version of the second distance to form the similarity distance, a weighted version of the first distance can be combined with the second distance to form the similarity distance, etc.). A candidate item associated with a lowest similarity distance can be provided as a replacement item. - In an aspect, the
matching component 106 can add a replacement item to a set of replacement items. For example, thematching component 106 can determine more than one replacement item from the set of candidate items. The set of replacement items can be a set of recommended replacement items (e.g., a set of recommended audio content) to replace the item in the media file. In one example, the set of replacement items can be a set of songs that sound similar to a song (e.g., the item) included in the media file. It is to be appreciated that thematching component 106 can additionally employ other information to determine a replacement item from a set of candidate items, such as but not limited to user ratings, contextual metadata, user comments, etc. - The
replacement component 108 can replace the item in the media file with at least a portion of the replacement item to generate a modified media file (e.g., MODIFIED MEDIA FILE shown inFIG. 1 ). For example, thereplacement component 108 can remove the item from the media file. It is to be appreciated that thereplacement component 108 can implement one or more signal processing algorithms to remove the item from the media file. Thereplacement component 108 can additionally add at least a portion of the replacement item to the media file (e.g., thereplacement component 108 can embed at least a portion of the replacement item into the media file). Therefore, the item (e.g., a song) removed from the media file via themedia modification component 102 can be replaced with the replacement item (e.g., another song, a cover version of the song, a re-recorded version of the song, a non-copyrighted version of the song, etc.). The replacement item added to the media file can be, for example, a replacement item from the set of replacement items that is most similar to the item in the media file. In an aspect, thereplacement component 108 can temporally synchronize at least the portion of the replacement item and the media file based on an interval of time associated with at least the portion of the item. In another aspect, thereplacement component 108 can re-process the media file to facilitate generating the modified media file that includes the replacement item. Thereplacement component 108 can upload to and/or store the modified media file on a remote server (e.g., a media content server). Additionally or alternatively, thereplacement component 108 can transmit the modified media file for display on a user device. - It is to be appreciated that the content-based techniques employed by the
system 100 to replace an item included in a media file can be integrated into any existing media sharing system, media modification system and/or media recommendation system. It is also to be appreciated that content-based techniques employed by thesystem 100 can be applied to other media systems, such as but not limited to, media classification systems (e.g., emotion recognition systems, genre classification systems, scene detection systems, etc.), personalized media discovery systems, etc. - While
FIG. 1 depicts separate components insystem 100, it is to be appreciated that the components may be implemented in a common component. In one example, theidentification component 104, thematching component 106 and/or thereplacement component 108 can be included in a single component. Further, it can be appreciated that the design ofsystem 100 can include other component selections, component placements, etc., to replace an item included in media content. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , there is illustrated a non-limiting implementation of asystem 200 in accordance with various aspects and implementations of this disclosure. Thesystem 200 includes themedia modification component 102. Themedia modification component 102 includes theidentification component 104, thematching component 106, thereplacement component 108 and aselection component 202. Theselection component 202 can receive user input associated with selection of the replacement item. For example, the user input can be associated with selection of the replacement items from a set of replacement items (e.g., a set of recommended replacement items) determined by thematching component 106. - Furthermore, the
replacement component 108 can replace the item in the media file with at least the portion of the replacement item based on the selection. In an aspect, theselection component 202 can be implemented in connection with a user interface on a user device and/or a cloud-based video editor. - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , there is illustrated a non-limiting implementation of asystem 300 in accordance with various aspects and implementations of this disclosure. Thesystem 300 includes themedia modification component 102. Themedia modification component 102 includes theidentification component 104, thematching component 106, thereplacement component 108 and/or theselection component 202. Thematching component 106 includes a Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)component 302 and/or a Stabilized Auditory Image (SAI)component 304. Thematching component 106 can include theMFCC component 302 and theSAI component 304 to facilitate similarity computation associated with the item included in the media file. Therefore, thematching component 106 can perform content-based matching based on audio which combines perceptually significant features associated with the item included in the media file and/or the set of candidate items. - The
MFCC component 302 can generate frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) and/or information associated with frequency coefficients based on audio content of the item included in the media file. The frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) can be associated with amplitudes of a spectrum derived, for example, based on at least a Fourier transform applied to audio content of the item and/or pitch comparisons of the audio content of the item determined based on the Fourier transform. TheMFCC component 302 can determine timbre associated with audio content of the item included in the media file. TheMFCC component 302 can also recognize speech associated with audio content of the item included in the media file. For example, theMFCC component 302 can provide genre classification (e.g., musical genre classification), emotion recognition and/or other audio similarity measures associated with audio content of the item included in the media file. Similarly, theMFCC component 302 can generate other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCCs) and/or other information associated with frequency coefficients based on audio content associated with the set of candidate items. In one example, the other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCCs) associated with the set of candidate items can be previously determined by theMFCC component 302 and/or another component. Additionally, the other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCCs) associated with the set of candidate items can be stored in thecandidate item database 114. - The
MFCC component 302 can also determine a distance based on frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) and/or frequency coefficient information associated with the item and the set of candidate items. For example, for each item/candidate item pair, a distance (e.g., MFCC distance) between frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) of the item and other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCCs) of a candidate item can be determined by theMFCC component 302. The distance (e.g., MFCC distance) between frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) of the item and other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCCs) of a candidate item can be a cosine distance. However, it is to be appreciated that the distance (e.g., MFCC distance) between frequency coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) of the item and other frequency coefficients (e.g., other MFCCs) of a candidate item can be a different type of distance measure, such as but not limited to, Euclidean distance, correlation distance, Hamming distance, etc. - The
SAI component 304 can generate and/or determine SAI features associated with audio content of the item. The SAI features can be generated based on strobe points and/or a strobed temporal integration process associated with audio content of the item. TheSAI component 304 can determine tempo and/or pitch associated with audio content of the item included in the media file. TheSAI component 304 can also provide and/or preserve temporal information associated with audio content of the item included in the media file. For example, theSAI component 304 can provide temporal information associated with the SAI features generated based on audio content of the item included in the media file. Similarly, theSAI component 304 can generate other SAI features based on audio content associated with the set of candidate items. In one example, the other SAI features associated with the set of candidate items can be previously determined by theSAI component 304 and/or another component. Additionally, the other SAI features associated with the set of candidate items can be stored in thecandidate item database 114. - The
SAI component 304 can also determine a distance based on SAI features associated with the item and the set of candidate items. For example, for each item/candidate item pair, another distance (e.g., SAI distance) between SAI features of the item and other SAI features of a candidate item can be determined by theSAI component 304. The other distance (e.g., SAI distance) between SAI features of the item and other SAI features of a candidate item can be a cosine distance. However, it is to be appreciated that the other distance (e.g., SAI distance) between SAI features of the item and other SAI features of a candidate item can be a different type of distance measure, such as but not limited to, Euclidean distance, correlation distance, Hamming distance, etc. - In an aspect, for each item/candidate item pair, the
matching component 106 can generate a similarity distance based on the distance (e.g., MFCC distance) determined by theMFCC component 302 and the other distance (e.g., SAI distance) determined by theSAI component 304. The similarity distance can be, for example, a weighted average of the distance (e.g., MFCC distance) determined by theMFCC component 302 and the other distance (e.g., SAI distance) determined by theSAI component 304. In one example, the similarity distance can be equal to a combination of the distance (e.g., MFCC distance) determined by theMFCC component 302 and a weighted version of the other distance (e.g., SAI distance) determined by the SAI component 304 (e.g., a weight can be applied to the other distance determined by the SAI component 304). In another example, the similarity distance can be equal to a combination of a weighted version of the distance (e.g., MFCC distance) determined by theMFCC component 302 and the other distance (e.g., SAI distance) determined by the SAI component 304 (e.g., a weight can be applied to the distance determined by the MFCC component 302). Similarity distance determined by thematching component 106 can be employed to select a candidate item (e.g., a candidate item from the set of candidate items) as a replacement item for the item included in the media file. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , there is illustrated a non-limiting implementation of asystem 400 in accordance with various aspects and implementations of this disclosure. Thesystem 400 themedia modification component 102 and aninterface component 402. Themedia modification component 102 includes theidentification component 104, thematching component 106, thereplacement component 108 and/or theselection component 202. Thematching component 106 includes theMFCC component 302 and/or theSAI component 304. In an implementation, theinterface component 402 can be implemented separate from themedia modification component 102. In another implementation, themedia modification component 102 can include theinterface component 402. - The
interface component 402 can generate a user interface (e.g., a display) to present a replacement item determined by thematching component 106 and/or to present information (e.g., textual information, metadata, etc.) associated with a replacement item determined by thematching component 106. Theinterface component 402 can additionally or alternatively present and/or generate audio output associated with a replacement item determined by thematching component 106. The system 400 (e.g., the interface component 402) can be integrated with a cloud-based video editor. In an aspect, theinterface component 402 can present a user with an option to remove the item from the media file. For example, theinterface component 402 can generate a user interface (e.g., a display) for the user to allow the user to view information associated with the item included in the media file. Additionally, theinterface component 402 can present a user with a replacement item or a set of replacement items determined by thematching component 106. In one example, the replacement item included in the modified media file can be selected by the user (e.g., the user can select the replacement item from the set of replacement items presented to the user) via theinterface component 402. Theinterface component 402 can additionally present the user with the modified media file that includes the replacement item via a user interface (e.g., a display). - The
interface component 402 can also present the user with information (e.g., a notification, an email notification, etc.) regarding policies (e.g., ownership and/or licensing policies) for the item included the media file. In one example, theinterface component 402 provides a user with a list of one or more already-existing policy outcomes of not removing the item from the media file. For example, theinterface component 402 can present to a user an already-existing policy outcome of leaving one or more copyrighted songs in a video (e.g., a video file). An already-existing policy outcome can include, but is not limited to, muting an entire audio track for a video, blocking playback of a video in one or more geographical locations (e.g., countries), not allowing a video to display advertisements, etc. Additionally, theinterface component 402 can notify a user that the already-existing policy outcome(s) can be reversed by replacing the item in the media file with the a replacement item included in the set of replacement items. For example, theinterface component 402 can present a notification to a user which states that the media file is blocked in one or more countries due to the presence of the item (e.g., a copyrighted song). Additionally, the notification can state that replacement of the item included in the media file with the a replacement item from the set of replacement items will result in the media file being unblocked globally (e.g., unblocked in each of the one or more countries). - Accordingly, the
system 400, as well as other systems disclosed herein, can be implemented as a content-based similarity system to provide a user perceptually similar tracks if copyright claimed content is found in and/or associated with the media file. By providing perceptually similar content to a user with respect to copyright claimed content, a user can select from a set of similar content rather than manually searching for content to replace the copyright claimed content. Difficulty and/or time spent searching for proper content to replace the copyright claimed content can therefore be reduced. - Referring to
FIG. 5 , there is illustrated a non-limiting implementation of asystem 500 in accordance with various aspects and implementations of this disclosure. Thesystem 500 includes amedia file 502. For example, themedia file 502 can be a video file. The media file 502 can include at least anitem 504. For example, theitem 504 can be audio content (e.g., a song). However, it is to be appreciated that theitem 504 can be other media content (e.g., video content, etc.). Themedia modification component 102 can receive themedia file 502. In response to receiving themedia file 502, the media modification component 102 (e.g., themedia modification component 102 that includes theidentification component 104, thematching component 106, thereplacement component 108 and/or the selection component 202) can generate a modified media file 506. The modified media file 506 can be a modified version of themedia file 502. For example, the modified media file 506 can be a modified video file. The modified media file 506 can include at least a replacement item 508 (e.g., theitem 504 can be replaced with the replacement item 508). Thereplacement item 508 can be replacement audio content (e.g., a replacement song) for theitem 504. However, it is to be appreciated that thereplacement item 508 can be other replacement media content (e.g., replacement video content, etc.). In an aspect, thereplacement item 508 can be a candidate item included in a set of candidate items (e.g., a set of candidate items stored in the candidate item database 114). The set of candidate items can be a set of candidate audio content (e.g., a set of candidate songs) that can replace theitem 504 in themedia file 502. Thereplacement item 508 can be an item (e.g., audio content, a song, etc.) that is not associated with a copyright claim. For example, thereplacement item 508 can be associated with a grant to utilize thereplacement item 508 in order to replace theitem 504 in the media file 502 (e.g., thereplacement item 508 can be associated with a grant to generate the modified media file 506 with the replacement item 508). Accordingly, the modified media file 506 can be implemented without theitem 504. In an example where themedia file 502 is a video file and theitem 502 and thereplacement item 508 are associated with audio content, the modified media file 506 can be associated with the same video content as themedia file 502. - In an aspect, the
replacement item 508 can be selected from a set of candidate items (e.g., a set of candidate items stored in the candidate item database 114) based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with theitem 504 and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. Perceptual characteristics can include, but are not limited to, timbre characteristics, tempo characteristics, harmonic characteristics, dynamic characteristics and/or other perceptual characteristics. In one example, thereplacement item 508 can be selected from a set of candidate items (e.g., a set of candidate items stored in the candidate item database 114) based on MFCC information and/or SAI information associated with theitem 504 and the set of candidate items. - Referring to
FIG. 6 , there is illustrated a non-limiting implementation of asystem 600, in accordance with various aspects and implementations of this disclosure. In an aspect, thesystem 600 can be associated with theinterface component 402. Thesystem 600 illustrates an example webpage 602 (e.g., a user interface to allow a user to replace an item embedded in media content 604). Thewebpage 602 can be presented on a display of a user device (e.g., a user device associated with a user that generated and/or uploaded the media content 604). The user device can include a computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device, a handheld device, a cellular phone (e.g., a smartphone), a tablet, an interactive television, an internet-connected television, a set-top box, a streaming media device, a wearable computing device, a camera, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an electronic reader (e-reader), a portable computing device, a gaming device, another type of media capable device, etc. In one example, themedia content 604 can be a video and thewebpage 602 can be a video hosting website. Themedia content 604 can be associated with, for example, a media file received by themedia modification component 102. Thewebpage 602 can include themedia content 604, an identifieditem section 606 and a replacement item section(s) 612. The identifieditem section 606 can include an item (e.g., a song) 608 and a remove/replace button 610. As such, a user can view information associated with the item 608 embedded in themedia content 604. The item 608 can be, for example, an item identified by theidentification component 104. The user can remove the item 608 from themedia content 604 and/or replace the item 608 with a replacement item included in the replacement item section(s) 612 by selecting the remove/replace button 610. The replacement item(s)section 612 can present the user with one or more replacement items (e.g., replacement songs) 614 a-n. Therefore, the user can choose to replace the items 608 included in themedia content 604 with a replacement item 614 a-n included in the replacement item(s)section 612. The one or more replacement items 614 a-n included in the replacement item section(s) 612 can be associated with information (e.g., textual information, metadata, etc.) and/or audio output for the one or more replacement items 614 a-n. In an aspect, thewebpage 602 can additionally or alternatively present modified media content that includes a replacement item (e.g., a replacement item presented via the replacement item section(s) 612 and/or selected from the one or more replacement items 614 a-n). The replacement items 614 a-n can be determined, for example, by thematching component 106. It is to be appreciated that thewebpage 602 is merely an example. Therefore, the location and/or content of themedia content 604, the identifieditem section 606 and/or the replacement item(s)section 612 can be varied. Furthermore, thewebpage 602 can include other features, content and/or functionalities not shown inFIG. 6 . It is also to be appreciated that the identifieditem section 606 can include more than one item (e.g., more than one item that is identified in the media content 604). - The aforementioned systems and/or devices have been described with respect to interaction between several components. It should be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or sub-components specified therein, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components. Sub-components could also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components. Further yet, one or more components and/or sub-components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality. The components may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein for the sake of brevity, but known by those of skill in the art.

FIGS. 7-10 illustrate methodologies and/or flow diagrams in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. For simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are depicted and described as a series of acts. It is to be understood and appreciated that the subject innovation is not limited by the acts illustrated and/or by the order of acts, for example acts can occur in various orders and/or concurrently, and with other acts not presented and described herein. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement the methodologies in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In addition, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the methodologies could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events. Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device or storage media. - Referring to
FIG. 7 , there illustrated is amethodology 700 for replacing an item in a media file, according to an aspect of the subject innovation. As an example,methodology 700 can be utilized in various applications, such as, but not limited to, media content systems, media sharing systems, media editing systems, media recommendation systems, content management systems, network systems, computer network systems, communication systems, router systems, server systems, high availability server systems (e.g., Telecom server systems), Web server systems, file server systems, media server systems, media content server systems, disk array systems, powered insertion board systems, cloud-based systems, etc. At 702, at least a portion of an item in a media file is identified (e.g., by an identification component 104). For example, an item (e.g., audio content) embedded in a media file (e.g., a video file) can be identified. - At 704, a replacement item from a set of candidate items is determined (e.g., by matching component 106) based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with the item and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. For example, timbre characteristics associated with the item (e.g., timbre of audio content of the item) can be compared to timbre characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., timbre of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Additionally or alternatively, tempo characteristics associated with the item (e.g., tempo of audio content of the item) can be compared to tempo characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., tempo of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Additionally or alternatively, harmonic characteristics associated with the item (e.g., harmony of audio content of the item) can be compared to harmonic characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., harmony of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). Additionally or alternatively, dynamic characteristics associated with the item (e.g., dynamics of audio content of the item) can be compared to dynamic characteristics associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items (e.g., dynamics of audio content of each candidate item in the set of candidate items). In an aspect, the replacement item can be determined based on a weighted average of at least a first perceptual characteristic (e.g., timbre characteristics) and a second perceptual characteristic (e.g., tempo characteristics) associated with the item and a candidate item from the set of candidate items.
- In a non-limiting implementation, frequency coefficient (e.g., MFCC) information associated with the item can be compared to frequency coefficient (e.g., MFCC) information associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items. Additionally, auditory imagery (e.g., SAI) information associated with the item can be compared to auditory imagery (e.g., SAI) information associated with each candidate item in the set of candidate items. The replacement item can be determined, for example, based on a weighted average of frequency coefficient (e.g., MFCC) information and auditory imagery (e.g., SAI) information associated with the item the set of candidate items.
- At 706, the item in the media file is replaced with at least a portion of the replacement item (e.g., by a replacement component 108). For example, the replacement item can be a candidate item from the set of candidate items that is determined to be most similar to the item in the media file based on the comparison between the perceptual characteristics associated with the item and the corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. In an aspect, the replacement item, information associated with the replacement item and/or a modified media file that includes the replacement item can be presented to a user (e.g., a user that generated and/or uploaded the media file) via a user device. In one example, the replacement item can be selected by a user from a set of replacement items presented on a user device.
- Referring to
FIG. 8 , there illustrated is anexample methodology 800 for replacing an item in a media file. At 802, at least a portion of an item included in a media file is identified (e.g., by an identification component 104). In one example, the item can be audio content (e.g., a song) and the media file can be a video file. At 804, a level of perceptual difference between the item and a previously determined item is determined (e.g., by matching component 106). For example, a level of perceptual difference between the item and a previously determined item can be determined based on perceptual characteristics (e.g., timbre, tempo, dynamics, harmony and/or other perceptual characteristics) associated with audio content of the item and audio content of the previously determined item. In an aspect, a level of perceptual difference between the item and a previously determined item can be determined based on frequency coefficient information (e.g., MFCC information) and/or auditory imagery information (e.g., SAI information) associated with audio content of the item and audio content of the previously determined item. - At 806, the previously determined item is selected as a replacement item in response to a determination that the level of perceptual difference meets or exceeds a threshold level (e.g., by matching component 106). For example, the previously determined item can be selected as a candidate item in response to a determination based on perceptual characteristics that the previously determined item is a previously determined item from a set of previously determined items that is most similar to the item in the media file. In one example, the previously determined item can be selected based on perceptual characteristics (e.g., perceptual characteristics associated with audio content of the item and audio content of the previously determined item) and user input. At 808, the item included in the media file is replaced with the replacement item (e.g., by a replacement component 108). For example, a modified media file can be generated by removing the item from the media file and embedding the replacement item into the media file.
- Referring to
FIG. 9 , there illustrated is anexample methodology 900 for generating a modified media file. At 902, a media file is received (e.g., by an identification component 104). At 904, an item in the media file is identified (e.g., by an identification component 104). At 906, a set of replacement items from a set of candidate items is determined (e.g., by a matching component 106) based on a comparison between perceptual characteristics associated with the item and corresponding perceptual characteristics associated with the set of candidate items. At 908, user input associated with selection of a replacement item from the set of replacement items is received (e.g., by a selection component 202). For example, the set of replacement items can be presented on a user device associated with a user. Therefore, the user can select the replacement item from the set of replacement items presented on the user device. At 910, a modified media file is generated by replacing the item in the media file with the replacement item (e.g., using a replacement component 108). - Referring to
FIG. 10 , there illustrated is anexample methodology 1000 for replacing an item in a media file. At 1002, an item in the media file is identified (e.g., by an identification component 104). At 1004, a replacement item from a set of candidate items is determined (e.g., by a matching component 106) based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) information and Stabilized Auditory Image (SAI) information associated with the item and the set of candidate items. For example, MFCC information and SAI information can be employed to match the item in the media file with one or more candidate items from a set of candidate items. The replacement item can be a candidate item from the set of candidate item that is determined to match (e.g., be similar to) the item in the media file based on the MFCC information and the SAI information. At 1006, the item included in the media file is replaced (e.g., by a replacement component 108) with the replacement item. - In order to provide a context for the various aspects of the disclosed subject matter,
FIGS. 11 and 12 as well as the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable environment in which the various aspects of the disclosed subject matter may be implemented. - With reference to

FIG. 11 also depicts software that acts as an intermediary between users and the basic computer resources described in thesuitable operating environment 1100. Such software includes, for example, anoperating system 1128.Operating system 1128, which can be stored ondisk storage 1124, acts to control and allocate resources of thecomputer system 1112.System applications 1130 take advantage of the management of resources byoperating system 1128 throughprogram modules 1132 andprogram data 1134, e.g., stored either insystem memory 1116 or ondisk storage 1124. It is to be appreciated that this disclosure can be implemented with various operating systems or combinations of operating systems. - A user enters commands or information into the
computer 1112 through input device(s) 1136.Input devices 1136 include, but are not limited to, a pointing device such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, touch pad, keyboard, microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, TV tuner card, digital camera, digital video camera, web camera, and the like. These and other input devices connect to theprocessing unit 1114 through thesystem bus 1118 via interface port(s) 1138. Interface port(s) 1138 include, for example, a serial port, a parallel port, a game port, and a universal serial bus (USB). Output device(s) 1140 use some of the same type of ports as input device(s) 1136. Thus, for example, a USB port may be used to provide input tocomputer 1112, and to output information fromcomputer 1112 to anoutput device 1140.Output adapter 1142 is provided to illustrate that there are someoutput devices 1140 like monitors, speakers, and printers, amongother output devices 1140, which require special adapters. Theoutput adapters 1142 include, by way of illustration and not limitation, video and sound cards that provide a means of connection between theoutput device 1140 and thesystem bus 1118. It should be noted that other devices and/or systems of devices provide both input and output capabilities such as remote computer(s) 1144. -
Computer 1112 can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as remote computer(s) 1144. The remote computer(s) 1144 can be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a workstation, a microprocessor based appliance, a peer device or other common network node and the like, and typically includes many or all of the elements described relative tocomputer 1112. For purposes of brevity, only amemory storage device 1146 is illustrated with remote computer(s) 1144. Remote computer(s) 1144 is logically connected tocomputer 1112 through anetwork interface 1148 and then physically connected viacommunication connection 1150.Network interface 1148 encompasses wire and/or wireless communication networks such as local-area networks (LAN), wide-area networks (WAN), cellular networks, etc. LAN technologies include Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Copper Distributed Data Interface (CDDI), Ethernet, Token Ring and the like. WAN technologies include, but are not limited to, point-to-point links, circuit switching networks like Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) and variations thereon, packet switching networks, and Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL). - Communication connection(s) 1150 refers to the hardware/software employed to connect the
network interface 1148 to thebus 1118. Whilecommunication connection 1150 is shown for illustrative clarity insidecomputer 1112, it can also be external tocomputer 1112. The hardware/software necessary for connection to thenetwork interface 1148 includes, for exemplary purposes only, internal and external technologies such as, modems including regular telephone grade modems, cable modems and DSL modems, ISDN adapters, and Ethernet cards. -
