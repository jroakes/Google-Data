Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, and including a method for determining content based on a location. The method comprises: receiving a query; determining the query is a local query including determining a location associated with the query; when the query is a local query, determining one or more categories associated with the query; and using the query, the location, and the one or more categories to determine content responsive to the query.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Content item slots can be allocated to content sponsors through an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for determining content based on a location. The method comprises: receiving a query; determining the query is a local query including determining a location associated with the query; when the query is a local query, determining one or more categories associated with the query; and using the query, the location, and the one or more categories to determine content responsive to the query.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Receiving the query can include receiving a query request. Determining the query is a local query can include determining if the query includes location information, and determining the location associated with the query can include using the location information to determine the location. The location information can include location information from a map-related application. The location information from a map-related application can include location information from a current viewport. The location information can include location information determined from keywords of the query. Determining the query is a local query can include determining a location of a user that submitted the query comprising: determining an IP address of where the query originated and determining a location based on the IP address. Determining one or more categories can include determining categories for local searches in the location. Determining the one or more categories can include determining a category associated with a business that supplied a prior local advertisement in response to the query. The method can further comprise: storing an association between a query, location data and one or more categories, where determining a category can include evaluating stored query location data to determine one or more associated categories for a given query location pair. Using the query, the location, and the one or more categories to determine content responsive to the query further can include using a query language and a display language.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for targeting content using location-based categories. The method comprises: associating one or more categories with a query-location pair, where the query-location pair includes a query and a location of a device from which the query was submitted; and targeting, to users that submit the query, content based on the query and the one or more categories.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems that include a content management system that provides content responsive to received requests comprising: a query handler that is enabled to receive a query and location information and provide content in response to the query and the location information; a location engine that is enabled to determine that the query is a local query; and a category engine that is enabled to determine one or more categories associated with the query if it is a local query.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The content management system can further include a ranking engine enabled to rank content using at least the location information.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions that, when executed by a processor, perform a method for providing content, the method comprising: receiving a query; determining the query is a local query including determining a location associated with the query; when the query is a local query, determining one or more categories associated with the query; and using the query, the location, and the one or more categories to determine content responsive to the query.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- This document describes methods, processes and systems for targeting content based on local queries. A query can be a local query because, for example, location information is associated with the query and can be used with the query to determine content based on the geographic location. As an example, a user in San Francisco with a mobile device may enter the name of a business entity, such as a local restaurant, as a search query in a browser, resulting in a query associated with the local restaurant. In another example, the user may be running a map-related application and enter the name of the local restaurant, such as to obtain driving directions to the local restaurant, resulting in a query request associated with the local restaurant. In some cases, the name of the restaurant (e.g., “ChezBurrito”) may be obscure so that few, if any, content items (e.g., ads) are targeted using keywords based on the restaurant's name. In some implementations, categories associated with the entity can be looked up, such as categories of Mexican food and take-out for ChezBurrito. Using the category names (e.g., as additional keywords), location information and any available keywords, content items can be determined that are responsive to the query (or query request). In this way, an expanded number of content items can be matched and served as compared to using keywords alone.
- The local query can be associated with the user's current location or a location-of-interest for the user. For example, a user with a mobile computing device may be in San Francisco, and the user's current location (e.g., a latitude/longitude) can be determined from GPS capabilities of the user's mobile device. In another example, the user may be in a different location running an application using and/or displaying information associated with San Francisco. A map application may, for example, display a map of San Francisco, accept input from the user specifying a San Francisco address as a starting point or destination, or display driving directions to a San Francisco address. In these examples, the location can be determined from coordinates of a map viewport and/or from a specified (or displayed) address or geographic location. In other examples, a user-provided base address or the IP address of the user's device can be used to determine the location.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for targeting content based on local queries. Theexample environment 100 includes acontent management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106, content providers (e.g., advertisers 108),publishers 109, and thecontent management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106,advertisers 108 andpublishers 109. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots). - To facilitate searching of these resources, the
environment 100 can include asearch system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on thewebsites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in anindexed cache 114. -
User devices 106 can submitsearch queries 116 to thesearch system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, thesearch system 112 accesses the indexedcache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 116. Thesearch system 112 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can generatesearch results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from thesearch system 112. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. In some examples, requests for content other than, or in addition to, search queries 116 can occur, such as requests for content based on a location, as is described in this document. In these examples, no search terms are explicitly provided by the user, but keywords for which to target content items can be inferred from the location associated with the request for content (e.g., the query) as is described further below. - When a
resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thecontent management system 110. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the
content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource orsearch query 116. In some implementations, keywords can be inferred from a location, such as based on the user's current geographic location and/or a location-of-interest for the user. - Based at least in part on data included in the request, the
content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. However, in applications in which search queries 116 are not used, thecontent management system 110 can use other ways of selecting content, e.g., in the absence of keywords obtained from search queries 116. For example, as described within this document, thecontent management system 110 can select content using keywords inferred from the user's current location and the names of categories associated with entities in and around the location. - The
content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, for the eligible content items, thecontent management system 110 can receive bids from content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received bids (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction). The bids are amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. The selected content item can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors. - A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In some implementations, the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by serving content that is more likely to be of interest to the user. For example, if a content item that is served is selected in part based on the user's current location and category names associated with the query terms, then the user may be more likely to interact with the content item because it includes content that is more relevant to the user. In some implementations, the categories can be based on past queries.
- Query logs 121 can include information about the past queries, e.g., including all queries entered by a single user, a group of users or an entire community of users. For example, information stored for each query can include the one or more query terms, the location associated with the query, the query language and display language, and the content items delivered in response to the query. One example location associated with the query is the location-of-interest that can be determined from viewport coordinates of a user's map-related application when the query request occurred. Another example location is the location of the device from which the query was submitted, e.g., determined using GPS capabilities of the device. In some implementations, information for the content items can include the URL(s) of resource(s) (e.g., web pages) that were responsive to the user's query. In some implementations, query logs 121 can logically include cookies stored on the
user device 106 that can contain information regarding the user's most recent Internet activity. - In some implementations, information in the query logs 121 can be analyzed to determine categories associated with groups of queries (e.g., by query and location), and this information can be stored in a
categories data store 122. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can obtain category information from the landing pages of the content items (e.g., search results) responsive to the past queries. As an example, the content items can correspond to businesses or other entities that supplied a prior local advertisement in response to the query. In some implementations, determining which content items were responsive to a query can use a query fingerprint such as (query terms+user's location-of-interest). In some implementations, the query fingerprint can include language, such as (query terms+user's location-of-interest+user's query language+user's display language). From this information, categories determined from the responsive content items of past similar queries, for example, can be used to determine keywords for targeting content when new queries are received that have a similar query fingerprint. In an example, the landing pages for query X and location Y can be analyzed to extract names of categories (e.g., “restaurants”, “Mexican restaurants,” etc.) from all of the queries that were entered for location Y. In some implementations, weights can be assigned to categories for a query-location pair based on various factors, such as the number of queries for that category. Categories having lower weights relative to the other categories can be discarded. In some implementations, the categories that are kept can be stored in thecategories data store 122. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. In some implementations, opt out features related to social networking systems, for example, can allow the user to specify that the user's activity stream content is not to be used in ads, or to anonymize the information in some way.

FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing anexample system 200 for targeting content based on local queries. As an example, thecontent management system 110 can receive aquery 202, such as from auser device 106, and in response, providecontent items 204. Thecontent items 204 provided can be targeted based, at least in part, on location information associated with the query, e.g., a geographic location associated with the query 202 (e.g., the current location of the user, or a location-of-interest). - The
content management system 110 can include plural engines, including aquery handler 206, alocation engine 208, aranking engine 210, and acategory engine 212. Thequery handler 206 can receivequeries 202 and providecontent 204 in response to the queries. Thequery handler 206 can also store information about queries (e.g., in the query logs 121) such as the query terms, the location-of-interest associated with the query, the query and display languages, and the content items delivered in response to the query. Thelocation engine 208 can be used to determine alocation 214 associated with thequery 202, such as the user's current location or a location-of-interest. Thelocation engine 208 can also determine entities, such as businesses, stores, restaurants, etc. for the geographic location. Theranking engine 210 can be used to rank elements used within thecontent management system 110. In some implementations, theranking engine 210 can rank categories based on the number of queries that have been received and that are associated with the category. In some implementations, theranking engine 210 can rank content items based, at least in part, on location information. For example, theranking engine 210 can rank the ads responsive to thequery 202 based on the distance that the advertised entities are from the location associated with the query. Thecategory engine 212 can be used to determine categories, such as by looking up categories (e.g., from the categories data store 122) for a given query-location pair. In some implementations, thecategory engine 212 can generate information to be stored in thecategories data store 122 by analyzing information in the query logs 121. In some implementations, thecategory engine 212 can be used to determine categories associated with entities (e.g., stores, businesses, etc.) in the geographic area of thelocation 214. - In some implementations, the
query handler 206 and plural engines 208-212 can operate as a local search engine that, in combination with the search system 112 (described earlier with reference toFIG. 1 ), can generate targeting keywords based on location information of local queries. In some implementations, the keywords can include the names of categories that are stored for query-location pairs in thecategories data store 122. The targeting keywords can be used to target resources, e.g., selected from a set of eligible content items (e.g., business listings), and to providecontent items 204 that are responsive to thequery 202.Content items 204 can be rendered in pluralcontent item slots - Upon receiving the
query 202, thecontent management system 110 can determine whether the query is a local query, including determining a location associated with the query. Local queries, by way of example, can comprise queries (or query requests) that include location information. Example location information includes one or more terms in the query that identify the location, a location determined from the current location of theuser device 106, or a location-of-interest associated with the query. Queries, for example, can include search queries, such as asearch query 218 “chezburrito” that the user can enter in asearch field 220 on aweb page 222. Query requests, for example, can include requests for content that do not necessarily include queries or query terms, but may be provided by location-based applications, such as map-related applications that display a map (e.g., amap 224 displayed in a viewport 226). In this example, themap 224 displays thelocation 214, e.g., a place in San Francisco from which thequery 202 originated or the location for which thequery 202 is associated. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 can use location information associated with the query 202 (e.g., a local query) to determine the location (e.g., thelocation 214 in the San Francisco area) associated with thequery 202. In some implementations, thequery 202 can include keywords that thecontent management system 110 can use, for example, as location information to determine a location. For example, the user'ssearch query 218 “chezburrito” can be the name of a local Mexican restaurant, or the user may enter address or phone number information in thequery search 218 that can be used to identify the ChezBurrito restaurant using reverse business look-up techniques. - In one example of determining a location from a map-related application, the
query 202 can be based on a location associated with a location-related application running on theuser device 106, e.g., displaying themap 224 of a San Francisco area in theviewport 226. Example location-related applications include map applications (e.g., applications for displaying maps and/or requesting and receiving driving directions, etc.) and street view applications (e.g., applications that provide a panoramic view of an area). Other example location-related applications include any applications in which a location can be inferred from data provided by, or displayed to, the user. - In some implementations, the
location engine 208 can determine thelocation 214 from the user'suser device 106, e.g., using global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of theuser device 106, or obtained through cell triangulation, e.g., from three or more signal transmitters, towers or satellites that serve theuser device 106. In some implementations, the location of theuser device 106 can be obtained through periodic mobile check-ins, such as positional checkpoints made by the mobile device at regular intervals. In some implementations, thelocation 214 can be determined from geographic information displayed in, or related to, aviewport 226. For example, a map application (or street view application) that is running on theuser device 106 can display the map 224 (or street view) of an area in San Francisco within theviewport 226. Then, thelocation engine 208 can infer thelocation 214 from, for example, the center-point coordinates of the map's viewport, the field-of-view direction of the street view, or from some other source. In some implementations, thelocation 214 can be determined from place names (e.g., city names, state names, street names, ZIP codes, etc.) that the user enters into the map application or that can be determined from driving directions provided by the map application. Other ways of determining thelocation 214 associated with thequery 202 can be used. - When the query is a local query, one or more categories associated with the query can be determined. In some implementations, the
category engine 212 can determine categories (e.g., restaurants, Mexican food, take-out, etc.) based on terms of the search query 218 (e.g., “chezburrito”) and thelocation 214. For example, thecategory engine 212 can look up the categories in thecategories data store 122, such as by using query-location pairs from terms of thesearch query 218 plus thelocation 214. In this way, categories can be determined for thecurrent query 202 and thelocation 214 based on categories associated with past local searches that are stored in thecategories data store 122. In some implementations, categories can be category phrases comprising two or more terms (e.g., “Mexican food”). - In some implementations, the
category engine 212 can determine categories based on entities (e.g., stores, businesses, etc.) that exist in the area around thelocation 214. For example, in situations when a query request is received without query terms, but location information is provided, categories can be determined. In some implementations, thelocation engine 208 can identify the names of the entities (e.g., the restaurants “Chez Burrito,” “Inventive Tacos,” etc.) in the area of thelocation 214 that is associated with the user'squery 202. Then, thecategory engine 212 can use the entity names plus thelocation 214 to look up the categories from thecategories data store 122. In some implementations, thecategory engine 212 can access all categories in thecategories data store 122, regardless of query, and select the categories, for example, that have the highest number of previous queries. - The
content management system 110 can target and providecontent items 204 using available search terms from thequery 202 as well as keywords that are based on thelocation 214 and categories of entities in thelocation 214. For example, in response to the user entering “chezburrito” as thesearch query 218, thecontent management system 110 can returncontent items 204 that include ads for the ChezBurrito Mexican Grill and another Mexican restaurant that can be rendered inad slots -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for targeting content based on local queries. Theprocess 300 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 including thequery handler 206, thelocation engine 208, theranking engine 210, and thecategory engine 212.FIG. 2 is used to provide examples for steps of theprocess 300. - A query is received (302). As an example, the
content management system 110 can receive aquery 202 from theuser device 106. Thequery 202 can be thesearch query 218 entered in thesearch field 220 and/or thequery 202 can include location information for the location 214 (e.g., San Francisco) associated with thequery 202. - A determination is made whether the query is a local query, including determining a location associated with the query (304). For example, the
location engine 208 can determine if thequery 202 is local, such as if the query includes location information that can be used to target content for a local entity associated with the location 214 (e.g., a San Francisco restaurant). - When the query is a local query, one or more categories associated with the query are determined (306). As an example, the
category engine 212 can determine one or more categories (e.g., Mexican restaurants, take-out, etc.) associated with thequery 202. The categories can be based, for example on categories corresponding to entities associated with thequery 202, such as by accessing category information in thecategories data store 122. - Using the query, the location, and the one or more categories, content responsive to the query is determined (308). For example, the
content management system 110, and in particular thequery handler 208, can determine content (e.g., ads related to Mexican restaurants) responsive to thequery 202. - In some implementations, the content items can be ranked using at least the location information. The
ranking engine 210, for example, can rank the ads responsive to thequery 202 based on the distance that the advertised entities are from thelocation 214. For example, if thecontent management system 110 identifies four content items that are responsive to thequery 202, theranking engine 210 can rank the content items closest-to-farthest. As a result of the ranking, for example, the ads for ChezBurrito Mexican Grill and the other Mexican restaurant can be selected and rendered inad slots -
