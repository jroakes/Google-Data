Definitions
- Social networks permit users to post information about themselves and to communicate with other people, e.g., their friends, family, and co-workers. Some social networks permit users to specify friendships with other users. To establish and maintain connections with others, users can interact with social networking services in a number of ways, such as over the Internet, by sending e-mail messages, or by posting content such as micro-blog posts, instant messages, text-based posts, or multimedia correspondence (e.g., photographs or videos).
- structured data can be fetched from a server used by the social network service. For example, when a user clicks on a link embedded with a webpage being presented by a web browser, data associated with the user selection may be fetched and presented (e.g., on a mobile device) to the user.

- Content specific to the target party such as a social network profile, activity stream, media files, or contact information, may be collected (referred to herein as “pre-fetched”) by the user's client computing device and stored locally on the client device. When the user requests some or all of the pre-fetched content, for instance by clicking on a link to that content, the content has already been retrieved from the server and thus can be quickly and efficiently provided to the user.
- Social relationships incorporate both static components (e.g., Michael is one of Jane's contacts) and dynamic components (e.g., Jane is upset with Michael and has not visited his profile in a month).
- static social data such as the structure of a user's social graph
- dynamic social data such as the content a user has viewed recently or the content the user views frequently
- a direct contact of a user i.e., another user to whom the user is directly connected
- a contact-of-a-contact e.g., a friend of a friend.

- the electronic content may include, e.g., text comments (e.g., updates, announcements, replies), digital images, videos, audio files, and/or other appropriate information.
- information can be posted on a user's behalf by systems and/or services external to social network 123 or to server system 112 .
- the user may post a review of a movie to a movie review Web site, and with proper permissions, that Web site may cross-post that review to social network 123 on the user's behalf.
- the user may include, with a post, a tag, which includes a hyperlink to a discussion forum about a particular topic (e.g., the movie).
- the tag typically relates to the topic of the post (although that need not be the case always).
- the discussion forum contains posts by the user and others who have included similar tags on their posts.
- users interacting with the computing devices 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 can also use social network 123 to define social circles to organize and to categorize the user's relationships to other users of the social network.
- the social circles become part of the user's social connections.
- Electronic content can be distributed to contacts within social network 123 , including one or more social circles, so that such content is viewable by the indicated contacts and/or contacts, or others.
- a user of social network 123 can generate content and indicate, e.g., one or more individual social network contacts and/or social circles to which the generated content is to be distributed.
- a content data set is transmitted from the user's client computing device (e.g., computing device 102 of FIG. 1 ) to a distribution hub (e.g., a content distribution engine 125 ), which can be provided at a server (e.g., server system 112 of FIG. 1 or elsewhere on the network).
- a distribution hub e.g., a content distribution engine 125
- server e.g., server system 112 of FIG. 1 or elsewhere on the network.
- the content data set may include content data (e.g., text, identity of the content author, tag, uniform resource indicator (URI), timestamp data (e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the content was generated)), distribution data (e.g., data identifying contacts and/or one or more social circles), and identification (ID) data (e.g., an ID assigned to the content data set upon generation of the content).
- content data e.g., text, identity of the content author, tag, uniform resource indicator (URI), timestamp data (e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the content was generated)
- distribution data e.g., data identifying contacts and/or one or more social circles
- ID identification
- other data can be appended to content data sets.
- Example other data can include scoring data.
- scoring data can include a social affinity score among other possible scoring data. As described in more detail below, affinity identifies the closeness of parties on a social graph.
- the scoring data may be recipient specific.
- the scoring data can include social affinity data that is provided based on respective social affinity scores between an author of the content and each recipient of the content.
- a first user can author content and define a distribution of the content, thereby creating an underlying content data set.
- the distribution can include a second user and a third user, and so forth.
- a first social affinity score associated with a social relationship between the first user and the second user can be provided, and a second social affinity score associated with a social relationship between the first user and the third user can be provided.
- the first social affinity score can be different from the second social affinity score, reflecting different social relationships between the first user and the second user and the first user and the third user.
- the first social affinity score and the second social affinity score can be appended to the content data set and/or stored in another location while maintaining an association with the content data set.
- the distribution data is processed to provide an access control list (ACL) that specifies which contacts within the social network are granted access to the content.
- ACL access control list
- content-associated social affinity scores can be processed to provide the ACL.
- distribution data can indicate that content is to be accessible by, and/or distributed to, a particular user.
- a social affinity score can be determined for the content and can be specific to a relationship between the content recipient and the author of the content. In some examples, if the social affinity score is below a threshold score, it is determined that the content will not be accessible by, and/or distributed to, the particular user. Consequently, in this example, although the particular user had been explicitly targeted for distribution of the content by the author, the particular user is not provided in the ACL for the content.
- the social affinity score is at or above the threshold score, it is determined that the content will be accessible by, and/or distributed to, the particular user. Consequently, the particular user has been explicitly targeted for distribution of the content by the author and the particular user is provided in the ACL for the content.
- the distribution hub determines end points to which the content data set is to be distributed based, e.g., on the ACL. For example, the set of contacts that may care about the content and/or that are allowed access to the content is determined based on the ACL, and the ID of the content is written to a per user/view index at the distribution hub. When fetching content to distribute to a user, the user/view index is accessed and the IDs of the various contents that the user is allowed to view are determined. The content data sets are retrieved from a data store (e.g., data store 118 of FIG. 1 ) and are transmitted to a client device associated with the requesting user.
- the ACL can be provided based on an overall score, a quality score and/or the social affinity score. Content may be distributed to a user's main page for inclusion in a content stream.
- FIG. 2 shows an example main page 200 for a member of a social network.
- page 200 can be provided as a Web page within a Web site of social network 123 , and can display electronic content that has been shared with a member 201 associated with the page 200 .

- this content includes various tags 220 , 222 , 223 , 224 , 225 .
- Page 200 also includes a social network menu 206 and a content stream 207 , in which items of content are presented.
- Example content items 209 that have been distributed to the member are displayed in the content stream.
- items 209 displayed in content stream 207 include electronic content that is distributed to the member from contacts established within the social network.
- a content sharing interface 210 can also be provided on page 200 . The member can activate (e.g., click on) the interface 210 to input electronic content. Although twelve content items are depicted in FIG. 2 , it is appreciated that page 200 can display more or less than twelve content items to the member.
- a search field 211 can also be provided on page 200 to search social network 123 for content. In the above example, a member may make a post, either in their own content stream or elsewhere.

- the search results may also include social information.
- search results may be comments, endorsements, or other information obtained about the search results from a user's social graph.
- the search results may also include user-generated content displayed alone or in association with relevant social information (e.g., a link to a content author's profile). Search results may be displayed in a user's content stream along with other content. For example, a user may conduct a search of the social network from their main page, and the results may be displayed in their content stream along with others' posts.
- a social graph is a way to represent, graphically, social connections between two parties that may, or may not, be on the same social network, and to represent connections between parties and content.
- a party may be an individual or an entity, e.g., a company, organization, country, or the like.
- Types of connections in social graphs may include, but are not limited to, other users to which a user is in direct contact (e.g., user messaging or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites) and users to which the user is in indirect contact (e.g., contacts of contacts, connections of users that have a direct connection to the user).

- a social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user.
- the social graph may include connections within a single network or across multiple networks.
- Distinct social graphs may be generated for different types of connections. For example, a user may be connected with chat contacts in one social graph, electronic message contacts in a second social graph, and connections from a particular social network in a third social graph.
- a social graph may include edges to additional parties at greater degrees of separation from the user.
- an electronic message contact may have its own electronic message contacts to others adding a degree of separation from the user (e.g., user ⁇ electronic message contact ⁇ contact of electronic message contact). These contacts may, in turn, may have additional contacts at another degree of separation from the user.
- a party's connection to someone in a particular social network may be used to identify additional connections based on that person's connections.
- Distinct social graphs may include edges connecting one or more social graph to one or more other social graphs.
- a social graph may include a single social graph or multiple interconnected social graphs.
- users may designate content as endorsed, share or comment on content, quote URLs, or otherwise indicate an interest or liking of content, examples of which include, but are not limited to, a particular resource, Web page, or search result.
- an application, widget, or scripting may be provided in search results pages, Web pages, or within a browser application that allows a user to indicate liking, sharing, or other evaluation of an associated resource or search result.
- the user may mark the particular resource, Web site, or search results to indicate endorsement or other evaluation (e.g., through a browser control or user interface element presented with the associated content).
- Such relationships to information from others may be captured in a user's social graph.
- Affinity between entities of a social graph may be represented by the above-noted edges in the user' social graph.
- affinity may identify the closeness of a party to a user. For example, a contact of a contact who has five common middle contacts with the user has more of an affinity with the user (e.g., is considered closer to the user) than a contact of a contact who has only one common middle contact.
- Factors in determining affinity may include, e.g.: how a contact is connected to the user (e.g., a source of a connection), which social networking site the contact is a member of, whether contact or contact of contact, and how many paths to get to the contact of a contact (e.g., common middle contacts).
- Edges may be weighted, either in a database containing the social graph or elsewhere, to reflect a level of affinity between connections (e.g., parties) in the social graph.
- Affinity between parties may be content specific in some cases.
- social graph data may identify specific types of content associated with an edge between parties and specific affinities for that content.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's videos and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's written work.
- the social graph may specify that the second party has a third, different level of affinity for the first party's blogs.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's content about baseball and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's content about basketball.
- Affinity may also be based on the user's interactions with members of the social graph (e.g., the frequency of interaction, the type of interaction, and so forth). For example, a user that frequently clicks on posts by a particular contact may be considered to be closer to that contact than to other contacts where they click on respective posts less frequently. Likewise, if a user frequently “mouses-over” content by an author (e.g., a search result link), but does not select that content, the degree of affinity may be less than if the link were selected.
- an amount of time viewing content may be an indicator that one party likes content from another party. The amount of time viewing particular content may be an indication that one party likes that particular type of content from the other party, as opposed to other types of content from the other party.
- affinity may be defined by indirect interaction between users. For example, if two users interact with the same content regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with one other. In still other examples, if two users interact with the same people regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with one other.
- FIG. 4 is a conceptual view of an example social graph 400 .
- FIG. 4 shows sources of information for a social graph.
- the user's social graph is a collection of connections (e.g., users, resources/content, etc.) identified as having a relationship to the user 402 (“ME”) within some degree of separation.
- the user's social graph may include parties and particular content at different degrees of separation.
- the social graph of a user may include contacts, contacts of contacts (e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric), the user's social circle, people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- contacts e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric
- the user's social circle e.g., people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- FIG. 4 shows that it is possible to extend the user's social graph to people and content both within a single network and across one or more external networks.
- the user may have a profile or contacts list that includes a set of identified contacts, a set of interests, a set of links to external resources (e.g., Web pages), and subscriptions to content of a system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including electronic messages, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs).
- blogs that include links to a user's contacts may be part of the user's social graph.
- These groups may be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user.
- contacts of the user may have their own profiles that include connections to resources as well as contacts of the respective contacts, a set of interests, and so forth.
- a user may be connected to a social network account. That social network account may reference an article in a newspaper. A social connection, therefore, may be established between the user and the author of the article.
- the connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation may be considered the bounds of the social graph of a user. Membership and degree of separation in the social graph may be based on other factors, including a frequency of interaction. For example, a frequency of interaction may be by the user (e.g., how often the user visits a particular social networking site) or it may be a type of interaction (e.g., endorsing, selecting, or not selecting items associated with contacts). As interactions change, the relationship of a particular contact in the social graph may also dynamically change. Thus, the social graph may be dynamic rather than static.
- Social signals may be layered over the social graph (e.g., using weighted edges or other weights between connections in the social graph). These signals, for example, frequency of interaction or type of interaction between the user and a particular connection, may be used to weight particular connections in the social graph or social graphs without modifying the actual social graph connections. These weights may change as the interaction with the user changes.
- Social graphs may be stored using suitable data structures (e.g., list or matrix type data structures).
- Information describing an aspect of a stored social graph may be considered relationship data.
- relationship data may include information describing how particular members of a user's social graph are connected to a user (e.g., through what social path is a particular entity connected to the user).
- Relationship data may also include information describing social signals incorporated in the user's social graph.
- relationship data may be stored in a relationship lookup table (e.g., a hash table).
- Suitable keys for locating values (e.g., relationship data) within the lookup table may include information describing the identities of both a user and a member of the user's social graph.
- a suitable key for locating relationship data within the lookup table may be (User X, User Y), where User Y is a member of User X's social graph.
- Social graph information may be indexed for use in information retrieval.
- the social graph information may be part of a search index in the indexed cache 314 of FIG. 3 .
- the search index may be searched to identify relevant search results that are dependent upon social signals, e.g., that are associated with one or more aspects of a user's social graph, examples of which are provided above.
- a search system may receive a query and identify, e.g., general search results and user-generated content.
- the user-generated content may include, e.g., search results based on the indexed social graph information (e.g., content from electronic messages, posts, blogs, chats, etc. of members of the searcher's social graph).
- the indexed social graph information may be updated intermittently or periodically, for example, to include recently added information associated with the user's social graph.
- the indexed social graph information may also be updated, e.g., on an on-going basis to reflect relationships determined in accordance with the processes described herein.
- a user may prevent addition of members to the user's social graph, e.g., using an opt-out option or by keeping contacts out of particular groups used to generate the social graph.
- privacy features provide a user with an opt-in or opt-out option to allow or to prevent, respectively, being included (or removed the user if already included) as a member of another's social graph.
- users may have control over what personal information or connection information, if existing, is included in their social graphs and, consequently, that is included in the content streams and search results described herein.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of a content pre-fetching system 500 for a social networking service 123 implemented in a client/server based environment.
- an identification module 506 implemented in the user's computing device 102 identifies one or more target parties (e.g., other users or entities having a presence in the social network) as having associated content that is likely to be accessed by user 122 .
- party identification and other operations are executed by client side devices. However, a portion or all of the operations may be executed by server-side components, distributed between client- and server-side computing devices, or implemented in one or more other types of computational architectures.
- a content retrieval module 508 executed by the client computing device 102 retrieves (“pre-fetches”) content specific to the identified target party or parties from the server system 112 prior to the user requesting some or all of the content.
- the pre-fetched content is stored in a readily accessible, temporary storage 510 , such as, for instance memory in the user's computing device 102 ; memory on server 112 ; or memory on a local search server, such as a search server that is physically closer to the user or has a shorter network distance to the user than server 112 ;
- the pre-fetched content includes only content to which the user already has access (e.g., public content or content available via a pre-existing relationship in the social network).
- caching of the pre-fetched content occurs only if the user has agreed to caching of the content and/or has opted into the use of the pre-fetching service provided by the social network.
- the content is already local to the user's computing device 102 and thus can be delivered to the user quickly and with little latency. If user 122 requests all of the content that has been pre-fetched, then the entirety of the content is served to the user. Alternatively, if user 122 requests only a portion of the content that has been pre-fetched, then the requested portion is provided. In some cases, the user may request some content that has been pre-fetched and other content that has not been pre-fetched; in this case, the user's computing device 102 may call the server system 112 to retrieve the content that is not already stored locally. In some embodiments, the pre-fetched content may be provided to the user prior to the content that is retrieved from the server system; in other embodiments, the pre-fetched content is delayed such that all content requested by the user is displayed at substantially the same time.
- the identification module 506 is illustrated as including three sub-modules for assisting in identifying one or more target parties.
- a weighting sub-module 512 assigns a weight to each party within the social graph of user 122 based on scores generated by an affinity sub-module 514 and/or an interaction sub-module 516 .
- the weight assigned to each party may be indicative of the likelihood that the user 122 may be interested in accessing content specific to that party. In some embodiments, a higher weight indicates a higher likelihood; however, other weighting schemes are also possible.
- Affinity sub-module 514 assigns a social affinity score to each party on the basis of a social affinity between the party and the user.
- the social affinity score may reflect how the topographic distance between a party and the user correlates with the likelihood that the user will view content specific to that party. For instance, if a user is more likely to view the profile of a direct contact than the profile of a contact of a contact, then the contacts of the user may be assigned a higher social affinity score than the contacts of the contacts of the user.
- the social affinity score may reflect how a user's interactions with a party (e.g., the frequency or type of interaction with content specific to the party) correlate with the likelihood that the user will view content specific to that party.
- the first contact may be assigned a higher social affinity score than the second contact.
- contacts in certain social circles e.g., a user's Close Friends circle
- contacts in other social circles e.g., the user's Acquaintances circle.
- Other models of social affinity may also be used to assign social affinity scores to parties in a user's social graph.
- the social affinity score for a party may also be determined based in part on activity by the party. For instance, parties who have recently posted content on the social network may be assigned a higher social affinity score than parties who have not had any recent activity on the social network.
- the type of content posted may also be a factor in determining the social affinity score: for instance, parties who post rich media, such as photos or videos, may be assigned a higher social affinity score than parties who post plain text.
- the social affinity score may be assigned from a discrete or continuous spectrum of values.
- the social affinity score may be represented by a binary value, for instance, indicative of whether a value representative of the social affinity between the user and a particular party exceeds a threshold social affinity value.
- Interaction sub-module 514 assigns an interaction score to each party in the user's social graph on the basis of the user's interactions with the social network during one or more periods of time. For example, at one extreme, the user's long-term interactions with the social network, e.g., over the last year, or since the user became a member of the social network, can be considered to determine a baseline interaction score for each party.
- the baseline interaction score may reflect the types of interactions that the user commonly has with the social network. For instance, if a user generally views profiles of contacts that live in the same city as the user, those contacts are assigned a higher baseline interaction score than contacts who live elsewhere.
- the user's short-term interactions with the social network can be used to determine an immediacy interaction score for each party.
- the immediacy interaction score may reflect the manner in which the user is currently interacting with the social network. For instance, a user may be viewing contacts from a particular social circle (e.g., contacts from the user's Grade School Friends circle) on a given day; as a result, the immediacy interaction score for all contacts in the user's Grade School Friends circle may be increased for that day and/or for the near future.
- the overall interaction score assigned to each party in the user's social graph is determined based on a combination of the baseline interaction score, the immediacy interaction score, and/or other interaction scores, such as interaction scores representative of interactions during other periods of time.
- a user's interactions with the social network may reflect the type of content with which the user interacts. For instance, if a user preferentially views rich media files, then parties who have a large amount of rich media content may be assigned a higher interaction score. As another example, if a user often views any type of content associated with baseball, including photographs, blog posts, and news articles linked to from a post on the social network, then parties who have content that is related to baseball may be assigned a higher interaction score.
- a user's interactions with the social network may be determined based on simple click data (i.e., which links the user clicks on).
- the user's interactions with the social network may be based on click data modified by an engagement parameter, which may indicate, for instance, how long a user engaged with a clicked link or with material associated with a clicked link.
- the user's interactions with the social network may further include temporally based interactions. For instance, a user may interact differently with the social network depending on the time of day, day of the week, time of year, or other period of time.
- the interaction score for each party may be determined in part based on these temporal aspects. For instance, if a user accesses profiles of certain contacts primarily in the summer (e.g., because the user plays tennis with those contacts in the summer), the interaction score for those contacts may be increased during the summer. As another example, if a user accesses profiles of her coworkers during the week and profiles of her friends on the weekend, the interaction scores for her coworkers and friends can be adjusted according to the day of the week.
- the social affinity score and the interaction score may be combined by weighting sub-module 512 to generate a weight for each party in a user's social graph.
- One or more of the most highly weighted parties may be identified as having a high likelihood of being of interest to the user.
- the N parties having the highest weights are identified, where N is a number determined on a per client basis, e.g., to balance perceived latency with number of server calls.
- N may be dependent on the type of client platform (e.g., desktop computer, laptop computer, or mobile device) and/or the type of connection the client device has with the server (e.g., wireless Internet connection or mobile telephony connection.
- Content retrieval module 508 pre-fetches content specific to the one or more most highly weighted parties from server system 112 . For instance, the activity feed, profile information, photos, videos, and/or other content posted by or otherwise associated with the party may be retrieved.
- the pre-fetched content is stored locally on the user's computing device 102 in a temporary storage 510 , from which it can be quickly retrieved upon request by the user.
- a feedback module 518 determines time-based parameters based on the successes or failures, on a system-wide level and/or a per-user level, with which various factors predict the content that will be requested next by a user.
- the time-based parameters are provided to identification module 506 to promote successful factors and/or to punish unsuccessful factors used by affinity sub-module 514 , interaction sub-module 516 , and/or weighting sub-module 512 in the identification of target parties.
- the time-based parameters act as multipliers for the appropriate factors.
- a particular factor e.g., distance in the social graph
- a positive system-wide multiplier i.e., for a generic user, the factor is a successful predictor
- the time-based parameters may be instrumented and captured on a per-platform basis to reflect variations in user behavior among different client devices.
- feedback module 518 is implemented by a server-side computing device; however, other implementations of feedback module 518 in other locations are also possible.
- FIG. 6 is an example process flow 600 for pre-fetching content specific to parties in a social network in which a user may have an interest.
- a weight is determined for each party in the user's social graph (block 602 ). For instance, as discussed above, the weight may be determined based on a combination of factors such as a social affinity between the user and each party and/or a social network interaction history of the user.
- Target parties in which the user is likely to exhibit an interest are identified based on the weight associated with each party (block 604 ). For instance, in one embodiment, one or more parties having the highest weight are selected as the target party or parties.
- content specific to the target party is collected from the server system serving the social network (block 606 ) prior to receiving a request from the user for content associated with the target party.
- the collected content is stored in a readily accessible, temporary storage on the user's computing device (block 608 ).
- a user request for content associated with the target party is received (block 610 ), such as by the user clicking on a link associated with the content, the content is provided to the user (block 612 ) directly from the local, temporary storage.
- the processes described above are executed by a client computing device, such as the user's computing device.
- these processes are performed by a server, such as a server hosting the social network.
- these processes may be distributed among multiple computing devices, which may be co-located or located in different locations. For instance, one or more steps may be performed by a first computing device while one or more other steps are performed by a second computing device. Alternatively, the execution of a single step may be distributed among multiple computing devices.
