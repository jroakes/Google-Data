Definitions
- This subject matter described herein relates to a graphical user interface for a computing device.
- Many applications that run on computing devices such as various types of computers, mobile phones, PDA (personal digital assistants), portable media players, etc., allow users to enter text in text boxes that are displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI).
- GUI graphical user interface
- Many companies that provide services available through the Internet for example, various search engine providers, such as Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., use text boxes as a means for users to input various information or search queries, etc.
- an auto-complete function is often provided.
- a drop-down menu with suggested words is displayed as the user types the text in the text box.
- the drop-down menu typically changes for each character the user types into the text box in order to provide increasingly relevant suggestions to the user.
- the drop-down menu contains different categories of suggestions. This is the case, for example, in the text search box provided in Google Toolbar, a browser plug-in available from Google Inc.
- the auto-complete drop-down menu can be divided into suggestions matching one or more of the following three different data types: (i) spelling corrections, (ii) search history, and (iii) query suggestions. Having a drop-down menu with the suggestions arranged into categories may make it easier for the user to more quickly find the particular suggestion that matches the word the user is about to enter into the text box.
- Spotlight is a system wide desktop feature that displays an auto-complete drop-down that offers suggestions of many different data types when a user starts typing a word in the text box.
- Some examples of data types include Applications, System Preferences, Documents, Folders, Mail Messages, Contacts, Events & To Do Items, Images, PDF Documents, Bookmarks, Music, Movies, Fonts, etc. That is, not only search queries are suggested, but also names of local files on the user's computer that the user may want to access.
- the suggested words are displayed within a single drop-down menu.
- the drop-down menu can be segmented into different sections with titles acting as delimiters, but ultimately suggestions are still presented as a single list.
- keyboard access to, say, the first item of the third section of the drop-down menu requires stepping through the first two sections before reaching the third section which contains the relevant suggestion. This can often be a nuisance to the user, especially on mobile devices.
- the various implementations provide methods and apparatus, including computer program products, for implementing and using techniques for completing a user entry in an entry field displayed on a user interface of a computing device.
- An entry field is displayed on a display of a computing device.
- two or more distinct auto-complete menus are displayed.
- Each auto-complete menu is included in a separate display element, and each auto-complete menu contains suggestions that correspond to the current at least one character in the entry field.
- Implementations can include one or more of the following features. At least one additional character entry can be received into the entry field and the auto-complete menus can be updated to display increasingly relevant suggestions, based on the current characters in the entry field. A user selection of a suggestion in one of the auto-complete menus can be received to complete the user entry in the entry field.
- Each auto-complete menu can contain a distinct category of suggestions. The categories of suggestions can include contact entries, suggested search queries, spelling corrections, computing device applications, computing system preferences, document names, folder names, email messages, to-do items, image names, bookmarks, or media file names.
- the two or more auto-complete menus can be displayed adjacent to the entry field. Each of the two or more auto-complete menus can be displayed as a separate menu at a distance from the entry field. Each auto-complete menu can be accessible through a single keystroke by the user when the entry field is in focus. Each auto-complete menu can be accessible through a keyboard shortcut by the user when the entry field is in focus.
- a user selection of an auto-complete menu can be received and, in response to receiving the user selection, the selected auto-complete menu can be split into two or more sub-menus, where each sub-menu contains a sub-category of suggestions to the suggestions in the auto-complete menu, and a user selection of a suggestion in one of the sub-menus can be received to complete the user entry in the entry field.
- the various implementations provide methods and apparatus, including computer program products, implementing and using techniques for pre-fetching search query results corresponding to a user entry in a search query box displayed on a user interface of a computing device.
- a search query box for accepting search terms from a user is provided.
- one or more suggestions for one or more completed search terms are generated.
- Search results corresponding to the one or more suggestions are pre-fetched and categorized into at least two sets. The at least two sets are displayed so that each result set is included in a separate display results box, which is anchored to the search query box used for entering the search query.
- the display results boxes can be displayed so that each display results box extends in a cardinal direction relative to the search query box.
- Various implementations can include one or more of the following advantages. Users can navigate more quickly to a relevant suggested word, using a smaller number of key presses compared to what is typically possible in current drop-down menus. Users typically know where to look for a particular type of data, rather than having to find a particular section in a long drop-down menu. They would also be able to anticipate which arrow key (or other key) to use on their keyboard in order to start navigating the appropriate drop-down menu.
- FIG. 1 shows an empty search query box, in accordance with one implementation.
- FIGS. 2-10 show the search query box of FIG. 1 and two changing auto-complete menus, in accordance with one implementation.
- FIG. 11 shows a final user selection of a contact in one of the auto-complete menus, in accordance with one implementation.
- FIG. 12 shows a message shown to a user in response to the selection of the contact shown in FIG. 11 , in accordance with one implementation.
- FIG. 13 shows a search query box with four adjacent auto-complete menus, in accordance with one implementation.
- FIG. 14 shows a search query box with six surrounding auto-complete menus, in accordance with one implementation.
- the purpose of auto-complete mechanisms is to allow users to complete a text field entry with a minimal number of keystrokes.
- the implementations described herein are not directed specifically towards trying to solve this “best guess” problem, although techniques for finding a “best guess” can certainly be used in conjunction with the subject matter described herein.
- the other general way of minimizing the number of keystrokes is through enabling users to quickly navigate to a desired suggestion. This is what will be discussed in further detail below, by way of example.
- the various implementations are particularly useful in situations where suggestions are grouped in multiple lists, such as one list for each data type.
- existing solutions simply present the suggestions as a single list, as was described above, and attempt to order the list based on various ranking heuristics or algorithms.
- Some challenges in ordering the list include figuring out the order of the different data types (e.g., whether spelling suggestions should come before query suggestions in the list, whether the data types should be kept separate or intermingled, etc.).
- a first feature is that navigating to the n:th item of a given list will always take exactly n keystrokes from the input text field. Expressed differently, at any time the input text field is in focus, the user is always n keystrokes away from m different menu items in m different lists.
- a second feature is that each list may consistently appear at the same place every time the user types an input.
- a third feature is that the lists may be used primarily in cases where it makes sense to assume that the user already knows what data type they are looking for, for example, when the user starts typing the name of a contact because she is looking for a “telephone number” data type.
- the various implementations described herein enable input text fields, such as search query boxes, to support more than a single auto-complete menu. While traditional auto-complete mechanisms typically offer a single drop-down menu that appears immediately below the text field, the implementations herein allow for a single input to trigger the simultaneous, or nearly simultaneous, appearance of additional auto-complete menus, where each auto-complete menu contains auto-complete suggestions of a different type of data. For instance, a primary auto-complete menu may appear immediately below the input text field, a secondary auto-complete menu may appear immediately above the input text field, a ternary one to the left of the input text field and a quaternary auto-complete menu may appear immediately to the right of the text input field.
- a single keystroke (e.g., an arrow stroke) may take the user directly into a relevant data category. Minimizing the number of keystrokes may be particularly valuable for users of mobile computing devices, as these devices have relatively small displays and often lack mouse-like pointing devices. It is also a valuable feature in terms of general accessibility on any type of computing device for people who have difficulties using a computer mouse or equivalent type of pointing device.
- a search query box a text input field in a search engine
- FIG. 1 shows an empty search query box ( 100 ) with a cursor ( 102 ) inside it.
- the search query box ( 100 ) is in focus, that is, the search query box ( 100 ) is ready to receive textual input at the location of the cursor ( 102 ) from a user.
- FIG. 2 shows what happens in response to the user typing the character “h” in the search query box ( 100 ).
- Two auto-complete menus ( 202 ; 204 ) are displayed.
- the first auto-complete menu ( 202 ) which is displayed above the search query box ( 100 ) contains a list with suggestions of a first data type, in this case a list of contact names for the user.
- the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ), which is displayed below the search query box ( 100 ) contains a list with suggestions of a second data type, in this case a list of suggested search queries.
- the suggestions in the auto-complete menus are displayed before the actual search query is completed, that is, the suggestions are aimed at completing an incomplete search query entered by the user prior to conducting the actual search.
- the same type of data always occur in the same place, that is, the contact list is always shown above the search query box ( 100 ) and the list of suggested search queries is always shown below the search query box ( 100 ), using the above example. This facilitates for the user to find the right information, since the user will be familiar with what portion on the interface will contain the type of information he or she is looking for.
- the two auto-complete menus ( 202 ; 204 ) change.
- the user has typed the letter “e”, which causes the first auto-complete menu ( 202 ) to display a smaller selection of contacts that match the “he” letter combination in the search query box ( 100 ).
- the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) displays a modified list of suggestions, which has the same length as the first list, but is more relevant for the “he” letter combination.
- FIG. 4 shows a similar refinement as shown in FIG. 3 , but for the new letter combination “hel”. It should be noted that while the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) is illustrated in the figures as having 10 entries, it can have any number of entries that is deemed to be appropriate. The number of entries in the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) can of course also vary dynamically instead of staying the same as the user continues to enter letters into the search query box ( 100 ).
- the user presses the “down arrow” key on his keyboard, which causes the suggestion “hello kitty” ( 500 ) in the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) to be highlighted, as shown in FIG. 5 .
- the user can continue to press the down arrow key to step down the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) and highlight different search suggestions, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 .
- the user can move up through the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) by pressing an “up arrow” on his keyboard, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 .
- the search query box ( 100 ) is back in focus, as shown in FIG. 10 .
- Another press of the up arrow key causes the first suggestion of the first auto-complete menu ( 202 ), “Helen Leynott” to be highlighted, as shown in FIG. 11 .
- the user decides that this is the selection he is interested in and pushes the “enter” key on his computing device.
- the enter key causes the selected contact to be called, as shown in FIG. 12 . It should however, be realized that any other appropriate action can be taken.
- an e-mail or SMS (short message system) interface could be opened up for a contact, or the user could be presented with a number of options of how he would like to communicate with the selected contact.
- a selection in the second auto-complete menu ( 204 ) typically causes a search to be conducted for the selected search term. As the reader realizes, these are just a few examples, and many further variations are possible.
- FIG. 13 shows an implementation where four auto-complete menus ( 1302 , 1304 , 1306 , 1308 ) are displayed, one on each side of the text input field ( 100 ). Similar to the operations described above with respect to FIGS. 1-12 , the auto-complete menus ( 1306 , 1308 ) located on the respective sides of the search query box ( 100 ) can display suggestions matching what the user is entering into the search query box ( 100 ). As can be seen in FIG. 13 , the left auto-complete menu ( 1306 ) shows image results, which can be presented, for example in a textual format with the file names or as image “thumbnails” corresponding to the file names.
- the right auto-complete menu ( 1308 ) contains names of documents located on the user's computer or in some other remote file repository specified by the user.
- the left and right auto-complete menus are as easily accessible as the top and bottom auto-complete menus, through using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard of the computing device.
- “images”, “contacts”, “search suggestions”, and “documents” are merely examples of different categories of menu items that can be displayed in the auto-complete menus ( 1302 , 1304 , 1306 , 1308 ). In many implementations, these categories can be customized by the user to the types of items or suggestions that will be most relevant for the user's purposes.
- the types of auto-complete menus may also vary depending on the application in which they are used.
- a search suggestion menu and a history list of previously visited websites may be displayed, whereas in a word processing application, spelling suggestions, definitions, phrases within a certain document where a particular word occurs, etc., can be displayed in the various auto-complete menus.
- each auto-complete menu ( 1402 through 1412 ) has a header and a number, and to get to the relevant menu, the user simply presses the number of the menu, or some other keyboard shortcut, just as easily as pressing one of the arrow keys on the keyboard.
- the user simply presses the number of the menu, or some other keyboard shortcut, just as easily as pressing one of the arrow keys on the keyboard.
- the arrow keys can be used to navigate to the desired entry within the selected menu, as described above.
- the suggestions within each auto-complete menu can also be enumerated, such that the user can press, for example “Ctrl+4” to get to auto-complete menu number four (i.e., the Documents menu 108 ) and then “3” to select the third item listed in that menu.
- search query box is not spatially constrained by other UI elements surrounding it, and where it makes sense to use a single search query box to search multiple data types.
- search query box is not spatially constrained by other UI elements surrounding it, and where it makes sense to use a single search query box to search multiple data types.
- a text field on the main page could be used to either (i) retrieve a contact's phone number and make a call, or (ii) run a standard web search, as described above.
- the various implementations described herein can be used by anyone designing an interface that attempts to present the user with suggestions of multiple data types, based on a single user input that is not type-specific.
- Various implementations can be realized by means of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. Apparatus can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage device for execution by a programmable processor; and method steps can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output.
- Various implementations can include one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- Each computer program can be implemented in a high-level procedural or object-oriented programming language, or in assembly or machine language if desired; and in any case, the language can be a compiled or interpreted language.
- Suitable processors include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors.
- a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory and/or a random access memory.
- a computer will include one or more mass storage devices for storing data files; such devices include magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and optical disks.
- Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM disks. Any of the foregoing can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).
- semiconductor memory devices such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices
- magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks
- magneto-optical disks magneto-optical disks
- CD-ROM disks CD-ROM disks
- the various implementations can run on a computer system having a display device such as a monitor or LCD screen for displaying information to the user.
- the user can provide input to the computer system through various input devices such as a keyboard and a pointing device, such as a mouse, a trackball, a microphone, a touch-sensitive display, a transducer card reader, a magnetic or paper tape reader, a tablet, a stylus, a voice or handwriting recognizer, or any other well-known input device such as, of course, other computers.
- the computer system can be programmed to provide a graphical user interface through which computer programs interact with users.
- the processor optionally can be coupled to a computer or telecommunications network, for example, an Internet network, or an intranet network, using a network connection, through which the processor can receive information from the network, or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above-described method steps.
- a computer or telecommunications network for example, an Internet network, or an intranet network
- Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using the processor, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.
- there may be branching menus so that when a particular menu or menu item is selected, it splits into two separate sub-menus. This can be useful, for example, in a contact list, where one sub-menu can show telephone numbers, and another sub-menu can show email addresses for a selected contact.
- actual searches can be carried out that correspond to the suggestions in the auto-complete menu. That is, the search results corresponding to the suggestions can actually be pre-fetched to the user's computing device.
- the search results are essentially instantaneously available and the user does not have to wait further for the search of the selected suggestion to be conducted.
- the suggestions can be displayed in a textual format, or as image thumbnails. Having image thumbnails may be particularly useful, for example, when the user is looking for images, web pages, etc.
- the image thumbnails can also, for example, represent title pages of documents, books, applications, etc., which may further facilitate for the user to find the content she is looking for.
- various other techniques can be used in conjunction with displaying suggestions. For example, a callout box with an excerpt from a document can be displayed when a user “mouses over” a suggestion, or an enlarged version of an image thumbnail can be displayed to the user when she mouses over an image thumbnail.
- a callout box with an excerpt from a document can be displayed when a user “mouses over” a suggestion, or an enlarged version of an image thumbnail can be displayed to the user when she mouses over an image thumbnail.
