Definitions
- This specification relates to activity-based segmentation of user histories.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, video or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, book articles, and news articles.
- the World Wide Web (the web) is large and complex. In the process of conducting research on a topic of interest, a user may navigate the web and in doing so will often browse through many resources.
- a task encompasses the acts of issuing queries and selecting (and not selecting) resources that a search engine determines to be responsive to the queries.
- a task generally relates to one or more related topics, and a user may be engaged in multiple tasks. For example, assume a user, over the course of several days or weeks, is planning a trip to Kenya and is also planning a child's summer.
- each task the Kenya trip and the children's summer activities—the user issues queries and selects resources that map into multiple sessions over the several days or weeks.
- each task may relate one or more topics, e.g., horseback riding and canoeing for the summer activities, and flights, hotels, safaris and immunizations for the Kenya trip.
- Typical web browsers can retain the user's browser history.
- the user can also use server or cloud based services (e.g., Google Web History). Reviewing web histories enables the user to recall particular resources that the user may have found to be very informative for a particular topic.
- server or cloud based services e.g., Google Web History.
- Reviewing web histories enables the user to recall particular resources that the user may have found to be very informative for a particular topic.
- chronological histories provide a list of user actions in the order they occurred, and do not partition the histories by task.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing action trail data that corresponds to a task and resources related to that task, wherein each task relates to one or more related topics and is defined by a sequence of user actions corresponding to the resources related to that task; clustering the action trails based on the action trail data such that each action trail cluster corresponds to a particular task and includes the action trails corresponding to that particular task; and for each action trail cluster, ranking the resources that correspond to the included action trails according to the topics of the particular task.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Each action trail cluster may comprise one or more action trails corresponding to the particular task of the action trail cluster, and each of the one or more action trails may meet a similarity threshold for the action trail cluster to which the action trail belongs.
- Each action trail cluster may be associated with a cluster identifier, the cluster identifier being based on the particular task corresponding to the action trail cluster.
- Each topic may be associated with one or more resources to which the action trails included in the action trail cluster correspond and that meet a similarity threshold for that topic.
- Ranking the resources may further comprise ranking the resources according to a click through rate associated with each resource, the click through rate being a rate at which a resource is selected when presented to a user in response to a query.
- the actions may further comprise: determining whether a user is engaged in a task, and in response to determining that the user is engaged in a particular task: identifying an action trail cluster that corresponds to the particular task; identifying at least one resource corresponding to an action trail that corresponds to the identified action trail cluster as a task relevant resource; and providing data identifying the at least one task relevant resource.
- Determining that the user is engaged in a task may comprise receiving explicit user feedback indicating that the user is engaged in a task. Determining that the user is engaged in a task may be based on the user's resource access history, the resource access history describing one or more user actions, each user action being associated with a resource upon which the user action is performed.
- the actions may further comprise: receiving data identifying a query relevant resource that is determined to be responsive to a query; and wherein determining whether a user is engaged in a task comprises determining whether a user associated with the query is engaged in a task; identifying an action trail cluster comprises identifying an action trail cluster including an action trail for which the query relevant resource is a corresponding resource; identifying at least one resource comprises identifying at least one other corresponding resource for an action trail that belongs to the identified action trail cluster as a task relevant resource; and providing data comprises providing data identifying the at least one task relevant resource in response to the query.
- At least one resource identified as a task relevant resource may be associated with a first topic that is different from a second topic associated with the query relevant resource.
- Providing data identifying the at least one task relevant resource may comprise: providing data for generating a display of a topic environment to the user, wherein the topic environment includes references to resources corresponding to action trails included in the action trail cluster associated with the particular task.
- the topic environment may include a plurality of reference groups and each reference group may correspond to a particular topic of the action trail cluster, and each reference group may include one or more references to resources corresponding to the particular topic of the action trail cluster associated with the particular task.
- the subject matter described in this specification may combine detailed research conducted by multiple users to help a particular user locate relevant information that he or she may have otherwise not located.
- the system implements a “crowdsourcing” technique that aggregates data for related topics for multiple users and identifies information that is relevant to a task from the aggregated data.
- the relevant information can be identified and presented to a user even when the user issues queries that do not, by themselves, result in the search engine identifying the relevant information for the user.
- combining task data for multiple users also identifies particular topics associated with a task, which further satisfies the informational needs of users by informing users of relevant topics for a particular task.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which a task aggregation system aggregates task data from tasks of multiple users.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example data flow in which action trails are clustered and their corresponding resources are ranked.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example data flow in which task-relevant resources are provided in response to a query.

- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example data processing apparatus.
- Some search systems can organize the user's history into “action trails.” Each action trail corresponds to one or more related topics of a task and to resources relating to those topics, and is defined by a sequence of user actions taken by the user that correspond to the resources. While this is very helpful in organizing the user's personal history, the user must still search the web and read numerous resources to find the relevant information.
- the user when a user is researching a task, the user will often issue multiple queries for each topic to which the task relates and manually browse resources presented in response to the queries. Because the user may not know what search queries to enter, or because the user may not be familiar with the resources presented in response to each query, the user may not discover resources which are particularly relevant to their task. For example, with respect to the task of planning a trip to Kenya, the user may overlook immunization requirements. Likewise, when planning the child's summer, the user may not discover a particularly highly-rated horseback riding camp because it was not presented as a summer camp for children. Thus, even when the search system can organize information for each of the user's particular tasks, the user still may not discover particular resources that are relevant for each task.
- the activities of many different users define activity patterns that arise out of many relatively simple interactions. While recognizable but complex sets of activities may emerge from the many different interactions, the relationship among the activities can often be difficult, if not impossible, to classify a priori.
- This specification describes technologies relating to activity-based user histories. Complex sets of activities are compared and, based on the comparisons, a collection of related topics and corresponding resources identified from the particular tasks of users emerges. The emergence can occur based on user actions or inaction, without a preexisting ontology.
- a user uses a search engine to find the resources the user needs to plan a trip to Kenya.
- the task of planning the trip includes visiting many web pages, issuing multiple search engine queries, clicking on multiple web page hyperlinks, viewing various images, watching videos, etc.
- the search engine aggregates topic data describing the other users' research and the particular user's research to form a combined set of task data relating to Kenya travel.
- data concerning user research may be anonymized using conventional methods.
- the particular user researching a trip to Kenya may be provided with an identification of resources (e.g., links, search results, etc.) that previous users found relevant to the task of planning a trip to Kenya.
- resources e.g., links, search results, etc.
- These resources can be identified based on the combined topic data, and thus may be identified for a user despite the user having not issued a query that would otherwise be required for the search engine to identify the resource.
- Relevant resources from other users' research may be further focused to the particular stage of research by also filtering based on temporal activity data.
- a user beginning research on a safari trip to Kenya may have only planned on searching for safari packages, flights and hotels, but may not have considered searching for other information relevant to the task of planning a trip to Kenya (e.g., resources related to restaurants, travel visas, medical immunizations, exchange rates, etc.).
- resources related to restaurants, travel visas, medical immunizations, exchange rates, etc. may not be as useful as the resources other users planning a trip to Kenya found.
- the search engine determines to be related to the task of Kenya travel. Accordingly, the search engine identifies resources and, optionally, topics related to Kenya travel, and provides this information to the user. Thus, the search engine provides the user with the information that is determined to be very relevant to the task by aggregating (e.g., crowdsourcing) previous users' research.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a task aggregation system 110 aggregates topic data from topics of multiple users.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the example environment 100 also includes a search system 104 , a search index 106 , an action trail data store 108 , an aggregated task data store 112 , user devices 114 , and resources 116 . While the search system 104 and task aggregation system 110 are depicted separately, they may be realized as part of a single system.
- a resource 116 is any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 116 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 116 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 114 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 116 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 114 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 114 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- User devices 114 can submit search queries to the search system 104 over the network 102 .
- the search system 104 accesses a search index 106 to identify resources 116 that are relevant to the search query.
- the search system 104 identifies the resources 116 in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 114 in search results pages.
- a search result is data generated by the search system 104 that identifies resources 116 that are responsive to a particular search query, and typically includes a link to the resources 116 .
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page or other relevant resource.
- a user that is interested in a finding a hotel for a vacation may research hotels by submitting one or more search queries to the search system 104 in an effort to identify information that will assist the user in finding details about various hotels.
- a user that is interested in finding a hotel in Kenya may submit search queries such as “hotels in Kenya,” “What are the best hotels in Kenya,” “Hotel Brand X in Kenya.”
- search queries such as “hotels in Kenya,” “What are the best hotels in Kenya,” “Hotel Brand X in Kenya.”
- the user may be provided search results that have been identified as responsive to the search query (e.g., have at least a minimum threshold relevance to the search query, for example, based on cosine similarity measures or clustering techniques).
- the user can then select one or more of the search results to request presentation of a web page or another resource 116 that is referenced by a URL associated with the search result.
- Each user may research multiple related topics as part of a greater body of research. For example, a user that is interested in planning a vacation may submit queries to the search system 104 for hotels, flights, travel visa information, immunizations, or other information related to vacation planning. Provided the user has opted-in or otherwise chosen to allow the search system 104 to store a web history, the web history may be kept for the user performing research on the network 102 using the search system 104 . Web history provides a history of user activities performed sequentially in a time period. The user activities may be user actions associated with various resources (e.g., webpages, images, or other resources) on the web. In some implementations, stored web histories may also be anonymized.
- resources e.g., webpages, images, or other resources
- the search system 104 generates action trails for a user from that user's web history, and stores them in the action trail data store 108 .
- Action trails are sequences of user activities that are grouped together based on semantic and temporal criteria (e.g., when the user activities are related to each other semantically and temporally). Each action trail is specific to one user.
- action trails are one-dimensional strings of temporally ordered events, starting from the most recent and going back in time.
- an event is a recorded user action (e.g., a page view, copying text) or inaction (e.g., no page view) for a particular resource (e.g., a webpage).
- An event is an entry in the web history, and describes actions taken and inactions on the part of the user. For example, for the query “Kenya travel,” the events may include the query, the search results presented to the user, and the search results the user selected. The event also includes other user activity information (e.g., time, number of visits, etc.). Action trails are used, for example, to aid users in creating and reestablishing context across fragmented research activity without requiring the users to explicitly structure and organize the material. Action trails are more specifically described with reference to FIG. 2 below.
- the task aggregation system 110 builds on the utility of action trails by aggregating action trail data for multiple users.
- the task aggregation system accesses the action trail data stored in the action trail data store 108 , and clusters the action trails according to particular tasks.
- the task aggregation system 110 may determine a particular task, e.g., “Kenya travel”, and accesses all action trails that correspond to this task.
- task data for multiple users relating to Kenya travel are clustered into an action trail cluster for “Kenya travel.”
- an action trail cluster may be defined by the action trails included in that cluster such that the task associated with the cluster may not be explicitly identified.
- action trails may be clustered based on similarities in the action trail data alone, regardless of any identified task associated with any particular action trail.
- the task aggregation system 110 stores the action trail clusters in the aggregated task data store 112 .
- the task aggregation system 110 also ranks the resources corresponding to each action trail cluster according to topics of the particular task to which the action trail cluster corresponds. For example, resources related to “flights to Kenya” may be ranked separately from resources related to “hotels in Kenya.” The ranking of resources within each action trail cluster is more specifically described with reference to FIG. 2 below.
- a user may perform research using the search system 104 while engaged in a particular task (e.g., planning a trip to Kenya).
- the particular task may be identified by the user or by the search system 104 (e.g., by using semantic and temporal analysis of a user's web history). For example, the search system may determine that a user is planning a trip to Kenya based on the user's recent search queries: “flights to Kenya” and “do I need a travel visa to visit Kenya,” and user actions taken on resources presented in response to those queries.
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies an action trail cluster that corresponds to the particular task and provides data identifying one or more task relevant resources for presentation to the user.
- the task relevant resources can be identified independent of the user's historical actions for the topics.
- a user engaged in the task of planning a trip to Kenya may submit the query, “flights to Kenya” to the search system 104 .
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies the “Kenya travel” action trail cluster, which contains action trails including data identifying resources related to the topics “flights to Kenya” and “hotels in Kenya.”
- the task aggregation system 110 provides the search system 104 with data identifying at least one resource related to hotels in Kenya.
- the search system 104 may then present the user with data identifying resources relevant to the user's query, and/or resources relevant to the task, “Kenya travel,” that may not otherwise be relevant to the user's query.
- the user may be presented with data identifying resources that were included in action trails of previous users who were planning a trip to Kenya, thus helping the user by using the research of others.
- the process of providing data identifying task relevant resources is more specifically described with reference to FIG. 3 below.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example data flow 200 in which action trails are clustered and their corresponding resources are ranked.
- the task aggregation system 110 accesses data defining action trails 202 stored in the action trail data store 108 .
- Each action trail (e.g., AT 1 , AT 2 , AT 3 . . . ATN) corresponds to a particular task (and, if applicable, topic(s)) for a particular user, and is defined data describing a sequence of user actions (e.g., ⁇ A ⁇ ) taken by the particular user with regard to particular resources (e.g., R, where R is represented by the URL of the resource, or some other resource identifier) that correspond to the particular task.
- particular resources e.g., where R is represented by the URL of the resource, or some other resource identifier
- AT 1 includes data defining the particular task as “Kenya travel,” and represents represent an action trail related to that task.
- Resource R 1 may be a resource related to a first topic, “flights to Kenya,” resources R 2 may be resources related to a second topic, “hotels in Kenya,” resource R 3 may be a resource related to a third topic, “safaris in Kenya,” and resource R 4 may be a resource related to a fourth topic, “immunizations for Kenya.”
- Each resource is associated with a corresponding set of actions for that resource (e.g., ⁇ A ⁇ ). Example actions include viewing the resource, a click on a resource link, a search query entry or submission, etc.
- the generation of action trail data is done by the search system 104 , or another system in data communication with the search system 104 .
- the task aggregation system 110 clusters the action trails into action trail clusters 204 according to their particular tasks.
- action trail cluster 204 is identified by a cluster identifier and represents the cluster associated with the task, “Kenya travel.”
- Each action trail (AT 1 , AT 2 , AT 3 . . . ) in the cluster 204 corresponds to the task “Kenya travel,” and each resource R corresponding to the cluster 204 relates to a topic of the task, “Kenya travel.”
- the cluster identifier need not be human readable, and in some implementations, may be as simple as an identifier of the topics within the action trail cluster 204 .
- each action trail cluster is associated with a similarity threshold (e.g., a semantic similarity threshold), and action trails associated with the action trail cluster must meet or exceed the similarity threshold.
- a similarity threshold e.g., a semantic similarity threshold
- Similarity of action trails may be determined, for example, by a semantic similarity between action trail tasks, topics, resources, and/or actions, or some other similarity/distance metric.
- a resource included in an action trails may be associated with a topic when the resource meets a similarity threshold for that topic.
- determining similarity between action trails may involve analysis of the resources and topics included in each action trail. For example, one action trail may be deemed similar to another action trail if they share a threshold number of resources. In some implementations, the similarity of action trails is determined based on similarity of topics represented by the resources included in the action trails. For example, AT 1 and AT 2 may share the same cluster due to the similarity of the topics identified for each action trail (e.g., AT 1 and AT 2 each include resources related to topics R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 ). An example threshold in the foregoing example may require that a predetermined number, or a certain percent, of the topics represented in a particular action trail match topics included in an action trail cluster.
- the task aggregation system 110 ranks the resources to which the action trails included in the cluster 204 correspond according to the topics of the particular task. For example, the resources of the “Kenya travel” cluster 204 are ranked according to the various topics associated with planning a trip to Kenya.
- Topic 1 may correspond to the topic, “flights to Kenya,” corresponding resource R 1 a may be the top ranked resource for the topic, “flights to Kenya.”
- R 1 b represents the second ranked resource for “flights to Kenya,” while R 1 c and R 1 d are ranked third and fourth, respectively.
- Topic 2 may correspond to the topic, “hotels in Kenya,” and the corresponding resources associated with that topic (e.g., R 2 a , R 2 b , R 2 c , R 2 d , etc.) are ranked accordingly.
- the resources are ranked according to one or more metrics corresponding to each resource.
- the resources related to the topic, “flights to Kenya,” might be ranked according to their click through rate (e.g., the rate at which the resource is selected when a link to the resource is presented in response to a query) or authority score (e.g., the weight attributed to the resource in a directed graph representation of the Internet or portion of the Internet).
- Other example metrics include user ratings associated with each resource, average time spent viewing a resource, amount of textual content, and layout of the resource.
- the foregoing metrics are example metrics only, and another appropriate metric, or combination of appropriate metrics, may be used to rank the resources with respect to the particular cluster.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example data flow 300 in which task relevant resources are provided in response to a query.
- a user 302 uses a user device 304 to submit a query 306 to the search system 104 .
- a user might enter the query, “ABC airline flights to Kenya” and submit it to a search engine.
- the search system 104 identifies a query relevant resource 308 , which is determined by the search system to be responsive to the user's query, and submits the query relevant resource to the task aggregation system 110 .
- the search system 104 determines that the user 302 is engaged in a particular task.
- the determination of whether a user is engaged in a particular task can be based on a variety of factors, and the threshold can be tuned so as to require the user to submit multiple queries and take several actions related to a particular task before a positive determination is made.
- the search system 104 may determine, based on the user's web history (e.g., web pages visited, recent search queries, actions the user takes on various resources, etc.) and/or a current query (e.g., “ABC airline flights to Kenya”) that the user 302 is engaged in planning a trip to Kenya.
- the threshold can be a single occurrence of a query related to the particular task.
- a user need not be logged into any particular service for the determination to be made; and, in some implementations, a user is only identified using an IP (internet protocol) address, and a search query (or other action) is the only data upon which the determination is made.
- IP internet protocol
- a user 302 also requires explicit indication that the user 302 is engaged in a particular task.
- the search system 104 may prompt the user 302 , through the user device 304 , for an indication that the user is engaged in a task, such as presenting a hyperlink with the text “are you planning a trip to Kenya?” to the user. User interaction with the hyperlink will indicate that the user is engaged in the task, “Kenya travel.”
- the search system 104 determines the user is not engaged in a particular task, then the search system 104 provide search results that identify resources that the search system 104 determines to be responsive to the query. For example, the search system 104 may send search results that identify the resource 308 , and that identify other resources. Because the resource 308 is responsive to the instant query, it is referred to as a “query relevant” resource.
- the search system 104 determines the user is engaged in a particular task, the system 104 notifies the task aggregation system 110 that the user is engaged in the particular task, e.g., task 309 , which corresponds to “Kenya travel.”
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies an action trail cluster 310 corresponding to the particular task 309 , e.g., action trail cluster 310 , which is the cluster for “Kenya travel.”
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies at least one task relevant resource.
- a task relevant resource is a resource corresponding to an action trail that, in turn, corresponds to an action trail cluster for the particular task.
- a task relevant resource for the task “Kenya travel” may be any of the resources corresponding to an action trail included in the action trail cluster of the task, “Kenya travel.”
- a task relevant resource that is identified need not, however, be identified for a particular query that the user submitted, as long as the user is determined to be engaged in the task.
- a task relevant resource is a resource that is relevant to a task, but is not necessarily relevant to each query for the particular task.
- a task relevant resource that is not a query relevant resource for an instant query may be identified for the instant query.
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies, as a task relevant resource, others resources that belong to the same topic as the query-relevant resource 308 .
- the query relevant resource 308 is a web page for ABC airline's flights to Kenya (depicted in FIG. 3 as RR)
- the resource belongs to the action trail cluster 310 and to Topic 1 resource R 1 a and/or R 1 b may be identified as a task relevant resource.
- Resource R 1 a is, for example, a web page for XYZ airline's flights to Kenya
- resource R 1 b is a web page with the schedule of flights to Kenya from three other different airlines.
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies, as a task relevant resource, a resource associated with a topic that is different from the topic associated with the query relevant resource.
- the query relevant resource is associated with Topic 1 (e.g., flights to Kenya), and the task aggregation system 110 thus identifies a resource associated with Topic 2 (e.g., hotels in Kenya) and/or Topic 3 (e.g., Safaris in Kenya) as a task relevant resource.
- Topic 1 e.g., flights to Kenya
- Topic 3 e.g., Safaris in Kenya
- the task aggregation system 110 only identifies task relevant resources from action trails which are associated with a user who has a threshold degree of similarity with the user issuing the instant query. For example, if the user who issues the query is from the United States (e.g., determined via a user profile or IP address), the task aggregation system may only identify a task relevant resource from an action trail associated with another user from the United States. Degree of similarity may be determined based on any appropriate factors, such as location, gender, or search history of users.
- Identifying at least one task relevant resource 312 from each topic of the identified action trail cluster 310 helps inform the user of other sub-topics that the user may want or need to research when engaged in a particular task. For example, if there are three topics (Topic 1 , Topic 2 , and Topic 3 ), the task relevant resources may include at least one resource from each topic (e.g., R 1 b , R 2 c , R 3 d ).
- the identified action trail cluster is related to the task “Kenya travel”, and the topics are “Flights to Kenya,” “Hotels in Kenya,” and “Safaris in Kenya.”
- the task relevant resources may include a web page for XYZ airline's flights to Kenya, a web page with a listing of all major hotels in Kenya, and a web page including reviews of Safaris in Kenya.
- the task aggregation system 110 identifies at least one task relevant resource 312 based on the ranking of the resources according to each corresponding topic of the identified action trail cluster 310 .
- action trail cluster 310 depicts a ranked resources view of the action trail cluster, and each resource is ranked within each topic (e.g., R 1 a is ranked higher than R 1 b , which is ranked higher than query-relevant resource RR, etc.).
- the top ranked resource from each topic are identified as task relevant resources to be provided to the user.
- the task aggregation system 110 provides data identifying the task relevant resources 312 . While the query relevant resource 308 may be the most relevant resource for the user's query 306 , the user 302 is also provided with task relevant resources 312 . For example, the task aggregation system may provide data identifying task relevant resources R 1 a , R 2 a , and R 3 a to the search system 104 for eventual display on the user device 304 , along with data identifying the query relevant resource 308 .
- the presentation of data identifying task relevant resources can be done in a variety of ways, such as the environment depicted in FIG. 4A , which is an illustration of an example task environment 400 in which links to task relevant resources are displayed.
- the task environment 400 includes a plurality of reference groups (e.g., 404 a - 404 d ), and each reference group corresponds to a particular topic of the action trail cluster. For example, “Flights to Kenya,” 404 a , “Immunizations for visiting Kenya,” 404 b , “Safaris in Kenya,” 404 c and “Hotels in Kenya,” 404 d are reference groups that correspond to different topics of the action trail cluster associated with the task 402 , “Kenya travel.”
