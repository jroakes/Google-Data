Definitions
- Embodiments of this invention relate generally to search industries and, more particularly, to special purpose machines, systems, methods and computer instructions for displaying location information corresponding to search results.
- Search results typically include a listing of hyperlinks to the location of relevant items on the Internet as well as some information about the search result.
- search result is sometimes accompanied by a physical address for the entity.
- Applicants have recognized that, in many instances, a user may not be able to readily identify locations corresponding to address information traditionally provided with search results. For example, a user may not be able to readily identify a location corresponding to an address of “1500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036” where some addresses on Broadway are located in the Upper Westside of New York City while other addresses on Broadway are located in Times Square. Moreover, Applicants have recognized that in many instances presenting a physical address may be difficult or otherwise clutter the displayed results, especially on smaller display screens such as those of cell phones, PDAs, tablets, and the like.
- a computer-implemented method that includes identifying a set of search results to be provided for display to a user via a search results listing, two or more of the search results being associated with geographic locations, determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations associated with the two or more search results, for each of the two or more search results, identifying a descriptor of a sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result, and providing the set of search results for display, each of the two or more search results to be displayed in association with the identified descriptor of the sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result.
- a system including one or more memories storing instructions and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and executing the instructions stored thereon in order to perform the following steps: identifying a set of search results to be provided for display to a user via a search results listing, two or more of the search results being associated with geographic locations, determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations associated with the two or more search results, for each of the two or more search results, identifying a descriptor of a sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result, and providing the set of search results for display, each of the two or more search results to be displayed in association with the identified descriptor of the sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result.
- a computer-implemented method that includes receiving search result content and rendering the search result content for display.
- a resulting display including a listing of search result items, two or more of the search results each being displayed in associated with descriptors of a region that includes a geographic location corresponding to the search result, the region being a sub-region of a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations associated with the two or more search results.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates a method for displaying search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a table that illustrates a set of search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of a geographic map that illustrates geographic locations corresponding to the set of search results of FIG. 2 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of a webpage displaying map-based search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a query environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- Certain embodiments of the invention include providing concise geographic location information in association with search results.
- the concise geographic location information can include the names of geographic regions (e.g., the name of a neighborhood, a city, a county, or the like) that are provided in-place of complete physical addresses that are typically provided with search results.
- a search result for “New York Cafe” (a restaurant located at 1500 Broadway in Times Squares of New York City) may be accompanied by concise geographic location information specifying the region of “Times Square” as opposed to the physical address of “1500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036”.
- concise geographic location information may be preferred by users as it allows them to quickly assess a geographic location associated with the search result without having to determine a geographic location that corresponds to a physical address. Further, it is expected that use of concise geographic location information may be particularly beneficial with smaller displays (e.g., displays of cell phones, PDAs, tablets, etc.) where display of a full address is not possible due to space constraints or display of the full address would clutter the display.
- smaller displays e.g., displays of cell phones, PDAs, tablets, etc.
- Concise geographic location information displayed can be determined based on geographic locations associated with search results. For example, where some or all of a set of search results to be displayed are associated with geographic locations, the concise geographic location can describe a sub-region of a common geographic region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations.
- the threshold amount can be defined by a given number, a given percentage, a majority, substantially all (e.g., greater than about 95%), all of the geographic locations or the like.
- the concise geographic location information displayed can include descriptors of regions (“sub-regions”) having a level of granularity that is one or more hierarchical levels lower than a level of the smallest common region that includes at least the threshold amount of the geographic locations.
- each search result may be displayed in association with the name of their corresponding neighborhood (e.g., Times Square, Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Central Park, West Village, Bowling Green, etc.).
- the name of the neighborhoods may be displayed in-place of the physical addresses often displayed in association with search results.
- concise geographic location information may be displayed in association with search results
- the physical address or similar geographic location information may be readily available to the user. For example, upon hovering over the text of the concise location information (e.g., a name of a neighborhood), the physical address can be displayed in a pop-up bubble. As a further example, upon copying the text of the concise geographic location information, the physical address can be inserted upon the corresponding paste operation.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates an exemplary method 100 for displaying search results.
- Method 100 includes identifying search results to be displayed, as depicted at block 102 .
- Identifying search results to be displayed can include identifying a listing of search results that are to be displayed to a user. For example, where a user visits a search web page and submits a search query for “New City York Restaurants”, a corresponding search query is submitted to a search server (e.g., a search engine), and the search server processes the search query to identify a listing of search results (e.g., a listing of entities/webpages) corresponding to “New York City Restaurants”.
- FIG. 2 is a table 200 that illustrates an exemplary set of search results 202 .
- Search results 202 includes a listing of search results identified by a search engine in response to the search query for “New York City Restaurants”. Each entry of table 200 corresponds to a given one of the search result of set of search results 202 . Each entry includes an identifier 204 , a descriptor 206 , a location 208 , and an address 210 .
- Identifier 204 may include a unique identifier that is used to distinguish a given entry from other entries/results.
- Descriptor 206 may include a name/title or other descriptive information associated with the corresponding entity.
- Location 208 may specify or otherwise be indicative of a geographic location associated with the corresponding entity.
- Location 208 may represent a set of geographic coordinates (e.g., longitude and latitude coordinates) corresponding to a geographic location of the corresponding entity.
- the location “L 1 ” can represent geographic coordinates corresponding to the geographic location of the address “67 Central Street, New York, N.Y. 10023”.
- Address 210 includes a physical address associated with the corresponding entity.
- Identifying search results to be displayed may include identifying particular ones of the search results that will ultimately be displayed to the user. For example, where a web page only has enough room to display five search results, identifying search results to be displayed can includes identifying the five highest ranked search results of the listing of search results 202 . Accordingly, where table 200 includes a ranked listing of search results 202 , the search results for “Upper Westside Restaurant”, “The City Café”, “Upper Eastside New York Restaurant”, “New York Pizza” and “Lower Eastside Restaurant” may be identified as the search results to be displayed.
- Method 100 includes identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed, as depicted at block 104 .
- Identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed includes identifying locations 208 corresponding to the search results. For example, where the five highest ranked search results of the listing of search results 202 are to be displayed (i.e., the sixth result for “Long Island Pizza” is not a search result returned for display), identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed includes identifying the locations “L 1 ”, “L 2 ”, “L 3 ”, “L 4 ” and “L 5 ” which correspond to the five highest ranked results. Where a given search result is not associated with a location, no location may be identified for that search result. For example, where one of the five results were to include a link to a webpage article, no location may be specified or identified for the search result and, thus, identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed includes identifying only four locations.
- Method 100 includes determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed, as depicted at block 106 .
- Regions may include any variety of geographic regions such as continents, countries, states, counties, cities/towns, postal-codes, neighborhoods, boroughs, or the like. These regions can include various sizes and hierarchical relationships. For example, a city region of a first hierarchical level may contain a plurality of neighborhood regions one level lower in the hierarchy. A region at a lower level than another region is referred to as a sub-region of the other region.
- An exemplary hierarchy of regions includes—from a highest/largest level to lowest/smallest level—continent, country, state, county, city/town, postal-code, and neighborhood.
- Determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed may include determining a region of the lowest-level that includes at least a given number of, at least a given percentage of, at least a majority of, or all of the geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed. For example, where the threshold amount is a majority, a smallest common region includes a region of the lowest-level that includes greater than 50% (e.g., three or more) of the identified geographic locations “L 1 ”, “L 2 ”, “L 3 ”, “L 4 ” and “L 5 ”.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of a geographic map 300 that illustrates geographic locations “L 1 ”, “L 2 ”, “L 3 ”, “L 4 ”, “L 5 ” and “L 6 ” corresponding to the set of search results 202 of FIG. 2 .
- the threshold amount is all of the locations associated with the search results to be displayed
- the smallest common region includes the region labeled “New York City” based on its boundary encompassing all five of the locations “L 1 ”, “L 2 ”, “L 3 ”, “L 4 ” and “L 5 ” associated with the search results to be displayed.
- the region labeled “The State of New York” corresponds to a level (e.g., a state level) that is higher than the level (e.g., city level) corresponding to the region labeled “New York City”
- the region labeled “The State of New York” is not the smallest common region as it is at a higher level than another region (e.g., New York City) that includes all of the locations.
- Method 100 includes identifying descriptors of sub-regions of the smallest common region that include locations associated with the search results to be displayed, as depicted at block 108 .
- the smallest common region is identified as “New York City” having a city level
- descriptors of sub-regions at the neighborhood level i.e., one level below the city level
- the neighborhood descriptors of “The Upper Westside”, “The Upper Eastside”, “The Lower Westside” and “The Lower Eastside” are identified based on each of the neighborhoods including at least one of the locations“L 1 ”, “L 2 ”, “L 3 ”, “L 4 ” and “L 5 ” associated with the search results to be displayed.
- Method 100 includes displaying search results with descriptors of sub-regions including geographic locations associated with search results, as depicted at block 110 .
- Displaying search results with descriptors of sub-regions including geographic locations associated with the search results may include, for each search result displayed, displaying a descriptor that includes the geographic location corresponding to the search result as identified at block 108 .
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an exemplary webpage 400 displaying map-based search results.
- Webpage 400 includes display of a listing of search results 402 and a map 404 .
- Webpage 400 may be generated and served for display to a user, for example via an Internet web browser of a user's computer.
- Search results 402 correspond to the search results identified at block 102 .
- Search results 402 include a concise geographic location descriptor 406 corresponding to a sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the location corresponding to the search result. For example based on “New York City” being identified as the smallest common region and location “L 2 ” being located in “The Lower Westside”, the search result for “The City Café” includes the concise geographic location descriptor of “The Lower Westside”.
- Search results 402 may also include other information about the corresponding entity.
- a search result 402 for “The City Café” includes a hyperlink that can be selected to navigate to a webpage corresponding to a home page for “The City Café”, other contact information (e.g., phone number), or the like. Similar concise location descriptors can be provided for some or all of other search results associated with a geographic location.
- Map 404 includes a geographic mapping of the smallest common region (e.g., New York City) and the corresponding sub-regions (e.g., “The Upper Westside”, “The Upper Eastside”, “The Lower Westside” and “The Lower Eastside”).
- the descriptors may include the address and a cross-street (e.g., the search result for “The City Café” may be displayed in association with the descriptor of “1501 Broadway @ 43 rd St.”).
- a cross-street e.g., the search result for “The City Café” may be displayed in association with the descriptor of “1501 Broadway @ 43 rd St.”.
- concise geographic location information is displayed in association with search results
- the addresses or similar geographic location information may be readily available to the user. For example, upon a user hovering a cursor over (or otherwise selecting) the text of the concise location information “The Upper Westside” of the search result for “New York Pizza”, the corresponding physical address “100 Broadway, New York City, N.Y., 10023” may be displayed in a pop-up bubble 410 . As a further example, upon a user selecting to copy the text “The Upper Westside” of the concise geographic location information, the physical address of “100 Broadway, New York City, N.Y., 10023” may be provided upon the corresponding paste operation.

- 2. Description of the Related Art
- Persons employ Internet searches in an effort to locate items that interest them from the millions of items available on the Internet. For example, a user may submit a search for “New York City Restaurants” in hopes of locating webpages, maps, and the like that provide information regarding restaurants in New York City. Search results typically include a listing of hyperlinks to the location of relevant items on the Internet as well as some information about the search result. In the case of a search result corresponding to an entity having a geographic location, the search result is sometimes accompanied by a physical address for the entity.
- Applicants have recognized that, in many instances, a user may not be able to readily identify locations corresponding to address information traditionally provided with search results. For example, a user may not be able to readily identify a location corresponding to an address of “1500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036” where some addresses on Broadway are located in the Upper Westside of New York City while other addresses on Broadway are located in Times Square. Moreover, Applicants have recognized that in many instances presenting a physical address may be difficult or otherwise clutter the displayed results, especially on smaller display screens such as those of cell phones, PDAs, tablets, and the like.
- Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for displaying search results are provided herein. In some embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method that includes identifying a set of search results to be provided for display to a user via a search results listing, two or more of the search results being associated with geographic locations, determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations associated with the two or more search results, for each of the two or more search results, identifying a descriptor of a sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result, and providing the set of search results for display, each of the two or more search results to be displayed in association with the identified descriptor of the sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result.
- In some embodiments, provided is a system including one or more memories storing instructions and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and executing the instructions stored thereon in order to perform the following steps: identifying a set of search results to be provided for display to a user via a search results listing, two or more of the search results being associated with geographic locations, determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations associated with the two or more search results, for each of the two or more search results, identifying a descriptor of a sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result, and providing the set of search results for display, each of the two or more search results to be displayed in association with the identified descriptor of the sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the geographic location associated with the search result.
- In some embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method that includes receiving search result content and rendering the search result content for display. A resulting display including a listing of search result items, two or more of the search results each being displayed in associated with descriptors of a region that includes a geographic location corresponding to the search result, the region being a sub-region of a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations associated with the two or more search results.

FIG. 2 is a table that illustrates a set of search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 3 is an illustration of a geographic map that illustrates geographic locations corresponding to the set of search results ofFIG. 2 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of a webpage displaying map-based search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a query environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. - As discussed in more detail below, provided are embodiments of systems and methods for displaying geographic location information corresponding to search results. Certain embodiments of the invention include providing concise geographic location information in association with search results. The concise geographic location information can include the names of geographic regions (e.g., the name of a neighborhood, a city, a county, or the like) that are provided in-place of complete physical addresses that are typically provided with search results. For example, a search result for “New York Cafe” (a restaurant located at 1500 Broadway in Times Squares of New York City) may be accompanied by concise geographic location information specifying the region of “Times Square” as opposed to the physical address of “1500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036”. It is expected that such concise geographic location information may be preferred by users as it allows them to quickly assess a geographic location associated with the search result without having to determine a geographic location that corresponds to a physical address. Further, it is expected that use of concise geographic location information may be particularly beneficial with smaller displays (e.g., displays of cell phones, PDAs, tablets, etc.) where display of a full address is not possible due to space constraints or display of the full address would clutter the display.
- Concise geographic location information displayed can be determined based on geographic locations associated with search results. For example, where some or all of a set of search results to be displayed are associated with geographic locations, the concise geographic location can describe a sub-region of a common geographic region that includes at least a threshold amount of the geographic locations. The threshold amount can be defined by a given number, a given percentage, a majority, substantially all (e.g., greater than about 95%), all of the geographic locations or the like. The concise geographic location information displayed can include descriptors of regions (“sub-regions”) having a level of granularity that is one or more hierarchical levels lower than a level of the smallest common region that includes at least the threshold amount of the geographic locations. For example, where a set of ten search results to be displayed all fall within the city limits of New York City, the smallest common level may be identified as the “city” level, the next lower level of granularity may be identified as the “neighborhood” level, and, thus, each search result may be displayed in association with the name of their corresponding neighborhood (e.g., Times Square, Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Central Park, West Village, Bowling Green, etc.). The name of the neighborhoods may be displayed in-place of the physical addresses often displayed in association with search results.
- Although concise geographic location information may be displayed in association with search results, the physical address or similar geographic location information may be readily available to the user. For example, upon hovering over the text of the concise location information (e.g., a name of a neighborhood), the physical address can be displayed in a pop-up bubble. As a further example, upon copying the text of the concise geographic location information, the physical address can be inserted upon the corresponding paste operation.

FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates anexemplary method 100 for displaying search results.Method 100 includes identifying search results to be displayed, as depicted atblock 102. Identifying search results to be displayed can include identifying a listing of search results that are to be displayed to a user. For example, where a user visits a search web page and submits a search query for “New City York Restaurants”, a corresponding search query is submitted to a search server (e.g., a search engine), and the search server processes the search query to identify a listing of search results (e.g., a listing of entities/webpages) corresponding to “New York City Restaurants”.FIG. 2 is a table 200 that illustrates an exemplary set ofsearch results 202.Search results 202 includes a listing of search results identified by a search engine in response to the search query for “New York City Restaurants”. Each entry of table 200 corresponds to a given one of the search result of set ofsearch results 202. Each entry includes anidentifier 204, adescriptor 206, alocation 208, and anaddress 210. -
Identifier 204 may include a unique identifier that is used to distinguish a given entry from other entries/results.Descriptor 206 may include a name/title or other descriptive information associated with the corresponding entity.Location 208 may specify or otherwise be indicative of a geographic location associated with the corresponding entity.Location 208 may represent a set of geographic coordinates (e.g., longitude and latitude coordinates) corresponding to a geographic location of the corresponding entity. For example, the location “L1” can represent geographic coordinates corresponding to the geographic location of the address “67 Central Street, New York, N.Y. 10023”.Address 210 includes a physical address associated with the corresponding entity. - Identifying search results to be displayed may include identifying particular ones of the search results that will ultimately be displayed to the user. For example, where a web page only has enough room to display five search results, identifying search results to be displayed can includes identifying the five highest ranked search results of the listing of
search results 202. Accordingly, where table 200 includes a ranked listing ofsearch results 202, the search results for “Upper Westside Restaurant”, “The City Café”, “Upper Eastside New York Restaurant”, “New York Pizza” and “Lower Eastside Restaurant” may be identified as the search results to be displayed. -
Method 100 includes identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed, as depicted atblock 104. Identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed includes identifyinglocations 208 corresponding to the search results. For example, where the five highest ranked search results of the listing ofsearch results 202 are to be displayed (i.e., the sixth result for “Long Island Pizza” is not a search result returned for display), identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed includes identifying the locations “L1”, “L2”, “L3”, “L4” and “L5” which correspond to the five highest ranked results. Where a given search result is not associated with a location, no location may be identified for that search result. For example, where one of the five results were to include a link to a webpage article, no location may be specified or identified for the search result and, thus, identifying geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed includes identifying only four locations. -
Method 100 includes determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed, as depicted atblock 106. - Regions may include any variety of geographic regions such as continents, countries, states, counties, cities/towns, postal-codes, neighborhoods, boroughs, or the like. These regions can include various sizes and hierarchical relationships. For example, a city region of a first hierarchical level may contain a plurality of neighborhood regions one level lower in the hierarchy. A region at a lower level than another region is referred to as a sub-region of the other region. An exemplary hierarchy of regions includes—from a highest/largest level to lowest/smallest level—continent, country, state, county, city/town, postal-code, and neighborhood.
- Determining a smallest common region that includes at least a threshold amount of geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed may include determining a region of the lowest-level that includes at least a given number of, at least a given percentage of, at least a majority of, or all of the geographic locations associated with search results to be displayed. For example, where the threshold amount is a majority, a smallest common region includes a region of the lowest-level that includes greater than 50% (e.g., three or more) of the identified geographic locations “L1”, “L2”, “L3”, “L4” and “L5”.
-
FIG. 3 is an illustration of ageographic map 300 that illustrates geographic locations “L1”, “L2”, “L3”, “L4”, “L5” and “L6” corresponding to the set ofsearch results 202 ofFIG. 2 . Where the threshold amount is all of the locations associated with the search results to be displayed, the smallest common region includes the region labeled “New York City” based on its boundary encompassing all five of the locations “L1”, “L2”, “L3”, “L4” and “L5” associated with the search results to be displayed. Notably, where the region labeled “The State of New York” corresponds to a level (e.g., a state level) that is higher than the level (e.g., city level) corresponding to the region labeled “New York City”, the region labeled “The State of New York” is not the smallest common region as it is at a higher level than another region (e.g., New York City) that includes all of the locations. -
Method 100 includes identifying descriptors of sub-regions of the smallest common region that include locations associated with the search results to be displayed, as depicted atblock 108. Where the smallest common region is identified as “New York City” having a city level, descriptors of sub-regions at the neighborhood level (i.e., one level below the city level) that include one or more of the locations are identified. For example, the neighborhood descriptors of “The Upper Westside”, “The Upper Eastside”, “The Lower Westside” and “The Lower Eastside” are identified based on each of the neighborhoods including at least one of the locations“L1”, “L2”, “L3”, “L4” and “L5” associated with the search results to be displayed. -
Method 100 includes displaying search results with descriptors of sub-regions including geographic locations associated with search results, as depicted atblock 110. Displaying search results with descriptors of sub-regions including geographic locations associated with the search results may include, for each search result displayed, displaying a descriptor that includes the geographic location corresponding to the search result as identified atblock 108. -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of anexemplary webpage 400 displaying map-based search results.Webpage 400 includes display of a listing ofsearch results 402 and amap 404.Webpage 400 may be generated and served for display to a user, for example via an Internet web browser of a user's computer. Search results 402 correspond to the search results identified atblock 102. Search results 402 include a concisegeographic location descriptor 406 corresponding to a sub-region of the smallest common region that includes the location corresponding to the search result. For example based on “New York City” being identified as the smallest common region and location “L2” being located in “The Lower Westside”, the search result for “The City Café” includes the concise geographic location descriptor of “The Lower Westside”. Search results 402 may also include other information about the corresponding entity. For example, asearch result 402 for “The City Café” includes a hyperlink that can be selected to navigate to a webpage corresponding to a home page for “The City Café”, other contact information (e.g., phone number), or the like. Similar concise location descriptors can be provided for some or all of other search results associated with a geographic location.Map 404 includes a geographic mapping of the smallest common region (e.g., New York City) and the corresponding sub-regions (e.g., “The Upper Westside”, “The Upper Eastside”, “The Lower Westside” and “The Lower Eastside”). - In some embodiments, where all of the results are in the same lowest level region (e.g., all in the same neighborhood), additional location information can be provided to further distinguish their locations. For example, where all search results are located in the Lower Westside, the descriptors may include the address and a cross-street (e.g., the search result for “The City Café” may be displayed in association with the descriptor of “1501 Broadway @ 43rd St.”). Thus, a user can determine relative locations of results within the neighborhood or similar lowest level region.
- Although concise geographic location information is displayed in association with search results, the addresses or similar geographic location information may be readily available to the user. For example, upon a user hovering a cursor over (or otherwise selecting) the text of the concise location information “The Upper Westside” of the search result for “New York Pizza”, the corresponding physical address “100 Broadway, New York City, N.Y., 10023” may be displayed in a pop-up
bubble 410. As a further example, upon a user selecting to copy the text “The Upper Westside” of the concise geographic location information, the physical address of “100 Broadway, New York City, N.Y., 10023” may be provided upon the corresponding paste operation. -
