- TFC utility 110 provides a timing error estimate for (a) a contiguous/short tile grid separation and (b) a non-contiguous/long tile grid separation.
- TFC utility 110 is also able to provide timing and frequency error correction for all data symbols (e.g., first data symbol 204 and second data symbol 205 within pattern A 201 , third data symbol 216 and fourth data symbol 217 within pattern B 210 of two users (e.g., MS 101 , MS 102 ) that are superposed in a tile, where each user device has separate timing and frequency errors.
- data symbols e.g., first data symbol 204 and second data symbol 205 within pattern A 201 , third data symbol 216 and fourth data symbol 217 within pattern B 210 of two users (e.g., MS 101 , MS 102 ) that are superposed in a tile, where each user device has separate timing and frequency errors.
- TFC utility 110 initiates a process to determine a timing error estimate by utilizing tiles within a slot interval (i.e., an interval of six (6) tiles).
- TFC utility 110 selects a group of tiles such that the distance of each pair of tiles is less than a specific number (“T”) of tones.
- TFC utility 110 calculates a tone separation value between unique pairs of the selected tiles using respective pilot tone indices.
- TFC utility 110 compares the tone separation value to a pre-computed tone displacement threshold value.
- TFC utility 110 pre-computes the tone displacement threshold (“T”) value such that 2 ⁇ max T/N ⁇ .
- the parameter “N” represents a number of points in the FFT.
- ⁇ max ” represents a maximum time delay or error.
- the practical timing error magnitude is limited to within an interval of a half CP symbol interval, that is, the delay or error is limited to the following range: ⁇ N CP /2 ⁇ max ⁇ N CP /2.
- the parameter “N CP ” represents a number of cyclic prefix samples in a OFDM symbol.
- the practical timing error magnitude may be limited to within an interval of a fraction of the CP symbol interval.
- TFC utility 110 obtains a pilot phase difference between the selected tiles via corresponding pilots, which corresponding pilots are located within the same OFDM symbol.
- P 1,A1 ( 1 ) 202 represents the received first pilot of pattern A 201 from tile 1 (e.g., PUSC tile 200 ) on antenna 1 .
- P* t+1,A1 ( 1 ) represents the complex conjugate of P t+1,A1 ( 1 ).
- TFC utility 110 obtains one estimate of timing error from
- ⁇ t N ⁇ ⁇ t 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ t , where t is the number of tones between the pair of tiles that fulfill t ⁇ T.
- TFC utility 110 tracks a quantity (“G”) of unique pairs of inspected tiles for which the tone separation corresponding to unique pairs of the inspected tiles is less than the pre-computed tone separation threshold. TFC utility 110 generates a final timing error estimate from an average of all estimates, that is
- TFC utility 110 modifies the channel estimate to enhance performance via elements of the UL SDMA practical channel estimate matrix as follows:
- the parameters “ ⁇ A ” and “ ⁇ B ” represent the timing error of mobile with pattern A and B respectively.
- H ⁇ [ H ⁇ 1 , 1 H ⁇ 1 , 2 H ⁇ 2 , 1 H ⁇ 2 , 2 ] .
- the timing error ⁇ m causes relative phase offset for the 8 data symbols and two pilots depending on a relative tone index in the tile. More specifically, for the first tone of the tile, there is no phase error due to timing error. For those data symbols on the second tone of the tile, there is a phase shift in amount of e j2 ⁇ m /N . Similarly, the phase offset is e j4 ⁇ m /N and e j6 ⁇ m /N for those data symbols on tone 3 and 4 respectively (one pilot on tone 4 ). Timing error correction is achieved by simple phase de-rotation provided by the equalizer. For all data symbols and pilot on tone 1 of a tile, no correction is needed.
- Data symbols on tone 2 of a tile are multiplied by e ⁇ j2 ⁇ m /N .
- Data symbols on tone 3 of a tile are multiplied by e ⁇ j4 ⁇ m /N .
- Data symbols and a pilot on tone 4 of a tile are multiplied by e ⁇ j6 ⁇ m /N .
- the character ⁇ A represents the phase difference between the first and last OFDM symbol in the tile. For data in the first OFDM symbol, phase rotation is e j0.5 ⁇ A . For those data in the second OFDM symbol, no phase rotation is needed. Data in the last OFDM symbol is rotated by e ⁇ j0.5 ⁇ A .
- TFC utility 110 performs similar operations on the received signals of pattern B for another mobile user device.
- TFC utility 110 While estimating the timing error by using groups of tiles, TFC utility 110 identifies a group of tiles from which none of the unique pairs of tiles meets the tone separation threshold requirement.
- the inability of any pair of tiles, within a particular slot interval, to meet the tone separation threshold may be the result of assigning the UL SDMA users to one sub-channel in which the tiles (e.g., six tiles in PUSC for UL SDMA) are widely spread in the frequency dimension.
- the maximum timing error ⁇ max and smallest tile separation T min may satisfy the expression, 2 ⁇ max T min >N, which contradicts the requirement of 2 ⁇ max T/N ⁇ . Consequently, the previously described approach to obtain a timing error estimate may yield inaccurate results due to phase ambiguity.
- TFC utility 110 may perform timing error estimate by a comprehensive search over a finite number of values.
- ⁇ m may be approximated by a value t u , where t u ⁇ [ ⁇ N CP /2, ⁇ N CP /2+1, . . . ,1,2, . . . , N CP /2 ⁇ 1, N CP /2] that is a set of (N CP +1) integers.
- TFC utility 110 estimates timing error from an error correction convergence procedure. All pilots (i.e., a total of “K” pilots) within the same OFDM symbol “n” are multiplied by a complex conjugate value “P* (k(1),n) ” which provides a resulting set (“Q (k(i),n) ”) of “K” pilots.
- the value “P* (k(1),n) ” is a complex conjugate value of a value “P (k(1),n) ”, which value “P (k(1),n) ” represents a pilot of a first indexed sub-carrier tone (of the K pilots).
- TFC utility 110 identifies candidate values of timing error estimates (“t u ”) from a set comprising a total of “N cp +1” consecutive integer values ranging from a first endpoint of ⁇ N cp /2 to a second endpoint of N cp /2.
- the parameter “N cp ” represents a number of cyclic prefix samples within the OFDM symbol.
- TFC utility 110 generates a set of “K” complex values “W i (t u )”, which complex values “W i (t u )” represent candidate phase error correction (CPEC) fragments.
- the candidate phase error correction (CPEC) fragments (“W i (t u )”) are obtained from the following CPEC fragments equation:
- W i ⁇ ( t u ) Q k ⁇ ( i ) , n - ⁇ Q k ⁇ ( i ) , n ⁇ ⁇ e j ⁇ 2 ⁇ ⁇ N ⁇ t u ⁇ ( k ⁇ ( i ) - k ⁇ ( 1 ) ) , where “i” is an index for the “K” pilots.
- variable “k(i)” indicates a corresponding frequency number/tone number of the “i-th” pilot, which is separated from any other pilot within the slot by more than “T” tones.
- k( 2 ) and k( 3 ) may represent tone numbers “c” and “4c”, respectively, where c+T ⁇ 4c.
- TFC utility 110 calculates W i (t u ) for a mobile user based on a number of pilots per tile and a number of receiver antennas. For example, in a wireless system which has 2 receiver antennas, 1 pilot in a first OFDM symbol per tile and a second pilot in a third OFDM symbol per same tile, the procedure provides 4 sets of W i (t u ). Each set provides K values corresponding to the K tiles and four sets provide 4K values. More generally, TFC utility 110 obtains a value “R” from a multiplicative product of (a) the number of receiver antennas and (b) the number of unique OFDM symbols per tile per mobile user device, within which OFDM symbols pilots are located. Then, TFC utility 110 uses the product of R and K to indicate the number of sets of W i (t u ) that is provided when TFC utility 110 completes the error correction convergence procedure.
- TFC utility 110 determines a detection metric (M(t u ) for each value of t u .

- TFC utility 110 examines tone separation values for pairs of tiles within corresponding groups of tiles, as shown at block 410 .
- TFC utility 110 determines whether any of the tile pairs in the group of tiles satisfies the tone separation threshold. If at block 412 , TFC utility 110 determines that none of the tile pairs satisfies the tone separation threshold, TFC utility 110 initiates a timing error estimation method for long tile separation via an error correction convergence procedure, as shown at block 414 , and proceeds to block 416 .
- TFC utility 110 uses all candidate timing error values to estimate timing error, and then proceeds to block 420 .
- TFC utility 110 determines that at least one of the tile pairs satisfies the tone separation threshold, TFC utility 110 estimates the timing error based on pilots within a same symbol, as shown at block 418 , and then proceeds to block 420 .

TFC utility 110 modifies the channel estimate for a channel based on the final timing error estimate, as shown at block 422 . At block 424 , TFC utility 110 applies the modified/practical channel estimation to the equalizer to generate an enhanced set of equalizer coefficients. TFC utility 110 performs timing error correction by phase rotation according to the final timing error estimate, as shown at block 426 . At block 428 , TFC utility 110 performs frequency correction according to phase differences based on relative OFDM symbol indices. The process illustrated by the flow chart of FIG. 4 ends at block 430 .

Abstract
Description
where xn (i) is the n-th sample of the transmitted signal of the i-th user device; h(i,j) represents the channel impulse response of the i-th user device to j-th receive antenna; “{circle around (x)}” denotes convolution and zn (j) is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) associated with the j-th receive antenna. After performing a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the received signal, the received frequency domain signal on k-th sub-carrier or tone is
Y k =H k S k +Z k (Equation 1)
where the small letters represent time domain signals, while capital letters denote frequency domain signals.
{tilde over (S)} k=(H k H H k+σ2 ×I)−1 H k H Y k =W k H Y k
where (·)H is the Hermitian transpose of the matrix, σ2 is noise variance, and I is an L×L identity matrix. The signal after equalization is a M×1 vector, of which the i-th row item is applied in the detection of the transmit information for the i-th mobile user device on a sub-carrier basis. In the forthcoming description, the sub-carrier or tone index k has been omitted for notational convenience.
where each element in the matrix is given as
where the number in parenthesis indicates antenna, for instance, PA,1(2) represents received first pilot of pattern A on
W=Ĥ H(Ĥ H Ĥ+σ 2 I)−1.

Therefore the impact of frequency error is a common phase rotation for all tones in an OFDM symbol as well as inter-carrier interference (ICI) from other tones. For each OFDM symbol, the phase is a linear function of time or of the OFDM symbol index p.
−N CP/2<τmax <N CP/2.
The parameter “NCP” represents a number of cyclic prefix samples in a OFDM symbol. In one embodiment, the practical timing error magnitude may be limited to within an interval of a fraction of the CP symbol interval.
Φt=angle(P 1,A1(1)P* t+1,A1(1)+P 1,A2(1)P* t+1,A2(1)+P 1,A1(2)P* t+1,A1(2)+P 1,A2(2)P* t+1,A2(2)).
where t is the number of tones between the pair of tiles that fulfill t<T.
where G is the selected number of pairs of tiles previously described. Once timing error is determined,
W=Ĥ H(Ĥ H Ĥ+σ 2 I)−1,
where the UL SDMA practical channel estimate matrix is provided as follows:
{tilde over (S)}=W H Y
where W is the same for all 8 data symbols and 2 pilots in a tile for one user device. “Y” represents the received signals on all receive antennas, which are provided as inputs to the equalizer.

that is a set of (NCP+1) integers.
Q (k(i),n) =P (k(i),n) P* (k(1),n).
where “i” is an index for the “K” pilots.
where u=1, 2, . . . , NCP, NCP+1.
where “to” is selected from the candidate values of timing error estimates as a final estimate of timing error “τm” for mobile user “m” (e.g., MS 101).
