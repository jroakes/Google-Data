Definitions
- This specification relates to regulating the frequency of impressions of content items (e.g., advertisements) presented to users in a display environment.
- display environments include electronic publications such as webpages accessible via a web browser application executing on a computer system that has connectivity with the Internet, on a point-of-sale kiosk, a dynamic billboard, a video stream, or, more generally, on any appropriate display in essentially any suitable context or environment.
- an impression of a certain content item is said to occur for each instance that that same content item is presented to a consumer, user or other viewer.
- Resource providers may include content such as content sponsoring in their respective publications to help financially support their operations. Some resource providers do not maintain a content sponsoring (e.g., advertising) infrastructure, and thus depend on third party content sponsor serving companies to recruit content sponsors and to serve content items to the resource providers' sites. Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances.
- content sponsoring e.g., advertising
- This specification describes technologies relating to regulating the frequency of impressions of content items presented to users in a display content sponsoring environment, for example, to a human surfing the Internet and viewing webpages that host content items or to a consumer standing in a check-out line in a store.
- Implementations may include corresponding systems, apparatus, methods and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods and encoded on computer storage devices or other machine-readable articles.
- information is received at a content item serving system from a content sponsor.
- the received information includes a plurality content items and information relating to an impression frequency with which one or more of the content items are to be served by the content item serving system for presentation to a viewer.
- the content item serving system maintains a history of content items served by the content item serving system for presentation to the viewer.
- the content item serving system receives a request for content to be served by the content item serving system for presentation to the viewer.
- a content item is selected from among the plurality of received content items based at least in part on the received impression frequency information and the viewer's maintained history. The selected content item is provided by the content item serving system for presentation to the viewer.
- Information relating to impression frequency may comprise a skip impression parameter that specifies a quantity of different content item impressions to present before presenting a same content item again to the viewer.
- information relating to impression frequency may comprise a set frequency parameter that specifies a quantity of impressions of a same content item to present in succession to the viewer.
- Impression frequency information received from the content sponsor may specify variable impression frequencies based at least in part on one or more factors relating to the viewer.
- factors relating to the viewer may include one or more of demographic information, psychographic information, external factors, content context, content popularity, viewer geographic location, and user supplied information.
- All of the content items presented to the viewer may originate with a same content sponsor. Alternatively, one or more of the content items presented to the viewer may originate with different content sponsors.
- a content item may be an advertisement to be presented on webpage.
- the content sponsor may be an advertiser.
- Any or all of the foregoing may be implemented as a computer-implemented method that is performed by data processing apparatus controlled by an advertising serving company.
- Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this specification may be configured to realize various potential advantages. For example, by enabling a content sponsor to set parameters that are used to regulate content item impression frequency, content item effectiveness may be enhanced.
- content sponsors may fine tune their respective content item campaigns such that content items are displayed with sufficient and/or varying frequency to impart the desired consumer recall effect while, at the same time, are prevented from being displayed overly frequently to the point of annoying consumers due to tiresome repetition. As a result, effectiveness of content items tends to be increased.
- FIG. 1 shows an example environment in which a content item slot in a publication is reserved to receive and display a content item.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process in which a skip impression parameter is used to manage display of content items to a viewer.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process in which a set frequency parameter is used to manage display of content items to a viewer.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process in which both skip impression and set frequency parameters are used to manage display of content items to a viewer.
- FIG. 5 shows an example of a computer device and a mobile computer device that can be used to implement the technologies described herein.
- the technologies described here may be implemented to provide an environment in which content sponsors, for example, operating in conjunction with a content item serving company, may regulate the frequency of impressions of a particular content item to the same viewer.
- Such regulation may be realized, for example, by providing the content sponsor with either or both of (i) a skip impression parameter that, for each of the content sponsor's content items, allows the content sponsor to specify a quantity of different content item impressions to display before displaying that same content item creative again to the same viewer, and/or (ii) a set frequency parameter that, for each of the content sponsor's content items, allows the content sponsor to specify a quantity of content item impressions to display in a row to the same viewer.
- the skip impression and set frequency parameters can be used separately or in combination, and further can be applied in a content item rotation context in which the content item serving company chooses from and rotates among the content sponsor's universe of content items.
- the viewer's identity can be determined in any of a variety of ways including by soliciting viewer input, using a cookie or other token mechanism, biological recognition techniques or any other suitable means.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which various aspects of the subject matter described here may be implemented.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects resource provider web sites 104 , user devices 106 , and the search engine 110 , and an advertisement management system 120 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of resource provider web sites 104 and user devices 106 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a content resource provider, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource is any data that can be provided by the resource provider 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling the resource provider web sites 104 and indexing the resources provided by the resource provider web sites 104 .
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources, are stored in an index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 109 to the search engine 110 .
- the search queries 109 are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies the user device 106 that submits the request.
- the unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with the search engine 110 , or some other identifier that identifies the user device 106 or the user using the user device.
- the search engine 110 uses the index 112 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources in the form of search results 111 and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results page resource.
- a search result is data generated by the search engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score).
- IR information retrieval
- the search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- the user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result.
- the resource provider of the web site 104 hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from the user device 106 and provides the resource to the requesting user device 106 .
- the queries 109 submitted from user devices 106 are stored in query logs 114 .
- Click data for the queries and the web pages referenced by the search results are stored in click logs 116 .
- the query logs 114 and the click logs 116 define search history data 117 that include data from and related to previous search requests associated with unique identifiers.
- the click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by the search engine 110 .
- the query logs 114 and click logs 116 can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to web pages that were identified in search results and the actions taken by users (i.e., that data are associated with the identifiers from the search requests so that a search history for each identifier can be accessed).
- the click logs 116 and query logs 114 can thus be used by the search engine to determine the sequence of queries submitted by the user devices, the actions taken in response to the queries, and how often the queries are submitted.
- the advertisement management system 120 facilitates the provisioning of content items with the resources 105 .
- the advertisement management system 120 allows content sponsors to define targeting rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide targeted content items for the users.
- Example targeting rules include keyword targeting, in which content sponsor provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Content items that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots.
- the user device 106 When a user of a user device 106 selects an advertisement, the user device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage of the content sponsor.
- the resource providers 104 may include content sponsors, each having hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the content items of the content sponsors.
- a resource 105 from a resource provider 104 includes instructions that cause the user device to request content items from the advertisement management system 120 .
- the request includes a resource provider identifier and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource 105 .
- the advertisement management system 120 provides targeted content items to the particular user device.
- the user device With respect to a search results page, the user device renders the search results page and sends a request to the advertisement management system 120 , along with one or more keywords related to the query that the user provide to the search engine 110 .
- the advertisement management system 120 provides targeted content items to the particular user device.
- the advertisement management system 120 includes a data storage system that stores campaign data 122 and performance data 124 .
- the campaign data 122 stores content items, targeting information, and budgeting information for content sponsors.
- the performance data 124 stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items. Other performance data can also be stored.
- the campaign data 122 and the performance data 124 are used as input parameters to an advertisement auction.
- the advertisement management system 120 in response to each request for content items, conducts an auction to select content items that are provided in response to the request.
- the content items are ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in the performance data 124 .
- the highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
- the skip impression parameter is a content sponsor-settable parameter (e.g., via content sponsor's control panel webpage provided by an content item serving company) that enables that content sponsor to specify a quantity of different content item impressions for each content item creative that will be displayed in between display of that same content item creative from the same content item serving company to the same user.
- the intervening content item impressions may be either from the same or different content sponsors.
- the Acme Widget Co. as a content sponsor, could provide a content item creative relating to a three-lobed widget and information specifying a skip impression parameter of, e.g., four.
- the content item serving company would then use that information when serving the Acme Widget Co.'s content item creative to viewers.
- this skip impression limitation could apply even if Viewer Bob walked away from the display screen or logged off from his computer system and did not resume for another hour, day, week or even a month or longer. That is, the content item serving company could keep track of Viewer Bob's skip impression count for the three-lobed widget content item (and, for that matter, for any and all other content items having skip impression parameters and for which Viewer Bob had a viewing history). Consequently, in this manner, the Acme Widget Co. is provided with a tool to manage, and thus help prevent, Viewer Bob from becoming annoyed at having to view the three-lobed widget content item too frequently.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process 200 for implementing a skip impression parameter to manage a user's viewing of content items.
- the content sponsor specifies a skip impression parameter for one or more of its content items.
- the specified skip impression parameter can be the same for all users or can vary with user-dependent factors such as user demographics, user geo-location, user psychographics, user history, external factors, user-supplied information, the nature or context of the content items and the like.
- each content item can be assigned an individually tailored skip impression parameter or groups of content items all can be assigned the same skip impression parameter.
- the content item serving company receives a request from a resource provider for a content item to display to a specific viewer.
- the content item serving company which has access to the skip impressions parameters specified by the content sponsor, and which maintains each viewer's viewing history (e.g., keeps a running count of which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency), makes a decision based on that information about which content item to select to provide to the resource provider for display to the viewer.
- the content item serving company at 220 delivers the selected content item to the resource provider and updates its records about which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency.
- the resource provider displays the received content item to the viewer.
- the set frequency parameter is a content sponsor-settable parameter (e.g., via content sponsor's control panel webpage provided by a content item serving company) that enables that content sponsor to specify a quantity of times in succession that a content item will be displayed to a same viewer (i.e., consecutive impressions) by the same content item serving company.
- the Acme Widget Co. could specify that the three-lobed widget content item have a set frequency parameter of, e.g., five.
- the content item serving company when serving content items to Viewer Bob, would choose content items for delivery to ensure that the three-lobed widget content item was displayed to Viewer Bob five times in succession, even if Viewer Bob stopped interacting or viewing for an indefinite period of time, before any other, different content items were displayed to Viewer Bob.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for implementing a set frequency parameter to manage a user's viewing of content items.
- the content sponsor specifies a set frequency parameter for one or more of its content items.
- the specified set frequency parameter can be the same for all users or can vary with user-dependent factors such as user demographics, user geo-location, user psychographics, user history, external factors, user-supplied information, the nature or context of the content items and the like.
- each content item can be assigned an individually tailored set frequency parameter or groups of content items all can be assigned the same set frequency parameter.
- the content item serving company receives a request from a resource provider for a content item to display to a specific viewer.
- the content item serving company which has access to the set frequency parameters specified by the content sponsor, and which maintains each viewer's viewing history (e.g., keeps a running count of which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency), makes a decision based on that information about which content item to select to provide to the resource provider for display to the viewer.
- the content item serving company at 320 delivers the selected content item to the resource provider and updates its records about which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency.
- the resource provider displays the received content item to the viewer.
- the skip impression parameter and the set frequency parameter can be used in conjunction, e.g., to specify that a certain content item creative is viewed by the same user, say, 3 times in a row (that is, the set frequency parameter is set to three) but then not viewed again by that same viewer until 10 impressions of different content item creative are displayed to that same viewer (that is, the skip impression parameter is set to 10).
- the skip impression and/or set frequency parameters can be used in the content item rotation context in which the content item serving company has access to all of a content sponsor's content items and selects and rotates among them. In that case, all of the content items displayed to a same viewer would come from the same content sponsor, including the content items appearing as intervening content item impressions used for a skip impression parameter.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example process 400 for concurrently implementing set frequency and skip impression parameters to manage a user's viewing of content items.
- the content sponsor specifies both set frequency parameters and skip impression parameters for a set of content items.
- the specified set frequency parameters, and/or the specified skip impression parameters can be the same for all users or can vary with user-dependent factors such as user demographics, user geo-location, user psychographics, user history, external factors, user-supplied information, the nature or context of the content items and the like.
- each content item can be assigned an individually tailored set frequency parameter and/or skip impression parameter, or groups of content items all can be assigned the same set frequency/skip impression parameters.
- the content item serving company receives a request from a resource provider for a content item to display to a specific viewer.
- the content item serving company which has access to the set frequency and skip impressions parameters specified by the content sponsor, and which maintains each viewer's viewing history (e.g., keeps a running count of which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency), makes a decision based on that information about which content item to select to provide to the resource provider for display to the viewer.
- the content item serving company at 420 delivers the selected content item to the resource provider and updates its records about which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency.
- the resource provider displays the received content item to the viewer.
- the skip impression and/or set frequency parameters can be used not only with regard to the same content item but also with similar content items—that is, different versions of otherwise the same content item.
- the Acme Widget Co. could provide two different versions of the three-lobed widget content item (e.g., Creative1 and Creative2) both from the same content sponsor and both relating to the same product, but being slightly different in appearance, tone, message or the like.
- a skip impression parameter and/or a set frequency parameter could then be used to manage display of Creative1 and Creative2 to Viewer Bob as desired by the content sponsor.

Abstract
Impression frequency of displayed content may be regulated by data processing apparatus by receiving from a content sponsor content items and information relating to an impression frequency with which one or more of the content items is to be displayed a viewer, maintaining a history of content items displayed to the viewer, receiving a request for content to be displayed to the viewer, selecting a content item from among the received content items based at least in part on the received impression frequency information and the viewer's maintained history, and providing the selected content item for presentation.
Description
- This specification relates to regulating the frequency of impressions of content items (e.g., advertisements) presented to users in a display environment. Examples of display environments include electronic publications such as webpages accessible via a web browser application executing on a computer system that has connectivity with the Internet, on a point-of-sale kiosk, a dynamic billboard, a video stream, or, more generally, on any appropriate display in essentially any suitable context or environment. In whatever display content sponsoring context or environment, an impression of a certain content item is said to occur for each instance that that same content item is presented to a consumer, user or other viewer.
- Resource providers (e.g., publishers such as web site publishers) may include content such as content sponsoring in their respective publications to help financially support their operations. Some resource providers do not maintain a content sponsoring (e.g., advertising) infrastructure, and thus depend on third party content sponsor serving companies to recruit content sponsors and to serve content items to the resource providers' sites. Third party content sponsor serving companies can, depending on various factors, control which content items are displayed to which users and under what circumstances.
- This specification describes technologies relating to regulating the frequency of impressions of content items presented to users in a display content sponsoring environment, for example, to a human surfing the Internet and viewing webpages that host content items or to a consumer standing in a check-out line in a store.
- Implementations may include corresponding systems, apparatus, methods and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods and encoded on computer storage devices or other machine-readable articles.
- In an implementation, information is received at a content item serving system from a content sponsor. The received information includes a plurality content items and information relating to an impression frequency with which one or more of the content items are to be served by the content item serving system for presentation to a viewer. The content item serving system maintains a history of content items served by the content item serving system for presentation to the viewer. The content item serving system receives a request for content to be served by the content item serving system for presentation to the viewer. At the content item serving system, a content item is selected from among the plurality of received content items based at least in part on the received impression frequency information and the viewer's maintained history. The selected content item is provided by the content item serving system for presentation to the viewer.
- Information relating to impression frequency may comprise a skip impression parameter that specifies a quantity of different content item impressions to present before presenting a same content item again to the viewer. Alternatively, or in addition, information relating to impression frequency may comprise a set frequency parameter that specifies a quantity of impressions of a same content item to present in succession to the viewer.
- Impression frequency information received from the content sponsor may specify variable impression frequencies based at least in part on one or more factors relating to the viewer. Such one or more factors relating to the viewer may include one or more of demographic information, psychographic information, external factors, content context, content popularity, viewer geographic location, and user supplied information.
- All of the content items presented to the viewer may originate with a same content sponsor. Alternatively, one or more of the content items presented to the viewer may originate with different content sponsors. A content item may be an advertisement to be presented on webpage. The content sponsor may be an advertiser.
- Any or all of the foregoing may be implemented as a computer-implemented method that is performed by data processing apparatus controlled by an advertising serving company.
- Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this specification may be configured to realize various potential advantages. For example, by enabling a content sponsor to set parameters that are used to regulate content item impression frequency, content item effectiveness may be enhanced. In addition, by providing content sponsors with the ability to specify parameters such as a skip impression parameter (e.g., a quantity of content item impressions to skip before displaying that same content item again to the same viewer) and/or a set frequency parameter (e.g., a quantity of content item impressions to display in a row to the same viewer), content sponsors may fine tune their respective content item campaigns such that content items are displayed with sufficient and/or varying frequency to impart the desired consumer recall effect while, at the same time, are prevented from being displayed overly frequently to the point of annoying consumers due to tiresome repetition. As a result, effectiveness of content items tends to be increased.
- Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- The technologies described here may be implemented to provide an environment in which content sponsors, for example, operating in conjunction with a content item serving company, may regulate the frequency of impressions of a particular content item to the same viewer. Such regulation may be realized, for example, by providing the content sponsor with either or both of (i) a skip impression parameter that, for each of the content sponsor's content items, allows the content sponsor to specify a quantity of different content item impressions to display before displaying that same content item creative again to the same viewer, and/or (ii) a set frequency parameter that, for each of the content sponsor's content items, allows the content sponsor to specify a quantity of content item impressions to display in a row to the same viewer. The skip impression and set frequency parameters can be used separately or in combination, and further can be applied in a content item rotation context in which the content item serving company chooses from and rotates among the content sponsor's universe of content items. The viewer's identity can be determined in any of a variety of ways including by soliciting viewer input, using a cookie or other token mechanism, biological recognition techniques or any other suitable means.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which various aspects of the subject matter described here may be implemented. Acomputer network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects resourceprovider web sites 104,user devices 106, and thesearch engine 110, and anadvertisement management system 120. Theonline environment 100 may include many thousands of resourceprovider web sites 104 anduser devices 106. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 is maintained by a content resource provider, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A resource is any data that can be provided by the
resource provider 104 over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network. - To facilitate searching of these
resources 105, thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling the resourceprovider web sites 104 and indexing the resources provided by the resourceprovider web sites 104. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources, are stored in anindex 112. - The
user devices 106 submitsearch queries 109 to thesearch engine 110. Thesearch queries 109 are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies theuser device 106 that submits the request. The unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with thesearch engine 110, or some other identifier that identifies theuser device 106 or the user using the user device. - In response to the search request, the
search engine 110 uses theindex 112 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries. Thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 111 and returns the search results to theuser devices 106 in search results page resource. A search result is data generated by thesearch engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. - The search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score). The search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- The
user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users. In response to the user selecting a search result at auser device 106, theuser device 106 requests the resource identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result. The resource provider of theweb site 104 hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from theuser device 106 and provides the resource to the requestinguser device 106. - In some implementations, the
queries 109 submitted fromuser devices 106 are stored in query logs 114. Click data for the queries and the web pages referenced by the search results are stored in click logs 116. The query logs 114 and the click logs 116 definesearch history data 117 that include data from and related to previous search requests associated with unique identifiers. The click logs define actions taken responsive to search results provided by thesearch engine 110. The query logs 114 and clicklogs 116 can be used to map queries submitted by the user devices to web pages that were identified in search results and the actions taken by users (i.e., that data are associated with the identifiers from the search requests so that a search history for each identifier can be accessed). The click logs 116 and querylogs 114 can thus be used by the search engine to determine the sequence of queries submitted by the user devices, the actions taken in response to the queries, and how often the queries are submitted. - The
advertisement management system 120 facilitates the provisioning of content items with theresources 105. In particular, theadvertisement management system 120 allows content sponsors to define targeting rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide targeted content items for the users. Example targeting rules include keyword targeting, in which content sponsor provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Content items that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots. - When a user of a
user device 106 selects an advertisement, theuser device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage of the content sponsor. For example, theresource providers 104 may include content sponsors, each having hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the content items of the content sponsors. - These targeted content items can be provided for many different resources, such as the
resources 105 of theresource providers 104, and on a search results page resource. For example, aresource 105 from aresource provider 104 includes instructions that cause the user device to request content items from theadvertisement management system 120. The request includes a resource provider identifier and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of theresource 105. Theadvertisement management system 120, in turn, provides targeted content items to the particular user device. - With respect to a search results page, the user device renders the search results page and sends a request to the
advertisement management system 120, along with one or more keywords related to the query that the user provide to thesearch engine 110. Theadvertisement management system 120, in turn, provides targeted content items to the particular user device. - The
advertisement management system 120 includes a data storage system that storescampaign data 122 andperformance data 124. Thecampaign data 122 stores content items, targeting information, and budgeting information for content sponsors. Theperformance data 124 stores data indicating the performance of the content items that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for content items, the number of impressions for content items, and the number of conversions for content items. Other performance data can also be stored. - The
campaign data 122 and theperformance data 124 are used as input parameters to an advertisement auction. In particular, theadvertisement management system 120, in response to each request for content items, conducts an auction to select content items that are provided in response to the request. The content items are ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in theperformance data 124. The highest ranked content items resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device. - The skip impression parameter is a content sponsor-settable parameter (e.g., via content sponsor's control panel webpage provided by an content item serving company) that enables that content sponsor to specify a quantity of different content item impressions for each content item creative that will be displayed in between display of that same content item creative from the same content item serving company to the same user. The intervening content item impressions may be either from the same or different content sponsors. For example, the Acme Widget Co., as a content sponsor, could provide a content item creative relating to a three-lobed widget and information specifying a skip impression parameter of, e.g., four. The content item serving company would then use that information when serving the Acme Widget Co.'s content item creative to viewers. For example, assume Viewer Bob surfs to a web page that has an available content item slot, which causes the content item serving company to select and provide for display the Acme Widget Co.'s three-lobed widget content item. In doing so, the content item serving company would remember the identity of the specific content item viewed by Viewer Bob and, in choosing and delivering content item creative in the future for Viewer Bob, the content item serving company would make sure that the three-lobed widget content item was not displayed again to Viewer Bob until four other, different content items item have been served by the content item serving company and displayed to Viewer Bob in the interim.
- Potentially, this skip impression limitation could apply even if Viewer Bob walked away from the display screen or logged off from his computer system and did not resume for another hour, day, week or even a month or longer. That is, the content item serving company could keep track of Viewer Bob's skip impression count for the three-lobed widget content item (and, for that matter, for any and all other content items having skip impression parameters and for which Viewer Bob had a viewing history). Consequently, in this manner, the Acme Widget Co. is provided with a tool to manage, and thus help prevent, Viewer Bob from becoming annoyed at having to view the three-lobed widget content item too frequently.

FIG. 2 is a flowchart of anexample process 200 for implementing a skip impression parameter to manage a user's viewing of content items. At 205, the content sponsor specifies a skip impression parameter for one or more of its content items. Optionally, the specified skip impression parameter can be the same for all users or can vary with user-dependent factors such as user demographics, user geo-location, user psychographics, user history, external factors, user-supplied information, the nature or context of the content items and the like. In addition, each content item can be assigned an individually tailored skip impression parameter or groups of content items all can be assigned the same skip impression parameter. - At 210, the content item serving company receives a request from a resource provider for a content item to display to a specific viewer. At 215, the content item serving company, which has access to the skip impressions parameters specified by the content sponsor, and which maintains each viewer's viewing history (e.g., keeps a running count of which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency), makes a decision based on that information about which content item to select to provide to the resource provider for display to the viewer.
- After making the decision, the content item serving company at 220 delivers the selected content item to the resource provider and updates its records about which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency. At 225, the resource provider displays the received content item to the viewer.
- The set frequency parameter is a content sponsor-settable parameter (e.g., via content sponsor's control panel webpage provided by a content item serving company) that enables that content sponsor to specify a quantity of times in succession that a content item will be displayed to a same viewer (i.e., consecutive impressions) by the same content item serving company. Using the example above, the Acme Widget Co. could specify that the three-lobed widget content item have a set frequency parameter of, e.g., five. In that case, the content item serving company, when serving content items to Viewer Bob, would choose content items for delivery to ensure that the three-lobed widget content item was displayed to Viewer Bob five times in succession, even if Viewer Bob stopped interacting or viewing for an indefinite period of time, before any other, different content items were displayed to Viewer Bob.
-
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for implementing a set frequency parameter to manage a user's viewing of content items. At 305, the content sponsor specifies a set frequency parameter for one or more of its content items. Optionally, the specified set frequency parameter can be the same for all users or can vary with user-dependent factors such as user demographics, user geo-location, user psychographics, user history, external factors, user-supplied information, the nature or context of the content items and the like. In addition, each content item can be assigned an individually tailored set frequency parameter or groups of content items all can be assigned the same set frequency parameter. - At 310, the content item serving company receives a request from a resource provider for a content item to display to a specific viewer. At 315, the content item serving company, which has access to the set frequency parameters specified by the content sponsor, and which maintains each viewer's viewing history (e.g., keeps a running count of which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency), makes a decision based on that information about which content item to select to provide to the resource provider for display to the viewer.
- After making the decision, the content item serving company at 320 delivers the selected content item to the resource provider and updates its records about which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency. At 325, the resource provider displays the received content item to the viewer.
- The skip impression parameter and the set frequency parameter can be used in conjunction, e.g., to specify that a certain content item creative is viewed by the same user, say, 3 times in a row (that is, the set frequency parameter is set to three) but then not viewed again by that same viewer until 10 impressions of different content item creative are displayed to that same viewer (that is, the skip impression parameter is set to 10).
- The skip impression and/or set frequency parameters can be used in the content item rotation context in which the content item serving company has access to all of a content sponsor's content items and selects and rotates among them. In that case, all of the content items displayed to a same viewer would come from the same content sponsor, including the content items appearing as intervening content item impressions used for a skip impression parameter.
-
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for concurrently implementing set frequency and skip impression parameters to manage a user's viewing of content items. At 405, the content sponsor specifies both set frequency parameters and skip impression parameters for a set of content items. Optionally, the specified set frequency parameters, and/or the specified skip impression parameters, can be the same for all users or can vary with user-dependent factors such as user demographics, user geo-location, user psychographics, user history, external factors, user-supplied information, the nature or context of the content items and the like. In addition, each content item can be assigned an individually tailored set frequency parameter and/or skip impression parameter, or groups of content items all can be assigned the same set frequency/skip impression parameters. - At 410, the content item serving company receives a request from a resource provider for a content item to display to a specific viewer. At 415, the content item serving company, which has access to the set frequency and skip impressions parameters specified by the content sponsor, and which maintains each viewer's viewing history (e.g., keeps a running count of which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency), makes a decision based on that information about which content item to select to provide to the resource provider for display to the viewer.
- After making the decision, the content item serving company at 420 delivers the selected content item to the resource provider and updates its records about which content items have been displayed to which viewers and at what frequency. At 425, the resource provider displays the received content item to the viewer.
- The skip impression and/or set frequency parameters can be used not only with regard to the same content item but also with similar content items—that is, different versions of otherwise the same content item. For example, the Acme Widget Co. could provide two different versions of the three-lobed widget content item (e.g., Creative1 and Creative2) both from the same content sponsor and both relating to the same product, but being slightly different in appearance, tone, message or the like. A skip impression parameter and/or a set frequency parameter could then be used to manage display of Creative1 and Creative2 to Viewer Bob as desired by the content sponsor.

The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thedevice 550, such as control of user interfaces, applications run bydevice 550, and wireless communication bydevice 550. -
Processor 552 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 558 anddisplay interface 556 coupled to adisplay 554. Thedisplay 554 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 556 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 554 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 558 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 552. In addition, anexternal interface 562 may be provided in communication withprocessor 552, so as to enable near area communication ofdevice 550 with other devices.External interface 562 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used. - The
memory 564 stores information within thecomputing device 550. Thememory 564 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 574 may also be provided and connected todevice 550 throughexpansion interface 572, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 574 may provide extra storage space fordevice 550, or may also store applications or other information fordevice 550. Specifically,expansion memory 574 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also.

Device 550 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 566, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 566 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 568. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown).
