Unrestricted notice.III. illustrative method
Fig. 3 is the flow chart for showing method 300 accoding to exemplary embodiment.Method 300 can be by computing device (such as
The group of computing device 100 shown in FIG. 1, computing device shown in Fig. 2 210 or the second computing device 230 or such device
Close) Lai Shixian.In the case of without departing from the scope of the present invention, method 300 also may be implemented in other kinds of computing device.
Implementation method 300 can be carried out when computing device operates under restricted access mode (such as locking mode).More
Body, as indicated at block 302, when operating in the restricted access mode, computing device receives the instruction of application affairs.Application affairs packet
Containing application content.As shown in block 304, in response to application affairs, computing device determines at least part of comprising event content
Content of announcement.As described in block 306, then filter criteria is applied to content of announcement by computing device, with wanting for identification notification content
The part of blurring.As described in frame 308, computing device is then by generating any identification division blurring of content of announcement
The content of announcement of filtering.In this way, the content of announcement of filtering includes that not being blurred for event content is partially fuzzy with event content
Change part.Then, as indicated at block 310, when computing device still operates in the restricted access mode, computing device keeps figure aobvious
Show that device shows the unrestricted notice of the content of announcement comprising filtering.
A. it is operated under restricted access mode
At frame 302, the operation under restricted access mode, which can be related to computing device, prevents or limits the certain functions of access,
And do not have to provide certain verifying input datas first.For example, computing device can be locked so that need password, password, fingerprint or
Other verify datas access application.
In addition, restricted access mode can prevent or limit answering to the instruction for providing application affairs when carrying out frame 302
Access.For example, the application when user can not access when computing device is locked text message receives text message
When, sink block 302 can be carried out.Other examples are also possible.
B. the instruction of application affairs is received
At frame 302, receive the instruction of application affairs function can be related to mark, description or otherwise with answer
With the reception of the related data-message of event.
As an example, considering that device operation provides the scene of the operating system of application programming interfaces (API).API can be mentioned
Notice can be provided a user by the mechanism with mechanism for application.For example, API can provide the mechanism of application, will notify to send
To notification manager, which generates according to certain parameters, filters and route notice, which can root
Change according to the mode of operation and/or other factors of device.In this way, frame 302 may include the notification manager of operating system from
The application run on the computing device receives notice (or its instruction), and/or detection application affairs using itself.
It should be understood, however, that above-mentioned example is not intended to be limited to.Other instructions of application affairs are also possible.
C. content of announcement is determined
At frame 304, computing device determines the content of announcement comprising event content.Herein, " event content " should be managed
Solution is to include some or all of the actual content from application affairs.Therefore, the type of event content and event is general
Property description be distinguishing.For example, event content may include the main body from message when receiving mail or text message
And/or some or all of actual text of Subject field.The general description of event can simply indicate that following facts: receive
To mail or text message, without providing other details.
In some embodiments, the content of announcement determined at frame 304 is not filtered, or may be due to the size of notice
And/or space limitation and filtered or censoring (truncate).However, not yet being filtered based on the information provided by content of announcement
The content of announcement determined at frame 304.For example, the content of announcement determined at frame 304 can when receiving mail or text message
With (such as some in event content comprising some or all of actual text of main body and/or Subject field from message
Or all).Text from mail or text message may be truncated (such as since the space of notice limits), but not yet base
The essence of text and/or picture in message filters.Other examples are also possible.
It is noted that in some embodiments, user can such as method 300 method adjustment system option or setting,
In order to close filtering.In this case, computing device can be simply displayed in generated at frame 304 comprising content of announcement
The notice of (such as unfiltered content of announcement).
D. the potential sensitive information to be blurred is identified
At frame 306, the combination of various filter criterias or filter criteria can be applied to content of announcement, in order to identify
The part of content of announcement to be blurred.
In some embodiments, filter criteria can take the form of entity interpreter, be applied in true at frame 304
Fixed content of announcement.Each entity interpreter can be implemented as software, hardware and/or firmware, and may include can be by handling
The program instruction that device executes, with some type of information or content in analysis text and identification notification content.For example, separating
Entity interpreter can be used for identifying and annotating telephone number, address, mail address, the public name entity (such as the public
Available name or place name) and privacy name entity (such as name of the contact person stored in the address list of user).
In in other respects, content of announcement may include text, image data and/or other kinds of media content.Cause
This, blurring technology can be applied to different types of content of announcement.For example, text type entity interpreter can be applied to logical
Know the text for including in content, while vision entity interpreter can be applied to the image or video counts for including in content of announcement
According to.
In some embodiments, the entity interpreter on device can be applied in the notice that do not change provided by application
In include title and text.Each text type entity interpreter can be designed as detecting in the text different types of potential quick
Feel entity.For example, first instance interpreter can be applied to detection telephone number, second instance interpreter can be applied to detection
Address, third entity interpreter can be applied to detection mail address, and the 4th entity interpreter can be applied to detection public's life
Name entity (such as publicly available name or place name), the 5th entity interpreter can be applied to detection privacy name entity (example
As user address list in the name of contact person that stores), etc..It should be understood of course that example above-mentioned is only can be with
One of many possible combinations of the entity interpreter of use.
Some entity interpreters can be used for searching for the notification text of name entity (NE), and name entity (NE) is to define
The reference of the things of title associated with their (such as people, city, product, business, streets etc.).Name entity may include
The public names entity and/or privacy to name entity.The public names entity to may be embodied in the theme (public people that public field is named
The name of object or the official name of building), and privacy name entity is named about some locality sources (such as user's
The name of the friend saved in address list of mobile phone).It notices in some cases, identical entity classification is the public and privacy
The two of entity is possible.
(it is also referred to as entity identifier, entity chunking (chunking) to the various technologies of name Entity recognition (NER)
Or entity extraction and other possibilities) it can be used for identifying and annotating the part in text corpus of text, this article
This corpus has classification predetermined, such as personnel's name, Business Name, position, the expression of time, quantity, currency valence
Value, percentage etc..In fact, name Entity recognition module can take the text not annotated (determining such as at frame 304 to lead to
Know content), and export the annotation version of text.
In this way, the part to be blurred that filter criteria is applied to identification notification content may include name at frame 306
Entity recognition process, the name Entity recognition Process Design are the certain text type parts of identification notification content to be blurred.
In the exemplary embodiment, certain form of name entity can be classified as comprising potential sensitive information, such as intended recipient
It may be not intended to the information that unexpected viewer sees.
In some embodiments, frame 306 can be related to the name Entity recognition in conjunction with other technologies, in order to notify
Potential sensitive information is detected in content.For example, one or more vision entity interpreters can be applied to image data, with mark
The one or more specific types for the information that vision provides.For example, First look entity interpreter can be applied to detection face,
And position corresponding with the face of detection or region in imaged toggled data Input, can apply the second vision entity interpreter,
To detect the visual information (for example, lofty tone terrestrial reference in image background) of position, etc. that can disclose people.
It should be understood that in addition to or substitute process as described herein, frame 306 can also relate to be based on image using other
And/or text based process, to identify potential sensitive information in content of announcement.Arbitrarily under such circumstances, then may be used
For example to be notified by using the annotation and/or other information determined at frame 306 with the text type for generating filtering at frame 308
Content removes or hides the text and/or image comprising potential sensitive information using the annotation of resulting text and/or media
Or part of it.
In in other respects, the various ranks of susceptibility and corresponding blurring degree can be defined, and with it is various
Type names entity associated.In this way, frame 308 can be related to changing the blurring degree for being applied to different types of entity.Example
Such as, the more sensitive public names entity that can be annotated in this way, and can be blurred due to their more sensitive essence
Change to largely.For example, the title of the doctor's office of user can be complete in the content of announcement of filtering in calendar reminding
It is removed or is blurred entirely to largely (such as " reservation at * * * * * * * * * "), by comparison in similar day
Go through the title (such as " reservation at S**** manicure salon ") of the manicure salon in reminding.Change many of blurring degree
Other examples are possible.
In the embodiment described herein, it is with high recall ratio that entity interpreter, which can tune (tune),
(recall), sometimes using precision as cost, in order to ensure that all privacy informations are correctly identified.Certainly, without departing from this hair
In the case where bright range, it is possible that entity interpreter, which can alternatively be tuned as having lower recall ratio,.
E. generate and show the content of announcement of filtering
In order to be blurred the part of media content, notification manager or another such module can remove or change text
Certain parts of this and/or picture material.In addition, in some cases, blurring, which may include with replacement content, substitutes original
The part of beginning content of announcement, and/or the part for removing original content of announcement.
In addition, different blurring technologies can be used for different annotations.For example, for phone number, address and
Mail address and other possible contents can use different blurring technologies.Other examples are also possible.
In the exemplary embodiment, it can be blurred content of announcement, so that the content of announcement of filtering is expected to for expection
Recipient is identifiable, but is unlikely to be useful for the viewer of unauthorized.For doing so, notification manager
The data from user account associated with user apparatus and computing device can be used and/or be associated with user apparatus
The associated contextual information and/or other information of user account are annotated with adjusting for specific intended recipient.
IV. the example of the content of announcement filtered
With reference to Fig. 4 A and 4B, Fig. 5 A to 5C and Fig. 6 A and 6B, as the existing content of announcement for showing generation filtering of example
Example technique.The content of announcement of filtering in these attached drawings can be generated using the exemplary method of such as method 300.Fig. 4 A
(such as when computing device operates in a locking mode) is may be displayed in screen locking to notice shown in 6B.However, Fig. 4 A
It may be also used in other confined scenes of access to computing device or the application for generating notice to notice shown in 6B, and
And by unrestricted or show notice in a manner of by smaller limitation.
Fig. 4 A and 4B show the alternate version of screen locking notice corresponding with same application event.Fig. 4 A shows notice
402a, when user has disabled fuzzy according to the notice of exemplary method, (such as default via computing device) can be with
Display.Therefore, notify 402a offer content of announcement does not filter version, and it includes the full names 404 for the contact person for sending message
(" Matt Snow "), the text 406 that do not change itself (telephone number comprising sender) from message and containing hair
The image 408 of the face for the person of sending.It is noted that image 408 can be the incarnation or brief introduction of sender's account from messages application
Image, can be associated with the contact information of the sender stored on computing device, or can also be associated with sender.
Fig. 4 B shows notice 402b, provides the filtering version of the notice content of announcement that 402a is provided with non-filtered version
This.In this way, when the user of computing device it is enabled according to the notice of exemplary method be blurred when, can replace notice 402a and
Display notice 402b.It is noted, however, that it is optional for enabling and/or disable according to the ability of the filtering of exemplary method, because filling
Setting may be preconfigured to always using blurring accoding to exemplary embodiment.
Notice 402b may include the notice of the filtering generated according to exemplary method (such as at frame 308 of method 300)
Content.In the example shown in the series of figures, the entity of three types is identified or is blurred.
Firstly, annotating and being blurred telephone number "+41 123 555555 ".In this way, the text 416 of notice 402b is only
It include a part for the telephone number for including in primitive event content, and remainder is blurred.Therefore, notice 402b will
The telephone number of sender is shown as "+41 123 5****5 ".
Secondly, " Matt Snow " can be identified and be annotated as privacy life by notification manager at the frame 306 of method 300
Name entity, matching are (such as associated with the account of current link to computing device with the associated address list of computing device
Address list in) name.Correspondingly, at frame 308, the name of sender can be changed, to help to protect the body of sender
Part.Therefore, in the example by notice 402b diagram, the surname of sender can be replaced with initial, so that the hair in notice 402b
The person's of sending name 414 only pronounces " Matt S ".
Third, vision entity interpreter can analyze the image for including in the content of announcement that do not change, and detection image
The face of middle sender.In this way, can handle image to hide the face of user (such as using fuzzy or pixelation) or complete
The full face for removing user.In the example as shown in Figure 40 2b, the face of sender is obscured in image 418.
Fig. 5 A and 5C show the alternate version of the notice of the screen locking for same application event.(it is noted, however, that with figure
The corresponding application affairs of 5A to 5C and application affairs corresponding with Fig. 4 A and 4B are simultaneously non-equal.) Fig. 5 A show notice 502a,
When user has disabled and has been blurred according to the notice of exemplary method, (such as default via computing device) can be shown.
Therefore, what notice 502a provided the content of announcement from application affairs does not filter version, and the application affairs are in this example
Reception by messages application (such as mail or text message applications) to message.In this way, notice 502a includes the connection for sending message
Be the full name 504 (" Jack Fox ") of people, from message the text 506 that do not change itself (address comprising meeting and when
Between) and containing sender face image 508.
Notice 502b and 502c shown in Fig. 5 B and 5C includes the notice shown in the form of unfiltered in notice 502a
The version of the different filterings of two of content.As mentioned above, the content of announcement of this spline filter can be such as square by realizing
The exemplary method of method 300 generates.In addition, the content of announcement of the filtering in the content of announcement and 502c of the filtering in 502b it
Between difference, the specific calculation in view of showing the content of announcement of filtering with the recipient of target and/or thereon can be attributed to
The related various factors of device.As follows to be explained in greater detail, such factor, which can be used for changing, is applied to given entity
Blurring technology, so that the expression of the entity given in the content of announcement of filtering is different.
In notice 502b, identified and four entities of blurring.Firstly, the name (" Jack Fox ") of sender
It can annotate and name entity for privacy, and be replaced with initial, so that the name 514 of the sender in notice 502b is only pronounced
"JF".Additionally, notice 502b includes the image 518 that face is hidden.Face can be described in 418 septum reset of reference picture
Similar method is hidden.In addition, address " street Vine 123 " and time " at 4 points in afternoon " are annotated respectively as address entity and
Time entity, and be blurred in the content of announcement of the filtering shown in notice 502b.Particularly, carry out self-information itself
Text is replaced with the text for the information for including in description message, without providing the time definitely met and address (such as " JF
Message is sent to confirm the meet details of your proposal ").
It is identified and obscure identical four entities in notice 502c.However, using such as institute in greater detail below
The technology stated, although the content of announcement of the filtering in 502c is not filtered with both contents of announcement of filtering in 502b based on identical
Content of announcement, but the two is still had any different.More specifically, notice 502c also includes the image 518 that sender's face is hidden,
And 502c is notified integrally to remove sender's name.In addition, the blurring of address and time are the texts by being only blurred annotation
It is original to complete (rather than as done in notice 502b, replace the more part comprising these entities of text).
Fig. 6 A and 6B show the alternate version with the screen locking of one group of application affairs notice.Fig. 6 A show notice 602a,
604a, 606a, it includes the unfiltered contents of announcement for corresponding to the application affairs from three different applications.With notice
The corresponding application affairs of 602a, 604a, 606a separately include file and upload to cloud storage application, there is holding via map application
Continue navigation procedure and the reservation from calendar application is reminded.In addition, when user has disabled notice in accordance with some embodiments
When being blurred feature (such as default via computing device), can show shown in Fig. 6 A notice 602a, 604a,
606a。
It is identified and be blurred mail entity in notice 602b.Specifically, completely being shown in notice 602a
Mail address " johndoe@email.com, " be blurred for notice 602b in pronounce " jo**d**@email.com ".
It is noted that such mail entity, which can be privacy or the public, names entity, depend on mail address whether with mobile device
It is associated (such as be comprised in it is being stored on device or be connected to in the address list of the associated user account of device).
It is identified and be blurred address entity in notice 604b.Specifically, completely being shown in notice 604a
Address " street Townsend 2 " be blurred for notice 604b in pronounce " street Tow*** ".It is noted that such
Address entity can be privacy or the public and name entity, depending on the address for mobile device whether be it is known (such as should
Whether address is locally-stored on device or is connected to part with the contacts entries of the associated user account of device).
A. it is blurred for the purpose of intended recipient
As mentioned above, exemplary method can be blurred a part of text and/or image data in the notification, make
It must it is expected that intended recipient can derive outbound message from notice, and the viewer of unauthorized cannot.It is noted that in some feelings
Under condition, such purpose blurring can be carried out with general intended recipient, rather than fixed to specific intended recipient
Specific notification processed.
For example, several examples for the purpose blurring for notifying 402b to provide content of announcement with reference to Fig. 4 B are returned to, it is expected that
To expected or authorization viewer without providing implicit information to unexpected or unauthorized viewer.For example, having served as
The intended recipient for having been observed that and/or dialing telephone number+41 123 555555 is gone to watch blurring in notice 402b
Telephone number ("+41 123 5****5 ") when, the telephone number of blurring can prompt memory of the intended recipient from them
In recall complete telephone number.
However, due to blurring, the telephone number of blurring is assorted for that will not have from the people that the telephone number is not used before
Use.As another example, the privacy life of the people or place such as stored in the address list of user when interpreter mark
When name entity, the title of entity can be filtered or be blurred, so that the owner of expectation device can understand the identity of entity, and not
The user of authorization will not.For example, the entity (" Matt Snow ") of personal name can be identified referring again to Fig. 4 B
Entity, such as the item based on the Matt Snow in locally-stored address list on the computing device are named for personal privacy
Mesh (it may include telephone number in the message comprising sender)." Matt Snow " can be annotated as personal privacy
The fact that name entity is interpreted as intended recipient and is familiar with Matt Snow.In this way, it is likely that as computing device
The owner or the intended recipient of user can be inferred to the message from the blurring of the name in notice 402b and come from
Matt Snow。
As mentioned above, exemplary method may include the purpose filtering to picture material.For example, can will include
The image pixel of human face, fuzzy or other modes change, so that stranger is less likely the image identification from change
This people, but the intended recipient for being familiar with this face still is able to identify this people in the image of change (especially
When being combined with the other information of the blurring version of such as this name word).
In order to illustrate and referring again to returning to Fig. 4 B, notice 402b include from there is personal face image (such as
Brief introduction picture, incarnation or the contact image from address list) generate image 418.In notice 402b, having for image is a
The region of human face has been blurred, so that the remainder of some general characteristics of a human face and/or image (such as is sent out
Color, background color, shirt color etc.) it is still recognizable, but hidden more detailed characteristic.It is familiar with the appearance of user
And/or had been observed that the recipient of the version that do not change for incarnation or brief introduction picture can be from still recognizable one in the past
As identify sender in characteristic.However, the stranger for having never seen this people and/or original image before is less likely from notice
The blurry versions for their face for including in 402b just can be identified for that user.
B. the purpose blurring based on account information
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the blurring of content of announcement can be based at least partially on and spy
Surely the specific intended recipient notified is related and/or associated information.For example, can be associated with or be linked to life based on coming from
At and/or display notice computing device one or more user accounts in, and/or be associated with or be linked to and is corresponding with notice
Specific application one or more user accounts in account information, carry out filter NOTIFY content.
For example, the set of entity can be named based on privacy associated with user account, change given name entity
Blurring degree.More specifically, computing device can be by the name detected in content of announcement reality at the frame 306 of method 300
Set (such as (multiple) user with intended recipient of body (such as sender's name of text message) and privacy name entity
All names stored in the associated one or more address lists of account) it is compared.Obtained blurring can be based on inspection
The conflict in the address book of recipient is surveyed, makes the name of blurring in the case of intended recipient is still unique and specific
Lower apply will hide or remove the scheme of the maximum number of character in the name of mark.Such rule can be with other rules
(such as comprising enough characters, so that still the name and other possibilities are inferred in expectation by intended recipient) is applied in combination
Add.
It is being provided by user's (agreeing to through them) and store in their accounts in terms of other of some embodiments
Information may be used to determine how to be blurred certain entities in content of announcement.
For example, user can be equipped with adjustable setting, it can be logical in screen locking via these adjustable setting users
Know the middle rank for changing blurring.In some embodiments, it can select and/or adjust across all entities, and/or for spy
The entity for determining type is individually chosen and/or adjusts the degree (such as percentage, amount or technology of blurring).For example, user
Can choose: (a) personal name is adequately filtered out (such as " you good * * * *, you wanted meeting and had supper tonight? "), (b)
The character/number of a certain number of name is hidden to (such as in name 30% letter), (c) replaces Ming Hexingshi with initial
(such as " JD "), or (d) only with initial replacement surname (such as John D) or other possibilities.As another example,
User, which can choose, is adequately filtered out telephone number, or the digit of certain amount is filtered out (and may can choose
The digit that should be removed in telephone number).Other examples are also possible.
In in terms of other of some embodiments, when generating content of announcement, it may be considered that including the more of identical entity
(interplay) is influenced each other between a notice.For example, when telephone number appears in several screen lockings notice, telephone number
Blurring can be consistent in all notices comprising telephone number entity in identical screen locking.As specifically showing
Example can obscure telephone number if mobile device generates three notices comprising same phone number in each notice
Same numbers.Doing so helps to prevent the viewer of unauthorized by will be from the different mistakes of the telephone number of several notices
Filter version is combined to extract complete telephone number.
C. fuzzy based on context
In some embodiments, mobile device is configurable to carry out based on upper the fuzzy rank added in screen locking notice
Hereafter or location-based adjustment.Particularly, mobile device can (i) determining subsequent display phase with the content of announcement of filtering
Associated position and/or other contextual informations, (ii) select multiple blurring grades based on determining position and/or context
One in not, and then (iii) selects filter criteria based on selected blurring rank to be applied to content of announcement.
In a specific example, when mobile device detects in family that user is located in them, device can be reduced and is applied to
The blurring amount (or filtering that screen locking notice may be complete switched off) of screen locking notice.Also, when mobile device detects that user is fixed
Position in public places when, can automatically improve blurring amount.
Additionally or alternatively, device can be based on the specific type of the entity of the type and blurring of blurring
The adjustment of context.For example, determine user just at work when device, the special entity of adjustable blurring and for obscuring
The replacement text/image data of change, so that screen locking notice is more suitable for working environment, (such as to be located in other public with user is worked as
Made blurring is compared when place).It is noted that such adjustment (type of its entity obscured based on context changes)
The amount for being averagely applied to the blurring of content of announcement may or may not be increased or decreased.In the other content of some embodiments
In, user setting can permit user adjustment as device apply to as screen locking notification filter based on the adjustment of context
Mode.
In another aspect, filter process can using from associated (multiple) user accounts, computing device environment,
And/or the contextual information that user goes over and/or derived now with the interaction of the application run on the computing device.For example,
Especially sensitive name position can be passed through to the such life of text replacement with impliedly indicating positions by another reference point
Name position is blurred, which is known by intended recipient, but undesirable for unexpected viewing
Person is easily recognized.It include text if the doctor's office of user and gymnasium are located adjacent one another as specific example
The content of announcement of the office of Smith doctor " reserve " can be notified with screen locking in " reservation is near your gymnasium
Office " is replaced.
As another example, the notice 502b in Fig. 5 B is considered again, uses the preceding one in dialogue
Contextual information, with filter dialogue in newest message notice 502b in content of announcement.Unfiltered notification text
506 instructions and the Jack Fox time met and position.However, being based on message history, computing device can be determined comprising text
506 message is in response in the preceding one from intended recipient, such as a kind of possibility, it is proposed that appointment time and
The preceding one of position.(it is noted that such deduction can also be based on text 506 regardless of whether analyzing past message
Meaning itself determines, seems to refer to preferred message).
Thus it can be assumed that be, it is contemplated that recipient has known the appointment time confirmed in notification text 506 and position
It sets.Therefore, in the content of announcement 516 for generating filtering, computing device is by by address entity (such as " street Vine 123 ")
Text and annotation are the base that time entity (such as " 4pm ") replaces with time and position that meet is known dependent on intended recipient
In context hypothesis substitution herein come handle annotation be address entity text and annotation be time entity both texts,
And such information is impliedly provided to intended recipient by reference to " meet that you propose ".
It is noted that Fig. 5 C provide following example: if do not use contextual information, or with described in aforementioned exemplary
