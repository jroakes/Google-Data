- a wearable computing device may include a head-mounted display (HMD) equipped with a magnetometer device for detecting the presence and motion of a hand-wearable magnet (HWM), such as a magnetic ring or other hand-wearable item bearing a magnetic element.
- HWM hand-wearable magnet
- Detecting the presence and motion of the HWM can be used recognize known patterns of motion of the HWM that correspond to known gestures. Recognition of known patterns of motion may thereby be used to identify of known gestures, and identification of known gestures may provide a basis for user input to the HMD. For example, a particular gesture could be associated with a particular command, application, or other invocable action on the HMD.
- a head-mounted display may also include eyeglasses or goggles that can combine computer-generated images displayed on the eye-facing surfaces of lens elements with an actual field of view observable through the lens elements.
- eyeglasses or goggles that can combine computer-generated images displayed on the eye-facing surfaces of lens elements with an actual field of view observable through the lens elements.
- the capability of presenting the combination of the actual, observed field-of-view (FOV) with the displayed, computer-generated images can be complemented or supplemented with various functions and applications, as well as with various forms of user input and sensory data from ancillary wearable computing components, to provide rich and varied experiences and utility for a user or wearer of the HMD.
- FOV field-of-view
- the magnetometer device of the HMD may be configured to detect the presence and motion of the HWM predominantly within a spherical (or approximately spherical) volume of space of approximately arm's-length in diameter and centered (or nearly centered) at and surrounding the HMD, referred to herein as a “gesture detection region.” Accordingly, hand gestures detected via motion of the HWM may be associated with the wearer of the HMD; i.e., those gestures made generally within the wearer's arm's length of the magnetometer-equipped HMD.
- the magnetic field strength of a small magnet or other source that may be practically configured as the magnetic element of the HWM typically falls rapidly with distance from the source (e.g., as r ⁇ 3 for a dipole field for distance r), so that beyond a threshold distance (e.g., approximately half of a meter) the HWM may not be detectable above a threshold field strength by the magnetometer device.
- the gesture detection region may be seen as a spherical (or approximately spherical) region within which the distance from the HWM to the magnetometer device is smaller than the threshold distance.
- the boundary of the gesture detection region may be relatively sharp.
- the size and shape of the gesture detection region, as well as the sharpness of the boundary may be configured to depend on the sensitivity of the magnetometer device, and the strength and the geometry of the magnetic field of the HWM (e.g., dipole, multipole, etc.), among other possible factors.
- the field strength of a dipole magnet decreases as r ⁇ 3
- a quadrupole field drops off as r ⁇ 4 .
- a field having non-spherical shape and non-isotropic decrease in field-strength can be configured so as to result in a non-spherical gesture detection region having sharp boundaries in a well-defined region.
- Other multipole fields could be used as well for similar refining purposes.
- the ability to engineer the size and shape of the gesture detection region can further enhance precision, accuracy, and reliability of gesture detection and recognition.
- the field of the HWM may be detected as a deviation from a background magnetic field. More particularly, at any given time the magnetic field in the vicinity of the magnetometer device can be characterized as vector sum of a background magnetic field (typically dominated by the Earth's magnetic field) and a possible contribution due to the magnetic field of the HWM. Beyond the gesture detection region, the magnetic field of the HWM measured by the magnetometer device may be much weaker than the background field, and consequently can be treated as a perturbation of the geomagnetic field. As such, the field of the HWM may be considered to be detected if the magnetometer device measures a perturbation above a perturbation threshold. In practice, detection of the HWM above the threshold may be largely restricted to a region within the gesture detection region, and correspondingly to when the HWM is located within the gesture detection region.
- the magnetometer device may be configured to measure a magnetic field strength along each of three orthogonal directions (i.e., vector components along three orthogonal axes) in a frame of reference fixed to the magnetometer device. A magnitude of the magnetic field can then be determined from the measured strength of the vector components.
- detection of the HWM above the perturbation threshold can be determined by comparison of the field magnitude measured at a given time with the time averaged value. Since the boundary of the gesture detection region can be very sharp, a perturbation exceeding the threshold can occur very rapidly in comparison with the typical time duration of a gesture, and can therefore serve as a trigger condition to signal the start time of a “gesture detection window” within which a gesture may be detected.
- the HMD may begin interpreting detected presence and motion of the HWM as measured by the magnetometer device as a potential gesture upon occurrence of a trigger condition, and may cease interpreting when the trigger condition is no longer met, when the interpreted presence and motion are identified as a known gesture, or some combination of both.
- the HMD will begin acquiring time-sampled measurements of the field strength of each of the vector components. For each vector component, a discrete time derivative can be computed as a difference between the field strengths of successive samples.
- the discrete time derivatives of the vector field obtained from the discrete time derivatives of the vector components, may then be compared to digitally stored vector-field time derivatives associated with known (e.g., cataloged) gestures. For example, the comparison could be based on a statistical regression analysis or on a hidden Markov model algorithm. If and when a match is determined from a comparison, the associated gesture can then be identified as a particular known gesture.
- the HMD may then carry out an action or operation associated with the particular known gesture. If no match is found, the presence and motion of the HWM detected during the gesture-recognition window may be considered as spurious with regard to any potential gesture.
- the HMD may continue to monitor the trigger condition during the gesture detection window.
- the gesture detection window may end upon the first occurrence of any one of (a) the trigger condition ceasing to be met, (b) successful determination of an intended gesture, or (c) determination that detected presence and motion of the HWM is spurious.
- the gesture detection window could also have minimum duration that supersedes (a) in order to ensure acquisition of a sufficient number of time samples for gesture detection, or to avoid possibly early, false determinations of trigger cessation.
- the HMD may return to a state in which it only monitors for a trigger event (e.g., onset of the trigger condition), but does not necessarily compute the magnetic field time derivative or attempt to identify a gesture.
- stored (or cataloged) gestures may be generated as part of a “learning” procedure, whereby a wearer of the HMD provides a first input to start a recording interval for “recording,” makes a personalized or customize hand gesture while wearing the HWM, and then provides a second input to stop recording and end the recording interval.
- the recording action may thereby record the derivative of the magnetic field vectors as measured from the customized hand gesture during the recording interval.
- the wearer can thereafter associate the recorded derivatives with a particular gesture (e.g., a gesture identifier, a command, an application, etc.). By repeating this procedure for different gestures, the wearer may build up a library or catalog of known gestures for future use.
- the HMD will may include one or more motion detectors that provide translational and rotational motion measurements of the HMD.
- a motion detector could include one or more accelerometers, one or more gyroscopes, a location detection system (e.g., a GPS system), some or all of which could be configured as an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
- a motion detector could also include a video camera, whereby analysis of video data could detect and measure motion in the form of optical flow. The information from a motion detector can be used to compensate for HMD motion during magnetometer-based gesture detection.
- a wearer of the HMD is in a moving vehicle that is rapidly changing orientation with respect to the geomagnetic field (e.g., moving in a circle)
- detection of this motion by the motion detector could be used to disable the trigger, and hence cause the HMD to ignore any spurious signal that might otherwise be taken for presence and motion of the HWM in the gesture detection region.
- spurious i.e., non-gesture
- Motion detector measurements of the head motion could be used to compensate for the spurious relative motion, and enable correct gesture detection in this circumstance.

Furthermore, with multiple magnetometers a relative distance between the HMD and the HWM can be determined, allowing determination of a trajectory of the motion of the HWM. Such information could increase the usefulness of gestures. For instance, a virtual line could be drawn between two spatial points, or a virtual cursor or pointer could be invoked as free-space gesture. Other more complex gestures could be devised as well.
- an HMD can be communicatively connected with a communication network, and can exchange data with a server or server system (other device) in the network. Multiple HMDs in a network could also exchange data.
- applications and/or commands invoked by hand gestures could involve communication with a server or server system or with one or more other HMDs in the communication network.

In other embodiments, however, some or all of computing clusters 409 a , 409 b , and 409 c can have different numbers of computing devices, different numbers of cluster storage arrays, and/or different numbers of cluster routers. The number of computing devices, cluster storage arrays, and cluster routers in each computing cluster can depend on the computing task or tasks assigned to each computing cluster.
- Cluster storage arrays 410 a , 410 b , and 410 c of computing clusters 409 a , 409 b , and 409 c can be data storage arrays that include disk array controllers configured to manage read and write access to groups of hard disk drives.
- the disk array controllers alone or in conjunction with their respective computing devices, can also be configured to manage backup or redundant copies of the data stored in the cluster storage arrays to protect against disk drive or other cluster storage array failures and/or network failures that prevent one or more computing devices from accessing one or more cluster storage arrays.
- the cluster routers 411 a , 411 b , and 411 c in the computing clusters 409 a , 409 b , and 409 c can include networking equipment configured to provide internal and external communications for the computing clusters.
- the cluster routers 411 a in the computing cluster 409 a can include one or more internet switching and/or routing devices configured to provide (i) local area network communications between the computing devices 400 a and the cluster storage arrays 401 a via the local cluster network 412 a , and/or (ii) wide area network communications between the computing cluster 409 a and the computing clusters 409 b and 409 c via the wide area network connection 413 a to the network 406 .
- the cluster routers 411 b and 411 c can include network equipment similar to the cluster routers 411 a , and the cluster routers 411 b and 411 c can perform similar networking functions for the computing clusters 409 b and 409 b that the cluster routers 411 a perform for the computing cluster 409 a.
- Example embodiments of magnetometer-based gesture sensing with a magnetometer-equipped HMD may be described in terms of operation by considering representative use of an example HMD and an example hand-wearable magnet (HWM).
- a HMD such as the wearable computing device 100 of FIG. 1 , that includes a magnetometer device, as well as a HWM, may be taken as being worn by representative user.
- the HWM may be taken to be a magnetic ring or a ring bearing a magnetic element.
- the magnetic element (or ring) may be considered a dipole magnet, unless otherwise specified.
- HWM can be used by the representative user to facilitate user interaction with the HMD, as described below.
- a magnetometer device may include a magnetometer for measuring local magnetic field.
- the magnetometer device could also include additional components, such as a power supply, an interface for connecting and communicating with the HMD, and a processor for carrying out various computational functions (such as ones discussed below) and/or control functions (such as determining modes of operation, setting adjustable parameters, etc.).
- additional components and functions could be integrated with the magnetometer, in which case the magnetometer and the magnetometer device could be considered one and the same.
- the magnetometer device could include more than one magnetometer, or multiple single-magnetometer devices could be used, as discussed later in more detail.
- the magnetometer of a HMD may continuously monitor and measure a local magnetic field, and the HMD could recognize a particular gesture of a hand bearing a HWM by analyzing the effect of gesture-related motion of the HWM on the local magnetic field measured by the magnetometer.
- hand gestures may be carried out as transient actions within a localized “gesture detection region” of space near the HMD (e.g., within a spherical volume of roughly an arm's length radius, centered at the HMD). Beyond the gesture detection region, the HWM may be largely undetectable by the magnetometer.
- hand gestures may be viewed as transient magnetic disturbances against a background magnetic field. Accordingly, the HMD may be configured to detect and respond to such transient magnetic disturbances.
- the HMD may be configured to operate in different states with respect to magnetometer-based gesture recognition. More particularly, the HMD may operate in a background detection state in order to determine an initial baseline level of local magnetic field strength. While operating in the background detection state, the HMD may also anticipate hand gestures by monitoring for magnetic disturbances attributable to presence and motion of the HWM within a threshold distance of the magnetometer. Upon occurrence of a trigger event corresponding to magnetic disturbance above a threshold level, the HMD may then transition to operating in a gesture detection state. While operating in the gesture detection state, the HMD may analyze measurements from the magnetometer in order to determine if they correspond to a known gesture. If so, the HMD may then carry out one or more actions based on the now-recognized known gesture. For example, the HMD could carry out a user command associated with the known gesture.
- analysis of magnetometer measurements during operation in the gesture detection state may include comparison of the analyzed measurements with stored information associated with known gestures.
- the stored information may be generated by way of a “gesture learning” procedure for creating new, known gestures, and recording them on the HMD (e.g., in program data 208 illustrated in FIG. 2 ).
- the HMD may further be configured to operate in a gesture recording state, during which the gesture learning procedure may be carried out.
- the magnetometer may be a three-axis magnetometer for measuring local magnetic field along each of three orthogonal axes.
- the term “three-axis” will dropped in the following discussion, but will be understood to apply to the term “magnetometer” hereinafter unless otherwise indicated.
- the three orthogonal axes will be taken to be ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ circumflex over (z) ⁇ of a rectangular coordinate system referenced to (i.e., fixed to) the magnetometer.
- the discrete sampling times t i are regular, such that ⁇ t i+1 ⁇ t i is the same for all i.
- ⁇ t is referred to as the sampling interval
- sampling frequency 1 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ t is referred to as the sampling frequency.
- each sample may correspond to an accumulation (e.g., a time average) of a continuous measurement of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i over the duration of ⁇ t.
- the magnetometer could be configured to provide each ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i sample to the HMD (e.g., via an integrated interface or an interface component of the magnetometer device), which in turn could compute each h i .
- the magnetometer or magnetometer device
- the magnetometer could include functionality to compute each h i . Additional functions of the magnetometer and/or magnetometer device could include adjustment of ⁇ t and/or other operational parameters.
- the primary source of background magnetic field will be the Earth's magnetic field (geomagnetic field). While the direction of the geomagnetic field measured by the magnetometer will depend on the orientation of magnetometer (i.e., of the three measurement axes ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ circumflex over (z) ⁇ ) with respect to a coordinate system fixed to the Earth, the magnitude of the geomagnetic field at a given location does not. In addition, the magnitude of the geomagnetic field generally varies sufficiently slowly with location that it may be considered nearly constant over roughly metropolitan-size regions. Local sources of magnetic field or of magnetic field disturbances (e.g., electrical wires and metal structures) may also contribute to the background, but these generally tend to be weak, contributing mainly as noise to an average background level.
- Local sources of magnetic field or of magnetic field disturbances e.g., electrical wires and metal structures
- the background magnetic field can be determined as a time average of successive samples of field magnitude h i .
- the sample mean field strength ⁇ is given by:
- a standard deviation ⁇ of the sample mean ⁇ in equation (2a) may be computed as:
- an adaptive form of the standard deviation ⁇ N 1 ,N 2 of the sample mean ⁇ N 1 ,N 2 in equation (2b) may be computed as:
- the HMD can compute h i from the samples of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i measured by the magnetometer at times t i .
- the HMD may then compute the sample mean and standard deviation of the field strength (magnitude). More particularly, baseline values of sample mean and standard deviation may be established during a calibration period by acquiring an initial set of M measurements at consecutive times t i when the HWM is known to not be detected above a threshold level. For example, a user could hold the HWM beyond the threshold distance during the calibration period.
- the accuracy of the baseline values of sample mean and standard deviation may be improved by adopting a calibration period that is long compared with known or expected short-term (e.g., tens of seconds) field disturbances.
- the HMD may be moved about to a number of different locations and oriented in a number of different orientations within a region of expected use.
- a user might walk around a room or neighborhood during the calibration period. Note that a precise value of M need not necessarily be specified, so long as M>>1 can be reasonably understood to be satisfied.
- a calibration period of “approximately X” minutes could be an adequate specification, so long as “approximately X minutes” could be reasonably understood as being much greater than ⁇ t and/or long compared with known or expected short-term field disturbances.
- “approximately X minutes” could be in a range of 5-10 minutes. Other values could be used as well.
- the HMD while operating in the background detection state, the HMD will continue to monitor the background magnetic field. More particularly, once the baseline values of sample mean and standard deviation have been established, the HWM may continually update the values to the current time by using ongoing measurements of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i from the magnetometer, and by applying a sliding window as described in equations (2c) and (3c), for example.
- the background magnetic field strength provides a baseline against which the HWM may at later times be detected as a perturbation. If appropriate conditions are met, as described below, a detected perturbation may serve as a trigger for the HMD to transition to operating in the gesture detection state.
- FIG. 5 is a conceptual illustration of the perturbation of the background magnetic field produced by the HWM.
- a user 501 is depicted as wearing a HWM 502 that is equipped with a magnetometer device (not shown).
- the user 501 is wearing a HWM in the form of a magnetic ring 504 on his left hand.
- Representative field lines of the ring 504 of a dipole aligned along the user's finger are shown for illustrative purposes only.
- a reference distance 505 delineates a spherical volume, represented by circular arc 507 , within which a perturbation field caused by the ring 504 makes a detectable contribution to the total field.
- the reference distance 505 is depicted as measured from the front and center of the HMD 502 ; in practice a more accurate measure might be referenced to the location of the magnetometer on the HMD 502 .
- the inset 508 - 1 represents the magnetic field magnitude ⁇ H ⁇ as function of time (solid horizontal line).
- the perturbation field makes a detectable contribution to the total magnetic field magnitude.
- the inset 508 - 2 shows the background magnetic field magnitude ⁇ H ⁇ as function of time, as well as the total of the background magnetic field plus the perturbation field (dashed horizontal line).
- a trigger condition can occur when the magnitude of the total magnetic field (i.e., the vector sum of the background plus the perturbation fields) differs from that of just the background field by at least a threshold amount.
- a perturbation of the background field is said to be greater than a perturbation threshold, and the reference distance 505 may accordingly be considered a threshold distance.
- Determination of a trigger condition may include not only detection of a perturbation above a perturbation threshold, but also when (and how suddenly) the detected perturbation occurs, and how long it lasts.
- the HMD may determine the occurrence of a trigger condition by detecting a perturbation of the background magnetic field caused by the HWM.
- the threshold condition can correspond to the HWM being moved within a threshold distance of the magnetometer, where the threshold distance can be considered a distance within which hand gestures are expected to occur.
- occurrence of the trigger condition can signal the start of a gesture, and can therefore be used to cause the HMD to transition to the gesture detection state (described below).
- a deviation d i of h i from the sample mean can be determined.
- a “trigger function” may be defined for each sample time as:
- Trigger i ⁇ 1 ⁇ ⁇ if ⁇ ⁇ d i > ⁇ 0 ⁇ ⁇ otherwise . ( 4 )
- the deviation d i can be defined in a number of ways.
- absolute value is used because any given deviation can be above or below the sample mean.
- d i and ⁇ are in units of magnetic field strength (e.g., Telsa or Gauss).
- the deviation can be defined as a dimensionless number relative to the standard deviation:
- d i 1 ⁇ 2 ⁇ ( h i - ⁇ ) 2 . ( 6 )
- d i and ⁇ are in units of standard deviations.
- d i 3.5 corresponds to 3.5 standard deviations (i.e., 3.5 ⁇ or “3.5 sigma”).
- Other forms of deviation d i could be defined as well, and the example embodiments described herein are not limited only to the two above examples.
- the sample mean against which h i is compared could take on one of the forms in equations (2a), (2b), or (2c) above.
- ⁇ as given by equation (2a) corresponds to an assumed constant (or nearly constant) baseline value.
- ⁇ as given by equations (2b) or (2c) corresponds to an adaptive value of sample mean, as explained above.
- ⁇ could take on one of the forms in equations (3a), (3b), or (3c) above, in which case the characterization of a constant (or nearly constant) baseline value of sample mean versus an adaptive value of sample mean applies to the standard deviation as well.
- a trigger condition could correspond to at least p consecutive occurrences of trigger events, where 1 ⁇ p ⁇ K.
- a trigger condition could correspond to at least any p out of K occurrences of trigger events, where again 1 ⁇ p ⁇ K.
- the onset of a trigger condition may be considered as occurring at time t 0 (i.e., the time of the third of three consecutive triggers).
- the onset of a trigger condition may again be considered as occurring at time t 0 (i.e., the time of the third of three out of six triggers).
- both p and K are kept small since it is generally desirable to make a trigger determination over a small number of samples compared with a number of samples in a typical gesture (as discussed below).
- trigger determination may be accomplished with p and K in a range of 1-5% of a typical number of samples in a typical gesture.
- keeping N>>p and K helps ensure that the sliding time window W 0,N spans a time interval large enough to average out transient fluctuations of the background field, including possible valid triggers.
- N ⁇ 1,000 ⁇ p, K although other relative sizes of N and p, K may be used that satisfy N>>p, K.
- FIG. 6 is a conceptual illustration of determination of a trigger condition based on a perturbation of the background magnetic field by the HWM.
- a user 601 is depicted as wearing a HWM 602 that is equipped with a magnetometer device (not shown).
- the user 601 is wearing a HWM in the form of a magnetic ring 604 on his left hand.
- a threshold distance 603 delineates a spherical gesture detection region, represented by circular arc 605 , within which a perturbation field caused by the ring 604 results in a trigger condition being satisfied.
- the threshold distance 603 is depicted as measured from the front and center of the HMD 602 ; in practice a more accurate measure might be referenced to the location of the magnetometer on the HMD 602 .
- the user's left hand (and ring 604 ) is shown at three positions, labeled “(1),” “(2),” and “(3),” intended to represent motion of the user's left hand from position (1) to position (3).
- the ring 604 is positioned beyond the threshold distance, and moving toward position (2).
- the ring 604 is positioned at (or nearly at) the threshold distance, and approaching the spherical boundary delineated by the circular arc 605 as it moves toward position (3).
- the ring 604 is positioned within the threshold distance (and possibly still moving within the gesture detection region).
- the perturbation of the background magnetic field by the magnetic ring 604 may be monitored and measured by the magnetometer of the HMD 602 in order to determine if and when a trigger condition occurs.
- This is illustrated in the insets 606 - 1 , 606 - 2 , and 606 - 3 , which depict successive samples of field strength ⁇ H ⁇ as the ring 604 moves across the three example positions.
- Each inset shows a background field strength labeled ⁇ (solid horizontal line), and a perturbation threshold labeled + ⁇ and ⁇ (dashed horizontal lines) above and below the background.
- the successive samples, corresponding to h i in the discussion above, are shown as diamonds with short vertical lines at the respective sample times.
- the inset 606 - 1 shows the samples h i at sample times t i , t i+1 , . . . , t i+k , as the ring 604 moves from position (1) toward position (2).
- the inset 606 - 2 shows the samples h i at sample times t i+k+1 , t i+k+2 , . . . , t i+2k , as the ring 604 moves from position (2) towards and across the spherical boundary delineated by the circular arc 605 .
- the inset 606 - 3 shows the samples h i at sample times t i+2k+1 , t i+2k+2 , . . . , t i+3k , as the ring 604 moves from across the spherical boundary toward position (3).
- the samples h i at sample times t i , t i+1 , . . . , t i+k in the inset 606 - 1 evidently fluctuate near the sample mean ⁇ , but remain within ⁇ of the background. Accordingly, a trigger condition has not yet occurred.
- the samples h i at sample times t i+k+1 , t i+k+2 , . . . , t i+2k show increasing deviations from ⁇ , with the last two, at times t i+2k ⁇ 1 and t i+2k , falling below ⁇ (that is, more than ⁇ below ⁇ ).
- a trigger condition may be considered occurring at time t i+2k in the example illustrated FIG. 6 .
- a trigger condition may be considered occurring at time t i+2k ⁇ 1 .
- This illustration also demonstrates that a trigger condition can correspond to a perturbation that is more than a threshold below (i.e. less than) background field.
- the samples h i at sample times t i+2k+1 , t i+2k+2 , . . . , t i+3k show deviations that are predominantly more than ⁇ below ⁇ . These could represent samples taken while a gesture is being made within the gesture detection region. Note that a few of the samples in the inset 606 - 3 appear to be within ⁇ of ⁇ . However, once the trigger condition is detected (e.g. at time t i+2k ), it may remain in effect until one or more other conditions or events occur.
- the time at which a trigger condition is detected is referred to as T start , and corresponds to the onset of the trigger condition.
- the HMD will transition to operating in the gesture detection state upon determination of occurrence of a trigger condition at T start .
- the HMD will continue to operate in the gesture detection state until one or more other conditions or combinations of conditions is determined by the HMD to occur, at which time the HMD will transition back to operating in the background detection state.
- these other conditions include cessation of the trigger condition, expiration of a minimum detection window interval W min , and detection of a gesture. There may be other conditions as well.
- the gesture detection window corresponds to a time interval during which the HWM is presumed to be tracing out a gesture within the gesture detection region.
- the discrete derivatives computed according to equation (7) correspond to derivatives specific to motion of the HWM presumed to correspond to a particular gesture that is traced during the gesture detection window.
- the duration of W g given by T stop ⁇ T start , will generally be at least as long as the minimum detection window interval W min , and may be longer depending on how long the trigger condition persists.
- a user 701 is depicted as wearing a HWM 702 that is equipped with a magnetometer device (not shown).
- the user 701 is wearing a HWM in the form of a magnetic ring 703 on his left hand, which is depicted as detached from the user's body in order to avoid an overly-complicated figure.
- the user's left hand (and ring 703 ) is shown at four positions, labeled “(1),” “(2),” “(3),” and “(4),” intended to represent motion of the user's left hand tracing a gesture.
- the ring 703 is presumed to be within the gesture detection region.
- Sample acquisition is represented in the three insets 706 - x , 706 - y , and 706 - z , which respectively show the strength of one of H x , H y , or H z as a function of time.
- the successive samples corresponding to (H x ) i , (H y ) i , (H z ) i are shown as diamonds with short vertical lines at the respective sample times.
- the HMD will compute the discrete derivatives according to equation (7) (or an algorithmically analogous form) to obtain a set of computed time derivatives, and then compare the set of computed time derivatives with one or more stored sets of pre-determined time derivatives in order to find a match.
- Each of the one or more stored sets will include a pre-determined association with a respective known gesture.
- the HMD may identify the respective known gesture associated with the particular stored set as the user's just-made gesture detected via the field ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i sampled during the gesture detection window.
- Each set of computed time derivatives corresponds to a triplet of computed sequences of time derivatives (one sequence each for ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ circumflex over (z) ⁇ ).
- each of the one or more stored sets of pre-determined time derivatives corresponds to a stored triplet of pre-determined sequences of time derivatives (again, one sequence each for ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ circumflex over (z) ⁇ ).
- Finding a match then may be accomplished by simultaneously matching (or most closely matching) each respective computed ( ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ , ⁇ , or ⁇ circumflex over (z) ⁇ ) sequence of the triplet of computed sequences of time derivatives with each respective pre-determined ( ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ , ⁇ , or ⁇ circumflex over (z) ⁇ ) sequence of one of the stored triplets of pre-determined sequences of time derivatives.
- each stored triplet of pre-determined sequences of time derivatives is based on differences between a reference set of successive samples of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ j , so again, the background magnetic field contribution to ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ j is subtracted out.
- any variations in the background magnetic fields between the samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i and ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ j may be removed by the subtraction.
- each stored set of pre-determined time derivatives corresponds to a respective known gesture that was previously carried out during operation of the HMD in a gesture recording state, in which the magnetometer acquired samples of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i and the HMD computed and recorded the associated derivatives.
- each stored set provides a reference set of time derivatives against which a subsequently detected, presumed gesture may be compared.
- a subsequent gesture traced by a HWM and detected by the magnetometer may not necessarily trace out a path strictly identical to that of a pre-determined gesture, even when the subsequent gesture is the same (e.g., intended by a user to be the same) as the pre-determined one.
- the HMD may not necessarily find a strictly exact match with one of the stored sets of pre-determined time derivatives. As suggested above, finding a “closest match” or “most closely matching” may be sufficient to identify a known gesture with measurements of a presumed gesture.
- finding a “closest match” or “most closely matching” may be accomplished by treating each stored set of pre-determined time derivatives as a mathematical model of a respective known gesture, and further, by statistically evaluating a fit of the computed time derivatives to each model.
- the HMD could determine the closest match from among the stored sets as the one that yields the best statistical fit.
- the HMD could also apply a statistical threshold for matching, such that failure to achieve at least the statistical threshold for any of the stored sets (models) in any given instance could correspond to failure to identify the measured, presumed gesture with any known gesture.
- the HMD may then invoke or carry out one or more actions associated with the known gesture.
- the known gesture may be associated with a user input to the HMD, such as causing the HMD to upload a digital photo to a social networking website or server, or selecting a menu item displayed in the display area of the HMD. It will be appreciated that any number and variety of actionable or passive user inputs to the HMD could be associated with known gestures stored on the HMD.
- a heuristic method could be used to recognize gestures based on characteristics of just the computed time derivatives.
- An example of such a heuristic approach may be illustrated by considering recognition of a horizontal “sweeping” or “swipe” gesture. Referring again to FIGS. 1 a and 1 b , and taking the lens elements 110 and 112 to define a plane of the field of view of the HMD, such a sweeping or swipe gesture could be considered as corresponding to movement of the HWM across the field of view of the HMD, with little or no movement perpendicular to the field-of-view plane.
- analysis of the signs of the ⁇ circumflex over (x) ⁇ and ⁇ time derivatives could be used to determine the direction (i.e., leftward or rightward) of the horizontal sweeping or swipe gesture. Accordingly, such a horizontal sweeping or swipe gesture could be recognized without reference to stored sets of pre-determined time derivatives of known gestures. It will be appreciated that such an approach could be extended to enable recognition of vertical or diagonal sweeping or swipe gestures, as well as line-of-sight gestures, and possibly other gestures as well.
- W g is at least as long as the minimum detection window interval W min .
- a minimum length time window also can help ensure that occurrences of cessation of the trigger condition do not prematurely end the gesture detection process.
- the gesture detection window W g may extend beyond W min if the trigger condition persists beyond W min . Hence, the end of W g at T stop corresponds to a time at least W min beyond T start at which the HMD determines the trigger condition to cease.
- the gesture detection window will remain open until at least the end of W min . If the HMD detects persistence of the trigger condition beyond the end of W min , the gesture detection window will remain open until at least T cease . It is convenient to specify the length (duration) of W min in terms of number of sample intervals, N min .
- the HMD may determine that a trigger condition has ceased by determining a threshold number of consecutive sample deviations d i below the perturbation threshold, or alternatively, by determining a threshold fractional number of sample deviations d i measured below the perturbation threshold.
- T cease can be determined by computing the trigger function Trigger i over a sliding time window W 0,K , where K is small compared with N min . This corresponds to searching for cessation over a time window W 0,K that is short compared with W min and that slides across W g starting from T start .
- K could be approximately 0.06 ⁇ N min , though other values could satisfy K ⁇ N min .
- the HMD may use either of equations (9a) or (9b) (or an algorithmically analogous form) to determine T cease , and equation (8) to determine T stop .
- equation (8) may apply equation (9a) or (9b) repeatedly in instances where either yields T cease ⁇ T start + ⁇ t min .
- the HMD may accumulate magnetic field samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i in a buffer (e.g., in memory such as program data 208 in FIG. 2 ) for determination of both h i and the computed derivatives. While operating in the background detection state, the HMD may skip computing discrete derivatives, and only compute h i . While operating in the gesture detection state, the HMD may compute both h i and the discrete derivatives.
- a buffer e.g., in memory such as program data 208 in FIG. 2
- the HMD may skip computing discrete derivatives, and only compute h i .
- the HMD may compute both h i and the discrete derivatives.
- the HMD may include in the computation of the derivatives some samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i accumulated during just before T start . This could help improve the accuracy of gesture detection for instances in which the start of a gesture precedes determination of an associated trigger condition by a few samples.
- the number of pre-trigger samples included in gesture detection i.e., computed derivatives would be expected to be small; e.g. approximately 10 or fewer.
- the HMD may compute the discrete derivatives and search for a matching known gesture based on an accumulation of field samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i acquired over either the entire gesture detection window W g or over just a portion of W g . More particularly, the HMD may accumulate field samples up until T stop , and thereafter compute the derivatives and analyze them for detection of a known gesture. Alternatively, the HMD may begin computing derivatives and analyzing them for detection of a known gesture after acquiring a threshold number of samples, where the threshold number is some fraction of the total number of samples corresponding to a full gesture detection window. In this alternative approach, the HMD may continue to acquire samples as it analyzes them, until a known gesture is detected. This could allow “early” gesture detection in instances when less than a full number of samples are sufficient to make the determination.
- the HMD may transition back to operating in the background detection state at T stop .
- the HMD may transition back to the background detection state upon either identification of a known gesture based on analysis of the computed derivatives (i.e., comparison with pre-stored derivatives), or failure to identify any known gesture.
- the HMD may remain in the gesture detection state if the trigger condition persists even upon or after identification of a known gesture. In this case, the HMD may begin a new gesture detection cycle using new set of acquired samples, without first transitioning back to the background detection state. For example, a user might make multiple gestures without ever moving the HWM (e.g., magnetic ring) outside of the gesture detection region.
- HWM e.g., magnetic ring
- analysis of computed time derivatives of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i for gesture recognition may be based on comparing the computed derivatives with one or more stored sets of pre-determined time derivatives, where each stored set is respectively associated with a known gesture.
- each set of pre-determined time derivatives may be generated and stored on the HMD during operation in a gesture recording state.
- the HMD may apply a gesture recording procedure that is largely the same as the gesture detection procedure described above, except that instead of matching computed time derivatives to stored ones, the HMD treats a set of computed time derivatives as a new (or replacement) known gesture and records (stores) them together with an identifier of the known gesture. Accordingly, equation (7) again applies to computation of time derivatives. However, while operating in the gesture detection state, the HMD records the computed time derivatives. The HMD also creates a three-way association between the recorded, computed time derivatives, an identifier of a known gesture, and a pre-determined action that may be carried out by the HMD.
- the HMD will transition to operating in the gesture recording state upon determining the occurrence of a recording trigger.
- a recording trigger may be used to signal to the HMD that the next detected gesture (as traced by the HWM) should be treated as a new or replacement gesture.
- the recording trigger may also include an indication of an identifier of the new or replacement gesture, as well as the associated pre-determined action.
- the HWM acquires samples of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i and computes time derivatives from them, it will store the time derivatives together with the three-way association for the gesture.
- a replacement gesture is one for which the stored time derivatives and three-way association replaces a previous version of the same for an existing (i.e. previously stored) known gesture.
- a recording trigger may correspond to a particular input or command that includes both an indication that a new or replacement gesture is about to be made (e.g., the next detected gesture) and the pre-determined action that should be associated with the gesture once it is detected and recorded.
- the trigger could also include the gesture identifier.
- the gesture identifier could be determined by the HMD as an internal parameter.
- a recording trigger could include just an indication to record the time derivatives. Identification of a pre-determined action could be made subsequently.
- a user could use an already-known gesture as a recording trigger for the next subsequent gesture.
- a user could use another form of user input to the HMD to indicate a recording trigger.
- a user could use the finger-operable touchpad 124 to signal a recording trigger.
- Other forms of user input could be used as well.
- the HMD could be operating in the background detection state prior to receiving a recording trigger and responsively transitioning to operating in the gesture detection state. Upon completion of recording a new or replacement gesture while operating in the gesture recording state, the HMD could then transition back to operating in the background detection state.
- the HMD is moving and/or changing orientation relative to the background (geomagnetic) field.
- the user could be in a moving vehicle, changing direction while walking, or even just shaking his or her head in a way that can alter the alignment between the axes of the magnetometer and the background field.
- Motion and/or changing orientation can be detected by a HMD using one or more of the motion sensing devices, such as could be part of the motion sensor 232 in FIG. 2 .
- the motion sensing devices such as could be part of the motion sensor 232 in FIG. 2 .
- an accelerometer, a gyroscope, or a magnetometer as described below.
- the effect of motion and/or changing orientation on magnetometer measurements can manifest in a variety of ways, and can call for one or another form of compensation applied to operations discussed above, or can provide additional modes of input for enhancing gesture detection based on magnetic sensing.
- a change in the orientation of the magnetometer i.e., of the HMD
- the background magnetic field will not affect operation of the magnitude-based trigger mechanism discussed above.
- a change in the orientation of the magnetometer with respect to the background magnetic field can cause a change in the relative strengths of the measured field vector components H x , H y , and H z . Consequently, such a change in orientation can affect HMD operations based on measured strengths of field vector components. For example, a change in orientation that occurs while the HMD is operating in the gesture detection state and over a timescale approximately comparable to that of a typical gesture can cause the computed time derivatives to deviate from those obtained in the absence of a change in orientation.
- the HMD while operating in the background detection state, can use a change in the relative strengths of the measured field vector components H x , H y , and H z as an alternative trigger. More specifically, even in the absence of a magnitude-based trigger from a HWM, the HMD may determine that a particular orientation change detected via a change in the relative strengths of H x , H y , and H z corresponds to a pre-determined trigger. In response, the HMD may transition to operating in the gesture detection state.
- the HMD could recognize a particular head-motion gesture of a user by determining that a change in the relative strengths of measured samples (H x ) i , (H y ) i , (H z ) i corresponds to pre-determined, pre-recorded relative changes associated with the particular head-motion gesture (or trigger).
- the pre-determined, pre-recorded relative changes could be established using a procedure similar to that described above for gesture recording.
- a user could use a nod or a shake of his or her head to trigger the start of a hand gesture (i.e., transition of the HMD to the gesture detection state).
- Other orientation-change-based gestures and/or triggers could be similarly devised and used as well.
- Detected orientation changes could additionally or alternatively signal conditions under which magnetic gesture detection by the HMD could be hampered.
- the HMD can use a change in the relative strengths of the measured field vector components H x , H y , and H z to determine that a transition to the gesture detection state should be disabled, at least while the orientation is changing.
- Such an action could be used to disable attempted gesture recognition under conditions that might otherwise be prone to an unacceptable or unrecoverable error in computing and/or analyzing time derivatives from samples acquired while the orientation is changing.
- the HMD could ignore a magnitude-based trigger from a HWM that occurs while the orientation is determined to be changing, or at least changing in a manner that does not correspond to a known orientation-change-based trigger.
- a changing orientation can affect computed time derivatives, it may be possible to compensate for such changing orientation so as to preserve a level of reliability and/or accuracy of gesture detection, even in the presence changing orientation. More specifically, by measuring orientation changes concurrently with the acquisition of samples of ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i during operation in the gesture detection state, the changing orientation may be accounted for and largely or entirely removed.
- the HMD may measure changing orientation by means of a motion sensing device, such as the motion sensor 232 in FIG. 2 .
- the senor may include a gyroscope that can be used by the HMD to determine orientation changes in a form that can be applied to analytically adjust the measured samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i to yield computed time derivatives with motion-related components largely or entirely removed.
- a gyroscope that can be used by the HMD to determine orientation changes in a form that can be applied to analytically adjust the measured samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i to yield computed time derivatives with motion-related components largely or entirely removed.
- a change in orientation of the magnetometer with respect to the background magnetic field can be represented as a rotation in three-dimensional space, and expressed analytically in terms of a rotation matrix R ⁇ SO(3), where SO(3) refers to the “special orthogonal rotation group” in three dimensions.
- ⁇ right arrow over (E) ⁇ is the Earth's magnetic field (i.e., the background field), assumed to be constant from one sample to the next, and ⁇ right arrow over (M) ⁇ i and ⁇ right arrow over (M) ⁇ i ⁇ 1 are the vector contributions from the HWM measured from one sample to the next as the HWM traces out a gesture.
- the background field is subtracted out, leaving only the difference between the HWM-produced field samples.
- the HMD may be equipped with a gyroscope, and may use measurements from the gyroscope to determine R. More specifically, the gyroscope may be configured to measure an angular velocity three-vector ⁇ right arrow over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ in the same frame of reference as the magnetometer.
- the form of the rotation matrix R may be derived from ⁇ right arrow over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ , and ⁇ , as is known in the art.
- the effect of R operating on a vector ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ is to rotate ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ around ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ by an angle ⁇ in time dt.
- the HMD may compute ⁇ i , ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ i , and ⁇ i to determine R i at t i .
- the effect of R i operating on ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i is to rotate ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i around ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ i by an angle ⁇ i in time ⁇ t.
- the HMD may acquire samples ⁇ right arrow over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ i and determine R i and R i ⁇ 1 at sample times t i .
- the HMD may then use equation (13) (or an algorithmically analogous form) to compute discrete time derivatives corrected for changes in orientation of the magnetometer with respect to the background magnetic field occurring (or that occurred) while magnetic field samples ⁇ right arrow over (H) ⁇ i are being (or were) acquired, also at sample times t i .
- the gesture recognition based on magnetic sensing of a HWM may thus be carried out while the magnetometer of the HMD is undergoing a change in orientation with respect to the background magnetic field.
- a magnetometer device of a HMD may include more than one three-axis magnetometer.
- a magnetometer device may include two three-axis magnetometers mounted on the HMD with a baseline distance between them. For example, they could be mounted at opposite ends of eyeglasses 102 in FIGS. 1 a and/or 2 a . In such a configuration, the two magnetometers could provide the HMD with a stereoscopic view of time derivatives associated with HWM-base gestures.
- the background magnetic field e.g., the geomagnetic field
- Mag1 and Mag2 can be calibrated in the absence of any disturbance to the background field to ensure that they both measure the same vector component values of the background magnetic field.
- the size scale of the gesture detection region is typically only slightly larger than, but of the same order of magnitude of, the separation between Mag1 and Mag2, the respective angular displacements between the HWM and each of Mag1 and Mag2 will generally be measurably different during gesture detection (i.e., while the HWM is within the gesture detection region).
- the perturbation-based triggering method described above may be applied with greater sensitivity, since the background field contribution can be removed prior to monitoring for perturbations.
- the use of Mag1 and Mag2 to may allow for more sensitive triggering of gesture detection.
- the HMD could then combine the measurements of to the two magnetometers to support a more precise trigger definition, enhance the accuracy of trigger detection and determination while operating in the background detection state, enhance the accuracy of gesture recognition while operating in the gesture detection state, and support the creation and recognition of more complex gestures.
- the HMD may determine the occurrence of a trigger condition by determining that measurements from both magnetometers concurrently indicate a magnitude-based trigger condition from the HWM.
- the HMD may determine the occurrence of a trigger condition by determining that measurements from at least one of the magnetometers indicate a magnitude-based trigger condition from the HWM.
- orientation-change-based trigger detection could be determined from concurrent orientation-change-based triggers from both magnetometers, or an orientation-change-based trigger from at least one of the magnetometers.
- gesture recognition using two magnetometers could combine individual time derivatives from both magnetometers into a three-dimensional (e.g., stereoscopic) view of time derivatives. This could introduce one or more additional spatial dimensions to gesture creation and gesture recognition.
- a hand gesture in the form a circle might be used to enclose an area of display viewed within the field of view of the HMD. The HMD might then create a digital photograph of the enclosed area.
- the distance of the HWM from the HMD when the gesture is made could be determined, and the size of the enclosed area in the field of view thereby adjusted according to the determined distance. In this way, a single gesture could produce different results when analyzed by the HMD, based (in this example) on distance from the HMD.
- Other modes of combining derivatives from two magnetometers to enhance gesture recognition are possible as well.
- the HWM may include a magnetic element that produces a magnetic field of higher order than just a dipole field.
- the HWM could produce a quadrupole magnetic field.
- the magnitude of a quadrupole magnetic field falls off as r ⁇ 4 , where r is the distance from the source of the field. Consequently the gesture detection region for a HWM with a quadrupole field could be smaller and have a sharper boundary than one with just a dipole magnetic field, since a dipole magnetic field falls off as as r ⁇ 3 .
- a HWM could include multiple dipole magnetic elements, or combined dipole and quadrupole magnetic elements, configured in relative orientations so as to produce field geometries that are non-spherical at distances within a gesture detection region. This could be used to create a non-spherical gesture detection region.
- the HWM could take a form other than a single ring.
- the HWM could be in form of multiple rings, or other hand-worn jewelry.
- the HWM could also be in the form of a magnetic decal affixed to one or more fingernails, or one or more magnetize artificial fingernails. Combining a multiple-finger HWM with one or more three-axis magnetometers could allow recognition of complex gestures involving combined motions of two or more fingers, in addition to bulk hand motion.
- the HWM could take the form of a fashionable or stylish adornment having potential marketing value beyond its function in gesture sensing by the magnetometer device.
- the example embodiments for magnetometer-based gesture detection and recognition described above in operational terms of can be implemented as a method on a wearable HMD equipped with a magnetometer device. An example embodiment of such a method is described below.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating an example embodiment of a method in a wearable computing system, such as a wearable HMD, for magnetometer-base gesture detection and recognition.
- the illustrated steps of the flowchart could be implemented in the wearable head-mounted display as executable instructions stored in one or another form of memory, and executed by one or more processors of the wearable head-mounted display.
- the HMD could include a magnetometer or magnetometer device for carrying out measurements used in the method. Examples of a wearable HMD include the wearable computing system 100 in FIG. 1 and the wearable computing system 202 in FIG. 2 .
- the executable instructions could also be stored on some form of non-transitory tangible computer readable storage medium, such as magnetic or optical disk, or the like, and provided for transfer to the wearable head-mounted display's memory during configuration or other procedure(s) for preparing the wearable head-mounted display for operation.

These include measuring the magnitude of the background magnetic field with a magnetometer device, monitoring for occurrence of a trigger from a HWM, and upon occurrence of the trigger, opening a gesture detection window and transitioning to operating in a gesture detection state.
- the HMD operates in the gesture detection state. While operating in the gesture detection state, the HMD carries various functions of the gesture detection state.

- measuring the magnitude of the background magnetic field with a magnetometer device while operating in the background detection state could be achieved as described in the discussion above of the background detection state. More particularly, the HMD could determine the magnitude of the background magnetic field from time sample measurements of three orthogonal components of the magnetic field H x , H y , and H z from the magnetometer device, as described above in connection with the discussion of equations (2a), (2b), and (2c).
- the HMD could monitor for a trigger from the HWM while operating in the background detection state (step 802 ), monitoring for occurrence of a trigger from a HWM by determining a the perturbation by the HWM of the background field magnitude remains at least as large as the perturbation threshold for at least a first threshold length of time. For example, the HMD could determine that a time-average value of the perturbation of the determined field magnitude remains at least as large as the perturbation threshold for at least the first threshold length of time.

- specifying both cessation of the trigger and expiration of a minimum window as a condition for the HMD to transition from the operating in the background detection state provides for a minimum number of magnetic field samples to be acquired and analyzed.

Abstract
Description
h≡∥{right arrow over (H)}∥=√{square root over (H x 2 +H y 2 +H z 2)}. (1)
is referred to as the sampling frequency. In accordance with example embodiments, sampling intervals in the range 10-20 msec (0.01-0.02 seconds) may be used, corresponding to sampling frequencies in the range 50-100 Hz (1 Hz=1 cycle per second). It will be appreciated that sampling intervals outside of this range are possible as well. In practice, each sample may correspond to an accumulation (e.g., a time average) of a continuous measurement of {right arrow over (H)}i over the duration of Δt.
More generally, for N discrete times ti, i=N1, . . . , N2, over a sliding time window WN
The sliding window WN
In terms of W0,N, the standard deviation σ0 at t0 may be computed as:
d i =|h i−μ|. (5)
Note that absolute value is used because any given deviation can be above or below the sample mean. In this case, di and θ are in units of magnetic field strength (e.g., Telsa or Gauss). As an alternative, the deviation can be defined as a dimensionless number relative to the standard deviation:
In this case, di and θ are in units of standard deviations. For example, di=3.5 corresponds to 3.5 standard deviations (i.e., 3.5σ or “3.5 sigma”). Other forms of deviation di could be defined as well, and the example embodiments described herein are not limited only to the two above examples.
As defined above, Δt is the sampling interval. Note that there may be one fewer time derivative for each axis than there are samples, since each computed time derivative uses two samples.
T stop=max[T cease,(T start +Δt min)]. (8)
T cease =t 0 if Σi=0 q≦kTriggeri=0 (9a)
and
T cease =t 0 if Σi=0 K−1Triggeri ≦K−q,q≦K. (9b)
{right arrow over (H)} i ={right arrow over (E)}+{right arrow over (M)} i, (10a)
and
{right arrow over (H)} i−1 ={right arrow over (E)}+{right arrow over (M)} i−1. (10b)
Δ{right arrow over (H)} i ={right arrow over (H)} i −{right arrow over (H)} i−1 ={right arrow over (M)} i −{right arrow over (M)} i−1. (11)
As discussed above, the background field is subtracted out, leaving only the difference between the HWM-produced field samples.
(Δ{right arrow over (H)} i)R =R i {right arrow over (H)} i −{right arrow over (H)} i−1 =R i({right arrow over (E)}+{right arrow over (M)} i)−({right arrow over (E)}+{right arrow over (M)} i−1), (12)
where Ri corresponds to the rotation matrix at time ti. In this case, the background field does not cancel between samples, because it has been rotated with respect to the magnetometer from one sample to the next. More particularly, Ri specifies the rotation of the magnetic field vector from its direction at time ti−1 to its direction at time ti. By determining Ri, the effect of rotation can be removed.
R i −1 R i {right arrow over (H)} i −{right arrow over (H)} i−1 =R i −1 R i({right arrow over (E)}+{right arrow over (M)} i)−({right arrow over (E)}+{right arrow over (M)} i−1)={right arrow over (M)} i −{right arrow over (M)} i−1. (13)
Thus, the Earth's magnetic field again cancels, and the un-rotated form of Δ{right arrow over (H)}i in equation (11) may be recovered. It will be appreciated that Ri −1 can be determined from Ri by known methods.
