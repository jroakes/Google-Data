On relatively more commonly or it is specific check in session (with it is all check session compared with) it is relatively less common, and therefore can
Cited characteristic is weighted.It does so, for example, can be based on cited comparison to the feature of the reference in notice
It is placed into row major, is cancelled and is prioritized and/or otherwise adjusts.As an example, checking session (for example, not with other
Include from the channel owners being cited those of video check session or all check session) compare, it is special in identification
Determine characteristic is in specific check in session (for example, each includes that those of the video from specific channel owners checks session)
After twice of generality, session is checked relative to associated with specific channel owners, the reality that the characteristic being cited occurs
The quantity of example can be weighted/be multiplied by 2 (to which reflection checks that the generality of this characteristic of session is opposite relative to what is be cited
Twice that the generality of such characteristic of session is checked in others).
For example, institute can be further enhanced for example, by being directed to each channel, video and/or topic calculating Relevance scores
The technology of description.For example, such score can reflect, for example, " interest (interest above norm) for being higher than standard "
Measurement (as described below) and spectators' (being referred to as " target audience (target audience) ") received cited channel,
The product for checking number of video etc. as a result, the spectators also check from related to the specific channel owners in same session
The content of the channel (being known as " interested channel (channel of interest) ") of connection.
Cited " interest for being higher than standard " measurement can reflect, for example, the spectators of channel, video or topic how may be used
The video for coming from interested channel can be also checked.For example, if 0.1% target audience watches video A, but same state
" interest for being higher than standard " of video Α can be then calculated as 2 (because of 0.05*2=by 0.05% viewing of the population of family
0.1).As noted, the score being cited can be directed to specific country, because the people from country variant is often at them
Check in pattern (due to local culture etc.) have it is dramatically different.
As yet another embodiment, in order to calculate the interest higher than standard for video, it can be considered that interested channel
(Ct) and all videos therein make Ct=(c1,c2...cn), and include these videos ciIn one all session
(St) so that：
St=(v1,v2...vn), whereinAnd vi≠vjAnd
For example, S=is directed to all sessions occurred in media shared platform in nearest 30 days of particular country.
Always checking for each video (v) can be calculated so that
σv=∑I=i mvi, wherein vi∈S
For all session StIt can be calculated as follows with always checking for S：
θ=∑I=1 m∑Si, wherein Si∈S
β=∑I=1 m∑Si, wherein Si∈St
Wherein ∑ SiIt is SiIn video sum.
Then draw above can be combined with each video of determination for session StSubgroup have how much interest.This is high
In standard interest and be represented as δ：
It should be understood that in some cases, above-mentioned technology may generate relative to certain videos and be used for σvLow value.This
(mistakenly) reflection it may work asWhen video the interest higher than standard have high level.Based on this, in certain embodiments
In, it can be in δvOn using filter and make it possible to ignore the value more than X.For example, the value for setting X to 500000 can
Filter " noise " being largely cited.In addition, for smooth remaining " noise " being cited, δ can be calculatedvAnd σvMultiply
Product, can reflect correlation (α)：
αv=δv×σv
In addition, by being ranked up to described result with α, can identify not only to user conversation StInterest it is high and
For in StIn popular video for many users with session.It does so, the residue for coming from low σ numbers can be removed
Noise is leading to reflect high-quality video as a result, the high-quality video height is for having watched CtIn video user/with
C is watchedtIn video user it is related.
Described technology can also apply to calculate αc(the channel degree of correlation) and αt(the topic degree of correlation).For example, in order to count
Calculate αt, can each video be mapped to its associated topic (and then following above-mentioned solution) first.In order to calculate
αc, the average value α for the video that interest channel possesses can be calculatedv(and then can follow above-mentioned solution).In block
