No. 14/095,519, filed Dec. 3, 2013, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- This application generally relates to systems and methods for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video.
- Overlays are displayed over videos for various reasons. For example, overlays can be displayed over a video to provide viewers with links to additional information about the video, to provide links to other related videos, to provide links to content associated with the video, or to present advertisements. In some aspects, an overlay can be configured for constant display over a video as the video plays. In other aspects, an overlay can be configured for displaying over a video at various points in the video and for various lengths of time depending on the purpose of the overlay. For example, an overlay can be integrated within a video to entice viewers to select the overlay before exiting a current video in which the overlay is displayed. Manually analyzing a video to strategically determine where to integrate an overlay and how long to display the overlay can be time consuming for a user. Such a task becomes significantly arduous when a user desires to strategically integrate overlays over many different videos, such as a plurality of videos associated with a user profile or channel.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this innovation. It may be evident, however, that the innovation can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the innovation.
- By way of introduction, the subject matter described in this disclosure relates to systems and methods for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein. As used herein, an overlay refers to a data object that is displayed over a video while the video is playing or paused. An overlay can include a graphical element or icon that is displayed over or within image data of a video within the dimensions of the display area (e.g., video player) in which the video is played. For example, an overlay can include an image, a thumbnail, an icon, text, an animation or an embedded video. In some aspects, the overlay can include a link or a hyperlink that can be selected. For example, an overlay displayed over a video can include a link to another video, a link to another data object, or a link to an external information source.
- Overlays are integrated over videos for various reasons. For example, overlays can be displayed over a video to provide viewers with links to additional information about the video, to provide links to other related videos, to provide links to content associated with the video, or to present advertisements. In some aspects, an overlay can be configured for constant display over a video as the video plays. In other aspects, an overlay can be configured for displaying over a video at various points in the video and for various lengths of time depending on the purpose of the overlay. For example, an overlay can be integrated within a video to entice viewers to select the overlay before exiting a current video in which the overlay is displayed. According to this example, the overlay can include a link to a related video or another data object that is configured to open in a new window or tab and/or replace the video in which the link is displayed, in response to selection of the link.
- Identifying an optimal point in a video to display an overlay for the purpose of enticing viewers to select the overlay before exiting a current video in which the overlay is displayed, can be difficult. For example, if the overlay is presented too early in the video, the viewer may not select the overlay if they are not ready to stop watching the current video. In this scenario, the viewer will likely be annoyed and distracted by the overlay. In another example, if the overlay is presented too early in the video, the viewer may select the overlay and prematurely stop watching the current video. However, an owner or promoter of the video may have preferred the viewer continue watching the current video rather than selecting the overlay. In this scenario, the owner or promoter of the video may only want a viewer to select an overlay integrated within a video as an alternative to exiting the video. In yet another example, if the overlay is presented at a point in a video after which the viewer stops watching the video, the user will never see the overlay.
- Manually analyzing a video to strategically determine an optimal point in the video to integrate an overlay and how long to display the overlay can be time consuming for a user. Such a task becomes significantly arduous when a user desires to strategically integrate overlays over many different videos, such as a plurality of videos associated with a user profile or channel.
- The disclosed systems and methods employ viewer retention data to automatically identify an optimal point or points in a video in which to display an overlay to entice viewers to select the overlay before exiting the current video in which the overlay is displayed and to reduce negative viewership impacts associated with displaying the overlay too early in the video. As used herein, retention data refers to information that indicates points in a video where viewers tend to stop engaging with or watching a video. In an aspect, this retention data can be obtained from watch histories of a plurality of users. For example, watch histories of a plurality of users that have selected a video for playing can be analyzed to identify segments or frames, (referred to herein as drop off points), in the video where the respective viewers stopped engaging with or watching the video. These drop off points can then be analyzed to identify segments or frames of the video associated with high drop off values. A drop of point or points associated with relatively high drop off values can then be selected as an optimal point or points in the video to integrate an overlay for the purpose of enticing future viewers to select the overlay before dropping off (e.g., before exiting or stopping the video).
- The subject systems and methods for identifying an optimal point or points in a video for displaying an overlay are based in part on the following two assumptions: 1.) When viewers drop off the current video during playback they are likely to be wanting to discover new content; and 2.) In order to lead viewers to new content via an overlay displayed over a current video during playback, the viewers need to be engaging with the current video at the time the overlay is displayed (e.g., have their focus on the video player playing the video) so they are more likely to see the overlay in the first place.
- In an aspect, after an optimal point or points in a video to display an overlay have been identified, the overlay can be automatically integrated within the video. Accordingly, overlays can be automatically and strategically integrated within different videos at an optimal point or points in the respective videos (e.g., where the optimal point or points in the respective videos can and will likely differ) without manual user intervention. In another aspect, after an optimal point or points in a video to display an overlay have been identified, the disclosed system and methods can provide the information to an owner or promoter of the video and suggest the owner or promoter of the video integrate the overlay at the optimal point or points identified.
- In one or more aspects, a system is provided that includes an engagement component that receives information regarding frames of a video at which respective users of a plurality of users stop engaging with the video and an analysis component that calculates user engagement scores for the frames based on the information, wherein the user engagement scores reflect a percentage of the plurality of users that stop engaging with the video at the respective frames, and wherein the higher the percentage the lower the user engagement score. The system further includes an identification component that identifies a subset of the frames associated with relatively lower user engagement scores in comparison to other frames of the video and an overlay component that configures an overlay for displaying over the video near at least one of the frames included in the subset.
- In another aspect, a method is disclosed that includes using a processor to execute computer executable instructions stored in a memory to perform acts including receiving information regarding segments of a video at which respective users of a plurality of users stop engaging with the video and calculating user engagement scores for the segments based on the information, wherein the user engagement scores reflect a percentage of the plurality of users that stop engaging with the video at the respective segments, and wherein the higher the percentage the lower the engagement score. The acts can further include identifying a subset of the segments associated with relatively lower user engagement scores in comparison to other segments of the video and configuring an overlay for displaying over the video near at least one of the segments included in the subset.
- Further provided is a tangible computer-readable storage medium comprising computer-readable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing system to perform various operations. The operations include at least, receiving information regarding segments of a video at which respective users of a plurality of users stop watching a video, and calculating user engagement scores for the segments based on the information, wherein the user engagement scores reflect a percentage of the plurality of users that stop watching the video at the respective segments, and wherein the higher the percentage the lower the user engagement score. The operations further include identifying one of the segments associated with a relatively lower user engagement score in comparison to other segments of the video, and configuring an overlay for displaying over the video near the one of the segments.
- Referring now to the drawings, with reference initially to
FIG. 1 , presented is a diagram of anexample system 100 for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein. Aspects of systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable components embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines. Such components, when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described. -

Overlay platform further includes aprocessor 114 to facilitate operation of the instructions (e.g., computer executable components and instructions) by overlay platform. -
Media provider 102 can include an entity that provides media content (e.g., video, streaming video, images, thumbnails or other static representations of video) to client device(s) 120 via a network 118 (e.g., the Internet). Aclient device 120 can includepresentation component 122 to generate a user interface (e.g., a graphical user interface or virtual interface) that displays media content provided bymedia provider 102 to a user of theclient device 120. In particular,presentation component 122 can play videos provided bymedia provider 102 as streamed toclient device 120. In accordance with aspects described herein, the videos can include overlays which are also presented bypresentation component 122. In an aspect,presentation component 122 can include an application (e.g., a web browser) for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. For example,media provider 102 can provide and/or present media content toclient device 120 via a website that can be accessed using a browser of theclient device 120. In an aspect, the media content can be presented and/or played atclient device 120 using a video player associated withmedia provider 102 and/orclient device 120. - As used herein the term media content or media item can include but is not limited to streamable media (e.g., video, live video, video advertisements, music, music videos, sound files and etc.) and static media (e.g., pictures, thumbnails). In some aspects, the term media content or media item includes a collection of media items such as a playlist including several videos or songs, or a channel including several videos or songs associated with a single media creator.
- A channel can be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic or theme. A channel can be associated with a curator who can perform management actions on the channel. Management actions may include, for example, adding media items to the channel, removing media items from the channel, defining subscription requirements for the channel, defining presentation attributes for channel content, defining access attributes for channel content, etc. The channel content can be digital content uploaded to the internet-based content platform by a channel curator and/or digital content selected by a channel curator from the content available on the internet-based content platform. A channel curator can be a professional content provider (e.g., a professional content creator, a professional content distributor, a content rental service, a television (TV) service, etc.) or an amateur individual. Channel content can include professional content (e.g., movie clips, TV clips, music videos, educational videos) and/or amateur content (e.g., video blogging, short original videos, etc.). Users, other than the curator of the channel, can subscribe to one or more channels in which they are interested.
- In an aspect,
media provider 102 can employ one or more networked computing devices to store media content and deliver media content to users via anetwork 118. The media content can be stored in memory associated withmedia provider 102 and/or at various networked devices employed bymedia provider 102 and accessed via aclient device 120 using a web based platform or cellular application platform of themedia provider 102. For example,media provider 102 can include a media presentation source that has access to a voluminous quantity (and potentially an inexhaustible number) of shared media (e.g., video and/or audio) files. The media presentation source can further stream these media files to one or more users atrespective client devices 120 of the one or more users over anetwork 118. - A
client device 120 can include any suitable computing device associated with a user and configured to interact withmedia provider 102, and/oroverlay platform 104. For example, aclient device 120 can include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a television, a mobile phone, a tablet personal computer (PC), or a personal digital assistant PDA. As used in this disclosure, the terms “content consumer” or “user” refer to a person, entity, system, or combination thereof that employs system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure) usingclient device 120. - Network(s) 118 can include wired and wireless networks, including but not limited to, a cellular network, a wide area network (WAD, e.g., the Internet), a local area network (LAN), or a personal area network (PAN). For example,
client device 120 can communicate withmedia provider 102 and/or overlay platform 104 (and vice versa) using virtually any desired wired or wireless technology, including, for example, cellular, WAN, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Wi-Max, WLAN, and etc. In an aspect, one or more components ofsystem 100 are configured to interact via disparate networks. - To facilitate identifying an optimal point or points in a video to display an overlay and configuring the overlay for display at the optimal point or points,
overlay platform 104 can includeengagement component 106,analysis component 108,identification component 110, andoverlay component 112. -
Engagement component 106 is configured to receive engagement information regarding user engagement in respective segments or frames of a video. The term video segment refers to a portion of a video less than the whole video. The term video frame refers to one of the plurality of sequential images which compose the complete moving picture of a video. Thus in an aspect, a video frame is a video segment. However, as generally used herein, the term video segment refers to a portion of a video including two or more sequential video frames. For example, a video can segment can include a portion of a video including frames numbers 1-24, 100-200, or 1-240 (e.g., where the frame rate is 24 frames per second (fps) and a video is segmented into 10 second intervals). In an aspect, engagement component is configured to receive or group engagement information based on 10 second intervals or windows. In other words, the video is divided into a plurality of sequential 10 second segments and engagement information is respectively associated with each of the 10 second segments. According to this example, a video segment can include a portion of a video from time marker 1:10:00 to 1:20:00. It should be appreciated however that the manner in which a video is segmented can vary. - In an aspect, engagement information received by
engagement component 106 includes user retention data based on watch histories of a plurality of users. For example,engagement component 106 can receive information based on watch histories of a plurality of users that began watching a video indicating respective frames or segments of the video at which the respective users stopped watching the video. These segments or frames of the video are referred to herein as the drop of points in the video (e.g., points in the video where a viewer drops off or stops watching the video). In an aspect, information identifying a point in a video where the user stops watching the video can be extracted from watch history data that clearly indicates the user has interacted with a video (or video player, interface including a video player, etc.) in a manner to cause the video to stop playing or streaming to the device of the user. For example, the watch history data can indicate the user selected a stop command of the video player playing the video, closed a window or tab in which the video was being played, or opened another data object that replaced the current video being played. - In another aspect, in addition to user retention data that clearly indicates a user has stopped watching a video (e.g., stopped playing the video or receiving the video as streamed to the user device),
engagement component 106 can receive other information indicative of user disengagement or engagement with respective segments or frames of the video. For example, although a video may not have stopped playing, the user may simply not be paying attention to or engaging with the video. According to this aspect,engagement component 106 can receive various signals regarding whether a user is engaged or disengaged with a segment or frame of a video as the video is being played. These signals are referred to herein as user engagement signals. User engagement signals can also indicate a level of user disengagement or engagement with a segment or frame of a video. Accordingly, user engagement signals can be employed to track points in a video where a user begins to lose interest until the user ultimately stops watching the video entirely. - For example, the various manners in which a user controls the playing of a video, aside from stopping the playing of the video, can indicate different levels of user engagement/disengagement with different parts of the video. According to this example,
engagement component 106 can collect/receive user engagement signals including but not limited to: segments of a video at which a user pauses a video, segments of a video at which a user resumes playing of a paused video, segments of a video a user rewinds or fast forward past, segments of a video a user seeks forward or backward past, segments of a video a user rewinds or fasts forward to, segments of a video a user seeks backward or seeks forward to, segments of a video a user re-watches and number of times the user re-watches, segments of the video a user increases the volume of, and segments of a video a user decreases the volume of. For example, seeking forward and/or fast forwarding past certain segments of a video can indicate that the user is not engaged by those certain segments. However, seeking forward or fast forwarding to a specific part of a video can indicate engagement with the specific part of the video. Similarly, seeking backward or rewinding past parts of a video can indicate a level of disinterest or disengagement with those parts of the video. However, a part of a video a user seeks backward or rewinds to is likely considered interesting by the user. In another example, muting or reducing the volume of a video can indicate a level of disengagement while increasing the volume of can indicate a level of engagement. -
Engagement component 106 can also receive user engagement signals related to whether a user is looking at a video or looking away from a video during respective segments or frames of the video. For example, client device 120 (or an auxiliary device) can include gaze detection hardware and/or software configured to determine whether a user is looking at a video displayed at theclient device 120. According to this example, as a user is watching a video,engagement component 106 can receive user engagement signals that provide information indicating what segments of a video the user is looking at and what segments of the video the user is not looking at. More specifically,engagement component 106 can receive information regarding what segments of a video causes a user who is looking at a video to lose interest and look away from the video. - In an aspect,
engagement component 104 can and/or client device 120 (or an auxiliary device) can employ voice recognition software and/or hardware to interpret words spoken by a viewer during playback of the video that can indicate a level of user engagement or disengagement with the video. For example, as a user is watching a particular part of a video with a friend, the user may ask questions about the particular part of the video or discuss the particular part of the video with the friend. This activity by the user can indicate the user is engaged in the particular part of the video. In another example, as a user is watching a video with a friend, the user may carry on a conversation about his or her dinner they cooked earlier in the evening, a conversation entirely irrelevant to the subject matter of the video. Such user activity can provide an indication that the user is not interested in the video during the particular segment of the video he or she is talking about the dinner he or she cooked. According to this aspect,engagement component 106 can receive and analyze words spoken by a user while watching a video. The particular words spoken by a user during a particular segment of a video can later be analyzed byanalysis component 108 to facilitate determining a level of user engagement or disengagement with the particular segment of the video. -
Engagement component 106 can also receive user engagement signals related to movement of a user with respect to aclient device 120 at which a video is being played. According to this aspect,client device 120 can include motion and/or proximity sensors configured to detect and interpret user movement. Various types of user movements during watching a video can provide indication of user engagement or disengagement with the video. For example,engagement component 106 can receive information indicating when a user leaves and returns to the room in which a video is being played atclient device 120. According to this example, the user movement information can indicate a level of user disinterest in the part of the video being played at the time the user leaves the room and a level of interest in the part of the video occurring at the point of the user returns to the room In another example,engagement component 106 can receive information indicating when a user moves closer to (e.g., leans in to watch intently, providing an indication of user engagement) or away from a display screen (e.g., providing an indication of user disengagement) at which a video is being played during the course of the video. In yet another example,engagement component 106 can receive information regarding when a user jumps in excitement in response to a part in a video (indicating user engagement) or falls asleep during a certain part of a video (indicating user disengagement). - In some aspects, a user can watch a video on a handheld client device 120 (e.g., a smartphone or tablet PC). According to these aspects, the handheld client device can include motion and/or positional sensors that detect movement of the device and
engagement component 106 can receive information regarding movement of the handheld device at which a video is being played. This information can also be received and interpreted byengagement component 106 as user engagement signals (e.g., information that provides an indication of whether a user is engaged or disengaged in certain parts of a video). For example, if a user is walking and watching a video on his or her smartphone, the user may stop walking to intently watch a part of the video that grabs his or her attention (indicating user engagement). In another example, if a user is holding his or her phone upside during a part of the video, this is a good indication the user is not paying attention to the part of the video. -
Engagement component 106 can further collect or receive user engagement signals relating to visibility of a video (or video player playing the video) to a user at an interface of aclient device 120. For example, although a video may be open and playing at aclient device 120, the video may not be visible to the user because the window or tab in which the video is displayed is covered or partially covered by another window or tab open in the user interface. In another example, the window or tab in which the video is displayed may be minimized or reduced to a size that makes the video difficult to see clearly. According to these examples,engagement component 106 can receive user engagement signals related to visibility of a video to a user at a given point in the video based on the arrangement, configuration and size of objects displayed at the user interface in which the video is displayed. Information indicating whether a video is visible to a user during the playing of certain parts or segments can further indicate whether the user is engaged or disengaged in the certain parts or segments of the video. - For example, a user can have a video playing in a first window and have word processing application open in another window. The user can further switch between maximizing and minimizing the window with the video and the window with the word processing application based on when the user is engaged in a part of a video. For example, a user may have the video window maximized during a first part of the video. When the user loses interest in the first part of the video, the user may minimize the video window and maximize the word processing application window instead.

Analysis component 108 is configured to analyze information received or collected byengagement component 106 for a plurality of viewers of a video and determine levels of user engagement (e.g., based on the data from the plurality of viewers) associated with respective frames or segments of the video. In an aspect, ananalysis component 108 is configured to determine or infer user engagement values or scores for respective frames or segments of a video based on the received user engagement information. According to this aspect,analysis component 108 can calculate user engagement scores for respective sequential segments of a video using one or more algorithms stored inmemory 116 that relate user retention data and/or user engagement signals associated with the respective segments, (as received from a plurality of viewers), to a level of user engagement in the respective segments. According to this example, the segments of the video can be previously defined oranalysis component 108 can divide the video into a plurality of segments to analyze and group received user engagement information with the respective segments (e.g., 5 second segments, 10 second segments, 15 second segments, etc.). According to this aspect, a high user engagement value/score can be associated with a high level of user engagement and a low user engagement value/score can be associated with a low level of or engagement. In other words, the lower the engagement value/score the greater level of disengagement. - In an aspect,
analysis component 108 can calculate different scores/values to associate with respective segments of a video based on the type of information analyzed and/or the algorithm employed. For example,analysis component 108 can calculate first scores for respective video segments that reflect only user retention information and second scores for the video segments that reflect user retention information and additional user engagement signals. In another example, analysis component can calculate different user engagement scores for respective segments of a video for different groups of people (e.g., where a group of people can be categorized based on preferences, interests, demographics, location, social affiliations/circles, etc.). According to this example,analysis component 108 can analyze user engagement signals received from people of a first demographic (e.g., based on age group, gender, political affiliation, marital status, ethnicity, etc.) and calculate user engagement scores for respective video segments that reflect how people from the first demographic find the respective segments of the video engaging/disengaging. Similarly,analysis component 108 can analyze user engagement signals received from people of a second demographic and calculate user engagement scores for respective video segments that reflect how people from the second demographic find the respective segments of the video engaging/disengaging. - In an aspect, based on user retention information,
analysis component 108 can calculate user engagement scores for respective segments of a video that indicate areas of the video where relatively large clusters or percentages of viewers tend to drop off or stop watching the video. In particular, based on user retention information from a plurality of users that began watching a video,analysis component 108 can calculate user engagement scores for respective segments or frames of the video that reflect percentages of the plurality of users that stopped engaging with the video at the respective segments, wherein the higher the percentage the lower the engagement score. In other words, a segment of a video where a relatively large number of viewers tend to lose interest and stop watching the video will be associated with a low user engagement score. - According to this aspect,
analysis component 108 can calculate engagement scores can reflect absolute percentages of viewers that drop off or stop watching the video at the respective segments and/or relative percentages of viewers that drop off or stop watching the video at the respective segments. Absolute percentages of viewers that drop off refer to the number of users that drop off at respective segments of the video relative to the entire number of users that began watching the video. Relative percentages of viewers that drop off refers to the number of users that drop off at respective segments of the video with respect to the number of viewers, (with respect to the total number of user that began watching the video), remaining engaged with or watching the video at the respective segments. High absolute and relative percentage drop of values reflect low levels of user engagement. Thus high absolute and relative percentage drop of values translate into low user engagement scores. - For example, where 100 people start watching a video, at a first segment occurring between time 00:02:00 and time 00:02:10, 10 people drop off. Here, the absolute drop off score of the first segment is 10% (10/100 people) and the relative drop of score is also 10% (10/100 people). As the video continues playing, by the time the video reaches a second segment between time 00:24:00 and time 00:24:10, only 20% (or 20 viewers) of the viewers who initially started watching the video remain (or have not dropped off). At the second segment, 10 more people drop off. Here, the absolute drop off score of the second segment is 10% (e.g., 10/100 people). However, the relative drop off score is 50% (e.g., 10/20 people).
- In addition to user retention data,
analysis component 108 can analyze user engagement signals associated with different frames or segments of a video from a plurality of users to determine user engagement scores associated with the different frames or segments of the video.Analysis component 108 can employ various algorithms and/or look-up tables stored inmemory 116 that relate the various user engagement signals described above to levels of user engagement/disengagement. For example, signals associated with muted volume and poor visibility can relate to a low user engagement score indicating the user is not engaged with video. However, signals associated with gazing at a video player while the video player is maximized and visible can related to a high user engagement score indicating the user is engaged with the video. -
Identification component 110 is configured to identify one or more frames or segments of a video for integration of an overlay based on the user engagement scores respectively associated therewith. In particular,identification component 110 is configured to identify one or more segments or frames of a video associated with relatively lower user engagement scores in comparison to other frames or segments of the video. These one or more segments associated with relatively low user engagement scores reflect low user engagement or interest in the respective segments. Afteridentification component 110 has identified one or more video segments or frames having relatively low user engagement scores,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at or near the one or more segments of the video when the video is played to entice future users to select the one or more overlays before disengaging with the video. - For example, as discussed above, in an aspect, a video segment associated with a relatively low user engagement score can indicate that a relatively large percentage of the viewers that have viewed the video including the segment tend to drop off or stop watching the video at or near the segment. Accordingly, by inserting an overlay for displaying over the video at or near the segment (e.g., just before the segment), when future users view the video, they can be enticed to select the overlay before dropping off or stopping the video. Thus, by allowing the owner or promoter of the video to select or influence the content of the overlay, the owner/promoter of the video can direct viewers to additional content selected by the owner/promoter of the video. For example, the owner/promoter of the video can select an overlay that includes a link to additional content the owner or promoter of the video is affiliated with (e.g., another video provided by the owner/promoter, a profile webpage or channel webpage associated with the owner/promoter, a website associated with the owner/promoter, etc.) to cross-promote additional content provided by the owner/promoter of the video.
-
Identification component 110 can employ various algorithms and look-up tables to influence identification or selection of video frame/segments based on the user engagement scores respectively associated therewith. For example,identification component 110 can be configured to identify the video frame or segment associated with the lowest user engagement score with respect to the other video frames/segments of the video. In another example,identification component 110 can be configured to identify a number N (e.g., three, five, ten, etc.) of the video frames/segments associated with the N lowest user engagement scores. In another example,identification component 110 can rank respective segments or frames of the video based on the user engagement scores associated therewith (e.g., from highest score to lowest score or vice versa). - In yet another example, where each of the segments/frames of a video are associated with multiple engagement scores that reflect different parameters or algorithms employed to calculate the respective engagement scores,
identification component 110 can filter the segments based on the different parameters or algorithms. For instance, each of the segments of a video can be associated with an absolute percentage drop of value and a relative percentage drop of value or each of the segments can be associated with an engagement score reflective of a first user demographic and another engagement score reflective of a second user demographic. According to this example,identification component 110 can identify segments associated with relatively lower user engagement scores with respect to each of the different scores associated therewith. For instance,identification component 110 can identify a segment of the video associated with a highest absolute percentage drop of value (where a high percentage drop of value reflects low user engagement) and another segment of the video associated with a highest relative drop off value. Similarly,identification component 110 can identify a first set of three of the video segments associated with the lowest user engagement scores with respect to the first demographic and a second set of three of the user engagement scores associated the lowest user engagement scores with respect to the second demographic.Identification component 110 can further identify overlap between the segments included in the first set and the second set. - It should be appreciated that
identification component 110 can employ various different algorithms and/or look up tables (e.g., stored in memory 116) to facilitate identifying and/or filtering video segments/frames based on the user engagement scores associated therewith and the purpose of the overlay to be integrated for displaying over the video at or near the segments identified byidentification component 110. -
Overlay component 112 is configured to configure an overlay for displaying at or near (e.g., just before) one or more of the video segments identified byidentification component 110 based on the engagement scores respectively associated therewith. In particular,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying over a video beginning at or near one or more segments of the video included in a subset of video segments identified byidentification component 110 as having relatively lower user engagement scores than other segments of the video. For example,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying over a video beginning at or near (e.g., just before) a segment of the video having the lowest user engagement score with respect to the other segments of the video. In another example,overlay component 112 can be configured to insert an overlay for displaying over a video during a sequential subset of video frames or segments associated with relatively low user engagement scores (as identified by identification component 110). In another example,overlay component 112 can configure multiple overlays for displaying at or near different segments of the video associated with relatively low user engagement scores. According to this example,overlay component 112 can configure overlays for displaying at or near each of the video segments having the top N lowest user engagement scores. Each of the overlays can be the same or different and each of the N top lowest user engagement scores can be located at different points in the video. - In another example,
overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying over a video based on engagement scores associated with the respective segments of the video and a parameter for which the engagement scores are based. For example,overlay component 112 can configure a first overlay for displaying over a video at or near a first segment of the video associated with a lowest user engagement score, wherein the user engagement scores are based on a first demographic.Overlay component 112 can also configure a second overlay for displaying over the video at or near a second segment of the video associated with a lowest engagement score, wherein the user engagement scores are based on a second demographic. According to this example, the first and second overlays can be tailored to the first and second demographics and the first and second segments can be different. Accordingly, where the video is played to a user, the overlay that is presented and the point in the video where the overlay is presented can be tailored to the users demographic. - Similarly,
overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at or near a segment of a video associated with a highest absolute percentage drop off value or for displaying at or near a segment of a video associated with a highest relative percentage drop off value. In an aspect,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at or near a segment of a video associated with a highest absolute percentage drop off value in order to maximize a total number of clicks or selections of the overlay (e.g., regardless of the number of viewers who see the overlay). In another aspect,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at or near a segment of a video associated with a highest relative percentage drop off value in order to maximize a selection rate or click through rate (CTR) of the overlay (e.g., maximize selection of the overlay with respect to the number of viewers that see the overlay). - In an aspect, in addition to configuring a point or points in a video for initially displaying an overlay,
overlay component 112 can also configure the position and size of the overlay. For example, where a video is displayed via a rectangular display interface,overlay component 112 can configure the overlay for displaying at any one of the four corners of the display interface or in the center of the display interface based in part on the user engagement score associated with the video segment or segments over which the overlay is displayed. Similarly, overlay component can modify the size, color or appearance of the overlay based in part on the user engagement score associated with the video segment or segments over which the overlay is displayed. For example, where the overlay is configured for displaying over a video at or near a segment having substantially low user engagement score, the overlay component can configured the overlay to appear large and in the center of the display screen to increase the chances of the viewer seeing and selecting the overlay. -
FIG. 2 presents a diagram of anotherexample system 200 for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.System 200 includes same features and functionalities ofsystem 100 with the addition oftiming component 202 tooverlay platform 104. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity. -
Timing component 202 is configured to determine or infer duration of time to display an overlay over a video starting from a segment or frame at whichoverlay component 112 has selected as an optimal segment or frame to display the overlay. In an aspect,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying over a video begging at or near a selected segment (e.g., selected based on the user engagement score associated therewith) and lasting for the remaining duration of the video. For example,overlay component 112 can select a segment identified byidentification component 110 as having the lowest user engagement score with respect to the other segments of the video and configure the overlay for displaying at a segment of the video just prior to the segment having the lowest user engagement score and lasting for the remaining duration of the video. - However, in another aspect,
overlay component 112 can employtiming component 202 to determine or infer duration of time to display the overlay starting at or near a segment selected byoverlay component 112.Overlay component 112 can further configure the overlay for displaying over the video for the duration of time determined or inferred by timingcomponent 202. For example,timing component 202 can determine that an overlay should be displayed for 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, etc. In another example,timing component 202 can determine that an overlay should be displayed for X consecutive video segments or frames, where X is a number.Timing component 202 can determine or infer a duration for displaying an overlay based on various factors, including but not limited to: a point in the video where the overlay is to be initially displayed (e.g., the segment or frame identified byidentification component 110 and selected by overlay component 112), a duration of the video following the point in the video where the overlay is to be initially displayed, total duration of the video, the user engagement score associated with the point in the video where the overlay is to be initially displayed, user engagement scores associated with segments or frames of the video following the point in the video where the overlay is to be initially displayed, whether additional overlays are configured for display over the video and respective locations and durations for display of the additional overlays, type of overlay, and content of the video. - For example, where an overlay is configured for initial display at a segment of a video near the beginning of the video, displaying the overlay over the remaining duration of the video will likely be distracting to the viewers that do not drop off and/or select the overlay. Thus, based on the remaining amount of time left in the video and user engagement scores associated with the remaining segment in the video,
timing component 202 can determine that the overlay should be displayed until the video reaches frame number M (where M is an arbitrary frame number). For example, frame M (and those frames immediately following frame M) could be associated with a high user engagement score. Thus timingcomponent 202 can infer that viewer's attention will likely be regained at or near segment M and displaying of the overlay at that time will be counterproductive. Thus in an aspect,timing component 202 can directoverlay component 112 to display overlays over parts of a video associated with low user engagement scores. For example, frames 45-75, 88-300 and 502-622 could be associated with low user engagement scores. According to this example,timing component 202 can directoverlay component 112 to display an overlay lasting the durations of frames 45-75, 88-300 and 502-622. -
FIG. 3 presents a diagram of anotherexample system 300 for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.System 300 includes same features and functionalities ofsystem 200 with the additions ofconversion component 302 andoptimization component 304. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity. - As previously noted, in an aspect,
overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at or near a segment of a video at one or more point in the video where viewers tend to stop engaging with or watching the video, as determined based on user retention data. In particular,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at or near a video segment having a user engagement score reflective of a highest absolute or relative percentage drop off value as compared to other segments of the video. In an aspect,overlay component 112 configures an overlay for displaying at or near a segment of a video associated with the highest absolute percentage drop off value in order to maximize a total number of clicks or selections of the overlay (e.g., regardless of the number of viewers who see the overlay). In another aspect,overlay component 112 configures an overlay for displaying at or near a segment of a video associated with the highest relative percentage drop off value in order to maximize a selection rate or click through rate (CTR) of the overlay (e.g., maximize selection of the overlay with respect to the number of viewers that see the overlay). - In an aspect,
overlay platform 104 is configured to run a gradient ascent learning mechanism on individual videos to optimize the timing of integration of an overlay over the videos in view of overlay conversion. For example,overlay platform 104 can experiment with different timing options for insertion of an overlay over a video to gradually improve the timing of insertion of the overlay by selecting the timing option which outperforms the others with respect to total number of clicks and/or CTR. According to this aspect, overlay platform can includeconversion component 302 andoptimization component 304. -
Conversion component 302 is configured to track the total number of clicks and/or the CTR of an overlay configured for initial display at different segments or frames in a video. For example,overlay component 112 can configure an overlay for displaying at different experimental points in a video. Each of the experimental points can be associated with relatively high drop off percentage values (e.g., absolute and/or relative). Each time the video is played, the overlay can be configured for displaying at one of the experimental points. The different experimental points can be subjected to equal or substantially equal test groups (e.g., with respect to number of viewers that begin watching the video with the overlay and type of viewers).Conversion component 302 can then track the number of times the overlay is selected at the different experimental points with respect to the number of viewers who have viewed the video and/or the number of viewers that were watching the video at the time the overlay was presented.Conversion component 302 can also track the actual points in the video at which the overlay is selected (e.g., within the duration of display of the overlay). -
Optimization component 304 is configured to analyze information tracked byconversion component 302 and determine or infer an optimal position in a video to insert an overlay based on the information. For example,optimization component 304 can identify one of the experimental points associated with the highest number of total clicks and/or the highest CTR. In another example,optimization component 304 can identify specific points in the video when an overlay is most frequently selected. In an aspect,optimization component 304 can directoverlay component 112 to automatically adjust the point in a video where an overlay is inserted based on learned data regarding a point or points in the video associated with highest total overlay conversion and/or highest CTR. For example, where an overlay is configured for display over a video at different experimental points for various percentages of playing time,optimization component 304 can identify one of the experimental points associated with the highest total conversion or the highest CTR and direct theoverlay component 112 to configure the overlay for displaying at the one of the experimental points for 100 percent of the playing time. -
FIG. 4 presents a diagram of anotherexample system 400 for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.System 400 includes same features and functionalities ofsystem 300 with the addition ofselection component 402 to overlay platform. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity. - In an aspect, the overlay that
overlay component 112 is configured to integrate into a video is predetermined. For example, an owner or promoter of a video can choose the overlay to be integrated into the video. For instance, a user can create a collection of videos for sharing with others and associate the videos with a profile of the user. The profile can embody a channel or collection of videos provided by and/or associated with the user and made available to other users viamedia provider 102. In an aspect, the user can select an overlay with a link to a channel homepage and apply the overlay for display over each of the videos on the user's channel to cross promote the user's channel within the respective videos. In another aspect, the user can select an overlay with a link to a video on provided on the user's channel and apply the overlay for display over each of the videos on the user's channel to cross promote the video. For example, the user could select a new video recently added to the user's channel to feature in each of the videos of the user's channel using an overlay with a thumbnail representing the video and link to the new video. According to this example,overlay component 112 can be configured to integrate the overlay within the respective videos of the user's channel at the optimal points in the respective videos using the mechanisms described herein to enhance the CTR of the overlay prior to viewership drop off. - However, in another aspect, the overlay that
overlay component 112 is configured to integrate into a video can be selected byselection component 402. According to this aspect,selection component 402 can automatically select one or more overlays to integrate within a video based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: content of the video, type of video, intended audience of the video, duration of the video, preferences of an owner or promoter of the video, user engagement scores associated with respective segments of the video, where drop off points in the video occur, user type associate with respective drop off points (e.g., with respect to demographics, preferences, social groups, etc.) or context of a viewer of the video. - For example, where a video is associated with a substantially high drop off percentage at a particular point,
selection component 402 can select an overlay that is considered highly enticing to viewers and frequently selected, regardless of the video in which it is integrated and/or position in the video in which it is integrated. In another example,selection component 402 can select an overlay based on a type of audience (e.g., based on demographics, preferences, social groups, etc.) associated with a drop off point at which the overlay is to be integrated. For instance, where most users who drop off at around video frames 88-92 are teenage boys,selection component 402 can select an overlay for integration at around video frames 88-92 that is highly popular amongst teenage boys. -
FIG. 5 presents a diagram of anotherexample system 500 for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.System 500 includes same features and functionalities ofsystem 500 with the addition ofsuggestion component 502 tooverlay platform 104. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity. -
Suggestion component 502 is configured to provide an owner or promoter of a video (e.g., a user who has control and authority over publication of the video via media provider 102) with suggestions regarding timing of integration of an overlay over the video, size and position of the overlay and/or what overlay to select for integration over the video. For example, rather than automatically configuring an overlay for integration over a video at an optimal video frame or frames determined or inferred byoverlay platform 104,suggestion component 502 can provide an owner or promoter of the video with information indicating the optimal frame or frames and/or an optimal duration for display of the overlay. In an aspect, the information can indicate projected overlay conversion (e.g., total conversion and/or CTR) associated with integration of the overlay at the suggested optimal video frame or frames. In another example,suggestion component 502 can suggest a specific video or content item to promote in an overlay (e.g., as determined or inferred by selection component 402). The owner or promoter of the video can then chose whether to apply a suggestion provided bysuggestion component 502. -
FIG. 6 presents a diagram of anotherexample system 200 for optimizing the timing at which an overlay is displayed over a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein.System 200 includes same features and functionalities ofsystem 100 with the addition ofinference component 602. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments of systems and interfaces described herein are omitted for sake of brevity. -
Inference component 602 is configured to provide for or aid in various inferences or determinations associated with aspects ofoverlay platform 104. In an aspect, all or portions ofmedia provider 102 can be operatively coupled toinference component 602. Moreover,inference component 602 can be granted access to all or portions of media provider, client device(s) 122 and other sources accessible via anetwork 118. - In an aspect,
analysis component 108 can employinference component 602 to infer user engagement levels to associate with respective segments of a video based on received user retention information and user engagement signals. For example,inference component 602 can analyze received information pertaining to user engagement and/or disengagement with a segment of a video to infer an average level of user engagement with the segment. In another aspect,identification component 110 and/oroverlay component 112 can employinference component 602 to infer which segments or frames of a video to select as optimal points in the video for insertion of an overlay to optimize overlay conversion and/or CTR andtiming component 202 can employ inference component to infer a duration to display the overlay.Optimization component 304,selection component 402 andsuggestion component 502 can also employinference component 602 to infer optimal positions for integration of an overlay, to infer what overlay to apply to a video or point in the video, and to infer suggestions to offer an owner or promoter of the video regarding overlay timing and selection. - In order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described herein,
inference component 602 can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. An inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. - Such an inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
- A classifier can map an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, such as by f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

At 904 user engagement scores for the segments are calculated based on the information, wherein the user engagement scores reflect a percentage of the plurality of users that stop engaging with the video at the respective segments, and wherein the higher the percentage the lower the engagement score (e.g., using analysis component 108). At 906, a subset of the segments associated with relatively lower user engagement scores in comparison to other segments of the video are identified (e.g., using identification component 110). At 908, an overlay is configured for displaying near a first video segment included in the subset for a first percentage of playback and near a second video segment included in the subset for a second percentage of playback (e.g., using overlay component 112). At 910, information is received regarding a number of times the overlay is selected during the first percentage of playback and a number of times the overlay is selected during the second percentage of playback (e.g., using conversion component 302).
