- process 300 may be performed by user device 210 .
- some or all of the blocks described below may be performed by a different device or group of devices, including or excluding user device 210 .
- Process 300 may include detecting a negative emotion of a user (block 310 ).
- user device 210 may monitor the user visually and/or audibly and may detect a negative emotion of the user based on the monitoring. Examples of negative emotions may include frustration, anger, disappointment, disgust, sadness, puzzlement, etc.
- user device 210 may include a first classifier for detecting a negative emotion, of a user, based on monitoring the user's facial expression. For example, the first classifier may be trained to detect negative emotion based on a position of a user's mouth and/or eyes.
- Examples of negative emotions that may be related to the position of the user's mouth include the lips being placed into a frowning position, the lips being placed into a pouting position, and/or other positioning of the mouth that may reflect a negative emotion.
- Examples of negative emotions that may be related to the position of the user's eyes include the inner corners of the eyebrows being raised, which forms wrinkles in the medial part of the brow; the outer portion of the eyebrows being raised, which forms wrinkles in the lateral part of the brow; the eyebrows being pulled down and together, which forms vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows and horizontal wrinkles near the nasion; and/or any other positioning of the eyes that may reflect a negative emotion.
- the first classifier may receive visual information regarding the facial expression of the user and generate a score based on the received visual information.
- user device 210 may include a second classifier for detecting a negative emotion, of a user, based on monitoring the user's body language.
- the second classifier may be trained to detect negative emotion based on detecting a slouched or slumped body posture, shaking, thrusting, or titling of the user's head, shaking of the user's fist(s), self-grooming or self-touching behavior, throwing an object, and/or any other body language that may reflect a negative emotion.
- the second classifier may receive visual information regarding the body language of the user and generate a score based on the received visual information.
- user device 210 may include a third classifier for detecting a negative emotion, of a user, based on monitoring audible signals from the user.
- the third classifier may be trained to detect negative emotion based on detecting a change in pitch of the user's voice, a change in volume of the user's voice, a change in cadence of the user's voice, a change in the user's use of vocabulary, the use of particular words and/or phrases (e.g., a curse word), the user repeating a word or phrase, and/or any other audible signal that may reflect a negative emotion.
- the third classifier may receive information regarding the audible signals from the user and generate a score based on the received audible signals.
- user device 210 may generate a total score for a detected emotion based on the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier. In some implementations, user device 210 may generate a total score for a detected emotion based on a weighted combination of the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier. For example, user device 210 may assign a weight value to the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier.
- the weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier contributes to the total score may vary.
- User device 210 may combine the weighted score from the first classifier, the weighted score from the second classifier, and/or the weighted score from the third classifier to generate the total score.
- user device 210 may compare the total score to a first threshold. For example, if the total score equals or exceeds the first threshold, user device 210 may determine that the detected emotion is a negative emotion. In some implementations, user device 210 may compare the total score to one or more additional thresholds. For example, user device 210 may compare the total score to a second threshold when the total score is less than the first threshold. The second threshold may have a value that is lower than the first threshold. If the total score is less than a second threshold, user device 210 may determine that the detected emotion is not a negative emotion. If, on the other hand, the total score is less than the first threshold and is equal to or greater than the second threshold, user device 210 may prompt the user as to whether the user needs help. In some implementations, the first threshold and/or the second threshold may be user configurable.
- Process 300 may include identifying an item with which the user is interacting (block 320 ).
- user device 210 may identify the item with which the user is interacting at the time that the negative emotion is detected.
- user device 210 may identify the application, on user device 210 , with which the user is currently interacting.
- user device 210 may identify the item, outside of user device 210 , with which the user is interacting.
- user device 210 may capture an image or video of the item and identify the item using, for example, an image recognition technique.
- user device 210 may generate a recognition score, for the item, that reflects the probability that the item is correctly identified.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on one or more factors.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding the user's browser history.
- the browser history may include, for example, a search history and/or a purchase history.
- User device 210 may detect that the user is getting frustrated and may attempt to identify that the item with which the user is interacting. Assume that user device 210 is able to identify that the user is interacting with a bicycle, but is unable to identify the particular brand of bicycle. Assume further that user device 210 determines that the user has recently performed a search for a Brand X bicycle and/or has recently purchased a Brand X bicycle online. Thus, user device 210 may modify the recognition score, of the item, based on the user's search history and/or purchase history.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding social activity associated with the user.
- the social activity may include, for example, social activity of the user and/or the user's social contacts.
- the user's social contacts may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of activity data may include whether the user or the user's social contacts have expressed interest in the item by, for example, providing a positive rating for the item, requesting additional information regarding the item, bookmarking a document that references the item, or the like.
- user device 210 determines that the user has recently posted a comment about a Brand X bicycle to a social network.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score, of the item, based on social activity associated with the user.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on voice communications. For example, user device 210 may capture voice communications of the user and/or another user and parse the voice communications for information identifying the item. Continuing with the example above, assume that user device 210 detects that user has said “I'm downstairs putting Katie's Brand X bike together.” Thus, user device 210 may modify the recognition score, of the item, based on verbal communications of the user or another user.
- User device 210 may compare the recognition score, as modified by browser history, social activity, and/or verbal communications, to a threshold. In some implementations, if the recognition score equals or exceeds the threshold, user device 210 may associate the item with the negative emotion. If, on the other hand, the recognition score is less than the threshold, user device 210 may prompt the user to identify the item with which the user is interacting. In some implementations, the threshold may be user configurable.
- Process 300 may include identifying a task being performed by the user (block 330 ).
- user device 210 may identify the task being performed in connection with the item at the time that the negative emotion is detected.
- user device 210 may identify task being performed in relation to the identified application, on user device 210 .
- User device 210 may identify the item as the word processing application and the task as adjusting the font of a word processing document.
- user device 210 may use additional information in identifying the task. For example, user device 210 may use voice communications in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform. In some implementations, user device 210 may capture voice communications of the user and/or another user and parse the voice communications for information identifying the task. Continuing with the example above regarding attempting to make the font of a word processing document uniform, assume that user device 210 detects that user has said “I can't get this font to be the same!” User device 210 may use this verbal communication to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform.
- user device 210 may identify the task based on visual and/or audible information.
- user device 210 may identify the task generally or may identify the particular step of the task that the user is attempting to perform. As one example, assume that the user is attempting to put the legs on a particular brand of dining room table and is getting frustrated. User device 210 may identify the item as the particular brand of dining room table and may generally identify the task as assembling the particular brand of dining room table or specifically as putting the legs on the particular brand of dining room table.
- user device 210 may capture an image and/or video of the user interacting with the item and identify the task based on analyzing the image and/or video. Continuing with the bicycle example above, user device 210 may capture a video of the user interacting with the bicycle and the part of the bicycle with which the user is interacting. User device 210 may generate a recognition score, for the task, based on the captured video. In some example implementations, user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on one or more factors. For example, user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding the user's browser history (e.g., a search history and/or a purchase history).
- the user's browser history e.g., a search history and/or a purchase history
- user device 210 may use search history and/or purchase history to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding the social activity of the user and/or the user's social contacts. Continuing with the example above, assume that user device 210 determines that the user's social contact has recommended, via a social network, a particular brand of brakes to the user. User device 210 may use this social activity to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform.
- user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on voice communications. For example, user device 210 may capture voice communications of the user and/or another user and parse the verbal communications for information identifying the task. Continuing with the example above, assume that user device 210 detects that user has said “Ugh! These brakes!” User device 210 may use this verbal communication to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform.
- User device 210 may compare the recognition score, as modified by browser history, social activity, and/or verbal communications, to a threshold. In some implementations, if the recognition score equals or exceeds the threshold, user device 210 may associate the task with the negative emotion. If, on the other hand, the recognition score is less than the threshold, user device 210 may prompt the user to identify the task that the user is attempting to perform.
- the threshold may be user configurable.
- Process 300 may include obtaining help information relating to the task (block 340 ).
- user device 210 may obtain help information based on the identified item and the identified task.
- user device 210 may generate a search query.
- the search query may include information identifying the item and the task.
- user device 210 may perform a search of user device 210 (or another device associated with the user) for help information relating to the identified item and the identified task.
- user device 210 may search the memory, of user device 210 , to obtain a help document and/or a user manual associated with the identified item and task.
- the item is a word processing application and the task is adjusting the font in a word processing document.
- user device 210 may search a help file of the word processing application for help information relating to adjusting the font.
- user device 210 may send the search query to another device, such as server 220 , to obtain the help information.
- server 220 may perform a search based on the search query. For example, server 220 may perform a search for documents and/or videos relating to the identified item and task. Server 220 may provide, to user device 210 , a ranked list of information identifying documents and/or a ranked list of information identifying videos relating to the identified item and task. Continuing with the bicycle example above, server 220 may perform a search for documents and/or videos relating to attaching brakes to a Brand X bicycle and provide, to user device 210 , a ranked list of links to documents and/or videos.
- Process 300 may include providing help information to the user (block 350 ).
- user device 210 may provide help information, audibly and/or visually, to the user to aid the user in performing the identified task in relation to the identified item.
- user device 210 may provide a user interface, to the user, that identifies different categories of help information.
- the user interface may identify a group of different help categories, such as a help document related to an application executing on user device 210 , a user manual, a web-based document (such as a web page and/or information from an online chat room), a video, and/or another type of help information.
- User device 210 may detect selection of one of the help categories in the user interface and may provide, based on the selection, help information based on the selected help category.
- An example user interface that may be provided to the user is described below with respect to FIG. 4 .
- user device 210 may provide, for display, that portion of the help information that directly relates to the identified task being performed. For example, returning to the bicycle example above, assume that user device 210 obtains an instruction manual for assembling a Brand X bicycle. Upon the user selection of the instruction manual, user device 210 may provide, for display, that portion of the instruction manual that relates to attaching the brakes.
- user device 210 may provide help information to the user without the user selecting a help category or particular help information.
- user device 210 may be configured to give a higher priority to one category of help information than the priority given to the other categories of help information and may automatically provide help information from that higher priority category.

A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news article, a blog, a discussion group forum, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript.
- In situations in which systems and/or methods, as described herein, monitor users, collect personal information about users, or make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features monitor users or collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), or to control whether and/or how to receive content that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before the data is stored and/or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected and used.

FIGS. 1A-1C are diagrams illustrating anoverview 100 of an example implementation described herein. With reference toFIG. 1A , assume a user, of a user device, is inserting paragraph numbers into a document of a word processing application. Assume further that the user is getting frustrated as a result of not being able to make the paragraph numbers sequential. The user device may detect the user's frustration, based, for example, on detecting a look of frustration, anger, disappointment, etc. on the user's face. In response, the user device may identify the application with which the user is interacting and the task that the user is attempting to perform. Inoverview 100, the user device may determine that the user is attempting to insert paragraph numbers into a document of the word processing application. The user device may then obtain help information relating to inserting paragraph numbers into documents for the particular word processing application. Foroverview 100, assume that the user device obtains information from a help file of the particular word processing application, information from an online user manual, information from one or more web pages, and a video that explains how to insert paragraph numbers into a document using the particular word processing application. The user device may present a user interface that allows the user to select the type of help information that the user desires, as shown inFIG. 1B . - Assume, for
overview 100, that the user selects the help file. In response, the user device may provide the help file to the user, as shown inFIG. 1C . In this way, the user device may provide help information, to the user, without the user having to manually obtain the help information. By providing the help information in this manner, the user's frustration with performing the task may be quickly eliminated. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample environment 200 in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented.Environment 200 may include auser device 210, aserver 220, and anetwork 230. -
User device 210 may include a device, or a collection of devices, that is capable of detecting an emotion of a user and obtaining help information when the detected emotion is negative. Examples ofuser device 210 may include a smart phone, a personal digital assistant, a laptop, a tablet computer, a personal computer, and/or another similar type of device. In some implementations,user device 210 may include a browser via which help information may be presented on a display associated withuser device 210. -
Server 220 may include a server device or a collection of server devices that may be co-located or remotely located. In some implementations,server 220 may store help information and provide particular help information, based on a request fromuser device 210. In some implementations,server 220 may receive a request for help information fromuser device 210, obtain help information from a remote location, such as from one or more other servers, based on the received request, and provide the obtained help information touser device 210. In some implementations,server 220 may include a search engine. -
Network 230 may include one or more wired and/or wireless networks. For example,network 230 may include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”) or a cellular network, an intranet, the Internet, and/or another type of network or a combination of these or other types of networks.User device 210 andserver 220 may connect to network 230 via wired and/or wireless connections. In other words,user device 210 and/orserver 220 may connect to network 230 via a wired connection, a wireless connection, or a combination of a wired connection and a wireless connection. - Although
FIG. 2 shows example components ofenvironment 200, in some implementations,environment 200 may include additional components, fewer components, different components, or differently arranged components than those depicted inFIG. 2 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components ofenvironment 200 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components ofenvironment 200. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for providing help information to a user. In some implementations,process 300 may be performed byuser device 210. In some implementations, some or all of the blocks described below may be performed by a different device or group of devices, including or excludinguser device 210. -
Process 300 may include detecting a negative emotion of a user (block 310). For example,user device 210 may monitor the user visually and/or audibly and may detect a negative emotion of the user based on the monitoring. Examples of negative emotions may include frustration, anger, disappointment, disgust, sadness, puzzlement, etc. In some implementations,user device 210 may include a first classifier for detecting a negative emotion, of a user, based on monitoring the user's facial expression. For example, the first classifier may be trained to detect negative emotion based on a position of a user's mouth and/or eyes. Examples of negative emotions that may be related to the position of the user's mouth include the lips being placed into a frowning position, the lips being placed into a pouting position, and/or other positioning of the mouth that may reflect a negative emotion. Examples of negative emotions that may be related to the position of the user's eyes include the inner corners of the eyebrows being raised, which forms wrinkles in the medial part of the brow; the outer portion of the eyebrows being raised, which forms wrinkles in the lateral part of the brow; the eyebrows being pulled down and together, which forms vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows and horizontal wrinkles near the nasion; and/or any other positioning of the eyes that may reflect a negative emotion. The first classifier may receive visual information regarding the facial expression of the user and generate a score based on the received visual information. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may include a second classifier for detecting a negative emotion, of a user, based on monitoring the user's body language. For example, the second classifier may be trained to detect negative emotion based on detecting a slouched or slumped body posture, shaking, thrusting, or titling of the user's head, shaking of the user's fist(s), self-grooming or self-touching behavior, throwing an object, and/or any other body language that may reflect a negative emotion. The second classifier may receive visual information regarding the body language of the user and generate a score based on the received visual information. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may include a third classifier for detecting a negative emotion, of a user, based on monitoring audible signals from the user. For example, the third classifier may be trained to detect negative emotion based on detecting a change in pitch of the user's voice, a change in volume of the user's voice, a change in cadence of the user's voice, a change in the user's use of vocabulary, the use of particular words and/or phrases (e.g., a curse word), the user repeating a word or phrase, and/or any other audible signal that may reflect a negative emotion. The third classifier may receive information regarding the audible signals from the user and generate a score based on the received audible signals. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may generate a total score for a detected emotion based on the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier. In some implementations,user device 210 may generate a total score for a detected emotion based on a weighted combination of the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier. For example,user device 210 may assign a weight value to the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier. The weight values may differ—in other words, the amount that each of the score from the first classifier, the score from the second classifier, and/or the score from the third classifier contributes to the total score may vary.User device 210 may combine the weighted score from the first classifier, the weighted score from the second classifier, and/or the weighted score from the third classifier to generate the total score. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may compare the total score to a first threshold. For example, if the total score equals or exceeds the first threshold,user device 210 may determine that the detected emotion is a negative emotion. In some implementations,user device 210 may compare the total score to one or more additional thresholds. For example,user device 210 may compare the total score to a second threshold when the total score is less than the first threshold. The second threshold may have a value that is lower than the first threshold. If the total score is less than a second threshold,user device 210 may determine that the detected emotion is not a negative emotion. If, on the other hand, the total score is less than the first threshold and is equal to or greater than the second threshold,user device 210 may prompt the user as to whether the user needs help. In some implementations, the first threshold and/or the second threshold may be user configurable. -
Process 300 may include identifying an item with which the user is interacting (block 320). For example,user device 210 may identify the item with which the user is interacting at the time that the negative emotion is detected. When the user is interacting withuser device 210,user device 210 may identify the application, onuser device 210, with which the user is currently interacting. - When the user is not interacting with
user device 210,user device 210 may identify the item, outside ofuser device 210, with which the user is interacting. In some implementations,user device 210 may capture an image or video of the item and identify the item using, for example, an image recognition technique. For example,user device 210 may generate a recognition score, for the item, that reflects the probability that the item is correctly identified. In some example implementations,user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on one or more factors. For example,user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding the user's browser history. The browser history may include, for example, a search history and/or a purchase history. As an example, assume that the user is assembling a bicycle and is getting frustrated trying to attach the brakes.User device 210 may detect that the user is getting frustrated and may attempt to identify that the item with which the user is interacting. Assume thatuser device 210 is able to identify that the user is interacting with a bicycle, but is unable to identify the particular brand of bicycle. Assume further thatuser device 210 determines that the user has recently performed a search for a Brand X bicycle and/or has recently purchased a Brand X bicycle online. Thus,user device 210 may modify the recognition score, of the item, based on the user's search history and/or purchase history. - Additionally, or alternatively,
user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding social activity associated with the user. The social activity may include, for example, social activity of the user and/or the user's social contacts. The user's social contacts may be identified based on the user's communications, the user's address book, and/or the user's account on one or more social networks. Examples of activity data may include whether the user or the user's social contacts have expressed interest in the item by, for example, providing a positive rating for the item, requesting additional information regarding the item, bookmarking a document that references the item, or the like. Continuing with the example above, assume thatuser device 210 determines that the user has recently posted a comment about a Brand X bicycle to a social network. Thus,user device 210 may modify the recognition score, of the item, based on social activity associated with the user. - Additionally, or alternatively,
user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on voice communications. For example,user device 210 may capture voice communications of the user and/or another user and parse the voice communications for information identifying the item. Continuing with the example above, assume thatuser device 210 detects that user has said “I'm downstairs putting Katie's Brand X bike together.” Thus,user device 210 may modify the recognition score, of the item, based on verbal communications of the user or another user. -
User device 210 may compare the recognition score, as modified by browser history, social activity, and/or verbal communications, to a threshold. In some implementations, if the recognition score equals or exceeds the threshold,user device 210 may associate the item with the negative emotion. If, on the other hand, the recognition score is less than the threshold,user device 210 may prompt the user to identify the item with which the user is interacting. In some implementations, the threshold may be user configurable. -
Process 300 may include identifying a task being performed by the user (block 330). For example,user device 210 may identify the task being performed in connection with the item at the time that the negative emotion is detected. When the user is interacting withuser device 210,user device 210 may identify task being performed in relation to the identified application, onuser device 210. As an example, assume that the user is getting frustrated attempting to make the font of a document in a word processing application uniform.User device 210 may identify the item as the word processing application and the task as adjusting the font of a word processing document. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may use additional information in identifying the task. For example,user device 210 may use voice communications in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform. In some implementations,user device 210 may capture voice communications of the user and/or another user and parse the voice communications for information identifying the task. Continuing with the example above regarding attempting to make the font of a word processing document uniform, assume thatuser device 210 detects that user has said “I can't get this font to be the same!”User device 210 may use this verbal communication to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform. - When the user is not interacting with
user device 210,user device 210 may identify the task based on visual and/or audible information. In some implementations,user device 210 may identify the task generally or may identify the particular step of the task that the user is attempting to perform. As one example, assume that the user is attempting to put the legs on a particular brand of dining room table and is getting frustrated.User device 210 may identify the item as the particular brand of dining room table and may generally identify the task as assembling the particular brand of dining room table or specifically as putting the legs on the particular brand of dining room table. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may capture an image and/or video of the user interacting with the item and identify the task based on analyzing the image and/or video. Continuing with the bicycle example above,user device 210 may capture a video of the user interacting with the bicycle and the part of the bicycle with which the user is interacting.User device 210 may generate a recognition score, for the task, based on the captured video. In some example implementations,user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on one or more factors. For example,user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding the user's browser history (e.g., a search history and/or a purchase history). Continuing with the bicycle example above, assume that the user recently searched for and/or purchased a new set of brakes for a Brand X bicycle. Thus,user device 210 may use search history and/or purchase history to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform. - Additionally, or alternatively,
user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on information regarding the social activity of the user and/or the user's social contacts. Continuing with the example above, assume thatuser device 210 determines that the user's social contact has recommended, via a social network, a particular brand of brakes to the user.User device 210 may use this social activity to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform. - Additionally, or alternatively,
user device 210 may modify the recognition score based on voice communications. For example,user device 210 may capture voice communications of the user and/or another user and parse the verbal communications for information identifying the task. Continuing with the example above, assume thatuser device 210 detects that user has said “Ugh! These brakes!”User device 210 may use this verbal communication to help in identifying the task that the user is attempting to perform. -
User device 210 may compare the recognition score, as modified by browser history, social activity, and/or verbal communications, to a threshold. In some implementations, if the recognition score equals or exceeds the threshold,user device 210 may associate the task with the negative emotion. If, on the other hand, the recognition score is less than the threshold,user device 210 may prompt the user to identify the task that the user is attempting to perform. In some implementations, the threshold may be user configurable. -
Process 300 may include obtaining help information relating to the task (block 340). For example,user device 210 may obtain help information based on the identified item and the identified task. In some implementations,user device 210 may generate a search query. The search query may include information identifying the item and the task. In some implementations,user device 210 may perform a search of user device 210 (or another device associated with the user) for help information relating to the identified item and the identified task. For example,user device 210 may search the memory, ofuser device 210, to obtain a help document and/or a user manual associated with the identified item and task. As one example, assume that the item is a word processing application and the task is adjusting the font in a word processing document. In this example,user device 210 may search a help file of the word processing application for help information relating to adjusting the font. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may send the search query to another device, such asserver 220, to obtain the help information. In some implementations,server 220 may perform a search based on the search query. For example,server 220 may perform a search for documents and/or videos relating to the identified item and task.Server 220 may provide, touser device 210, a ranked list of information identifying documents and/or a ranked list of information identifying videos relating to the identified item and task. Continuing with the bicycle example above,server 220 may perform a search for documents and/or videos relating to attaching brakes to a Brand X bicycle and provide, touser device 210, a ranked list of links to documents and/or videos. -
Process 300 may include providing help information to the user (block 350). For example,user device 210 may provide help information, audibly and/or visually, to the user to aid the user in performing the identified task in relation to the identified item. In some implementations,user device 210 may provide a user interface, to the user, that identifies different categories of help information. For example, the user interface may identify a group of different help categories, such as a help document related to an application executing onuser device 210, a user manual, a web-based document (such as a web page and/or information from an online chat room), a video, and/or another type of help information.User device 210 may detect selection of one of the help categories in the user interface and may provide, based on the selection, help information based on the selected help category. An example user interface that may be provided to the user is described below with respect toFIG. 4 . - In some implementations,
user device 210 may provide, for display, that portion of the help information that directly relates to the identified task being performed. For example, returning to the bicycle example above, assume thatuser device 210 obtains an instruction manual for assembling a Brand X bicycle. Upon the user selection of the instruction manual,user device 210 may provide, for display, that portion of the instruction manual that relates to attaching the brakes. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may provide help information to the user without the user selecting a help category or particular help information. For example,user device 210 may be configured to give a higher priority to one category of help information than the priority given to the other categories of help information and may automatically provide help information from that higher priority category. For example, assume thatuser device 210 prioritizes videos ahead of other types of help information. If a video has been identified that relates to the identified item and task,user device 210 may automatically provide the identified video to the user. - In some implementations,
user device 210 may continue to monitor the user after providing the help information. In those situations whereuser device 210 determines that the negative emotion has been eliminated oruser device 210 detects a positive emotion after providing the help information,user device 210 may store information, indicating that the appropriate help information was provided to the user. Similarly, in those situations whereuser device 210 determines that the negative emotion remains after providing the help information,user device 210 may store information, indicating that the appropriate help information was not provided to the user. Thus,user device 210 may receive positive and negative feedback, which may aiduser device 210 in subsequently identifying items and/or tasks, and/or obtaining help information. - While
FIG. 3 showsprocess 300 as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks, in some implementations,process 300 may include fewer blocks, additional blocks, or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally, or alternatively, some of the blocks may be performed in parallel. -
FIG. 4 is an example configuration of auser interface 400 via which help information may be provided. As shown,user interface 400 may include a help file and user/instruction manual area 410, avideos area 420, and ageneral documents area 430. - Help file and user/
instruction manual area 410 may include an area, ofuser interface 400, where links to help documents associated with applications executing onuser device 210, user manuals, and/or instruction manuals may be provided. In some implementations, the information, provided in help file and user/instruction manual area 410, may include information that is retrieved from a memory associated withuser device 210. In some implementations, some or all of the information, provided in help file and user/instruction manual area 410, may include information that is retrieved from a remote location, such asserver 220 or another device or devices. -
Videos area 420 may include an area, ofuser interface 400, where links to videos may be provided. In some implementations, the videos, provided invideos area 420, may correspond to the top ranking videos obtained fromserver 220 and relating to an identified item and task. -
General documents area 430 may include an area, ofuser interface 400, where links to documents may be provided. In some implementations, the documents, provided ingeneral documents area 430, may correspond to the top ranking documents obtained fromserver 220 and relating to an identified item and task. - As an example, assume again that user is assembling a Brand X bicycle and has gotten frustrated trying to attach the brakes.
User device 210 has detected the user's frustration and obtained help information. As shown inFIG. 4 , the help information may include an instruction manual for assembling the Brand X bicycle, a group of videos relating to attaching brakes to a Brand X bicycle, and a group of documents relating to attaching brakes to a Brand X bicycle. The user may select any of the links provided inuser interface 400. Upon selection of a link,user device 210 may obtain the corresponding instruction manual, video, or document. In this way,user device 210 may provide information that may aid the user in attaching the brakes. - Although
FIG. 4 shows an example configuration of auser interface 400, in some implementations,user interface 400 may include additional areas, different areas, fewer areas, or differently arranged areas than those depicted inFIG. 4 . -
FIGS. 5A-5D are an example 500 of the process described above with respect toFIG. 3 . With reference toFIG. 5A , assume that a user is attempting to play a particular music video onuser device 210. The user selects the particular music video, which causes a video player, onuser device 210, to launch. Assume, as shown inFIG. 5A , that instead of the video player playing the particular music video, the video player locks up while attempting to play the particular music video. Assume further thatuser device 210 monitors the facial expression of the user, using acamera 510 associated withuser device 210, and detects that the user is disappointed.User device 210 may, based on detecting that the user is disappointed, identify that the item with which the user is interacting is the video player and that the task that the user is attempting to perform is playing the particular music video. - With reference to
FIG. 5B ,user device 210 may obtain help information relating to the identified item and the identified task.User device 210 may obtain a help document and/or a user manual, associated with the video player, from a memory associated withuser device 210.User device 210 may also provide asearch query 520 toserver 220.Search query 520 may include information identifying the item and the task.Server 220 may perform a search to obtain videos, manuals, and/or documents relating to searchquery 520.Server 220 may provide, touser device 210 and ashelp information 530, one or more lists of search results. The search results may correspond to links to videos, manuals, and/or documents identified based onsearch query 520. - With reference to
FIG. 5C ,user device 210 may provide a user interface 540 to the user. User interface 540 may prompt the user to identify the type of help information that the user desires. As shown inFIG. 5C , user interface 540 allows the user to select, as help, a help document associated with the video player, documents relating to the identified item and task, or videos relating to the identified item and task. Assume that the user selects the help document. In response,user device 210 may provide, for display, ahelp document 550 associated with the video player to the user, as shown inFIG. 5D .User device 210 may provide a portion ofhelp document 550 directed to playing music videos. In this way,user device 210 may automatically provide help information, to a user, based on detecting that the user is expressing a negative emotion. -
FIGS. 6A-6C are another example 600 of the process described above with respect toFIG. 3 . With reference toFIG. 6A , assume that a user is assembling a dollhouse that is to be given as a gift. The user has assembled most of the dollhouse, but is struggling with the roof. Assume thatuser device 210 is monitoring the user and detects, based on the user's facial expression or body language, that the user is angry.User device 210 may, based on detecting that the user is angry, identify that the item with which the user is interacting is a dollhouse and that the task that the user is attempting to perform is placing the roof on the dollhouse. Assume further thatuser device 210 identifies the particular brand of dollhouse based on one or more of visual identification of the brand, the user's browser history (such as the user's search history and/or purchase history), and/or audible identification of the brand. Assume, for example 600, thatuser device 210 identifies the brand of the dollhouse as Brand Y. - With reference to
FIG. 6B ,user device 210 may obtain help information relating to the identified item and the identified task.User device 210 may provide asearch query 610 toserver 220.Search query 610 may include information identifying the item and the task.Server 220 may perform a search to obtain videos, manuals (e.g., an instruction manual), and/or documents relating to searchquery 610.Server 220 may provide, touser device 210 and ashelp information 620, one or more lists of search results. The search results may correspond to links to videos, manuals, and/or documents identified based onsearch query 610. - Assume, for example 600, that
user device 210 is configured to rank videos higher than documents or manuals. Moreover, assume thatuser device 210 is further configured to automatically provide a video if a video is determined to be particularly relevant to the identified item and task and that one of the videos, identified byserver 220, is determined to be particularly relevant. Thus, with reference toFIG. 6C ,user device 210 may provide the particularly relevant video, asrelevant video 630, to the user. In this way,user device 210 may automatically provide help information, to a user, based on detecting that the user is expressing a negative emotion. -

Also,multiple computing devices 700 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations, as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system, etc. -
Memory 704 stores information within thecomputing device 700. In some implementations,memory 704 includes a volatile memory unit or units. In some implementations,memory 704 includes a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 704 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk.
