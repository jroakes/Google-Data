Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to field of Internet Search Engines, Web browsers, and resource gathering and has special application in situations where these functions are further integrated with post-processing functions applied to the results of searches performed using theses software tools.
- the invention is related in the general area of Internet Search engine technology.
- Conventional Internet search engines permit users to search for a wide variety of information on the WWW.
- domain-specific search engines such as that exemplified by jCentral, http://www.ibm.com/developer/java) that provide users a more focused search within the desired domain.
- a successful search produces a search result page with result items (each usually contain a URL), an abstract, and some additional information about the resource found.
- result items each usually contain a URL
- an abstract an abstract
- some additional information about the resource found A user can use a pointing device (e.g., mouse) to select a result item and request a download of the document.
- pointing device e.g., mouse
- the prior art includes web-based systems that provide a static assignment of web tools and/or services mapped to search results.
- jCentral http://www.ibm.com/developer/java
- the present invention goes beyond this concept by letting the user integrate their own tools and/or services and thus personalize the post-processing options.
- FIG. 1 an exemplary association of a Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) file is illustrated to show the techniques used by the prior art.
- TIFF Tagged Image File Format
- the tool and/or service association begins by using registration dialog(s) ( 0101 ) (detailed in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3) that associate an application such as the KODAK® image previewer KODAKPRV.exe with the “tif” file extension ( 0102 ).
- This association is typically stored in a WindowsTM Registry ( 0103 ).
- the filename.“ABC.tif” (a Tagged Image Format File having a “tif” extension) may be selected within an application such as the FILE MANAGER ( 0105 ) and associated with a specific application such as the KODAKPRV.EXE image previewer using the modal dialog box illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- the application action and/or activation associated with triggering (generally in the form of double-licking a Microsoft® WindowsTM file icon) the file is defined in a modal dialog box as typified in FIG. 3 . Referencing FIG.
- the KODAKPRV.exe application ( 0104 ) is activated by reference to the WindowsTM Registry ( 0103 ), the tool/service executed ( 0106 ), and the designated file is OPENed for access by the associated application ( 0107 ) by using the filename “ABC.tif” as a parameter to the tool/service application.
- the prior art with respect to search engines has traditionally not provided a method to permit the user to dynamic associate post-processing tools with the search results obtained from a web browser.
- the scope of the post-processing activity has in general been limited to the use of hyperlinks ( 0401 ) or some form of file extension based application activation methodology.
- the objects of the present invention are (among others) to circumvent the deficiencies in the prior art and affect one or more of the following objectives:
- the invention is related in the general area of Internet Search engine technology.
- the present invention goes on step further that the prior art and provides the user the possibility to permit the search result items to be automatically used as input for post processing based on a personalized user profile that determines the type of processing tool and/or service and how it is to be applied to the search result item.
- the present invention permits the user to register personal tools and/or services for use in post-processing search results ( 0501 ).
- the example search results page illustrated in FIG. 5 is based on the jCentral Java search engine, but the concept may be applied to any variety of search engines or the like.
- the tool could be a Java compiler residing on the user's personal computer (client side).
- the registration process contains information about the user, the name of the tool, the type of data the tool and/or service can handle as an input for processing, and how to access and use the tool (parameter).
- the search engine creates a result set.
- the present invention determines the user and verifies whether there are registered tools and/or services for this user that can properly process the type of result item (e.g., Java source code).
- the user registered a Java compiler.
- the present invention creates some HTML markup in the result page for the matching type (Java source code) that when activated by the user invokes the user's tool.
- jCentral lets users search for Java resources using Java specific search features.
- a user would typically first register a tool and/or service.
- the user wants to register a Java compiler.
- the present invention then provides a registration form.
- the user then would typically apply for a username and a password for data protection purposes.
- the following information is provided for the application tool:
- the information is stored on the server side in a database and associated with the user's profile.
- the user is able to perform a search.
- the user is searching for Java source code, which implements a heap sort algorithm. He/She fills out the jCentral search form and issue a query to the jCentral search engine.
- the present invention could use a “Cookie” mechanism to store the tool information also on the client machine and retrieve the data as part of the search request. This is just another way of implementing the user profile.
- the present invention receives the search request and queries the database for the user profile (or extract the cookie data from the search request). It then forwards the search request to the actual search engine. Before sending back the result page it inserts the HTML markup for the user defined tool and/or service. As a result the search results contain a choice selection GUI where the user can activate a personalized tool and/or service.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary jCentral result page that was generated from the present invention. Note that the “Java compiler” choice box was generated from the present invention based on the registered user profile of the user.
- the present invention adds the corresponding HTML markup to each search result item in the result set.
- This markup is interpreted by the user's web browser when activated by the user and invokes the user's tool and/or service with the correct syntax and the specific search result item as an input for further processing.
- This post-processing is fully automatic on the client side by the user's tool and/or service.
- the user is able to integrate personalized tools and/or services, and customize these as desired.
- the present invention is based on user profiles that provide a very flexible and customizable way to manipulate and process the search results.
- the present invention has wide application in the application of web-based services, and since these applications will become more dominant in the future, the present invention may provide for additional benefits other than described above.
- One skilled in the art will realize that these advantages may be present in some embodiments and not in others, as well as noting that other advantages may exist in the present invention that are not specifically listed above.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a prior art system block diagram of how conventional application tool associations are performed within the Microsoft® WindowsTM operating environment.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a prior art modal dialog box used within the Microsoft® WindowsTM operating environment to define a filename extension to application activation link.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a prior art modal dialog box used within the Microsoft® WindowsTM operating environment to define an activation function associated with triggering a file by filename extension.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a prior art Internet search results page.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary Internet search results page generated by the present invention.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a system block data flow diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a process flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the present invention may be aptly described in terms of exemplary system block diagrams and procedural flowcharts. While these items are sufficient to instruct one of ordinary skill in the art the teachings of the present invention, they should not be strictly construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.
- system block diagrams may be combined and rearranged with no loss of generality, and procedural steps may be added or subtracted, and rearranged in order to achieve the same effect with no loss of teaching generality.
- the present invention as depicted in the attached exemplary system block diagrams and procedural flowcharts is for teaching purposes only and may be reworked by one skilled in the art depending on the intended target application.
- PC personal computer
- the term ‘personal computer’ should be given a broad meaning in this regard, as in general any computing device may be utilized to implement the teachings of the present invention, and the scope of the invention is not limited just to personal computer applications.
- the present invention may be implemented to advantage using a variety of Microsoft® operating systems (including a variety of WindowsTM variants), nothing should be construed to limit the scope of the invention to these particular software components.
- the system and method as taught herein may be widely implemented in a variety of systems, some of which may incorporate a graphical user interface.
- Internet/Intranet Not Limitive throughout the discussion herein the terms Internet and Intranet will be used generally to denote any network communication system or environment. Generally the term Intranet will denote communications that are local to a given system or user, and Internet will describe communications in a more distant local. One skilled in the art will recognize that these terms are arbitrary within the contexts of modern communication networks and in no way limitive of the scope of the present invention.
- the present invention may incorporate means for activating the application tool and/or service, this function may be incorporated in some system components not a part of the invention as implemented. Furthermore, the application association need not result in a mandatory invocation of the target handling tool and/or service for the teachings of the present invention to apply.
- the exemplary system ( 0600 ) comprises of the following components:
- Session Manager ( 0601 );
- the Session Manager ( 0601 ) receives a request from the user, typically in the form of a query ( 0612 ) generated from some user interface ( 0611 ).
- the Session Manager ( 0601 ) coordinates user and session management.
- the main task of the Session Manager ( 0601 ) is to analyze the user request and to determine whether the request represents a user query or a tool/service registration for a specific URL.
- the Session Manager ( 0601 ) forwards the request to the Search Engine ( 0613 ). Otherwise, it will forward the tool/service registration process to the Registration Manager ( 0602 ). Any status and error messages will be forwarded to the Request Server ( 0605 ) for dispatch to the User ( 0611 ).
- the Registration Manager ( 0602 ) receives a registration request from the Session Manager ( 0601 ) and manages the users of the Search Engine ( 0613 ), stores and retrieves user profiles, etc. In case of a registration for a new tool and/or service based upon a registration request, the Registration Manager ( 0602 ) adds the provided information about a new tool/service (e.g., Tool URL, Name, Parameters, etc.) to the User Registration Profile Database ( 0606 ) and associates it with the user's profile.
- the Result Analyzer ( 0603 ) receives search results from the Search Engine ( 0613 ) based upon a user's search request. Before it does any work it performs a lookup using the session/user ID of the user who issued and the search query to check whether there are any registered tools and/or services for this user. If not, the Result Analyzer ( 0603 ) simply forwards the search result page directly to the Request Server ( 0605 ). Otherwise Result Analyzer ( 0603 ) analyzes the search result page and extracts the URLs of the found external resources. It does this by applying the knowledge from the DTD Schema ( 0607 ) that provides information of how to extract key information and use the search result page.
- the DTD is the Document Type Definitions of the W3C XML 1.0 standard which provides a way to define the structure of an XML document through a document type definition.
- DTDs have widespread support in the industry and in the XML applications that are currently available.
- the extracted URLs will be marked so that the Tool/Service Integrator ( 0604 ) can rapidly identify these items. As an example this markup might take the following form:
- the modified result page will be routed to the Tool/Service Integrator ( 0604 ) along with the Session/User ID.
- the Tool/Service Integrator ( 0604 ) performs a lookup based on the session/user ID in the User Registration Profile Database ( 0606 ) to check what tools are registered, and which type of URL they are capable of processing. It then assigns all available tools matching a specific URL type to each result URL. This step is accomplished by inserting HTML markup tags that the user may later use to invoke the registered post-processing tool. Note that the Tool/Service Integrator ( 0604 ) erases the previous markup done by the Result Analyzer ( 0603 ). This markup is no longer required, and was just temporarily used by the Tool/Service Integrator ( 0604 ) to quickly identify the URLs in the search result page. When the Tool/Service Integrator ( 0604 ) has completed inserting the necessary markup in the result page it will forward the newly created result page to the Request Server ( 0605 ).
- the Request Server ( 0605 ) returns all the received data back to the user. It adds some header information (based on the HTTP protocol spec), integrates some style sheets for representation if necessary so that the user receives a proper search result that may be displayed in a standard search browser. Please note that with current browser technology, the Request Server ( 0605 ) also needs to send some binary code, such as a Java applet or ActiveX control, integrated in the result page back to the user. This component is needed on the client side (browser), to activate and run the user's registered program. Otherwise, the browser would have no access to the user's local machine and file system. For security reasons this binary code can be digitally signed by the provider/implementer of the present invention. These are implementation issues that while not discussed in detail here, are well within the scope of one skilled in the software arts to implement.
- the tools and/or services mentioned herein are not necessarily processed and/or hosted by the present invention. This is generally the responsibility of the user.
- the present invention typically provides only the registration mechanism of these tools and/or services and the corresponding user profile management, along with an optional means of activating the tool/service for a given search request.
- the present invention associates URLs of a user with personalized tools and/or services that have been registered by this user.
- the exemplary Application Tool Association method ( 0700 ) involves the following steps:
- FIGS. 6-7 the system and method described herein and generally illustrated in FIGS. 6-7 may be reduced to computer instruction codes and embodied on a computer readable storage means. This may take the form of a wide variety of storage media well known in the art and/or contemplated for future use. Thus, the present invention specifically anticipates the incorporation of the system and methods discussed herein in the form of tangible computer software products.
- the present invention specifically anticipates that one or more components of the present invention may be implemented using the Microsoft® WindowsTM operating environment in all its variations or its equivalent commercial embodiments, including but not limited to any system incorporating a graphical user interface.
- a Application Tool Association system and method have been disclosed wherein information retrieved from a variety of search engine results may be automatically processed using tools selected by a user and maintained via references within a user registration profile database.
- the present invention automates what was once a manual task, that of selecting and activating data analysis tools that operate on data sets obtained from conventional search engines.
