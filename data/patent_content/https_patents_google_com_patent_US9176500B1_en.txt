Definitions
- Some vehicles are configured to operate in an autonomous mode in which the vehicle navigates through an environment with little or no input from a driver.
- a vehicle typically includes one or more sensors that are configured to sense information about the environment. The vehicle may use the sensed information to navigate through the environment. For example, if the sensors sense that the vehicle is approaching an obstacle, the vehicle may navigate around the obstacle.
- a computer-implemented method involves: (i) receiving, by a computing system, information from one or more sensors of an autonomous vehicle, wherein one or more control processes for the autonomous vehicle are based upon the information; (ii) determining, by the computing system, an information-improvement expectation that corresponds to an active-sensing action, wherein the active-sensing action comprises an action that is performable by the autonomous vehicle to potentially improve the information upon which at least one of the control processes for the autonomous vehicle is based; (iii) determining, by the computing system, a risk cost that corresponds to the active-sensing action; (iv) determining, by the computing system, whether or not the risk cost is less than a threshold risk cost, wherein the threshold risk cost corresponds to the information-improvement expectation; (v) if the risk cost is less than the threshold risk cost, then initiating the active-sensing action; and (vi) if the risk cost is greater than or equal than the threshold risk cost, then: (a
- an autonomous-vehicle system includes one or more sensor interfaces operable to receive data from one or more sensors of an autonomous vehicle, and a computer system.
- the computer system is configured to: (i) receive, via the one or more sensor interfaces, information from the one or more sensors, wherein one or more control processes for the autonomous vehicle are based upon the information; (ii) determine an information-improvement expectation that corresponds to an active-sensing action, wherein the active-sensing action comprises an action that is performable by the autonomous vehicle to potentially improve the information upon which at least one of the control processes for the autonomous vehicle is based; (iii) determine a risk cost that corresponds to the active-sensing action; (iv) determine whether or not the risk cost is less than a threshold risk cost, wherein the threshold risk cost corresponds to the information-improvement expectation; (v) if the risk cost is less than the threshold risk cost, then initiate the active-sensing action; and (vi) if the risk cost is greater than or
- an example method involves: (a) receiving, by a computing system, information from one or more sensors of an autonomous vehicle, wherein one or more control processes for the autonomous vehicle are based upon the information; (b) determining, by the computing system, a risk-cost framework that indicates risk costs across a range of degrees to which an active-sensing action can be performed, wherein the active-sensing action comprises an action that is performable by the autonomous vehicle to potentially improve the information upon which at least one of the control processes for the autonomous vehicle is based; (c) determining, by the computing system, an information-improvement expectation framework that indicates information-improvement expectations across the range of degrees to which the active-sensing action can be performed; (d) applying, by the computing system, the risk-cost framework and the information-improvement expectation framework to determine a degree to which the active-sensing action should be performed, wherein a score of the active-sensing action of the determined degree is less than a threshold score, wherein the score is determined

- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a method according to an example embodiment.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating a method according to an example embodiment.
- Example methods and systems are described herein. Any example embodiment or feature described herein is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or features.
- the example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
- Example embodiments may relate to an autonomous vehicle, such as a driverless automobile, that is configured for active sensing.
- an autonomous vehicle may include various sensors, which provide information that the autonomous vehicle may use for various control processes.
- an autonomous vehicle may take proactive actions (referred to herein as “active-sensing actions”) in order to improve the information that is provided by or derived from its various sensors, in a manner that is in turn expected to improve at least one of the vehicle's control processes.
- active sensing may improve an autonomous vehicle's ability to, e.g., learn about its environment and/or perform self-diagnosis.
- example embodiments may help an autonomous vehicle consider and weigh both the information that might be gained by taking various active-sensing actions and the negative costs associated with those active-sensing actions, and determine what active-sensing action or action are appropriate to take (if any).
- an autonomous vehicle may determine an information-improvement value, which quantifies the information it expects to gain in the vehicle state that results from the action.
- the autonomous vehicle also determines a risk cost associated with the resulting vehicle state, which can be based on the probability of certain negative scenario(s) occurring while in the new vehicle state.
- the information-improvement expectation and the risk cost may be calculated in the same unit of measure, so that a single value may be used to evaluate whether to take an action.
- the autonomous vehicle can determine a score for the active-sensing action, which takes into account both the information-improvement expectation and the risk cost, and use the score to determine whether the active-sensing action is advisable.
- an autonomous vehicle can switch lanes to, e.g., allow its camera(s) or other sensors to obtain more information regarding a traffic light.
- the autonomous car may determine that it could get a clearer or less ambiguous view of the traffic light by changing lanes, so that it is not blocked by a large SUV, is closer to the light, etc.
- the autonomous car may determine an information-improvement value, which indicates how much information it expects to learn by changing lanes.
- the autonomous car may determine a risk cost for changing lanes, which may take into account risks such as running off the road, hitting a pedestrian (e.g., 0.1% chance of hitting a pedestrian in the lane closest to the curb versus a 0.07% chance in the lane closest to the middle of the road), having an accident with another car, annoying passenger(s) in the autonomous car and/or other cars resulting by changing lanes, and so on.
- a combination of the information-improvement expectation and the risk cost may then be used to determine whether or not to switch lanes.
- an example process can also help to concurrently analyze multiple active-sensing actions that are possible in a given state of the vehicle. Further, because information-improvement values and/or risk costs for a given action may vary as an autonomous vehicle's environment changes over time, an autonomous vehicle may implement such a process periodically or continually in order to base its decision-making on the current state of its environment and/or its current operating state.
- the risk cost for an action may be determined for the state that is expected to result from an active-sensing action, in isolation. For instance, the risk cost for an action that moves an autonomous vehicle into a certain lane may be calculated based solely on the probabilities of bad events occurring while the autonomous vehicle is in that lane. In other embodiments, the risk cost for an action may be relative, and based on a difference between the risk costs of the resulting state and its current state. For example, the risk cost for changing lanes may be the difference between the risk cost in the lane the autonomous vehicle would be moving into and the risk cost in its current lane.
- Some example methods may be carried out in whole or in part by an autonomous vehicle or components thereof. However, some example methods may also be carried out in whole or in part by a system or systems that are remote from an autonomous vehicle. For instance, an example method could be carried out in part or in full by a server system, which receives information from sensors (e.g., raw sensor data and/or information derived therefrom) of an autonomous vehicle. Other examples are also possible.
- sensors e.g., raw sensor data and/or information derived therefrom
- An example system may be implemented in or may take the form of an automobile.
- an example system may also be implemented in or take the form of other vehicles, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, boats, airplanes, helicopters, lawn mowers, earth movers, boats, snowmobiles, aircraft, recreational vehicles, amusement park vehicles, farm equipment, construction equipment, trams, golf carts, trains, and trolleys.
- Other vehicles are possible as well.
- FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram illustrating a vehicle 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- the vehicle 100 could be configured to operate fully or partially in an autonomous mode, and thus may be referred to as an “autonomous vehicle.”
- a computer system could control the vehicle 100 while in the autonomous mode, and may be operable to receive information from one or more sensors, upon which one or more control processes for an autonomous vehicle are based, to determine an information-improvement expectation that corresponds to an active-sensing action, to determine a risk cost that corresponds to the active-sensing action, and, based on both (i) the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action and (ii) the risk cost for the active-sensing action, to determine whether the active-sensing action is advisable.
- an autonomous vehicle may be fully autonomous or partially autonomous.

- an information-improvement expectation for a given active-sensing action may quantify an improvement to the information that images from a camera can provide about the environment, which in turn is expected to improve a control process. For example, if an autonomous vehicle is driving side-by-side with another vehicle for some period of time, its camera's view of the side of the road may have been obstructed, and the autonomous vehicle may not have detected a speed-limit sign for some period. As such, the autonomous vehicle may determine an information-improvement expectation that numerically represents the information it expects to gain (e.g., knowledge of the speed limit) if it speeds up or slows down so the other vehicle is no longer between it and the side of the road.

- the autonomous vehicle may determine an information value provided by sensor data in a first state of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., its current state), as well as an expected information value that is expected to be provided by sensor data in a second state of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., the state that is expected if the autonomous vehicle were to perform the active-sensing action.) The autonomous vehicle can then subtract the information value from the expected information value to determine the information-improvement expectation.
- a first state of the autonomous vehicle e.g., its current state
- an expected information value that is expected to be provided by sensor data in a second state of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., the state that is expected if the autonomous vehicle were to perform the active-sensing action.)
- the autonomous vehicle can then subtract the information value from the expected information value to determine the information-improvement expectation.
- the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action may account for some or all of the potential improvements.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine an information-improvement value for each improvement to the information upon which the at least one of the control process is based. To do so, the autonomous vehicle may determine an information value that is associated with a first state of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., its current state), as well as an expected information value that is associated with a second state of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., the state that is expected if the autonomous vehicle were to perform the active-sensing action.) The autonomous vehicle can then subtract the information value from the expected information value to determine the information-improvement value.
- a first state of the autonomous vehicle e.g., its current state
- an expected information value that is associated with a second state of the autonomous vehicle
- the autonomous vehicle can then subtract the information value from the expected information value to determine the information-improvement value.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine the probability of each improvement occurring as a result of the autonomous vehicle performing the active-sensing action. Then, for each improvement, autonomous vehicle can then multiply the information value of the improvement by the probability of the improvement occurring to determine an expected information value for the improvement. Further, in the scenario where there are multiple potential improvements as a result of an active-sensing action, the autonomous vehicle may determine the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action by summing the expected information values for some or all of the potential improvements.
- various techniques may be used to determine the risk cost that corresponds to the active-sensing action.
- the autonomous vehicle may evaluate the individual risk costs, or the risk penalties, for various bad events that might occur as the result of performing an active-sensing action.

- bad events may be considered when determining the risk cost for an active-sensing action.
- bad events may include various types of accidents, such as an accident with another vehicle, an accident with a police car or ambulance (for which the risk magnitude may be greater than it is for accidents with other vehicles), and/or an accident involving a pedestrian, among other possibilities.
- bad events are not limited to accidents, and may include any event that could be perceived as negative in some way.
- an autonomous vehicle may consider the dislike of an active-sensing action by a passenger in an autonomous vehicle to be a bad event (e.g., if an active-sensing action results in the autonomous vehicle repeatedly switching back and forth between lanes, or suddenly accelerating or coming to a stop).
- the dislike or annoyance of passengers in other vehicles due to an active-sensing action may be considered a bad event, which may be taken into account when determining the risk cost for the active-sensing action.
- an active-sensing action could make a future action more difficult, such as a planned turn or exit from a highway, this may be classified as a bad event for the active-sensing action.
- an active-sensing action may often be taken in order to gain information from sensor data, other information from sensor data may be lost in the process. Accordingly, the expected degradation to a control process corresponding to information lost as the result of an active-sensing action, may also be considered a bad event.
- the time it takes to evaluate an active-sensing action may be considered a bad event.
- a risk penalty may be calculated for the processing time it takes to determine and weight the information-improvement expectation and/or the risk cost.
- Other types of bad events are also possible as well.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine a probability of the bad event occurring as a result of the autonomous vehicle performing the active-sensing action.
- the autonomous vehicle may also determine a risk magnitude that corresponds to a severity of the bad event, if it does in fact occur.
- the autonomous vehicle can then use the respective probabilities and the respective risk magnitudes for the bad events to determine the respective risk penalties for the bad events.
- the autonomous vehicle may then sum the risk penalties of the potential bad events to determine the risk cost for the active-sensing action. Other techniques for determining the risk cost of performing an active-sensing action are possible as well.
- risk cost could be determined in absolute manner; e.g., by quantifying risks in the vehicle state that is expected to result from the active sensing action. For example, could simply add up the risk-contributions of the various bad events that are evaluated.
- the risk cost could be evaluated relative to a current state of an autonomous vehicle.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine the risk cost associated with a second (e.g., expected) state that is expected to result from the active sensing action, as well as the risk cost associated with the current state of the autonomous vehicle.
- the risk cost for the active-sensing action may then be calculated by subtracting the risk cost for the expected state from the risk cost for the current state.
- the autonomous vehicle may use various techniques to determine whether an active-sensing action is advisable.
- the information-improvement expectation and the risk cost may be determined in the same unit of measure. However, it should be understood that the information-improvement expectation and the risk cost may be determined in different units of measure, without departing from the scope of the invention.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine a score for the active-sensing action.
- the score may be based on both (i) the information-improvement expectation and (ii) the risk cost.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine the score for an active-sensing action by subtracting the risk cost for the active-sensing action from the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action.
- the autonomous vehicle may determine whether the score is indicative of an advisable active-sensing action. For example, the autonomous vehicle may determine that an active-sensing action is advisable when its score is above a threshold. Other techniques for determining whether active-sensing action is advisable are also possible.
- an example method may be used to concurrently evaluate a number of possible active-sensing actions.
- the autonomous vehicle may evaluate a number of active-sensing actions and select a single action that is advisable. To do so, the autonomous vehicle may evaluate information-improvement expectations and risk cost in the expected vehicle state corresponding to each possible active-sensing action. The autonomous vehicle may then determine a score for each active-sensing action by subtracting the respective risk cost from the respective information-improvement expectation. The autonomous vehicle could then perform the top-scoring active-sensing action (perhaps requiring some threshold score in order to do so).
- the autonomous vehicle could determine that multiple active-sensing actions are advisable. To do so, the autonomous vehicle could determine a score for each possible active-sensing action as described above, and then classify active-sensing actions having greater than a threshold score as advisable. Alternatively, the autonomous vehicle could rank the possible active-sensing actions according to their scores. The autonomous vehicle could then determine a certain number of the highest-ranking active-sensing actions to be advisable and/or could perform these active-sensing actions.
- an autonomous vehicle may implement method 100 in a periodic or continual manner. This may be beneficial since an autonomous vehicle's state may change continually, as it moves or takes other actions, and/or as its environment changes. These changes in the vehicle state and/or to environment typically may result in change to the active-sensing actions that are possible, change to the information-improvement expectation for a given active-sensing action, and/or change to the risk cost for a given active-sensing action.
- the autonomous vehicle may be able to periodically or continually update the active-sensing actions that are possible in its current state and environment, and weigh the knowledge improvement from the possible active-sensing actions against the risk costs associated with those active-sensing actions.
- FIG. 4 is a top-down view of an autonomous vehicle operating scenario 400 , according to an example embodiment.
- an autonomous vehicle 402 may carry out a method, such as method 300 , in order to determine whether or not to perform an active-sensing action.
- the autonomous vehicle 402 (which may also be referred to simply as vehicle 402 ) may be identical or similar to vehicle 200 of FIG. 2 .
- vehicle 402 may be another type of autonomous vehicle.
- Scenario 400 shows the autonomous vehicle 402 and a large truck 404 on a roadway that includes two lanes in either direction. Note, however, that FIG. 4 shows only the right-hand lane 406 and the left-hand lane 408 in the direction that vehicle 402 is travelling on the roadway. FIG. 4 also shows a traffic light 412 and a curb 414 .
- vehicle 402 has come to a stop in the right-hand lane 408 behind the large truck 404 .
- the sensor unit 410 of the vehicle 402 could be capturing sensor data based on an environment of the vehicle 402 .
- a camera could capture video and/or still images of the truck 404 , the curb 414 , and as well as other features in the environment so as to help the computer system of the vehicle 402 to determine the current state of the environment of the vehicle 402 (e.g., dashed and solid lane markers defining the right-hand and left-hand lanes 406 and 408 ).
- the large truck 404 may partially or wholly prevent the camera or cameras of sensor unit 410 from capturing image data that includes traffic light 412 .
- vehicle 402 may be configured for active sensing.
- vehicle 402 may determine that better image data of the traffic light 412 might improve its control processes.
- various control processes may function according to the state of the traffic light 412 (e.g., red, yellow, or green). Such control processes may therefore be improved with, e.g., more complete images of traffic light 412 , which allow vehicle 402 to better discern when the traffic light 412 switches between red, yellow, and green.
- vehicle 402 may determine an active-sensing action that, if performed, could result in more complete images of traffic light 412 . For instance, vehicle 402 may determine it could move into the left-hand lane 408 by e.g., moving along path 416 , to the position illustrated by the dotted outline of vehicle 402 , next to the large truck 404 . (For purposes of this example, the movement of vehicle 402 , along path 416 , to the position illustrated by the dotted outline of the vehicle, may also be referred to as the active-sensing action 416 .)
- vehicle 402 may then weigh the potential improvement to its knowledge of its environment and/or its control processes, against risk costs associated with taking the active sensing action.
- vehicle 402 may calculate an information-improvement expectation and a risk cost for switching lanes and pulling up beside large truck 404 .
- vehicle 402 may determine a value that is indicative of the expected improvement to the information provided by sensor data, for purposes of its control processes. To facilitate such calculations, vehicle 402 may include or have access to information-valuation data, which assigns certain values to certain types of information, for certain control processes.
- information-valuation data may specify that, for purposes of a control process that determines when to accelerate the vehicle upon detecting a green light, knowing the state of a traffic light has a value of 100.
- the information-improvement expectation may simply be set to 100.
- vehicle 402 may account for possible uncertainty as to whether and/or by how much moving into the left-hand lane 408 will improve its knowledge of the state of traffic light 412 .
- vehicle 402 may weigh the value associated with gaining complete knowledge of the state of traffic light 412 ; e.g., by multiplying the value of 100 by the 90% probability of correctly determining the state of traffic light from the left-hand lane 408 , to arrive at an information-improvement expectation of 90.
- the information-improvement expectation may quantify and/or be indicative of risk reduction and/or an increased probability of accomplishing a certain goal or task (e.g., driving the car to a certain location), which is expected to result from taking a certain active-sensing action.
- information-valuation data may quantify and/or be indicative of risk reduction and/or an increased probability of accomplishing the goal or task, which certain pieces of information are expected to provide.
- the autonomous vehicle may be able to calculate a probability of accomplishing a certain goal or task given the processes, routines, controllers, sensors, current context, and/or currently-available information of the autonomous vehicle.
- the information-valuation data may include an incremental information value for each of a number of pieces of information, which indicates the increase to the probability of accomplishing the goal and/or the reduction to the risks associated with accomplishing the goal, which is expected to result if the piece of information is acquired.
- both information-improvement expectation and the risk cost may both be indicative of change to the risk associated with accomplishing a goal and/or change to the probability of achieving a goal
- both information-improvement expectation and the risk cost may be calculated in the same unit of measure.
- the information-valuation data may include incremental information values for each of a number of pieces of information, which are also in the same unit of measure as the risk cost.
- vehicle 402 may also consider information that it already has, in its current state, when determining the information-improvement expectation for an active-sensing action. In particular, vehicle 402 may determine an information value for the state that would be expected if the active-sensing action were performed. Vehicle 402 may then calculate the information-improvement expectation by subtracting an information value for its current state from the expected information value that corresponds to the state that is expected after performing the active-sensing action.
- the traffic light 412 may only be partially obstructed by the large truck 404 . Accordingly, based on its camera's partial view of traffic light 412 , vehicle 402 may determine that there is a 60% probability of correctly determining the state of traffic light 412 , in its current position, and a 90% probability in the state that is expected if it were to perform the active-sensing action. If information-valuation data assigns a value of 100 to complete knowledge of a traffic light's state, then vehicle 402 may determine the expected information value to be equal to 90, and its current information value to be 60. Thus, vehicle 402 may calculate an information-improvement expectation of 30 for the active-sensing action of moving into left-hand lane 408 along path 416 .
- vehicle 402 may determine an information-improvement expectation that accounts for the possibility of active-sensing action 416 improving information for multiple control processes. To do so, an information-improvement expectation may be individually calculated with respect to each control process for which information may be improved, and the individual information-improvement expectations may be added together to determine the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action.
- vehicle 402 could also implement a control process that estimates the length of a red light, moves a camera to gather other environmental information, while the light is expected to be red, and then moves the camera back to observe the light just before it expects the light to turn green.
- information-valuation data may specify that knowing the state of a traffic light has a value of 50 for purposes of this control process.
- the vehicle may calculate an information-improvement expectation of 15 for the active-sensing action, with respect to the control process that repurposes the camera during a red light.
- the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action may then be calculated to be 45 by, e.g., summing the information-improvement expectations to the two control processes.
- a vehicle 402 may consider the possibility of an active-sensing action improving the information used for a single control process in more than one way. For example, moving along path 416 might also improve the camera's ability to capture a street corner under traffic light 412 , which may be useful for control processes that search for pedestrians and/or for other control processes. Accordingly, vehicle 402 may use similar techniques as described above to determine individual information-improvement expectations for the control processes that are expected to improve with better image data of the street corner.
- Vehicle 402 may then calculate the information-improvement expectation for the active-sensing action by adding these individual information-improvement expectations to the individual information-improvement expectations associated with the improvement in ability to determine the state of traffic light 412 (and possibly to individual information-improvement expectations associated with other information gains expected to result from the active-sensing action, as well).
- vehicle 402 may determine a value that represents the chances of a bad event occurring as a result of a movement into the left-hand land 408 along path 416 .
- vehicle 402 may determine individual risk penalties for a number of bad events that could potentially result from the active-sensing action, and calculate the risk cost for the active-sensing action by summing the individual penalties of the bad events.
- vehicle 402 may determine a risk magnitude for each potential bad event, which indicates the severity of the bad event, if it were to occur. Vehicle 402 may also determine the probability of the bad event occurring as a result of the active-sensing action (e.g., during the performance of, or in the state of the vehicle that results from performing the active-sensing action).
- Table 1 provides some examples of bad events that vehicle 402 may take into consideration in scenario 400 , when determining whether it is advisable to move along path 416 into left-hand land 408 .
- vehicle 402 may consider the risk of having an accident with the large truck 404 , the risk of an accident with an oncoming vehicle, and the risk of an accident with a vehicle (not shown) approaching from behind vehicle 402 in the left-hand lane 408 . Since an accident with another vehicle may be considered highly undesirable, the risk magnitudes for these bad events is relatively high; e.g., ranging from 5,000 to 20,000, depending on the expected severity of the respective type of accident. However, since large truck 404 is stopped at the light, the probability of the large truck suddenly moving into the left-hand lane 408 may be relatively low; e.g., 0.01%.
- the probability of an oncoming vehicle suddenly swerving into the left-hand lane 408 may be considered relatively low, e.g., 0.01%.
- An accident with a vehicle approaching from behind in the left-hand lane 408 may be considered more probable, although still relatively low (assuming that sensor data has not detected a vehicle approaching).
- vehicle 402 may consider the risk hitting a pedestrian that runs into the street. While the probability of this occurring may be determined to be very low (e.g., 0.001%), an accident with a pedestrian may be considered very undesirable, and worse than an accident with another vehicle. Accordingly, the risk magnitude for hitting a pedestrian may be much higher than the risk magnitudes for accidents with other vehicles.
- vehicle 402 may consider the risk of losing information that is provided by camera and/or by other sensors in current position. More specifically, while the vehicle's camera may be better positioned to capture traffic light 412 if it moves along path 416 , it may be in a worse position for capturing other aspects of the vehicle's environment. Information provided by other sensors may also be less useful for various control processes, if the active-sensing action is taken. Accordingly, the risk penalty for lost information may be determined by calculating an information-reduction expectation for the active-sensing action. The information-reduction expectation, which is indicative of an expected worsening of one or more control processes due to reduced information, may be determined using similar techniques as those described for determining an information-improvement value, which correspond to control-process improvements resulting from gains in information.
- vehicle 402 may consider the risk of it becoming more difficult to carry out planned actions, if an active-sensing action is performed. For instance, as shown in Table 1, vehicle 402 may consider whether its path planning involves a right turn at traffic light 412 . As indicated, this risk may be evaluated in a binary manner, as the planned path of travel either involves a right turn or does not; i.e., the probability that moving along path 416 into left-hand lane 408 will make it more difficult to make a planned right turn is either 100%, if the turn is planned, or 0%, if no turn is planned. Further, if a turn is planned, having to reroute may be considered to be fairly undesirable, and thus the risk magnitude and the risk penalty may be equal to 50.
- the vehicle may sum the risk penalties associated with the bad events that might occur due to the active-sensing action. For example, consider the case where risk penalties are determined as shown in Table 1, and no right turn is planned at traffic light 412 (meaning that the risk penalty for interference with a planned right turn is 0). In this case, vehicle 402 may determine the risk cost for active-sensing action 416 to be equal to 8. However, if a right turn is planned at traffic light 412 , then the risk cost may be determined to be 58.
- the risk cost for active-sensing action 416 is indicative of the risk level associated with bad events that are possible in the vehicle state that is expected to result from the active sensing action and/or bad events that are possible while the active-sensing action is being performed.
- the risk cost may indicate the difference between the risk level in the vehicle's current state and the risk level that is expected to result if the active sensing action is performed.
- vehicle 402 may calculate a risk cost in its current state, with it located in the right-hand lane 406 behind the large truck 404 , in a similar manner as it calculated the risk cost associated its expected state as the result of active-sensing action 416 (for clarity, these risk costs may be referred to as the current risk cost and expected risk cost, respectively). Vehicle 402 may then subtract the expected risk cost from the current risk cost to determine the risk cost for the active-sensing action 416 .
- vehicle 402 may take into account some or all of the same bad events as it considers when calculating the expected risk cost. However, because different bad events are possible in the current and expected states, the current risk cost might be based on partially or entirely different bad events than the expected risk cost is based upon.
- vehicle 402 may determine whether active-sensing action 416 is advisable. For example, consider the above-described scenario where the information-improvement expectation for active-sensing action 416 is determined to be 30, and the above-described scenario where no right turn is planned at traffic light 412 and the risk cost is determined to be 8. In this case, vehicle 402 may determine the score to be equal to 22 by subtracting the risk cost from the information-improvement expectation.
- vehicle 402 may determine that active-sensing action 416 is advisable and perform active-sensing action 16 in an effort to improve its image data for traffic light 412 .
- vehicle 412 may determine the risk cost for active-sensing action 416 to be 58. Thus, if the threshold score is set at 10, vehicle 412 may refrain from performing active-sensing action 416 .
- an autonomous vehicle may weigh expected information improvement and risk cost involved with varying degrees or extents of an active sensing action to determine the degree or extent of an active-sensing action that is appropriate (if any).
- risk costs and information improvement expectations could be used to determine the amount and/or direction of motion that results in an amount of improvement that is acceptable given the corresponding risk cost. For instance, a first movement in a given direction may have an undesirable amount of risk, but a second movement, which is smaller and/or in a slightly different direction, may still provide some information improvement, while staying within an acceptable risk threshold for the amount of information gained. In such case, the autonomous vehicle may initiate the second movement, even if the first movement is not advisable given the associated risk cost and information improvement expectation.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a method 600 , according to an example embodiment.
- Method 600 provides an iterative approach for determining the appropriate degree or extent (if any) of an active-sensing action.
- method 600 may be implemented to adjust the degree of the active-sensing action iteratively until the risk is below a threshold. Further, on some or all iterations of method 600 , the risk threshold may be adjusted to correspond to the information-improvement expectation of the adjusted active-sensing action.
- method 600 may involve a computing system receiving information from one or more sensors of an autonomous vehicle, as shown by block 602 .
- one or more control processes for the autonomous vehicle are based upon the information received at block 602 .
- the computing system may then determine an information-improvement expectation that corresponds to an active-sensing action, as shown by block 604 .
- the computing system may also determine a risk cost that corresponds to the active-sensing action, as shown by block 606 .
- the computing system may then determine whether or not the risk cost is less than a threshold risk cost, as shown by block 608 .
- the threshold risk cost corresponds to the information-improvement expectation. That is, the threshold risk cost may be set to a higher value if the information-improvement expectation determined at block 604 is higher, and set to a lower value if the information-improvement expectation determined at block 604 is lower.
- the computing system may initiate the active-sensing action, as shown by block 610 .
- the computing system makes an adjustment to the active-sensing action that is expected to affect the determined risk cost, as shown by block 612 .
- the adjustment to the active-sensing action may be made with the expectation of lowering the associated risk cost.
- the adjustment may involve changing the extent or degree of the active-sensing action.
- making the adjustment may involve one or more of: (a) adjusting an amount of a change in speed of the autonomous vehicle, (b) adjusting at least one of a distance and a direction of a change in position of the autonomous vehicle relative to an aspect of an environment of the autonomous vehicle, (c) adjusting at least one of a distance and a direction of a change in position of the autonomous vehicle within a lane, (d) adjusting at least one of a distance and a direction of a change in position of at least one of the sensors, and (e) adjusting a degree of a change in operation of at least one of the sensors.
- Other examples of adjustments to active-sensing actions are also possible.
- the adjustment to the active-sensing action may also affect (e.g., increase or decrease) the value corresponding information-improvement expectation.
- method 600 may further involve re-determining the threshold risk cost based on the changed value of the information-improvement expectation. In any case, if the risk cost is greater than or equal than the threshold risk cost, then method 600 involves repeating blocks 604 to 608 for the adjusted active-sensing action until either: (a) the determined risk cost is determined to be less than the threshold risk cost at block 608 , or (b) a determination is made that no further adjustments should be made to the active-sensing action, as shown by block 614 .
- method 600 may end without initiating the active-sensing action, as shown by block 616 .
- block 614 may involve a background process that checks whether to continue trying to determine an appropriate degree for the active-sensing action. In such case, the arrangement of block 614 may not reflect the timing of the background process with respect to the other parts of method 600 . More specifically, since block 614 may be a background process that is carried out in parallel with method 600 , it is possible that a determination may be made that no active-sensing action is appropriate at any point in time while method 600 is being carried out.
- such a background process may check whether the conditions that indicated a need for the active-sensing action have changed such that it is no longer necessary and/or beneficial (e.g., if an active-sensing action was intended to provide more information about a stoplight, the active-sensing action may no longer be needed, to any degree, if the autonomous vehicle has since driven past the stoplight).
- a timer could limit the amount of time for determining whether any degree of an active sensing action is appropriate. Other examples are also possible.
- block 614 may involve a periodic check as to whether the active-sensing action would still be beneficial. In such embodiments, block 614 may be carried out during each iteration of method 600 , or may be carried out intermittently (e.g., every fourth iteration). Other variations on method 600 are also possible.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating another method 700 , according to an example embodiment.
- Method 700 provides a single-pass approach for determining the appropriate degree or extent (if any) of an active-sensing action.
- method 700 may use a risk-cost framework and information-improvement expectation framework over a range of degrees to which the active-sensing action can be performed, and identify a particular degree or extent to perform the action, which balances risk cost with expected information improvement.
- method 700 involves a computing system receiving information from one or more sensors of an autonomous vehicle, as shown by block 702 .
- one or more control processes for the autonomous vehicle are based upon the information received at block 702 .
- the computing system determines a risk-cost framework, which indicates risk costs across a range of degrees to which an active-sensing action can be performed, as shown by block 704 .
- the active-sensing action is an action that is performable by the autonomous vehicle to potentially improve the information upon which at least one of the control processes for the autonomous vehicle is based.
- the computing system also determines an information-improvement expectation framework that indicates information-improvement expectations across the range of degrees to which the active-sensing action can be performed, as shown by block 706 .
- the risk-cost framework may be determined in various ways.
- the risk-cost framework indicates risk costs across a range of degrees to which an active-sensing action can be performed.
- determining the risk-cost framework may involve determining risk cost data across one or more of: (a) a range of speed changes for the autonomous vehicle, (b) a range of positional changes (e.g., over a range of distance, a range of directions, and/or a range of orientations) of the autonomous vehicle relative to an aspect of an environment of the autonomous vehicle, (c) a range of positional changes of the autonomous vehicle within a lane, (d) a range of positional changes of at least one of the sensors, and (e) a range of operational adjustments to at least one of the sensors.
- a risk-cost framework may be determined over a range of distances that the autonomous vehicle might move to the left. For instance, risk costs may be determined at each of a sampling of distances between one millimeter and two meters. Of course, other ranges are possible depending upon the particular implementation and/or the particular scenario.
- the risk-cost framework may be determined to be a formula, which takes distance as an input, and outputs the risk cost associated with a movement of the distance to the left by the autonomous vehicle. Other types of risk-cost frameworks are also possible.
- a risk-cost framework may be determined over a range of degrees through which the sensor might be rotated. For instance, risk costs may be determined at each of a sampling of degrees of rotation from an initial position; e.g., by determining a risk cost at every five-degree interval between five and ninety degrees.
- the risk-cost framework may be determined to be a formula, which takes the degrees of rotation as an input, and outputs the risk cost associated with such rotation by the sensor.
- the information-improvement expectation framework may be determined in various ways.
- information-improvement expectation framework indicates information-improvement expectations across the range of degrees to which the active-sensing action can be performed.
- determining the information-improvement expectation framework may involve determining information-improvement expectation data across one or more of: (a) a range of speed changes for the autonomous vehicle, (b) a range of positional changes (e.g., over a range of distance, a range of directions, and/or a range of orientations) of the autonomous vehicle relative to an aspect of an environment of the autonomous vehicle, (c) a range of positional changes of the autonomous vehicle within a lane, (d) a range of positional changes of at least one of the sensors, and (e) a range of operational adjustments to at least one of the sensors.
- the information-improvement expectation framework may be determined over a range of distances that the autonomous vehicle might move to the left. For instance, information-improvement expectations may be determined at each of a sampling of distances between one millimeter and two meters. Of course, other ranges are possible depending upon the particular implementation and/or the particular scenario.
- the information-improvement expectation framework may be determined to be a formula, which takes distance as an input, and outputs the information-improvement expectation associated with a movement of the input distance to the left by the autonomous vehicle.
- an information-improvement expectation framework may be determined over a range of degrees through which the sensor might be rotated. For instance, an information-improvement expectation may be determined at each of a sampling of degrees of rotation from an initial position; e.g., by determining the information-improvement expectation at every five-degree interval between five and ninety degrees.
- the information-improvement expectation framework may be determined to be a formula, which takes the degrees of rotation as an input, and outputs the information-improvement expectation associated with such rotation by the sensor.
- Other types of information-improvement expectation frameworks are also possible.
- the computing system may apply the risk-cost framework and the determined information-improvement expectation framework to determine a degree (if any) to which the active-sensing action should be performed, as shown by block 708 .
- the computing system then initiates the active-sensing action of the determined degree, as shown by block 710 .
- the degree of the active-sensing action determined at block 708 may have a score that is less than a threshold score, and/or that is greater than the score associated with other possible degrees of the active-sensing action.
- the score for a given degree of an active-sensing action may be determined based on the risk cost and information-improvement expectation corresponding to the given degree, as described herein in reference to other embodiments.
